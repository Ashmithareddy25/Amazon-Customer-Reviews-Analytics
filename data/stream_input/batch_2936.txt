B005CKPQNE|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better. The suspense, interspersed with some excellent comedy, is palpable. When you try to figure out what may come next, you are often surprised with what actually happens. Great series, with superb acting.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|Functionality of this product is good but I have not used it as much as I had anticipated that I would.
0385344228|1.0|A well-written mystery is one that not only keeps me wondering, but teaches me something about the world (see Tony Hillerman, Eliot Pattison, Faye Kellerman).  The lessons of this book are anything but fresh (who still believes there is equity in the american legal system?), the dialogue anything but well-written, the characters anything but worthy of wanting to be followed to the end of the book, let alone into future books.  If you must read this book (a book group selection for me), get a library copy, read parts 1 and 4 and call it enough time spent.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Small, unobtrusive while sleeping>> very good concept, well thought.<br /><br />also very easy to ware during daytime<br /><br />Easy setup<br /><br />Does what is was meant to!<br /><br />Lack of possibility to enter calorie intake (scanning qrcode) and also possibility to measure elliptical machines, crosstrainers would definitely be a plus worth!
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Fits the FZ 200 like a glove. Pockets offer room for small accessories. Bag seems wll made and meets all expectations.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|My kids love this movie too!  We could watch it over and over again.  This was a very good purchase.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|The suspense continues to build. This series has become addicting and I can't wait to see what happens next. Wonderful acting and character development.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|\\"Zealot\\", by Reza Aslan is a fairly well written discussion of the life and main sayings of Jesus. For me, it was somewhat disappointing. Since, Aslan was a Christian, who had converted to Islam, I had hoped for a unique angle, and something new that might help create more unity between the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic Religions.  However, it seemed that one objective of the author was to emphasize the discrepancies between cherished Christian doctrine and historical fact.<br /><br />In the Author's view there are two concepts of Jesus:<br /><br />1. The historical Jesus, who really did believe He was the Messiah, and wanted to bring about the Kingdom of God on earth for the Jews by removing the oppression of Rome - using whatever means, even force, if necessary.  He was crucified by Rome for sedition, as were dozens of others who attempted the same feat. However, his disciples claimed that God had raised him from the dead and that he would return to finally proceed to save the Jews from the Romans. This became the foundation of the Church in Jerusalem led by Jesus' brother,  James, who reiterated much of Jesus' teaching from the \\"Sermon on the Mount\\".  This Jesus, with some variations, was described many years later, in the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke.<br /><br />2. The Spiritual Jesus proclaimed almost entirely by Paul, who claimed to have seem the Spirit of Jesus in a blinding flash of light, and was henceforth changed from an enemy of Jesus followers to the most dedicated of believers.  All of Paul's knowledge of Jesus came from further supernatural encounters with Jesus' Spirit. Since Paul's message was not accepted by the Jews, he became first to spread the news of Jesus to the Gentiles. This Jesus was described in Paul's letters, which were the first written of the books compiled for the \\"New Testament\\".  In Paul's narrative, Jesus' crucifixion was part of God's plan to save man from his original sin, and was a sufficient sacrifice to render all innocent who believed. This Jesus became the one most familiar to Gentiles, and was described years after Paul's death in the Gospel of John.  The concepts proclaimed by Paul, became the foundation of the Christian Church.<br /><br />The Author ends with a statement that 2000 years later Paul's creation has subsumed the Jesus of History. Aslan thinks this is a shame and that the memory of Jesus the Zealot, Jesus the man, with the courage to face up to the power of Rome and the corruption of the religious establishment, even in the face of a horrible death - this Historical Jesus, is someone he can believe in.<br /><br />For us Christians, of course, Aslan's conclusion is not enough. We think:  what if Paul's revelations by the Spirit of the Lord were really a more reliable description of the truth than the sketchy history available, and that confirming the possibility of Spiritual communication with the God of peace and love is the true message from Jesus.  Nevertheless, the book is another piece of the puzzle, contains a lot of interesting information, and is worth reading for those who want to broaden their knowledge of the life of Jesus.cent who believed.

1451620829|5.0|Loved it & would highly recommend it! I have been a Kiss fan  for many years & I really enjoyed it!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I took this book with me on a vacation, and finished reading it quickly.  My daughter then read it with the same result.  We were engrossed with the characters, and the plot was surprising all the way through.  There are 38 years between myself and my daughter, so you know this is a book for women of different generations.
0767903862|5.0|I already had my own copy of this book, given to me as a gift. I really enjoyed the travel information in it, as well as the author's humorous touches. I bought this copy for my son. While he was serving a year in Kuwait with the Navy, he used his vacation time to take a trip to Australia. He only had enough time to see a small part of the country, and I thought he would like to read about other areas.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Nice twist! Kept you wondering the whole time. The end was a bit disappointing though. But a good read! XXX
044022425X|5.0|What can I say? I LOVE Diana Gabaldon's writing! She is masterful at creating characters we truly care about, and weaving a world that is so historically and scientifically accurate, thanks to her extensive research, that the reader finds themselves transported to the time and place in which the events occur. The books are crammed with vivid details about geographic locations, customs, clothing, food, smells, weather, flora and fauna, and people, both real and imaginary, but not to such an overwhelming extent that you get bogged down in them the way you do with some books. I cannot recommend this series highly enough.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love the characters and the story!! This book is definitely steamy!! I can not wait to read the next book!! Well worth reading!!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Lots of action, great story line, wonderful surprises, very well acted, surprising love story, very good casting - very realistic CG.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I loved this book, mostly because I'm a cat person but felt it was an interesting view of the marginally homeless people. I've been guilty of &#34;not seeing&#34; those people too and this gives me an inside look. Along the lines of Homers Odessey and Dewey it's a really nice memoir of a cats impact on a life.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|I am not a fan of Katie Holmes but she really seemed like a good fit for the role in this movie. I was happily surprised with the whole movie. It wasn't just a generic \\"Hallmark-ish\\" movie. The music was pretty well done, the script seemed decent, and the roles well cast. The ending is not too over the top sweet, but still expectantly happy with the promise of happy ending possibilities.<br /> \\"Chasing Liberty\\" was out the same year & it has zero appeal... just a huge disappointment. if you liked this movie don't bother with Chasing Liberty,which has Mandy Moore at turns over the top starry eyed & then bratty like 12 year old.I stopped watching it when it got to the part where she kept trying to loose her virginity to anyone who was willing. Blech! Crass, unlikeable movie<br />This one, however is a gem
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I've been using my gaems g155 for a little over a year now.  I'm a firefighter and like to bring it back and forth with me between home and work.  The box is big enough for everything you would need to game with an original xbox 360 and 1 controller.  I couldn't fit more than 1 controller in it.  This is more of a single person game box anyways, the best viewing angle is directly in front of the screen.  If you get off to the side it's hard to see.  The screen does have a pretty good picture.<br /><br />I initially had an issue with the box popping open at the top when I had it fully loaded, which eventually broke the video screen.  I was able to reach customer service via email within a day and they were very helpful with making sure the problem was resolved.  I eventually received a new box at no cost.  There aren't very many companies out there that will stand by their product like these guys do.  Excellent work!
B00425S1H8|3.0|It's an adapter.  It does what it is supposed to do.  The software doesn't install on all devices, though.  The newer devices by Plugable are much better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book as much as the first book. So much drama but such a fantastic love story. Is definitely a 5 star book!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|This is a pooly written fantasy story rather than what I expected it to be (action packed drama).  The end is one part fantasy and one part twist that you see coming a mile away.  Just for kicks it also ends with 2 characters falling in love despite zero chemsitry between them during the movie.  It felt like they added the relationship int he last few minutes of the filming. It was awful.
B005DI994W|1.0|Criterion has edited scenes of violence, specifically, spectacular footage where horses were tripped at full gallop. We may now assume there are three versions of a movie; the theatrical release, the director's cut, and the Criterion cut.<br /><br />Blu-Ray quality is excellent.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a great knife, especially given the price. If you break it, be sure to call Ethan Becker and tell him. He'll probably want to interview you to find out how in the world you did it. Seriously, this knife is tough. It's like a sharpened pry bar. So if you're looking for a knife that's end-of-the-world/bomb-proof tough, look no further. Just realize that there's a trade-off for that toughness. It's heavy.<br /><br />I can't speak quite as highly of the sheath. It's a good sheath; don't get me wrong. My main qualm is that the nylon backing is not stiff enough to hold the knife upright when you're wearing it on your waist. When the handle-retaining strap is snapped closed, there's no problem. However, when the strap is open, the weight of the knife causes it to flop sideways and stick out from your waist. A stiffer backing would likely resolve this issue.<br /><br />This is a great knife for the price overall.
0802473156|3.0|The best parts of this book are the last pages of each chapter. They list several types of love acts you can show to someone of a particular love language. That has been great inspiration! The information in the book is good, but I've felt while reading it that some stories/information could be cut or shortened and I'd appreciate more &#34;meat.&#34; It's helpful to hear about others experiences, but it seems that 50-60% of the book is a story of one couple or another in their own specific situation. Overall, I appreciated taking his love language quiz more than this book, but this isn't a waste of time to try if you're wanting a little more explanation and some good ideas.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It is done as a series of &#34;interviews&#34; with people from different areas of the world during the zombie wars. It is not really like the movie at all. I couldn't put it down, though sometimes I felt like the descriptions were gratuitously gross and overtly horrifying. Just my opinion. I was entertained by it though.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Even better than the first book in the series. The characters are more fully developed and the plot twists are great! This is a wonderful book to look forward to at the end of a long, tiring day. It's light, easy-to-read, and fun. Escapism at its best!
B006LSZECO|5.0|My eyes are red. I'm tired. Couldn't stop until it was over. Also a very good manual on how not to be a married couple.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I have watched many BBC series on PBS. Never saw this one. I am hooked.<br />Can't wait to see what happens in Seasons 2,3,& 4. Downton Abbey fans<br />will recognize the father in this series!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I watch it with my grandkids, and find it entertaining in a Disney sort of way. just like beach blanket bingo but updated.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark and funny; she excels at marking damaged women super like-able. You will def care about solving this mystery. Ending is stupid though.
1743156502|3.0|The narration and information is just so monotonous. I think it's easier to read the book. I'll be donating it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I am really enjoying this series! Its fun, light, bedtime reading. After a long, sometimes stressful day, its nice to escape into another world.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a show I can watch again and again and again.  I love the characters, the casting, the writing...it's just fantastic from start to finish.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Have this for my kindle fire (3rd one &amp; time). I enjoy wasting time playing, my wife doesn't.  Con- the game progress doesn't transfer to another device, seems like the glitches/ updates fixed only when I replaced my kindle, game requests that actual money be spent for some missions or progress. Pros- I enjoy mainly because the title. I thought of the Oregon Trail game from my childhood.
B0046ZG2VG|1.0|When i first heard about the \\"impossible Project' i was so excited. i had polaroid backs for my medium and large formatt cameras,and loved the look.i felt this would be a new creative way to express my work.So i ordered six or seven pacs of silver shade and the color film,as well.at this point ,heaving gone through three packs of film i have yet to get  ONE acceptable image. i purchased the \\"tongue\\" was careful about exposing the film to light.Everything.what i get is awful! small patches of the image or just crap.i purchased four polaroid 600 cameras,and tried two or three of them.nothing.I understand this is a \\"work in progress\\",but the film i received is no good.so don't get your hopes up.i may try again ,because i love the promise of instant film.Any one with a different experience contact me.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Nothing special in the teen drama market. Little confusing (writer just invited new characters to explain situations) and very high in the drama and angst.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This Item was received in perfect condition and is a must watch I would recommend this Mini series to anyone who wants to learn about the absolute hell that WWII was I would also recommend Band Of Brother's between the two of these Mini Series  there is about 24hrs of educational entertainment
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'm a crier... i mean like i cry at everything but this one made me cry for half the book.... please read totally worth the tears
B00932AA5G|1.0|This is a gimmicky, brutal movie with unlikeable, one dimensional characters. I like Scandinavian thrillers, but this was a complete waste of time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keep making more!<br />...I absolutely love games like this! Would love it any more if more were free . I'll give five stars when I can play more
0920668372|5.0|I adore this book.  I can't get the refrain out of my head after just thinking about it.  I bought this gift for my daughter who is expecting her first baby; my first grandchild.  I wanted her to know that as long as I live my baby she'll be...and for her to share that with her own child one day.  Truly a touching story and not just for children.
B000VIPJKM|5.0|This is a well done comedy. Reese Witherspoon is perfect for the role of the smart blonde who doesn't feel the need to project her I.Q.. I once saw a meeting of all women doctors and they all were in black and gray or navy suits - no pink, no lace, no fishnets. Okay, I can understand the &#34;no fishnets&#34;, but does smart and serious have to mean you are a dark suit?<br /><br />Elle, in this movie, proves that you can be smart and feminine, smart and frivolous, smart and fun. It's a light message delivered in a light, entertaining way. I loved this comedy.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Very well put together  with lots of suspense and drama..keeps you on edge as you watch this action filled flick.
B00BMKH5NW|3.0|I liked Fangirl but I'm disappointed because I wanted to love it, but I don't think I did. I had highs and lows with Fangirl. Sometimes I really liked it and felt like it was so easy for me to relate to Cath and her experiences. But then there were times where I was bored or disappointed or just not all that invested.<br /><br />I really liked how Fangirl was so uncertain and awkward--that pretty much rocked. I loved some of the small details like how Cath didn't eat at the dining hall for the longest time because she felt awkward about figuring out the system. Like where do you get your food? Which line do you get in? What food to you get? Where do you sit? I totally remember those college days! And I also enjoyed a the writing aspect. I may not have liked Simon Snow that much (see below), but I liked Cath as a writer. In some ways she felt like a blogger because she was constantly writing things, had loyal readers, etc.<br /><br />But a lot of tiny things irked me. For example: I was annoyed that Levi was a nice guy and then did something stupid before he and Cath even started dating. Why give me a bad feeling about a relationship before it even starts? Then I was annoyed at Cath for forgiving him when I was still mad at him and not ready to let it go. Then there was a similar thing with Wren.. I was pissed at Wren and I was a bit annoyed that Cath forgave her so easily when I was still holding a grudge.<br /><br />And the fanfiction itself--Simon Snow--I didn't click with it. I think I was mad that it seemed like a lame Harry Potter ripoff and yet was apparently even more popular than Harry Potter. The problem was that Simon Snow wasn't just a replacement Harry Potter, where Simon Snow is super famous and Harry Potter doesn't exist at all. Instead, they both exist but Simon Snow completely trumps Harry Potter. And given that Simon Snow was such a blatant Harry Potter ripoff (magical world, school of magic, a Harry/Draco relationship, some kind of chosen kid, etc.), I completely cannot buy that. I accept that maybe something could overtake Harry Potter one day, but not something in the exact same story universe...<br /><br />And on top of that, there were random Simon Snow excerpts scattered throughout the book and... they kind of bored me. They felt so disjointed, like I was being thrown in and out of another story at random points. I had a hard time stringing them together to get a good overall picture of the story. It just seemed like: random excerpt from chapter 2, random excerpt from fan fiction chapter 8, random excerpt from chapter 14, random excerpt from fanfiction chapter 10, etc. And after a while, I just really didn't care about them and wanted to skip them. I also don't feel like they added to the story. At first the chapters were helpful to get to understand Simon Snow a little, but once I \\"got\\" it, the chapters were completely unnecessary and didn't actually assist with the plot much at all (except the chapters that Cath was actually reading out loud, but those were separate).<br /><br />And finally.. the ending. I thought the ending was very disappointing. There were a lot of build-ups towards the end but then the book ended so suddenly. It's almost like it just dropped off. Some of those things got half wrapped up, but others didn't get wrapped up at all! It left me questioning what the point was to a lot of it.<br /><br />I know my review has been positive-negative-negative-negative-negative.. but I didn't hate Fangirl . I think I just feel really passionately about the things that bothered me, so they're hogging all the attention in this review. But I do understand why so many people loved this book. Unfortunately, I let a few things dig their way in and annoy the crap out of me. But the whole point about there being highs and lows really rings true for me. There were some moments where I adored the book and didn't want to put it down, but then there were others where I was sick of it and was ready for it to end. I am upset that I didn't love it more though, because I kind of thought I would!o end. I am upset that I didn't love it more though, because I kind of thought I would!
B008X8RSTM|1.0|Can't figure out how to add more maps, pin items or bookmark. When you choose bookmarks it just says you don't have any set up.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very enjoyable game. Lots of stuff to do with the promise of more to come. Challenging but not frustrating like some other seek and find games.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I saw this in the theater and had to get it on 3D and it was well worth it.  Great movie for zombie fans everywhere.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|I only watched it as it was free with prime Found it dull and almost stopped watching it. I would have been annoy if I paid for it
B005BDZQKU|5.0|Everything about this set is amazing: the DVDs, the extra info and all the perks. In the newly restored format, it's worth seeing again and again.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Back in June my old Logitech wireless mouse finally died.  I came across this one and gave it a shot and loved it.  I don't know what i can add to what others have said.<br /><br />I ordered a second for work because the one I had was junk.  I ordered this one because I was happy with it at home, happy with the price and wanted the adjustable DPI.  Only problem i had was that the weight cartridge does not open.  No big deal - I don't need it for work- I actually want it lighter
B00CIAYYU2|5.0|It was a good movie. I'm now going to watch Part 2. Its amazing how he and what it dealt with to make sure the little man doesn't get taken advantage of.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I finished this book at 1am - sobbing quietly to myself so as not to wake anyone. I had started it about twelve hours earlier. By way of backstory, I should mention that I have been actively avoiding reading The Fault in Our Stars - some might say refusing  to read this book. To put it bluntly I did not want to read a book about teenagers with cancer, ever. But once I started, I couldn't stop.<br /><br />This is a very beautiful, funny and sad book. The characters are smart and well read and passionate and quirky. They are so honest and real that about halfway through reading I started to stress about the actors who had been cast in the movie version, because, quite frankly, these are characters you do not want to get wrong.<br /><br />Put aside your preconceptions; this is one you have to just take on trust.<br /><br />Read this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book, could not put it down. Great ending. This book will keep you guessing what is next. Loved the movie.
B00ENUZV66|5.0|Great song Lady Gaga.  I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I have since Gaga has already had so many HITS, I figured she couldn't keep knocking them out of the ball park.  But she did it.  AND THE VIDEO IS AWESOME!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|What a surprise! When I watched Red for the first time I thought, &#34;another adventure movie.&#34; Was I ever wrong! It's got an excellent cast, is high on adventure, with twists and turns in the plot to get and hold your attention. When the movie ended I thought &#34;Holy Cow!!! And for cats sakes!!! This goes waaaaaay beyond an adventure movie!!!&#34; I've watched it many times since without tiring of the story and am waiting to acquire the sequel.
B009KG7EMC|5.0|This movie is a great edition to your collection if you have bought the first one. It's a must have.
0316228583|5.0|For some reason I'm reminded of Edith Wharton's books when reading The Casual Vacancy. Each character is so authentic and individual but somehow Ms. Rowling is also able to remind us that no single experience is solitary. You might think that you are completely singular and alone with your thoughts in this world, but it's a safe bet that one of your neighbors is having the exact same thoughts.<br />I'm so disappointed that this book is being judged so heavily as not being what people expected (read: not Harry Potter). It's an adult book dealing with the real world and cruel, horrible and uncomfortable situations. I'd say more than anything this is a character study. Can marriage that looks destined for failure endure? Just HOW happy is that perfect couple? And the most heartwrenching: Can that crass, rude girl from a drug addled broken home ever be anything more? Sometimes the answers are exactly as you'd expect and sometimes characters will surprise you.<br />If I can take away anything from this story it's that none of us exist in our own world. You have to keep your eyes and mind open to letting new people and experiences in and not go through life so inwardly focused.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Every so often a book comes along that inspires me both as a reader and a writer. Kate Morton's, The Forgotten Garden, is one of those books.<br /><br />The Forgotten Garden spans over a hundred years and two different countries. It traces three generations and is told from at least eight different viewpoints, and yet the story flows seamlessly.  As an exercise in plotting, this book reminds me of Audrey Niffenegger's, Time Traveller's Wife; another book that manages to effortlessly jump back and forwards in time without leaving the reader behind. Given the complexity though, this is a book that rewards a reader with time to devote to extended periods of reading. It really doesn't lend itself to reading in small bites.<br /><br />Over the course of the novel, Morton unravels a tangled collection of motivations and events that conspire to see a four year old girl abandoned on a ship bound for Australia. As subsequent generations search for meaning and identity, so too does the reader follow a trail of breadcrumbs leading to the ultimate truth. One of the great pleasures of this book is seeing the way seemingly inconsequential details have a powerful impact on events. While occasionally there are elements that you know are going to be relevant in chapters to come, others come as a surprise. By two thirds of the way through the book I assumed I knew how it would turn out, but there were enough unresolved threads to the story, that it could possibly have veered off in a different direction.<br /><br />If there is any weakness to the story, it's that the male characters are nowhere near as well drawn as the female. For the most part they are bit players in the unfolding of the dramas of the central women in the story and their stories don't seem to unfold as cleanly or feel quite as believable. Given their supporting role, however, this does not really impact on the reading experience.<br /><br />This is a very rewarding read and highly recommended.
B005DN7W4G|1.0|Tea Leona, or whatever.  Wooden.  How can you make a movie with big bangs so boring? Oh, was Robert Duvall in that too?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|we love this game. fun for the whole family! I love to play it when I am o. my lunch break
B009LDD54K|5.0|Season 3 is action packed full of twists and turns.  New characters arrive, some you hate and some not so much.  I'm anxiously looking forward to season 4!
B009POCG2C|5.0|I haven't watched it yet since I am in college, but I bought it for my father instead, and he loves it.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Wow, how awful. Even with the special effects this is just another bad zombie movie. It is almost like you popped into the middle of another movie. This didn't have a good beginning, middle or end. They left out a lot of detail and information about everything. Also, no character development at all. There basically wasn't any reason to even have the wife and kids scenes. What a bad movie and a waste of $3.99.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|I finished this book in about seven hours. I probably would have read it in less if I hadn't had to stop regularly to explain what I was laughing at (this time) or to read passages aloud. Fortunately that's one of the great things about reading on a kindle: it's the fact that you've snorted laughing for the seventh time in a row that causes perfect strangers to stare at you, rather than the fact that you're reading a book entitled How To Be A Woman. Because surely, by the time you're in your 40s you should have worked out how to be a woman, right?<br /><br />Except that this is not really a book about how to be a woman, rather it's a book about why to be feminist, but that would require terrible grammar and no one would ever believe that it could be funny. And that really is at the heart of this book - the notion that being a woman and a feminist can be funny.<br /><br />Part autobiography, part feminist treatise, Moran charts her life from puberty to current day, exploring issues of identity, sexuality, body issues, pornography, office politics, music culture, relationships and everything in between. It's highly entertaining, funny and educational, yes educational... No, I'm not going to give examples, let's just say there are things in the world that I didn't know were going on...*<br /><br />I've read many reviews from older readers who adopt a 'been there done that' tone, suggesting that this is a book for 20 somethings who are just catching on to this whole feminist thing. I disagree entirely, not because I question whether it's a book for young women, but rather I reject the notion that young women are somehow lagging in jumping on the feminist bandwagon. From what I've seen, young women are exploring feminism from an incredibly young age, and what's more they're picking it apart, discussing it in new and creative ways, and remoulding it to suit their own experiences and aspirations.

B00422LESO|4.0|I'd like to start out with a confession.<br /><br />My experiences with reading Jane Austen have not been entirely positive.  Which is a polite way of saying I don't like reading Jane Austen. I know that's not the sort of thing you say in polite company, but I find the books really hard to get into. I do, however, love the stories. I think the characters are wonderful and the stories incredibly entertaining. Which is why I stick to the movie versions.<br /><br />Sure he may have appeared in 73 other films and TV productions, but for many, Colin Firth will always be Mr Darcy - a notion immortalised in Bridget Jones' Diary and now Austenland, the story of a young woman whose love life appears doomed because no man will ever live up to her idealised Mr Darcy (especially Colin Firth's, Mr Darcy.)<br /><br />In an attempt to beat her Austen fantasy out of her once and for all, our heroine, Jane, is sent to Austenland, a three week immersion into the world of Jane Austen. For an exorbitant fee, desperate women have the opportunity to travel back to an Austen world. They live in a manor house consistent with the period (I had Downton Abbey stuck in my head throughout) dress according to the period, behave according to the period, and interact with other guests and staff just as Jane Austen would have written it.<br /><br />What saves the book from simply being a trashy Jane Austen fantasy is the fact that Jane maintains a cynical sense of humour throughout. While there's a part of her that simply wants to give herself over, there's another part that can laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. She knows everyone else is an actor playing a role, she knows she is being played (although not quite to what extent) and ultimately she's there to have fun.<br /><br />While there's a degree of predictability about how the book plays out, a few good twists along the way make this a very enjoyable and satisfying read.

B004IPPINW|3.0|I read this book a couple of weeks ago, but have delayed reviewing it, because I have been struggling to decide whether I liked it or not.<br /><br />I'm still not entirely sure, so let's just start at the beginning.<br /><br />Written in the first person, The Reluctant Fundamentalist, is told from the perspective of Changez, a young Pakistani man who narrates the story of his life to an unnamed American over dinner. His life's story is one of journeys; from Lahore to Princeton, to a New York firm, through a failed relationship, the fallout of 9/11, and a return to Pakistan. There are underlying streams of pain and unrest. Changez is an outsider who struggles to find his away into American life until he is ultimately rejected and rejects all that an American life means. And finally, the man who was once a Princeton shining star becomes a radical.<br /><br />The novel speaks to the pain and rejection of being within American society and then suddenly becoming an outsider. It is a novel of aspiration and disappointment and yet, I never really felt that it captured the essence of that experience. I could understand the narrator's pain and rejection at losing his girlfriend, but I never really had a clear sense of why Changez was so quick to turn on his adopted country.<br /><br />In many ways the premise of this novel reminds me of the books that are being written about the internment of Japanese during World War II. In both cases people have gone from being entwined in a local community to overnight pariahs. Perhaps it is with the benefit of seventy years of hindsight that what is written about the Japanese is able to explore the communities' pain on a more subtle and open level. For its part, The Reluctant Fundamentalist, feels like it has been written with caution. The pain is there but there seems a reluctance to really dig down into it.<br /><br />Perhaps the simplest way to describe my feelings about the novel is that I really admire what it has set out to do - to tell another side of the 9/11 experience. I like too that it doesn't offer easy answers; but still I wanted more. My hope is that this book opens the door to other novels exploring this event and experience from a different perspective. There are many stories to be told, and with each telling comes a different way of understanding. The more diverse the narrative being told, perhaps the greater the chance of us changing the way our societies interact with each other and with their own, in the future.o tell another side of the 9/11 experience.

140006922X|5.0|A very interesting historical overview from the perspective of the Jewish and Roman (both rich and poor) peoples of Israel at the time of Jesus. Asian combines historical (mainly Roman) and biblical records (trying to eliminate the mythological aspects) and discusses what they can tell us about the events surrounding the time of Jesus and how he may have been involved with them. It is very well written and readable (not dry history). An outstanding work that deserves to be included in any library on early Christianity. A good companion piece to such books as Elaine Pagels (Revelations) and Bart Ehrman (Jesus, Interrupted, Lost Christianities).

B00A8307BG|4.0|First of all, let me say that I have been a big fan of Robin Trower, ever since hearing Bridge of Sighs back in the early '70s, an album I would rate as one of the greatest in all of rock history.  Looking over the track listing of his latest CD, I was expecting a great album, as it features classic songs such as Hound Dog, The Thrill Is Gone, Little Red Rooster, I Believe To My Soul, That's Alright Mama and Born Under A Bad Sign.<br /><br />Having listened to it many times since buying it two months ago, I would say it isn't a bad album, as I did give it four stars.  However, maybe it's just me but it seems to be lacking some passion, fire and spirit, especially the vocals.  Both Robin and bassist Richard Watts share vocal credits, and I find it hard to distinguish between the two.  Maybe, if the late, great James Dewar was still with both us and Trower, would this album be special.  Since he isn't, this album isn't.  It is a decent album, and if you love Robin Trower, I would recommend you add it to your collection.  If you're new to the power of Robin's stratocaster, start with Bridge Of Sighs.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I know this review doesn't really tell you what the book is about, but I think to do so in more detail would spoil what is supposed to be an intimate trip down memory lane to a time when things were much more fantastical than what they are now. This a story that is simple on the surface, but with a depth of immersion that depends entirely on how much you connect with the story. My guess is that the further you are away from your childhood, be it through age or experience, the more you will connect with this story and the more you will fall in love with it.

B00DQVSTCG|4.0|With the exception of the much maligned 5.1 sound issue, Madonna's MDNA tour concert video is not nearly as bad as many have made it out to be. And, in all fairness, I have a Bose `Cinemate' for audio purposes, which does not feature a 5.1 sound option, so... But the regular stereo option was clear, booming and all encompassing - my living room shook as she took the stage to the opening strains of `Girl Gone Wild.'<br /><br />Yes, the filtered, `Instagrammed' look of the video itself is a bit distracting initially, but after making 2 minor adjustments to my televisions hi-def settings, the picture was dramatically improved and after a few songs, I forgot about the issue entirely and enjoyed the show. That stated, I will be returning my BD copy, once the sound issue has been corrected accordingly.<br /><br />Madge is at the top of her show-stopping game with this theatrical, over-the-top, bombastic presentation and both she and her set/sound designers have never looked or sounded better. The woman is an undeniable, unstoppable force of nature and this Miami show demonstrates her prowess down to the last fine detail.<br /><br />And for all you fans missing out on the 5.1 option, I feel your pain and would be much incensed as well. Here's to hoping they sort this error out and very soon. BAD FORM, UNIVERSAL!!!

Learn how modern dietary advice is essentially a corrupt science that ignores the past and results that it doesn't like (much like climatology).

B002KKCVQO|5.0|I just got my first pair and put them on. They were more comfortable than I expected, so I took them for a five-mile walk to find out if (and where) they would rub or chafe. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that, unlike new shoes, these didn't seem to require any breaking in. They fit perfectly right out of the box, and were still comfy after the first five miles. I'm very happy with them so far. Time will tell how comfy they still are after a few hundred miles of walking.

Mr. Frankl has successfully communicated to me a way to change my perspective on living and how to become even more grateful than I have ever been for the gift of my life. He has shown how,by a slight shift in my perception ,how I can find usefulness ,joy  and beauty in ,any life circumstance I may have to encounter.This  book is healing,provocative,challenging and I heartily recommend it for anyone who wants to live a life of enthusiasm,joy and a full focus upon his commitments to himself and others!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read most of the books written on this subject, but it was great to have the phenomenon explained by a physician who knows the technical side of it.

B00DFFI7K2|5.0|Kinda off book though killing off Duke like that. I realize the directors and what not had problems with the actor and that being the reason to kill duke off. They could have had him secretly kidnapped by cobra after the attack that kills him. But who knows what these Hollywood types are thinking when they do something like that in the movies anyway. To bad the kid that was to act for Duke got his head to high in the sky to get himself killed off on this when there for sure could be more films of this in the future as the cartoon series lasted for quite some time so there is room for more movies on this. As this movie series has long term potential. Other than that the show was excellent.

034580709X|1.0|If this was the first book I read of Nesbo, I would not had read his other, enjoyable books. The writing style was one of just filling the pages with a travel log and disjointed side stories. He certainly did not present his excellent writings after this troubled effort. It like he traveled to the site of the story and wrote down what he saw and heard. He then threw all into a story whether it was needed or not to fill pages.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Every once in a while, a book comes along that grabs you, that makes you stay up until 3am to get to the end of the chapter or section, a book that sticks with you for days and weeks after reading it. Wool is that kind of book. As a Sci Fiction book, it belongs alongside Factoring Humanity and others of Robert J. Sawyer's early work. This is character driven fiction. You get into the characters heads, learn their quirks and ways of thinking and reacting, and even though you think you may know what is going to happen in the plot, the writer is good enough at leading you along that the twists and turns of the story are surprises in the end. Haunting, original, thoroughly worth reading and re-reading. I will be loaning my copy out to everyone I can convince to read it, just so they go and buy their own copy!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Perfect alarm clock. Love the snooze/cancel options. The app is completely customizable. All my kids have it on their phone.
0618918248|4.0|Dawkins presents his ideas clearly, for the most part, and really forces you to examine your points of view not only on religion but what it means to be a critical thinker of any proposed ideas. I'd recommend this book to anyone who considers themselves a skeptic.

Having relatives in Australia, friends who sky dive & a love for Harry made this an outstanding reading experience. Jo Nesbo is a truly gifted writer with an incredible sense for people. I highly, highly recommend this book.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I recently watched this on Netflix for the second time. It's been so long since I saw it on TV that I had forgotten most of the plots.<br /><br />I enjoyed this series a lot. It could have gone on for several more years (cue gripes about Hollywood executives...)<br /><br />What I didn't like was that this is the most sex-obsessed Star Trek. They never missed a chance to show people rubbing gel on each other's half-naked bodies, etc. It feels crass. Star Trek is not about being soft porn. C'mon Braga.<br /><br />I also disliked the T'Pal character specifically. The token sex object in a skin-tight uniform, just like Seven of Nine in Voyager. Oh brother. Although they did make her more interesting in the later seasons.<br /><br />Also, I'm sorry, but the Prime Directive is ridiculous. If people need help you should help them. Period.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book made me remind of my old self (the one who launched a business when she was seventeen). Now I am 27 years old and I thought that girl she dead. Not anymore. Now I know how to get my &#34;mojo&#34; back. By the way, the audiobook is also great. Thank you, Steve!

B0090SI4LU|3.0|Stephenie Meyer's The Host is one of my all-time favorite books.  I've read it several times and each time I enjoy it just as much as the first time I read the book, right after it was released in 2008.  I've long hoped that Meyer would release a sequel to The Host (has she decided to just stop writing and work on movies?!) but in lieu of a new book release, I was pacified with the release of The Host movie.<br /><br />I did not see The Host in the theater; the main reason being that I'm a SAHM to a 2 year old and I really can't get to the movies anymore.  As soon as the movie was released on Netflix, I sat down and watched it.<br /><br />While I don't think the movie version of a book is ever as good as the book itself, I found the disparity between the book and movie versions of The Host to be quite shocking.  The movie felt flat, unemotional, and cliched to me.  Many of the more emotional scenes in the book were either missing, contrived, or rushed.  The movie seemed to drag and was, at times, boring.  In contrast, I think the book is exciting, full of emotion, and I love the slow build of the relationships between the characters.  The movie was full of what I consider typical alien cliches: very sleek, advanced technology, white and gray clothes, bright and modern silver cars, etc.  I wish that the souls' technology would have been more subtle (as it was implied in the book) and not so abjectly alien.<br /><br />There was a definite lack of chemistry between the main characters.  If I had not read the book, I would have been unsure as to why Ian and Wanda ever fell in love.  The relationship building was just not there.  At one point, Wanda/Melanie asks Jared to kiss her.  That part in the book was so full of chemistry.  In the movie, it was laughably forced.<br /><br />I have mixed emotions about the casting for The Host.  I thought Jeb, Jared, Maggie and the Seeker/Lacey were perfectly cast.  I also liked Melanie; however, I wish she would have been stronger-looking.  She's so thin and I always imagined Melanie to have a fighter's build, not a super-slim actress build with very light musculature.  Wanda's character was my biggest casting complaint.  Wanda is supposed to be small, ethereally beautiful, blonde, and delicate.  Wanda's new body was just all wrong (the wrong face, hair, and stature), and it nearly ruined the ending of the movie for me.<br /><br />My favorite character was the Seeker.  She perfectly embodied the Seeker from the book, and I loved her internal struggle, and the fact that she's hiding a huge secret of her own.  Her drive and determination were admirable, although poorly directed, and I loved the way her storyline came to a close.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about The Host movie is that it did stay true to the book.  I really appreciate that and liked seeing one of my favorite books adapted into a movie.  I wish that the movie had been longer, to allow for more character development.  There were some important plot points that were left out, due to time constraints, I'm guessing.  The storyline about Kyle and Jodi, as well as Wanda's job before she meets up with Jeb, immediately come to mind.<br /><br />I realize that this review is full of complaints.  I did enjoy the movie, but had some major problems with it.  I know it's not a movie I'll buy, or likely ever watch again.  It may be worth your time if you can rent it for a low price, but I would highly recommend reading the book instead if you have the time.ooking.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|[[ASIN:B00DR0PDNE Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player]]<br /><br />Works as advertised: Streams videos from Google Play, YouTube and Netflix.  No local streaming from Android (yet [fingers crossed]) and I haven't tested the  PC > Chrome browser streaming yet (will update once I have my laptop from work), however I do know that the PC and Chromecast communicate directly (ad-hoc) so a PC without Wifi is unable to stream (doesn't use the Router).<br /><br />Hoping for a more open development environment as Google needs to approve the app or concept (not exactly sure) and be on a whitelist.<br /><br />Still not as open an a Raspberry Pi on XBMC, but for the less-techy users this is great and super simple to setup.  I live in Canada so it was difficult to obtain the Chromecast app for Android, but it is possible with some searching.<br /><br />Giving it 3 stars because MANY other products can do what the Chromecast does and I would update to 5 stars when more apps are supported, hoping (doing a lot of hoping) that console emulators get the casting feature (ie: SuperGNes) or simple cast what you have on the Android device (also compatible on IOS but I have no need for that as I am Android user)!

B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very easy to get consumed in the story and watch all episodes back to back and want more. Getting season 2 right now
B0009VSB06|4.0|For the money, this is a decent little metal detector. If you are starting out or looking to replace an older model or upgrade from a real entry level device... this is a good choice. I took it out a couple of times in both my yard and to a start park on former estate and ironworks that dates back to the early 1700s. It accurately identified coins, and even found some old bullet cases at the park. Before going out I did a bench test by putting coins, jewelry and basically anything small and metal I could find in a box and the ACE was pretty much dead on every time. You should get a pointer if you are going to dig in grass or harder soil. But at the beach or in sand, this should be all you need.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is definitely one of John Grisham's best. I was caught completely off guard by the twist in the plot toward the end.  I highly recommend it.
1567184855|5.0|Great impact about life's lessons and processes. It may challenge those who have strong convictions about birth and death belief systems.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|OK,great movie,but I have one question. Why is the 3D 'NOT' the unrated version? I was looking for the best one to be in the 3D disc. What gives? You get a 3.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This game is simple yet challenging. It reminds me of &#34;Where's My Water&#34; but not as silly. I am not much a of a game person but this is addictive.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|A very heartwarming coming of age story. It was very easy to just get lost in this book. This one is a keeper.
B00785P2QC|5.0|fun game.  hours of fun.  its nice that it keeps building up while you are not playing this stupid game so that when you do play it you have lots of money.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|I remember this since I was a Kid. I'm now an over sized child, and still love to watch it.
B000RLFBP6|5.0|Best movie ever, there is no need for any remakes here.<br />I'd Buy That For A Dollar!<br />Classic classic movie
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book will go on my bookshelf as a definite favorite.  Extremely well written in an old-school style that makes reading once again enjoyable.  It kept me spellbound and wanting more with each chapter.  Thanks for the ride!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really loved reading this book. It was fun and mysterious. The storyline was unique. I could not wait to get back to the book because I was so curious as to what would happen next!
B004I744AS|4.0|Great resource. Love the fact that it has definitions for multiple languages. Easy to use. One of the best I've used.
1451695195|5.0|I found this book to be one I would recommend to everyone.  It was an excellent account of a doctor's experience into the afterlife.  It was good to get the medical side of the story also.  It sure made me a believer.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|Got this for my boyfriend and he loves it. Very lowkey sophisticated and mature but casual. He wears it all the time.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I really loved the movie. I'm not really into concert movies but this was definitely more about her as a person and how she has grown as an artist. Plus the love that she really does show for her fans is really amazing. You don't see a lot of that with someone famous.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|I wasn't expecting much to begin with from this film since I consider the 1977 SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE an amazing film that beautifully captures the essence of what Superman is.  After watching this film, I don't have high homps for this new, twisted franchise that made SUPERMAN RETURNS look like a masterpiece.    It's the screenwriter's and the director's job to establish a cohesive storyline that resolve every point it inserts into the film.  It makes sense to leave a few crumbs that will establish the next set of stories for the franchise but this film did a horrid job of creating a character people can relate to.    Watch it for yourself and see.  You may like it or you may hate it as much as I do since this film is so divisive.    SPOILERS BELOW -- YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!    The things they tried to pull off in this movie were just unbearable --    -The Codex is absolutely BS. Another useless plot point. What the hell was this skull all about and why was it so important? All I saw was a skull jizzing into the embryos of Kryptonians. Granted the connection of Lois to Superman was leaked throughout the news but that doesn't justify taking her back to the ship at all. Again, it was a simple way to use her as a way for Superman to escape, nothing more.    - About this environment BS, we all know Superman gets his power from the sun. They decide to through this wrench of environment issues just to make it \\"believable\\". Seems like MAN OF STEEL raided AVATAR's closet by having people ride flying animals in Krypton and throwing in the \\"we're having atmospheric issues\\" for good measure. Superman had over 30 years to get over it but it took Zod 5 min? Please. Lack of atmosphere didn't seem to be an issue for Superman when he decided to fly to the edge of space where there's no atmosphere whatsoever. He seemed happy and \\"breathing\\" fine.    - With regards to terraforming Earth, what's the point? If Krypton sent thousands of ships for exploration and not 1 was able to create a habitable world after their amazing \\"terraforming\\", why the hell would Zod think it would work in this instance (BTW, Zod states he's a warrior while Jor El is a Scientist. How the hell were these brute warriors smart enough to change the Phantom Zone equipment to a Warp Drive? Thought that's what scientists do, not warriors). Looks to me the scientists messed up big time developing that terraforming machine.    - What was the point of showing a ship with an kryptonian empty pod?  To me it looked like the director wanted to imply that a Kryptonian did survive when the ship crash landed 20,000 yrs ago and may even be alive.  What happened to that plot point?  Forgotten, much like the brains of the creators of this abomination.    - Couldn't stand the embryos-in-a-ship plotpoint as it held the potential for a can of worms. As for Superman playing abortion doctor, the embryos were on the ship AKA the \\"Fortress\\" of Solitude that landed over 20,000 years ago that Superman discovers in Canada. The ship was undisturbed for al that time until he showed up. If Superman is supposed to be the only hope for \\"his people\\" he should have found a way to acclimate them to this world. If HE could survive, why can't they?    - If a group of people as strong as Superman were in town and I were Superman, I would tell them to get the hell out of town. And if the people decided to run screaming, I wouldn't blame them for one bit. That's when genocide comes knocking on your door. A quiet community suddenly disturbed in such a fashion would certainly cause understandable fear and panic. I wouldn't tell them to stay in their homes or businesses. That was just insane to me. If he would have at least moved the fight elsewhere, it would have shown that he was thinking about the welfare of others, not just his mom or Lois.    - Fact is two ships came straight to the Kent Farm to find the Cryo-ship that held Kal El to find the codex (stupid codex). No other reason than that. Can't say there weren'tlooking as Zod was so pissed that he flipped the car into the house. If the military noticed this (in real life they would have), they would ask: Why go there? What's so important there? Must be important if Lois Lane was at the house to. (Hell, ET handled the arrival of an alien better than this turd).    - Superman's Cryo-Ship. How was that even picked up by the military? They don't know where it is except Superman and Ma Kent. Lois knows how to kickoff the phantom zone but needs the ship. Last I checked, Lois isn't Supergirl nor did she have a spare tow truck lying around. All we see is the ship sitting on a military truck about to be loaded onto a plane. Why didn't Superman just fly the Cryo-ship to the plane? What the hell was he doing that was so important that he couldn't do it himself (risking the exposure of his identity)? Wouldn't that raise questions?    - Superman killing Zod was a low point that was immediately followed up with a shallow comedic scene involving unmanned surveillance plane. People keep comparing Superman to a cop who has to sometimes use lethal force. Difference is a cop isn't faster than a speeding bullet. If cops we're they wouldn't need guns. Why didn't Superman just cover Zod's eyes when he was shooting heat vision at a family of idiots? Why stand there when you can, I don't know, move to the right & out the door? Why didn't Superman just pull a KILL BILL 2 and rip Zod's eyes out (or at the very least gouge them)? Killing is ok but eye removal is too much? You can't heat what you can't see and you certainly can't heat without eyes. Since solar radiation is what powers Kryptonians, why didn't Superman just bury Zod deep in the ground and surround him in lead (lead blocks radiation)? He'd be blind and unable to stay powered without the Sun's Ray. If friggin' smoke from a terraforming machine can weaken Superman in South Asia, why can't he do something similar to Zod?    I love Superman and his history but this movie butchered the character's image. Amazed people don't realize what they're watching. Puppets just enjoying the half-assed special effects and glossing over the obvious mistakes the film had.    Comics Alliance and Mark Waid (writer of SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT and KINGDOM COME) wrote on this as well:    [...]    [...]
B006LSZECO|1.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did. But it was too slow of a read. I love long Russian novels, and my favorite book is Lord of the Rings... but I just could not get through this book.  The surprise ending was sort of disapointing.
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|I ordered this because the Directtv insisted that to get HBO  I had to order 4 more stations - at the rate of $45 per month.  Much cheaper to just order the complete second season and if you preorder - they guarantee the cheapest price.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is one of the best hidden objects game I have ever played. It can be a bit confusing on what way to go at times but there is an unlimited hint button that helps.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Good fun. Some gaps in the storyline but no big deal since it was easy to make the leap myself.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I bought this game a while back and thought that it wasn't going to improve and now I see how far its made it and I was blown<br />out of the water this game is amazing
B005J2UM9S|4.0|I am pretty picky about my horror films as most tend to be predictable and tread the same territory earlier films pioneered.  This is in the \\"First Person Camera\\" Horror genre that's been popular starting with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and most recently with PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4.<br /><br />The basic premise is that of a group of GHOST HUNTERS who are trying to investigate the mysterious happenings at an abandoned hospital.  The cast is a bunch of unknowns which, in my opinion, helps with your suspension of belief and give you the \\"I'm There With Them\\" effect that I like in horror films.  The group actually doesn't believe in ghosts, they simply do the show just for the bottom line and it isn't until they enter this building one night that their belief in the supernatural takes effect.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this film with it's genuine scares.  I like seeing movies like this in the dark as it helps to heighten the fear factor. It also helps not to be in a theater with talkative people texting and bringing their children with them to an R rated film.<br /><br />I highly advise not watching it's sequel as it was just bad.  Really bad.  Sad too considering how much I liked this one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It was the perfect length, first of all, and definitely a page turner. I loved the ending especially! I was right there with the characters, in space, getting to know Ender. You know you're reading a good book when sometimes after reading a few pages you look up and have to blink, because you forget you're just at home on your couch. Definitely recommend.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|I love Liam Neeson! The unknown was one of his better movies. I really liked the part he played as well as the climax of this movie!
B0098QBEXO|5.0|a very different kind of road trip story. Funny, sad and suspenseful with fantastic acting by all four lead actors.  well developed characters.and relationahips.A very engaging
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Great read and difficult to put down! I recommend all three books, which are similar to the &#34;Grey&#34; books and yet so different.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Good game<br />Play the game and try to change the past week if you don't want to be with your significant other and the changes those things
B0033AGPFS|5.0|\\"Electric Ladyland\\" is one of those albums that is absolutely necessary in a vinyl collection. I do not have the original vinyl, so I can't compare this pressing to the original, but I can definitely  say that the sound is much, much better than the CD I've had for years. It is true that the EQ is a bit brighter than the original CD, but not at all to the point where it's overwhelming. There is no additional compression that I can hear: in fact it sounds less compressed than the CD, but maybe that's just me. Overall, great sound on this pressing. It sounds awesome with a headphone amp and a good quality EQ.<br /><br />The packaging is great. The album comes with a full-sized 8-page booklet with a nice bio on Hendrix and great quality photos. The 180g vinyls are nice and heavy and have played with minimal popping and crackling on the first few plays. The vinyls are packaged in plastic sleeves which tend to leave small bits of plastic on the record: this is not much of a problem, but it does need to be brushed off before playing almost every time.<br /><br />If all vinyl releases (and re-releases) nowadays were of this quality, I would almost certainly leave CD's behind. Sadly though, releases of this quality are few and far between. This aspect is also what makes this pressing a superb buy.
B005IYNQAY|4.0|Different to the 1st book, sets up the finale very well - looking forward to reading the final chapter. Yay
B0089LOG02|5.0|The author did a great job of positioning her characters in appropriate times and spaces in history which made the novel all the more interesting. The rich background of her characters helped the reader connect deeply with their stories. I will re-read this novel to absorb all the detail. Overall it was a worthwhile, interesting, and emotionally tolling read. I loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered a Chromecast and tried it out at my dad's house. He liked it so much that he kept it and I just ordered another one for myself Great for streaming YouTube, Netflix, and any content in a Chrome browser tab to a TV from a PC, laptop, tablet, or phone connected to the same network.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is quite entertaining, but being docked by 20 seconds for random clicking is annoying when you are not clicking but zooming in and out.  This is a standard hidden object game with very nice graphics and a charming dialogue.  I had fun playing it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a great book!  A very good story, with a humorous, modern twist on Greek mythology!  Adding the fact into the story line, that Percy, has ADHD was excellent.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|This review is about the download and blu-ray products, not the movie itself.  If I could give Amazon and Paramount marketing zero stars, I would.  The movie itself was very good.<br /><br />Thought I'd buy the pre-DVD release download version.  The hd version was not available for download.  After I purchased the standard version, I discovered I can't download it to my pc, only select players like tablets, etc.  So now I can only watch it by streaming it from the video library on Amazon's site, and it will not stream if you have your pc connected to a larger display, either.  This sucks so much!  I won't be doing this again.<br /><br />Now I find out that no one sells a complete blu-ray version with all the features, you have to buy all 3 versions of the blu-ray to get all the extras!  I won't be buying that from anyone, either.  What a disappointment from both Paramount and Amazon.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Love this book, completely different to any I have read before - recommended. One of those books you wish I could read all over again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fabulous book can hardly put it down can't wait to finish it and start the next book launch laurel la
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|You should play the game. This is good for all ages, except for 4 and under. This is a awesome.
B00DFUNA18|4.0|these are a strange bread of guy with slightly different style of music (I have to be in th mood to listen to them butthis cd is still a rockin releas from the vol-Beat boy with some good extras on the bonus disc.I heard anthrax lost there lead guitarist to these guys???? I didn't see hem listed on the cd?!great album!
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|I got on level 1 world 3 and it glitches every time I try to start at the very beginning it doesn't work and I fall through the ground
B004SCN2F6|4.0|A very fun game. The elite version is extremely challenging in that the size of the game map is gigantic. It really tests your strategic ability. Two thumbs up.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|I've been looking for a new weather app since Accuweather went insane. Only problem is, I depend heavily on radar to verify and get the REAL details. If this app ever includes LIVE MOVING Radar I'll get it. Until then, I'll be going elsewhere.
0920236251|2.0|What the heck is this?  I didn't see anywhere about this being tiny size.  I can't believe I just paid two bucks plus four more in shipping and handling (that was definitely unnecessary) for something half the size of a dollar bill.  Its still the story, and in great condition, but uh....I feel swindled.  This ad is not completely honest :/
B0037471TE|5.0|Not only a great read, A GREAT RE-READ. Enjoyed, & was gripped by every unfolding &#34;crisis&#34; as they raced towards that &#34;open&#34; end that will draw me towards the next exciting chapter.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love twilight and this cd. It takes you back to the movie scene!! I will order all of these cds now.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|White is classy if you don't have dirty hands.  It is easy to locate if you have a lot of wires from your power output.  This works well with the new surge protectors for your wall plugs.  Get the six expansion surge protector with two USB ports on the top.  Great for phone charging by your bed side or charging up all your Kindles for the next days use.
B005PK57NU|4.0|Well-acted, tautly-written drama with good characterization and plot development.  This series has so far resisted the fate of many series in their third year or later - they often turn into soap operas as the writers become desperate for ideas.  The weakness - Julianna Margulies is the least-talented member of the cast, and the episodes are enjoyable despite, rather than because of her.  Christine Baransky is the brightest light in a stellar cast.
B00F35BV64|5.0|This was a pretty good sequel/prequel to the Star Trek films. JJ Abrams is an amazing director and I can't wait to see his work with Star Wars!!
140006922X|4.0|Considering the amount of effort the author took to research Jesus of Nazareth, I was fairly disappointed with the one paragraph summary of why it may be significant to believe in Jesus Christ.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Love twilight and this cd. Takes you back to the movie scenes. I am going to order them all now!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|This album was amazing! NKOTB is back and better than ever. Their last album, &#34;The Block&#34;, was good, &#34;10&#34; is better.  Lots of good tracks 1-3, 7, 12.  All around great album!
0788859544|5.0|Was exactly what we wanted for our daughter's birthday. Was shipped really fast and we didn't have to wait for Disney to take it out of its vault in October.
030758836X|2.0|I read a lot and this is probably one of the worst reads I've encountered in a long time. I really wanted to like this book as I live close to where it is being filmed. I enjoy a good mystery but this book lacked in good writing and suspence. Perhaps it was supposed to be funny and I missed the punch line.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have WD TV Live box so I can pretty much use any service including Netflix and Youtube. With my android phone it is even easier to control WD TV Live. For me the only reason to buy Chromecast was to use Chrome browser's tab casting function. I have an I7 extreme laptop with 16 gb of ram and 250 GB SSD, so I can guarantee you that it is no slouch. I have a net gear router and have had no trouble streaming anything from the internet before. The problem with this device is that the tab casting is terrible. The video is choppy and the sound is out of sync.<br /><br />PROS<br />Best device on the market for  Youtube and Netflix.<br />Small Size<br /><br />Cons<br />Just another disappointment after Miracast.<br />Apple has had Airplay for ages and us Android users still can't get it.<br />The collection of APPS is 4.<br />It supports 4 APPS.<br />That's it, just 4 apps.
B009CF3MEK|3.0|Beautifully filmed, well cast and great acting. The scenes of the wild parties at Gatsby's mansion are magnificient. But I found the pace too slow and there was only one likeable character. Impossible for me to identify with the lovelorn characters, most of whom were not too superficial to evoke any empathy.
B00871C09S|5.0|THIS IS MY KIND OF SUSPENSE MOVIE. NO BLOOD BUT LOTS OF THRILLS.<br />THIS MOVIE BEATS ALL THESE OTHER MODERN SUSPENSE MOVIES.<br />JIMMY STEWART AND GRACE KELLY ARE PERFECT TOGETHER.<br />RAYMOND BURR IS POSITIVELY SCARY. THE PLOT IS DELICIOUS.<br />IF YOUR A FAN OF OLD MOVIES. THIS ONE IS ONE OF THE BEST.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Bought the last one in Hong Kong when I was 19 years old.  It survived 3 more years of the USMC and lasted for 30 years. I don't expect I'll have to buy another.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I love Bruce Willis.  He does action movies so well and this particular installment is well worth watching.  The inter play between father and son is hilarious.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Loved the first season and the second season was wonderful too.  It was hard to turn it off.  I think I watched the whole season in three nights.
0061122416|3.0|Okay book, common theme seen in similar books.  Easy read though.  A friend had recommended.  Not a total waste of time.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Can't go wrong with Phil Collins.  Makes road trips less boring and inspires me while I do my walks around the neighborhood.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|One of those games that is easy to learn but years to master.  It is truly amazing how much strategy there is to such a small and deceptively simple game.  I recommend adding it to any gaming group or who ever needs a party / ice breaker game.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|A very saucy read. Am halfway through it. Reading it in bed before sleeping and time gets away from me as I read. Whoops, it is almost midnight.
0545265355|5.0|My husband and I were fighting over the books since we were reading the books at the same time. He would take them to work and I would read them at night when he was asleep. I would highly recommend them to anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I live the Romance of the story.  The suspense beeps you on the edge.  Can't put the book down.  Will enjoy many more of his books.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Does just what I need and not a lot of fancy smancy stuff.  Good tool to carry with you at all times.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Show was short lived but had it's own spin going on for it.The new movies coming out are great,but do not look for any new series for T.V.as they cost to much.It seems we are going to be stuck with reality shows from now on if people don't start wanting better stuff coming on the little screen.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I chose this rating because it was $.1 and was soooo worth it! No scratches, glitches, or anything wrong with it. Great purchase!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book is beautifully written.  I was able to &#34;see&#34; the story as I read, and it was wonderful!  I loved all the twists and turns and really enjoyed all 3 voices of the characters.  A story of love, loss, friendship and still a great mystery.
0375869026|5.0|This book is filled with so much love.  It's like a hug for your soul.  I wish everyone in the world would read this book, especially the bullies, especially the dictators, especially the people who believe they have everything figured out.  I loved all the main characters-- Via, Jack, and above all, Auggie.  Some of the lines just slayed me--they were so insightful, so masterfully written.  This is one of the most emotionally true books I've ever read, and I've read A LOT.  I am so utterly grateful to have come across this book.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I crashes times after time dont waste your money its the worst app ever,  and I dosent even have power point WOW great app NOT!!!!!!!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|As always, Denzel delivers, a better supporting cast would have made it an awesome movie. I was however; still pleased.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This film had a very inventive premise and captivating science fiction elements.  Much better than the reviews, much better than 'Elysium.&#34;
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is a well written book that's connects event in our lives and the unforeseen impact is has on others. It's a great reminder that very decision you makes affects everything....the butterfly effect!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|For those who love the original James T. Kirk and crew, this is the movie set to have.  The original story of Khan is so much better than the recent remake - richer story line and female characters who aren't props.  It may be campy, but it's quite entertaining.  Live long and prosper!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is a great book about the journey of a child who is bullyed and commits suidice.  It looks at the question of the consequences that words and actions even though small impact a persons life. Great book.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|There is no one more qaulified to renew these song than Vince Gill.He does a fantastic job and I can listen to this album over and over.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great story,tons of fun, surprise ending. Casting was perfect.  Not very believable but exciting plot with great special effects  watched it twice
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Initially I brought game for my kids.  When I saw them enjoying it I tried the game and I am addicted. I would highly recommend purchasing this game.
B004YRSBTW|4.0|Such a great movie! So suspenseful that it keeps your attention the entire time! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the ending broke my heart!
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Just got this cord today and plugged it in and it works right away without any issues.  The cord quality is great and doesn't feel cheap.  The adaptor lights up white when charging to let you know that it's on.  I would recommend this cord to anyone needing one for an Iphone 5 or 5s.  I bought this for the 5s which is coming out tomorrow.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|This collection fullfilled my dreams. The book is also excellent. Earlier collection made in 80's or 90's was a liittle poor.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|Kind of fun and goofy  but who doesn't love Barbara Streisand.  Send a lot better comedic lines could have been written
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Yet another fantastic delve into the vaults reveals this well played 1972 show. This 3 CD/1 DVD set is well behaved and deserves to live in a good GD fan's home. It's had all of its' shots!!! If you like the GD this will have you wagging your tail.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|I was very pleased with my purchase. Not only it arrived on time, but the quality was wonderful when I watched the entire Season. I would definetly recommend this.Thanks again!
B003NTSBUG|4.0|I am sucker for thriller and suspense genres and I found this very engaging and exciting. The principle cast has done a fantastic job.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I watched season two after seeing season one.  I think this one was better than the first.  Asylums are scary by themselves, but this show did a great job of creating a world of corruption and pure evil.  Jessica Lange gave a convincing performance as a nun turned patient.  Can't wait to start watching season 3.
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|A little heads up to all amazon members. On this date of 9-20-13  I have received word from Decca Records that the \\"Mercurcy Living Presence Vol.1\\"  The first one, will be re-released on November 4th 2013.<br />  So all those sellers that are selling this set new from $700.00 to $1563.00  and the sellers selling used from $592.50 to $1196.00  you will not have to pay those ridiculous prices if you don't mind waiting until November 4th 2013.<br />  I just wanted amazon members to know this to help them save money by not buying high prices of over $500.00 when the set should be available for around $125.00 or less.<br />  I have a email copy of the letter sent to me by Decca making this announcement.<br />  I hope I helped out a lot of people here. Best of luck to everyone.  Dave<br /><br />By the way this box set is absolutely fantastic in it's sound and the job the people did transferring the music to CD was top notch.  If you like classical music and want something a little more than the great ones this is a great start.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|If you enjoyed Angry Birds Star Wars, you will LOVE Star Wars II.  It's worth it to see Yoda in all of his spinning glory! Great fun!
140006922X|3.0|This is an easy and light read, enjoyable for anyone interested in the historical Jesus. The author has compiled modern biblical research into an easily digestible book. There is a certain repetitiveness with regards to the listing of the other Messiahs that came before and after Jesus of Nazareth. This rhetorical technique to relegate Jesus as one of many fails to be interesting by the second and third re-telling. The book's major flaw however, is the failure to really convince on the titular premise of Jesus as zealot. This notion is almost a secondary aspect to the historical study and is tacked ad-hoc in various places in the book when the author seems to remember the purported central thesis. Far from establishing Jesus as a zealous revolutionary, the author seems confounded with even producing a coherent guess as to the meaning of the Jesus sobriquet - Son of Man, which he claims is the key to understanding Jesus's description of himself. Note the subheading, the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth, much of the book is devoted to the 'times'  of Jesus, these for me made up the most interesting parts of the work.
B005721Y7Y|2.0|I have no idea why this one is so talked about film. I mean I have seen it on the news when it was released that it had one some awards and stuff. But i found it very ordinary film.
0890090572|5.0|I searched all over for this copy because I loved the original art for the series. Classic Holmes now and forever.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|As the sequel to the Stargate franchise the crossover of storyline and characters flows into the Pegasus Galaxy where new villains become allies, and old villains are vanquished. As the technology of a long extinct civilization is being explored and used in new and exciting ways. For SiFi lovers this is a fun way to spend some time to decompress with a storyline familiar to the Stargate back story.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Saw the play live in Toronto many years ago.  My mom has this on VHS. needed to get my own copy. Beautiful music!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy playing the different puzzles. Builds observation skills, for sure! My only criticism is finding where to get help if you don't understand something. There's probably a lot more to the game than I've discovered so far. Yes, with patience you can play this game without having to spend your money on anything.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Loved it. Can't wait till the 2nd half!  Awesome action scenes, great cinimatography. Nice to see the familiar faces. That's all folks !
B008602KQI|5.0|Sure the lack of detail compared to the book is undesirable but we must remember its a film with a different focus. I really like the story and how it makes us think... &#34;what if?&#34;... I'm sure I couldn't make it.
B008602KQI|2.0|You think that the heroine is going to stay to the correct path of putting others first and righting wrongs.  Instead she becomes just like the rest - tolerant of what is wrong.  That is certainly today's message.  She had a chance to change the whole oppressive system but instead caved to power and attention.  We all know that with a few more riots like the one that took place in the movie,  the corrupt system would have gone down.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|When I was A kid I played many games of chess, I like the App. I was very good but not a master of the game. I like to play. If I set the level too low I feel cheated for winning, If I set it too high there is no way I could win. I wish they could show the missing or captured figures. when you know you are ahead you can trade out your pieces. This is a great App. I like it. and it is free.
0316023752|5.0|The author does an excellent job of hopping around the globe to keep things in perspective while still more or less chronological.  Reading of the war from a Brit perspective yields insights not usually found in American histories: coverage of the campaigns in Burma and the doings in Nazi-occupied Europe are two such; there is also more about the three-cornered war in China than is usually found.
B0063M22QO|5.0|We love mahjong  a home can play my kids, grandchildren and myself.  We've all enjoy it.  Thank you creator for this wonderful game.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I just think she is amaising. The songs are great and she sings so effortlessly. The entire album is great.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am already looking forward to the next installment in this alternate Star Trek universe - it should be interesting, as this one ends at the beginning of the 2260's when the Enterprise departs on its five year voyage to boldly go. . . .<br /><br />Blu-ray - 2013.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I play jurassic park builder every day.  I haven't spent a single dollar and still get alot out of it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun, challenging and addictive! The rooms are fun to explore, and I even like the banjo music! Be careful - every time you get out of one room, you just have to try the next one. You can waste a LOT of time with this game, so don't start unless you have time to spare!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Good game fun and addictive. Great grinding game since you can earn the money for cars. Start out with Audi
B005XR3K5M|5.0|I brought this for myself has a birthday present and I am greatly pleased with them. The cards feel good in your hards and are flexible but durable. Each suit as an unique theme from one of the games (The games are the original, Wind Waker, Skyward sword, and Ocarina of Time.)Each card as a unique item from the game itself on them too. Being a HUGE Legend of Zelda fan, and also a poker fan, I am extremely happy with this purchase. It came in two days, and with a protective plastic case. There is some green paper folded up in the box, but they are not in English. I am okay with that and wouldn't see why it would since they're cards. All in all, great spend of my money and may be buying a couple more pack for various friends and family.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Beautiful tunes to float away too while drinking wine in a overly bubbly bathtub with the lights dimmed enough to not know where the hell you are
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|As most of the reviewers already said...I wish I had read the description more carefully.  The \\"video\\" is just a bunch of stills.  Surely the entire concert was recorded. If you have Rock of Ages you already have most of this stuff.  However, the sound quality is great and it's a nice package.  If not for the $80 price I would be happier.  As it is, I am satisfied because it is The Band.  Die hard fans will want this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show all around. Cast is brilliant and the storyline moves quickly rather than dragging out each episode that<br />i find refreshing. Got hooked on it this year !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the best games I've played second to only subway-surfers.  The only way this game would be better is if it had a daily reward or challenge for multiple days played in succession.
B005KA188S|4.0|Arrived on time, and well packaged but I was hoping it would come a slipcover. In the description it said it would come with one. The artwork was a bit damaged on the spine but all in all fast shipping.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Surround sound in a headset.  This one is so good you can hear the bad guy sneaking up on you from behind.  Keeps the wife from complaining about all the blasting going on in your man cave.  LOL
B005IF7HNA|2.0|All of the discs work fine except the Miracle Day series. I read the reviews from people that said they had the same problem, but ordered the box set anyway hoping to get lucky. That was not the case. Amazon should pull this set until the problem is resolved. The two star rating is based on the non-working discs and does not reflect the show's content. As far as the show itself; five stars all the way. This is a great television show.
1934030597|3.0|I've been trying to maintain my mountain bikes without any manual and it's been a struggle.  I was excited about getting this book to help me through some harder tasks.  First--derailleur adjustment: the instructions were too confusing and ultimately not very helpful. I've spent hours on this and the adjustment is still off.  Second, replacement of my front derailleur: Even though the directions covered several types of derailleur, it left out some vital steps including how to use the inner sleeve and--oddly--getting the chain through the cage.  Presumably, the chain would need to be separated or the cage breeched (a real trick as it was obviously not intended to be opened)--but there was absolutely no mention of this.  True, I'm a novice and perhaps everyone but me knows how to do this, but a mention would have been helpful.  Finally, changing the front fork and replacing the front stem bearings:  The directions were too confusing for me to even think of attempting this and I'll probably need to Google it for more help.  I'm still trying to use the book but it is much more complicated than I would like for my inexperience.
006178480X|5.0|James Rollins is a great story teller.  His books teach about history as well as suspense.  I would recommend his books to anyone.
030759565X|5.0|Got this for a friend who loves to cook. She said she loves it and it has so many good dishes inside. Recommend if you want to expand your recipes with healthy yummy stuff
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I just bought Weather Live and so far love it.  I have added several cities including areas in Costa Rica and they all games right up.  Its very clear and easy to read.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I love this movie. It's one of my all-time favorites.  The casting was so genial.  These three women are so funny.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|and DARTH VADER Plus I cant wait til they make plush toys like anakin and obi-wan even villains like<br />count dooku and general grievous
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|I wasn't able to catch this when it was on TV and I'm glad that I have been able to watch these now.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|show and plot are good, but this new time line wiped out a complete history of star trek for millions of fans. This is like a slap in the face to those who loved the treks that came before. A complete fantasy with language, cultures, history and a galaxy of worlds is now gone and many people held on to those fantasys to escape reality for a brief time making reality a little easier to cope with.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|the greatest album to exist. seriously so good. is it rap, is it screamo, is it hip hop, is it alternative... who even knows bc its all of them.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I think it is a great way to get an alarm clock if you don't have money!!! U could be on time when ever this goes off!!! Buy it
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|If you like a great cast and love to listen to beautiful music this is the show for you.  Delightful!  I'm sure Dustin Hoffman had a great time directing this one.
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|Really well done, Dave! Thanks for the memories. It's like a time capsule in a mixing board - glad to see it's in good hands.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I saw this in the theatre and its the best movie I've seen this year. I absolutely loved it and I've noticed it being on my mind and wanting to see it again.
B004BDOJJU|5.0|Well, maybe I should qualify that one a little.<br /><br />I saw the movie version of Stardust first - it's one of my favourite movies, and I grabbed the book more recently to read the &#34;director's cut&#34; if you will. I'm quite happy that I did!<br /><br />The book is a slightly different story - there's no real sword fighting in the book, but there is a great fairy tale of romance and true love. It's a gentler story than the movie tells, and despite having a different sort of focus than the movie it's a really good modern day fairy tale.<br /><br />It's reading things like this that Gaiman's skill shines - his words take you along in a gentle way, and I could imagine this being read to me as a child, perhaps.<br /><br />If you're a fan of stories like the Princess Bride, you'll enjoy this as well. Full of charming turns of phrase and gentle wit, it's easy to collapse into and yet gobble in a single sitting.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|At first I did not undetstand how it worked... it seemed like the books werent free at all.. but then I tried yo purchase anyway, and it was not charged a thing!<br />The app is great! It works just fine on my kindle, so Im guessing they fixed the issues some of the other reviewers mention...<br />Recommended!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great game, lots of boards to play but you can't personalize the tiles nor the background that I can find yet
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|In a moment of curiosity, I tried this free app on my phone, as I am not really big on playing games.<br />I played until it just became too tedious, puzzle after puzzle, realizing that there were better things I could be doing.<br />This is amusing for about as long as it takes for water to boil.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|Since hearing about the premise of this novel, I had been dying to read it.  It was a quite enjoyable and bittersweet love story.
B00E3IZIM0|2.0|As a huge SciFi fan, and person who loves 3D, I couldn't wait to see this film on the big screen.  The special effects and 3D are phenomenal, but as good as they are, they cannot lift this movie enough to make up for the barely passable acting and the abysmal plot.  Next time they should spend less on technology and more on better talent and writing.  Save your $$.
B001R10BMS|3.0|Never Say Never Again is Sean Connery's worst outing as James Bond and suffers from wanting to compete with the Roger Moore film Octopussy that was released in the same year. While Connery is fitter than Moore and even in this poor film does a good job of being 007 the script is leaden  - a remake of Thunderball, with a poor mans vision of James Bond. The cast to back Connery up is excellent with Klaus Maria Brandauer as Largo and Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush. Brandauer under plays his role with psychotic menace, Carrera over plays her role with psychotic eroticism. Kim Basinger is eye candy and not very effective.<br /><br />If you are a completist then get this but if you want best  then get Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger and Thunderball then get On Her HMajesty's Secret Service and The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill. These are the cream 007 films.
B003B96AOW|5.0|The marvel select Deadpool is an excellent addition to anyone's action figure collection. It had great detail & is a very sturdy figure.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|This is so easy to use and adds a lot to your scrapbook pages.  I love that you can make the design any size you need from 6&#34; to 12&#34;.  I like the doily design a lot and will be adding more cartridges also.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Some 3D movies simply don't gain much thru the inclusion of 3D.  Furthermore, most movies that weren't originally created in 3D, don't really benefit that much after they've been transformed.  Well perhaps technology is changing this, or we need to give a lot of credit to the artists that re-did Nemo.  Because I was stunned at how much BETTER an already great 2D movie was in 3D.<br />If you thought the ocean was deep and things looked great as they were, buy this 3D movie and prepare to be blown away.  It's that good.
B00004YX39|5.0|I love this album, like the other first 5 from Steely Dan. I hum these all day, and listen to them often on my laptop at work from a thumb drive.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another thrilling adventure by Rollins.  The fringe of science meeting with an ancient past come together in an action packed ride that leaves you wanting more.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I was disappointed with the disjointed stories in Season 3 of Downton Abbey. I loved the first and second series, especially the second. I practically wore holes in my BluRays while my husband was deployed last year. By the by, he's deployed again this year and I can't stand to actually watch these episodes more than once or twice more to fill in the background while I'm doing housework. The characters aren't as engaging or likeable; we don't get to spend as much time with any of them; I can't stand Shirley MacLain. Bringing in a big name (and tragedy for the sake of tragedy for that matter) for the draw, in this case, disappoints miserably. Hoping that Season 4 is better written, more cohesive, and more intimate.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I well never buy one ever again it was slow and I lost some of my best books because it creshed
B000002KXV|4.0|This would be a 5-star rating but for two points:<br /><br />On a couple of the songs towards the end, it sounds like a sound gate was being used. They sound like when you take a volume knob and play with it in time to the music. It gives me a bit of a headache, and I usually have to skip them.<br /><br />The other is that I don't think these later lyrics are as punchy as some of the earlier works, or even like his last solo.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its nice being able to have a ready calculator on hand. I would totally recommend this app to any one.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|This was a very well written and directed Star Trek story. The new, updated take on the old classic continues to engage and entertain! The acting is top-notch and I cannot wait until the next iteration.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a very great game. The only problem I see it that the energy does not long too much.
0761169253|3.0|More like a term paper than a full book. Content stretched thin to be  book size. Some good stuff in it , Would make a good full length magazine article.
B006PZBRCY|3.0|My seven-year-old enjoyed it, but I couldn't finish it. The protagonist suffers some knocks at the start -- almost too many for this sort of movie -- but the ending is all too predictable. I wasn't thrilled with the level of violence, either, though it's mostly robotic.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|But I found the movie to be a little cold and not terribly engaging. Lots of profanity, which doesn't add much to the story. I would not pay again to watch this one.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love it; it works for my book and mine and everyone else's cell phones. this cable really comes in handy.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|It had a few funny or interesting moments, but was mostly a big &#34;I love me&#34; essay from the author.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|I didn't think I'd like this movie, but wanted to try something a little outside my comfort zone (and my wife said it looked good). It surprised me: I had the wrong impression from the ads some years ago. The plot has some neat twists, keeping us engaged to the end, and the characters show good depth. Leonardo Dicaprio plays his character well, and has a good cast around him. I thought this would be a shallow movie that relied on special effects, but the special effects, while interesting, take a solid back seat to the story.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Loved the book and all the others in the series would recommend it to everyone<br />can't wait to see if there will be another series
B0028ER4PU|5.0|Nothing like vinyl enjoyed it just great sound going to play it this weekend for some friends can't wait to see their faces.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Don't know how long he's been around, but his voice and style are &#34;Frank Sinatra like&#34; which is a real good thing.  He sings real tunes rather than the current noise that is so popular now-a-days.  Good for him.  Great disc.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Although the title is a bit too cute, this is a serious book about prison life for women - mainly women serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes. The author takes the reader through her journey from her crime, waiting to be sentenced, and through her year of incarceration. This book opened my eyes to the conditions in the three prisons, the relationships formed, and what it takes to survive day-to-day. This is an important story to tell. And we wonder why so many prisoners don't last long \\"outside.\\"
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|We've always loved Schleich's products and this Dragon Rider was an excellent addition to our collection. As with all our Schleich figures, the attention to detail was truly impressive. From the dragon's scales to the knights armor, part of the fun is just examining the toy and taking in all the little nuances. Our almost 4 year old was so thrilled when he say the toy and has played with it pretty regularly for the past few weeks. The wings on the dragon are removable and posable, so when they are on the dragon you can adjust their position however you like. My son likes to move the wings about as he zooms around the house and pretends his dragon & knight are hunting dinosaurs. Overall, a great toy and one we would definitely recommend.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|A half-star deducted due to the short length in this offering ... IMO, add two more new tunes when trying to secure a return to the 'Promised Land' in this ... the age of value for the consumer---the bonus tracks were well done though.<br />A half-star deducted for missing that one or more barn-burner/mega-tune/anthem per album ... no Take Hold Of The Flame, Walk In The Shadows, Eyes Of A Stranger, Silent Lucidity, etc---kinda why Promised Land fell short in comparison to Operation Mindcrime and Empire.<br /><br />Still, a very solid recording.  To me, it sounds like a cross between Rage For Order--- in that it's a little more on the artsy side in delivery ... and not quite commercial-sounding like Mindcrime and Empire with the catchy hooks and 'bigger' choruses---and the thick, lusher-sounding production of the also-chaired, Jimbo Barton, Promised Land.<br /><br />Trying to keep an economical review: Rockenfield seems rejuvenated behind the kit with some great fills and crashes while Wilton and Lundgren successfully attempt to bring back the harmonizing guitars that defined the 'Ryche-sound' of yore.  EdBass holds down the bottom-end with class and contributes quality to the songwriting that has been somewhat-lacking in recent years.  And La Torre?  Good job, new guy ... great sounding voice and lyrical contributions for the new role in such a talented outfit!  Can't wait to see how he evolves as a front-man in two albums.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|An in depth and easy to read biography.  A good insight into his philosophy and personality that eventually became Apple.  I don't think I could have ever worked for the man though....in fact, I don't know how ANYONE could work for such a tyrant.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much, new writer for me. I will be sure to purchase more of her books. Kept me very interested, lots of twists and turns in the plot.
B000002GBB|4.0|\\"Pieces of Eight\\" was released by Styx in 1979 and is one of their better efforts.  After \\"Grand Illusion\\" was released in 1977, it was the album that put Styx on the Rock and Roll charts, and this album their next one made it to #6 on the charts.  Many great songs are on this album and they include:<br /><br />  1. Great White Hope<br />  2. I'm O.K.<br />  3. Sing For The Day<br />  4. The Message<br />  5. Lords Of The Ring<br />  6. Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)<br />  7. Queen Of Spades<br />  8. Renegade<br />  9. Pieces Of Eight<br />  10. Aku Aku<br /><br />Though none of these became the \\"mega hit\\" songs that we all know by Styx such as \\"Lady\\", \\"Angry Young Man\\", \\"Babe\\", and so on, these are some good songs that any fans of Styx will enjoy.  The stand out ones are \\"I'm O.K\\", \\"Blue Collar Man\\", and \\"Pieces of Eight\\".  This is a good album from that classic band from Chicago when they had Dennis DeYoung as lead singer and is an album that I recommend to anyone who enjoys Styx.
B00DQVST76|1.0|I was anticipating the arrival of this awesome concert only to receive a defect. I hope this gets corrected and a new batch comes out very soon!
1449410243|5.0|Anyone who loves cats as much as my boyfriend will love this book. It is the funniest thing I have ever read.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Thought I wouldn't really care for this. My seventeen year-old communist philosopher/writer son loves it. Now I own it. You win, kid!<br />&#34;I TOLD you so, DAD!&#34; Okay, so maybe you're 54. Maybe your mid life crisis has been over a LONG time. If you appreciate creative musicians who aren't afraid to experiment with their talent (and who really don't care whether you like them or not), you should buy it. Warning: This is NOT touchy, feel good, honey, muffin, pumpkin music like you hear in airports and dentist offices. It's not feeling; it's attitude, melted, mixed, and amplified.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I must have a calculator that is simple to use and large enough for me to see. This one is perfect!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I have had this going on 2 years now. Still works perfect and is actually pretty good quality parts. For the price you cant not beat the ease of use, and organized travel it provides. The only thing I find difficult is adjusting to the smaller screen. Going from a large TV down to this takes me a couple hours of play to retrain my brain I guess. Once im home it is no problem to switch back to a larger TV though.
B00000DGUY|4.0|I only bought this because my son said it was one of the best cd's ever recorded.  I wanted to find out for myself.  I have been playing it on my walks and can see what he likes.  Sultans of Swing is marvelous.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|What's not to like about Mumford & Sons. You really should see them in concert, but this should hold you until you can escape your rat race.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My brother recommended this series to me! He gave such high praise for it that I was prepared to pay WAY more than the price I paid. Needless to say, I couldn't put it down, it was riveting from the start. An original idea is so rare anymore, this was original from beginning to end...<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me I've got more books from Hugh Howey to download and read.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Ozeki weaves together two lives in a magical story that was impossible to put down.  This is one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I'm a big fan of Alan Moore's original graphic novel version, and I'm also a big fan of this big screen adaptation. It is a beautiful, haunting, and stylish look at a dystopian America that has rejected the heroes that once protected it and made it great, only embracing the non-heroic versions of the Watchmen.<br /><br />This film is often maligned by fans of the originals as well as those who have no particular grounding in Moore's work. It has been panned both by &#34;comic book&#34; fans and &#34;laymen&#34; alike.<br /><br />But for my money it is one of the finer efforts in the genre. It's not The Dark Knight, fine, but it's absolutely a powerful work in its own right.
B008I3R2VG|3.0|Sorry, this was not the Killers I get when I find You Tube posting, &#34;Don't Shoot Me, Santa Claus.&#34; It's okay, but not as satisfying to me as other CD's.
B00DHQI2QS|5.0|cant wait to keep watching. its funny, interesting, has some drama but not too much. love the characters. really easy to get into it
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Have a kindle and a computer, found the computer a bit in convenient to use as a mobil reader so I used my Kindle a lot now I have the Galaxy I have the best of both worlds
B006YG9HJE|5.0|Maggie Q is perfect for the role of Nikita. Each episode is action packed. Shane West is the perfect anti-hero.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|Always wanted this album as a kid. Now that I'm a kid again I've got the CD's. The classical roots of early Genesis are captured here, and you won't hear this music in a dental chair, on an elevator, or at an airport lobby. Muzak cannot offend this with its invisible touch or its electric razor. You gotta get in to [it] to get out [of &#34;Idol&#34; folly].
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As the third of his novels that I have read, it doesn't disappoint.  I love the culture and family scenarios that the book takes you to...many paths for one journey.
B002ZG983M|4.0|This movie is funny, action packed and if you like movies from comic books, you'll love this! It stars Nicholas Cage, Chloe-Grace Moretz, and Aaron Johnson as kickass.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My son is a huge fan of this video game and really enjoyed the movie.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes superheros or Legos.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Not much about Radiohead disappoints. This CD is no exception. So many great tunes on this CD. I love it.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A wonderful novel and depiction about a middle eastern culture and women.  It was a tragic, yet enlightening read...A quick read cover to cover, one of those you don't want to end.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A wonderful presentation of the connection between  catastrophe and human response and the consequences.<br />Enlightening.  Provocative.  And a great read.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Really enjoyed game. Hints came in handy on hidden objects as these were<br />very well hidden compared to other games I have played. All in all good game. Wish it were longer and you could go to more places though!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|The movie was alright but for all of the hype preceding it i thought it would be allot better. It might of been better in the movie house but for home viewing it fell short of my expectations. It had a few parts that were entertaining but for the most part just a typical zombie movie.
B00936A0RU|4.0|intense and wonderful acting . Great story. Lots of action and ..some romance ....and tender moments ...soundtrack is wonderful , too
0307352153|5.0|Every teacher, every parent, and every bystander to children's activity should read this book.  My response iis &#34;bring on the introverts&#34;.  We've been missing them!
0780020685|4.0|This copy is a replacement copy.  I lent someone my last copy and asked for it back once and they didn't return it.  To me this is one of the best films of all time and I hold it close to my heart.  That's why I loaned it to my friend in the first place.  So instead of losing a friendship, I had decided to order a replacement copy.  That's one reason why it isn't opened yet.  I'm keeping it in excellent condition and not loaning this dvd to anyone.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|The Oatmeal only turns out quality stuff.  If you have, have had, or liked dogs...  Buy it.  Or, gift it to a dog lover.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|Perhaps the most defining line of the book--a line that truly emphasizes the existential underpinning of the novel--is when Meursault is musing over the fact that his fate will be decided by \\"men who change their underwear.\\" All just men. In accepting his fate, Meursault acknowledges that he has no control over his life. As he says, it will all inevitably end in death, now or twenty years from now. Those men and women who deliberate over and ultimately decide the course of Meursault's life have only the illusion of control as they spew empty notions of responsibility, remorse, and love, an illusion that allows them to bear this life, which they are incapable of comprehending. Meursault is at least aware of his ignorance, finally surrendering to the conclusion that there is no point to life--or if there is, it is so far beyond our grasp that it is also beyond faith and belief in God, or any sorts of discussions about it. His fate to die earlier rather than later perhaps saves him from more years of fumbling about, pretending that when or whether he lives or dies has any purpose or meaning at all.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I picked this book up after reading several rave reviews despite that the topic did not interest me.  I was immediately absorbed into the book and picked it for my book club.  The writing is excellent.  There were a few dips in the book, but overall it was worth reading.
B007P7UF0G|2.0|I really wanted to love this movie.  I was warned that I'd hate it, since most people do, but I was convinced I'd like it.  The story of `Camelot' is one that is strong and exciting, and the idea of casting Vanessa Redgrave in her prime alongside the manly Richard Harris was almost like dream casting.<br /><br />Add to that the fact that this was a musical, and you have me really excited.<br /><br />Sadly, the source of my true excitement wound up being the thorn in my side by the time the film was through.  For a story that is so exhilarating and charming and thrilling, `Camelot' feels like a halfhearted joke and really fails to capitalize on any of its real assets.  Redgrave is given some of the worst songs I've heard uttered in a musical that wasn't aimed at teenagers, and Richard Harris suffers with a character that should have been more than he was.  The handling of King Arthur is so, underwhelming.  Franco Nero is decent as Lancelot, but this film is clearly uninterested with him outside of his charming good looks and so he winds up being an empty vessel.<br /><br />My biggest qualm with this film is the musicality of it all.  This is a dark and serious story that needed edge to be something great.  It needed a heavier hand, treatment like that of `Sweeney Todd' in order to carry the weight of what we know of this tale.  Instead, the lightness and airiness of it all make the film feel like a spoof; like and intentional comedy that just isn't very funny.<br /><br />The sets, costumes and the like are astounding, and that cinematography is just phenomenal, but outside of those technical merits this was a giant waste of time.  I can't even really say that it was entertaining because it missed so many marks.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|C'mon, would I have purchased 11 seasons  of a show if I were not already familiar with it? I suspect that most buyers of this product have similar feelings and will not require a review to make a decision. I will say that the price is definitely reasonable.

1452000247|5.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairytale by Author William O'Brien<br /><br />Peter, a delightful nine year old boy living in Bodenlea Park in a small village, is soon to turn ten. Just before his double digit birthday, he and his mother make a little visit to Mrs. Kipple's antique store. After having a cup of tea, Peter decides to browse through the store to help pass away the time while his mother and Mrs. Kipple enjoy their visit. He manages to find a well-worn and tattered wood box that piques his curiosity. It is being sold for a very minimal price and Peter eagerly asks his mother to buy it for him. With the price being so reasonable, Peter's mother readily purchases this quaint little box. As soon as they return home, Peter goes to his room and fiddles with the box and discovers a hidden drawer. Inside he finds three odd objects, a silver ball, a pineapple chunk, and a copper key...<br /><br />On his birthday he is invited back to Mrs. Kipple's shop because apparently, she has a special gift for him. He finds her in a small room by the staircase which he has never noticed before. In this room there is another smaller room about the size of a broom closet. The key opens the door and Peter is transported into a fantasy world which consists of a wide cast of magical characters. This fairytale world takes him on a unique excursion into the land of talking stone paths where toads and little boys turn into steam in order to get to other unique and captivating places. Peter is exposed to a very unusual and challenging journey.<br /><br />Talented Author William O'Brien has done a great job of tapping into the creative abilities of the mind in this well-written fictional novel. The descriptions are vivid and easy to imagine. The curiosity of Peter and the pleasure he experiences in this enthralling and oftentimes dark fairytale are sure to bring enjoyment to its reading audience. Mystical encounters in a magical kingdom sums up Peter's enchanting plight as he moves along and has many unexpected encounters. The thread of good versus evil that is common to most, if not all fairytales, is expertly woven into this captivating story which will be pleasing to a wide range of readers and a variety of ages...in essence to both children and adults.  The poems at the end of the book are an added bonus and give this novel a special touch and an even greater glimpse at the talent of Author William O'Brien. Good stuff to be sure!<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00F6YPFAU Growing Up & Liking It]]many unexpected encounters.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|Bought it because it was pretty cheap but was surprised to see that it preforms very well with most knifes
B00846REIS|3.0|I know this is supposed to be sort of the next Fifity Shades of Gray series but it's much more raunchy (not that I have a problem with that) but I don't like the charachters very much.  Gideon and Eva are very intense and sort of ridiculous at the same time.  It's not bad but it's just ok for me.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is a very interesting show.  I started watching the first season on my NOOK because I do not have cable television.  I really enjoyed season one, so I bought season 2.  This is a science fiction/fantasy type series and has mature themes. language and situations, so it might not be suitable for younger children.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|For some reason it did not work well on my Kindle Fire after playing the Bingo game one evening after down loading it.  The second day it wouldn't let me in part of the time and at other times it seemed to freeze up.  Have gotten rid of this game even though I did like the game as a whole.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I just tried it and it's started to clean my kindle fire immediately, it helps me to get more space without the hassle. Try it, it works. One press of a button and your all cleaned up.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|An absolute stunning, and great ending to a great series. A truly wonderful book with a great story and again a great ending
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I really enjoy this show a lot.  I enjoy show with that let you learn about the different characters and their lives, relationships and careers.  Grey's Anatomy is like that.  Yes, you do have the medical cases that they work on, but that is not the heart of the show.  It's their interaction with each other.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Has very vibrant colors and is a good Mahjong game to play.  Mahjong is my game of choice, so have a lot of them down loaded to my Kindle Fire.  Play this game almost every day over some of my other Mahjong games.  I would recommend this Mahjong.
B005HED11Y|5.0|This is an enjoyable series. I watched it via my Prime account online. It is well written and though some of the special effects show their age they don't take away from the show. I would highly recommend it.
0321934318|5.0|well written, however it did not explain that the program is installed on the main pc  and  the external hard drive is just for photo's only as a result i  deleted all my photo's and have not been able to retrieve them. once the program is understood it is a great book. errol robinson
B009RX85N0|5.0|This show is one of my Sunday night must-see.  I have watched this show from the very beginning and have really enjoyed both seasons.  It incorporates fairy tale/nursery rhyme characters in real life situations.  It is also a show that the whole family can watch.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter loves it! She's 5 and plays it with ease. Lots of fun options and it's very cute. I believe that some of the pets are nearly impossible to unlock unless you pay for them.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book had me wanting more every time I picked it up! I recommend for all lovers of books especially those who like the unknown
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I've always had the upmost respect and pride in those that serve our country. This book took it to a whole new level... The accounts in this book will cause you to view those that serve in our military in an amazing new light.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I started watching this show in the first season.  It originated out of 2/3 episodes of the show J*A*G which I watched.  I enjoy shows that focus on character interaction and this show does.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome... I couldn't put it down and can not wait to get my hands on the next book. Every woman should for sure read these books!
B001AQIYJC|2.0|I know it's an oldie, but gahh i hated the ending. It starts pretty good. Lovable characters, nice imagery, good story. But that ending man. That. Ending. Ruins it.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Other than the fact that I played it so quickly, I found that this was a great game to play.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another beautiful book by this amazing writer. The setting is Afghanistan and although it is heart wrenching at times, the book is informative and enjoyable.
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|I like the fact that the author explains his idea behind the theory of HTML5, etc., but it is very much at the 50,000 foot level. He doesn't really go into the nitty-gritty. The reason I'm not sure if I finished is that there was an option to &#34;upgrade&#34; the book at the end. That's a little weird...
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Curious characters interacting to create a moderately developed story.  Pace is slow.  Engaging children opposite McConaughey. Poor ending.  Happy to have watched it on Amazon at home rather than in the theater.
B009LDD54K|3.0|First of all as the seasons go by I get fewer episodes. In the third season I only got 2 episodes per DVDs and there were 5 DVDs . This season I just noticed that it was it little more brutal and violence. Especially with the character Gyp he was crazy and mad. But I still like Boardwalk empire so if they come out with season 4 I may purchase it to watch it too. I might as well since I already own the three seasons.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This is a great book for anyone with curly hair.  Even if you don't have curly hair there are a lot of nice hair care tips in there.  I recommend this book to everyone that I see with curly hair.  Buy one for yourself and another copy for your loved one.  You won't be disappointed in it.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|Why?<br /><br />It takes everything I loved about their sound from the very old skool rave days, blends it with the things I love most about their Fat of the Land days and on top of that Liam seems to be at the top of his production game while doing it.<br /><br />This album has grown on me, I almost didn't like it at first.  The more I listen to it, the more it's becoming an album that will earn a permanent spot on my mp3 players.<br /><br />He takes the breaks to another dimension.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time...actually is my fourth time reading it...love love this book
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br /><br />Outin (Inner Movement #2) by Brandt Legg starts right where the last book leaves off. They stepped through the hole and on the other side was Nate eleven months older. Older Nate was explaining to Dustin and younger Nate everything that has happened in the past eleven months and it hasn't been good. Older Nate tells them that Amber and Linh died. (Way to start the book off with a bang.)<br /><br />They both leave the Outin and stay at Cervantes Island owned by Booker Lipton (Corporate raider). While on the island Nate tries to teach Dustin what he knows and he also practices himself. After Nate has a fight with Dustin, Nate takes a walk and meets a friend of Bookers named Wandus. Nate asks Wandus if he is a mystic but Wandus tells him that he considers himself a seeker. Wandus teaches Nate some valuable lessons and especially about eating a more healthy diet. Wandus tells him that a more healthy diet will help his powers.<br /><br />Nate goes to the Hibbs Mausoleum and retrieves files, papers, thumb drives and CD's which gave them enough evidence to expose Lightyear. Nate had an Outview that he should go to Graydon Manor and retrieves some papers that are connected in protecting the jadeo.<br /><br />Nate keeps on trying different things to change the outcome of Amber and Linh dying. One way is when he goes and meets with Luther Storch, the head of Lightyear on Roosevelt island. At that meeting Storch asks Nate to join Lightyear and their cause and Nate tells him to shove it. Of course Storch and the military try and kill him but are not successful. He escapes by getting in an RV but later jumps out and is picked up by one of Bookers men.<br /><br />Booker's employee takes him to Rust Nature Sanctuary which borders Graydon Manor. While Nate is there, Lightyear lays siege to the mausoleum and he almost gets caught but Bookers helicopter takes him away to another island where he meets up with Spencer.<br /><br />On themorning of the seventh day of being on the island, Nate has a vision of Amber, Linh and Kyle being ambushed by Federal agents and Linh was going to die. Nate goes to save them (which he does) and ends up being serious injured after a rocket blew up the tower of the Shakespeare theater in Ashland.. If it wasn't for Linh and the others quick thinking to get him into the Outin so he could get in the healing waters of Floral Lake, he would have died.<br /><br />After Nate wakes up, Linh, Amber, and Kyle begin to tell Nate everything that happened after the rocket blew up. They explained they remembered his stories of Outin and Floral lake so they knew where they had to take him there. They tell Nate they found a note from Dustin. It tells that he went through a window so he could fix some of the mistakes he made and that Nate needed to find the 5th lake in Outin. They decide they need to find Dustin and would also look for the lake. While exploring Outin, somehow Lightyear's soldiers infiltrated Outin and were after them again. They end up capturing a soldier but they don't know what to do with him. So while Nate,Amber and Kyle where talking, Linh picks up the soldiers automatic weapon and kills him.<br /><br />After they killed the soldier, they continued to look for Dustin and found him in a window. Dustin speaks to him but sees Dustin jump. Nate tries to dive after him but they hold him back. Nate thinks Dustin is dead.<br /><br />They leave Outin and are found by another mystic Yangchen. She teaches them so advanced kellering and tells them that the only way to beat Lightyear is through non-violence. Spencer ends up finding Nate and the others. He starts yelling at Yangchen for kidnapping Nate and the others. They end up staying at what is called Greater World, where they get some rest. While they are there, Lightyear blows up a mall and blames Nate and Dustin. They decide they need to find Dustin so Nate, Amber and Linh go back to Outin.<br /><br />While Nate andthe girls go to Outin, Kyle stayed behind because he wanted to speak with his Uncle through a portal to tell him what was going on and give him a pep talk. The government was holding his Uncle for questioning. After Nate and the girls had been in Outin for a while, they had not seen Kyle and they started to worry. They thought he might be at the lodge, so they went there looking for him. They walked in and found that Kyle was shot. Nate takes him to Floral Lake but realizes he is too late and Kyle is dead.<br /><br />Nate does find Dustin in Outin, so Nate and Dustin make the tape of Storch talking to Nate on Roosevelt Island. Additionally they are able to get all the military soldiers out of Outin and Nate seals the entrances up.<br /><br />Nate and the girls use a window to leave. Nate contacts Spencer and Booker on the astral to let them know where they could find them. The window led them out of Outin and into Cuba, three months ahead of time. One of Bookers contacts takes Nate and the girls to Booker. Booker tells Nate to go easy on Spencer because he has had a hard time with everything.<br /><br />Spencer tells Nate he has to meet with Storch again after the tape is released. After a couple of days, Nate uses a portal to drop in on Storch in his office, Storch is furious and tells Nate he's a dead man. The door opens and two darts are shot in Storch's neck and Nate is finally able to see Storch's soul in the split second before he is tossed back to Wizard Island. Nate finally understands why he had to see Storch. He finally knows who has Storch's soul in this lifetime and he is not happy.<br /><br />After they leave Cuba, the place they were staying at was raided. Nate tries to figure out how every place they have stayed at ends up getting raided. He thinks Dustin is the traitor. He contacts Dustin by astral and tells him he knows he's the traitor. However, Dustin tells him that he isn't the leak but Nate himself is the leak. Dustin begins to tell him that because of the advance kellering he is using, he has an open channel with his mom and his mom has been giving the information to Lightyear. Nate asks his mom and she tells him that she is the one giving them the information. Nate cuts off his kellering with her.<br /><br />Later, when Nate and the group get to Taos, Nate feels that his mother has died. Yangchen tells Nate that his mother was not killed by Lightyear but by a faction of the movement known as the IF (Inner Force). Nate asks Yangchen to help him find the Dark mystic. She tells him he isn't ready for the dark mystic. Yangchen tells Nate there is a way to defeat them. Nate realizes that Yangchen is right and then is happy and scared at the same time because he sees is Aunt Rose and Clastier walk into the shack they were in.<br /><br />All I can say is another brilliant job by Brandt Legg with the second book in the series. It definitely doesn't have the second book slump. Legg has written a breathtaking view on a subject that allows the reader to immerse themselves into another dimension that he has created.<br /><br />Legg's written words are mind-blowing. They flow effortlessly throughout the story and allow the reader to throw themselves into the story. His imagination makes the story come alive. The characters are well developed and the story progresses nicely. There is never a dull moment. I enjoyed this book better than the first. The imagery in this book is phenomenal. This is an awe-inspiring follow up to Outview and if you miss reading this fabulous book, you will return to this time and slap yourself silly.<br /><br />4.6 Stars<br /><br />This book was provided free by the Author in exchange for an honest review
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Enjoying the game.  Kind of like Despicable Me Minion Rush.  Still getting used to the movement.  It is enjoyable and amusing.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Just started seems like a good game to while away the time will see how it goes to gain more experience.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|This is a well written and produced album.<br /><br />Avenged is an extremely talented band. Their timing is accurate and succinct as always. The production quality is very high.<br /><br />It reminds me of a high def version of the classic Megadeth type albums in the 80's to early 90's.<br /><br />That doesn't describe it perfectly but you can hear the reminiscence of old metal albums from various bands for sure in this album.<br /><br />I'm glad a band these days can still preserve that sound and talent.<br /><br />Fantastic job.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|It was a fun game. Not really worth the $2.99 due to the fact it was too short. I finished the game in just a couple days. Four stars because of the lack of time and challenge. Five stars for the graphics and plot. The search pictures were a little off with identification. Didn't always want to acknowledge the touch and would give a red X. Then when you hit the hint it would go to what you just touched.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I am so happy that I decided to purchase this item vs the Britax version (which costs 4x more!!) It fits great and looks nice. Also, the DIONO wording is smaller than what is shown on the above picture.
B00DQVST76|5.0|Others have commented on technical flaws, so all I need do is acknowledge they are there.<br /><br />How can I give five stars in the face of such technical difficulties? Simply because this is a drop-dead gorgeous show.  I saw it three times from the Golden Triangle, and this DVD really does capture so much of the excitement I felt then and there.  Madonna typically puts on a brilliant show, and this one is considered by many fans to be her best tour ever. I know people who really are not Madonna fans and who see many shows--when they saw the MDNA Tour they said--\\"That's one of the best shows I've ever seen.\\" And really, it's a show more akin to Broadway than to a typical pop concert.<br /><br />Madonna skillfully picked some remixes of her new work that translated beautifully to the stage. \\"Give Me All Your Luvin' was off the hook, as was the finale, \\"Celebration\\". She also reworks her past hits in such novel ways. Who else would have seen \\"Hung Up\\" as a song about being a hostage? The acoustic version of \\"Open Your Heart\\" is breathtaking--I've never heard it sound like such a beautiful song. I have not yet seen how \\"Like A Virgin\\" translates onto DVD, but in concert, the role she assumes of a world-weary woman who has seen too much made the tune the emotional highpoint of the concert. The video interludes she created were also artful.<br /><br />This is the only place I can give this brilliant tour a review that will stand and be seen into the future. So, even with some of the sound issues and the occasional odd edit, I give it five stars.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A book that stirs emotion and makes you reflect on nature or nurture. Just how much do we know about our families?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|THIS GAME IS THE ONLY ONE I'VE PLAYED WHERE THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO UPDATE OR PLAY. IT IS PERFECT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. I LIKE THAT I DON'T NEED TO BE ON FACEBOOK TO ENJOY THE EXTRAS OF HAVING FRIENDS.THAT WAS THOUGHT ABOUT TOO.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Awesome talent! My 2013 favorite; I recommend this work to all of my friends and family.. Can't wait for the next release..
0425266060|5.0|Absolutely loved all the books, This is my favorite after 50 shades of grey.<br />Check them out you wont regret it.
B000H305U0|5.0|I give this album five stars. I absolutely love it. It has a different style than what I'm normally use to. I don't know what took me to song to buy it.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|It's useful for talking to other people to know what's going on.<br />It also helps us get to know people of the gaming community better.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|great device.  easy to setup and use.  A few companies are blocking it's mirroring capabilities (silverlight and therefore amazon instant) when full screen.  Otherwise it is perfect.  For the same cost as many HDMI cables, this acts as a wireless HDMI with some (albeit limited) apps.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|perfect replacement for my worn out tips. Recommend them for anyone needing to replacements for their headset,. Worked great, try them.
B004XIZK5K|5.0|Simple yet effective read for anybody interested in fitness.  I will reread this many times! Pavel rules!!!!! Thanks for the great advice!
B0037TPMOA|4.0|I am not generally a horror reader but this book works on so many more levels. The writing is a litlle contrived at times but the overall structure, the shifting point of views, character ambiguities and above all the never ending suspense makes this one of my better reads.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Ok kik is incredible u must get add me on there if you do l:investigatestion. Awsome and the best part it's FREE:D
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Loved this movie.  It reminds me of my childhood.  I would always get excited when they would occasionally show this on TV back in the 70s.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series was intriguing and addicting to watch. My husband actually watched it with me episode after episode. We were amazed at all the detail to fit into the period and how each episode kept you wanting to watch more. Just an awesome series.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|And so I read this one quickly. Not too much joy in this, character motivations are hugely suspect, plot twists all too convenient .. Ah well ..
B00005RDRO|3.0|This is entertaining -- a bit along the Agatha Christie line.  It includes many of the old (first-generation: 1950's & 60's) sleuths, with their individual oddities/trademarks exaggerated.  All are invited to an old \\"haunted-house\\" type mansion and are pitted against each other to solve a murder.  Each does an admirable job in his/her own way -- but I won't give away the ending.  You'll have to buy the DVD to get that.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's great and easy to use! I prefer to use this as opposed to using the traditional one! I am so glad I downloaded this app.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I loved this book. It was fascinating for a child to be the war hero. I'm excited to see if the movie does this book any justice.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was the only book of the triology which I really liked. The apocalytic environs, novelty of the 'games' and the seemingly doomed love makes this a pleasant read. The sequels alas are certainly a let down.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my favorite game.  I play it all the time and mostly win.......maybe that's why it's my fav, lol.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I've been using this for a while now with a Microsoft Surface Pro and a HooToo 7 port USB 3.0 hub on my gigabit network without experiencing any problems.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There's so much that happens on this book! And it's not a happy ending, but then how could it be happy after all they've been through. This is life. One just have to go on!
B003O86FMW|3.0|The first book was great in its ideas and characters but in this sequel the whole thing feels even more ludicrous, the characters less likeable. Ah well when you read the first one you have to read 'em all.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Enjoy playing this game. I think it helps that wizard of oz is of my favorite movies. I normally don't lol  run games but this  one I do. The graphics are good.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like that it for my Kindle which goes everywhere with me.  I like seeing the time as well as the weather. Thanks.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|There is no bond as unbending as a parent's love for their child. This is a relationship story. The characters are painfully human-for good and ill. I liked that the chapters captured the thoughts of various characters. It allows the reader to see the same event from different points of view. The over-riding message is that every little thing we do has an impact on someone else in ways that we could never imagine. Especially the things that we do for, or to, our children. If you like fiction that grabs you by the heart and makes you evaluate your own relationships, this is for you.

B0093QE37S|5.0|Great movie, The kind I enjoy watching, Great actors, Clean film, Nice colors, Good sound! The price beats going to expensive movie theaters! Sit in my own chair and eat my own snacks!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love everything logitech, almost bought this on that point alone... the sale and need for a headset helped though. Sound is great, the mic works great and that's just the start.<br /><br />cushy, all the way around my big ears with not too much squeeze from the whole thing.<br />mm adjustable size<br />10 hours of listening on a charge of a few hours<br />3 G Keys. Pre-programmed media player commands work even when a non-mainstream player is out of focus. Now imagine using them to activate your visor and nanovision in crysis 3. sounds awesome.<br />There are some software woes, must manually set default playback device to switch back to speakers. Also the charging cord is an irritating spool i hope to bypass and throw in the garbage. I love logitech and the sound in these headphones too much to take any eggs off for minor difficulties.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this one last minute just because of the Prime shipping ability, and was pleasantly surprised that it was actually rather good. My friends who normally use whetstones even kept borrowing this from me saying how much they liked it. Not sure how long it will last, but so far it's been great. Used it on different types and sizes of blades.  I'd recommend it.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|I love this game it seems really polished and thing work as they should the only hiccups I have seen is very light multi player matches but with a little tweeking and an update should and could smooth all the rough spots overall very nice
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love it. I love all the Twilight Saga Movies. I can's decide what one is my favorite, it maybe this one or Part 2.
B005V20JKI|1.0|Had the full game then updated and was prompted to pay for it.  Quite the scam.  I will never do business with this app maker again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game I'm just not very good at it. Never have enuf money for power ups and haven't completed even one collection yet.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works very well with Netflix and Youtube, setting it up was very easy. Really wish Redbox and Amazon Instant Video would supported today, maybe one day.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|Matches lots of colors, Swatch quality. I may give more Swatches in the future based on this experience. I like the transparent back, too.
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games is a beautiful, suspenseful, and thought-provoking film about a future that is brutal, extremely unfair, authoritarian, and downright frightening for most people. Despite the oppressive conditions (or because of them), the young characters have become strong, brave, creative, and inspiring! They are beginning to rebel, getting fed up with their authoritarian state. They worked together and made progress. The movie was engaging and entertaining and leaves the viewer with hope for a positive future democratically created by a united people. If you like science fiction, action, justice drama where the downtrodden start to win, it's a great film! There's even a little love involved. I want to read all the books. I strongly recommend this movie. [[ASIN:0545626382 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset]]
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|First defective. Replaced for free by Withings. Second has short battery life and underestimates altitude and even steps. $99 lesson.
020530902X|5.0|I write a lot of different kinds of material and work with a lot of others on various projects - many of them are college students.. I have had this little book close to hand for many years and give it to others with whom I have to work. I pick it up occasionally to browse and review the rules. It helps me to write more clearly and to get the message across. I highly recommend it.
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|The player itself is a decent app, and I liked the layout of the music files, as well as the accessibility.  My main complaint is that this is another program that REQUIRES you to be online.  I am one of the apparent few who do not have 24/7 access to a WIFI hotspot.  I wish Amazon would have categories for programs that do/do not need the network.  I had all my music setup to play on a 6hr flight, but never got to use any of it.  If you only use it at home, it is a nice program.
B004J64QSI|4.0|this production is at the highest level that this play could get. what a wonderful difference between this concert and the movie which was terriable. i recomand this concert for all les miserables lovers.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Really a great read and I only have a passing acquaintance with D&D, arcade games, Japanese Anime and 80s pop culture. I'm sure if you are into those things, this book would be even more awesome. Even without being a self proclaimed geek ,I loved this book and found it captivating.

0525478817|5.0|Review from 14 year old girl:  My girlfriend recommended this book, and I'm so glad she did - I couldn't put it down and stayed up too late on my nights.  The story line was great and had me in tears several times.  I am now a huge fan of John Green.  My parents purchased 4 of his other books for me over the summer ... and needless to say, I had some great summer reading at my fingertips.  Our summer assignment was to pick a book from a list of 6 books ... this book was on the list, and I'm glad it was - such a good read!  Recommend this book to ALL ... you won't be disappointed.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love being able to play a free game and it be free. Don't have pay for extras unless you want to.

B00338QENI|5.0|A great read about a woman making history! I have talked with nurses that have done labs using the HeLa cells, so it was interesting to read about how those cells came to be. I highly recommend this book to everyone!!

B00BSZZA3I|5.0|This case it's accually better that i expected, it's very nice and soft and neat when u touch it its really worth buying it.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|This series has everything.  I don't usually write reviews but this show holds my interest.  I did not see the series on tv so I purchased it because I like the action characters. I am not sorry I did. This blu-ray edition contains the blu-ray and regular which I like because some friends do not have a blu ray player.  I did think that the series contained 9 discs of episodes but I was mistaken.  It contains only 4 discs of blu-ray and 5 other, making up 9 discs.  Sorry if I mislead anyone.  I did not see that it contained both editions.  I do love the series.  The acting is great, lots of action, good plots and great characters.  Some romance also.  You won't be sorry if you purchase this set..
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Great game I really enjoyed it and look forward to more levels in both the Pork side and the Bird side.

B00A285OOW|4.0|I JUST LOVE PHILLIPPA GREGORY'S BOOKS. IT MAKES SINCE THAT THINGS WOULD/COULD HAVE HAPPENED THAT WAY IN THOSE LIGHT AND DARK DAYS.
0399226907|5.0|My son is almost 16 month old and he just loves this book. Everyday when I read to him, I pretend to ask him to find the book and he bring me the book with joy. Then we sit together and I starts to read it to him. He flips the pages for me and does not want me to turn the pages. When I get to the pages where the catterpillar eats apples/orages/starawbaey, there is a hole in the middle of the fruits that it eats. He tries to stick his tiny finger into it and delights. At the end where the catterpillar turns into the butterfly, my son wides his hand and mimics that it turned into butterflys. He really enjoys the book very much. I have this book for him almost three month, he still loves it. Its a great book. Its a short book which is good for his age as he has a short attention span.
B00E0SXNE8|4.0|Great movie!!  My kids and I watched it together.  It was funny and entertaining.  We would definitely watch it again.

B00000DGUG|4.0|Alanis Morissette's follow-up to her great success \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" can be an exhausting exercise to get through. With an unusually long playing time of more than 71 minutes, some may feel a bit like a marathon to get through all seventeen tracks. But first and foremost it is the limited number of really strong songs that pulls down a bit on the overall impression.<br /><br />Big ambitions with the album are obviously there and there is experimenting with both odd beats, quirky harmonies and unusual instrumentation. Fortunately there is indeed a handful of really good songs; especially \\"Thank U\\" with its haunting keyboard theme and catchy chorus stand out as one of Morissettes very best songs.<br /><br />Other favorites include \\"UR\\", \\"Unsent\\" and \\"That I Would Be Good\\", which help to lift up the album. The quiet and waltzing \\"Heart of the House\\" certainly also isn't without charm.<br /><br />An interesting but somewhat longwinded album by Morissette from a time when she was still unpredictable and really interesting.
B00275EHJG|5.0|If you're a grown man watching Toy Story 3 and you do not feel emotional at the end, you must absolutely have your head examined.  If there was a career as a shrink for toys, this would definetly be the training video.  What could serve as a bigger trauma than being left behind as your kid grows up.  Well, Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and their merry band of toys handles it well enough.  Meanwhile, PIDXAR has handled this film perfectly.  From animation to acting to the plot...I have no complaints...okay, there's one...I, like Woody, miss Bo Peep.  I would like to take this morning to express my condolences for the death of Jim Varney, aka Slinky Dog, who passed away shortly after Toy Story 2.  Stepping into his...I'm not entirely sure what part of the character is appropriate for this statement...is Blake Clark, coincidentally a friend of Mr. Varney's who keeps our favorite incredibly flexible canine alive and well.  As for Mr. Clark and other new additions to the voice cast, I only have one question...how does PIXAR always get absolutely the right people?  This film was the end of an eara...and the toys went out with a bang.  Is it just me or did we see a lot more of Andy's mom than before?  And when did she become a blond?  Anyway, get this film and a box of tissues and enjoy this fine third and final film in the series.
B000JML90Y|4.0|I have heard this book referenced many times. I finally decided to get myself a copy. Totally worth the read and really got me thinking.
0882847953|5.0|Reed's Syncopation is an endlessly challenging method book. It teaches control of time, feel and dynamics. It is especially useful for drummers who can use the various syncopated figures to play &#34;against&#34; ostinato rhythms.<br /><br />Other musicians can also benefit from the contents of this text. Although percussion notation (e.g. snare drum note heads in the &#34;c&#34;space) is used throughout the book, any player can adapt the figures to their own instrument, e.g. interpreting the rhythms as progressions within a scale or mode.<br /><br />Another aspect of this book is its suitability for all levels of players. Beginners will appreciate its &#34;progressive&#34; difficulty (easy to challenging) and more advanced players will see endless possibilities for rhythmic adventures.<br /><br />Beginners should use this book with a competent teacher, as it is easy to imagine that there is not much going on with each example.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00EU98VVC|4.0|Awesome riffs, Tyr fans, this is a must-have for your library!  Valkyrja may be their best work to date, epic.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Like that's a bad thing.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen reunite to lead our favorite cast of toys into this exciting sequel and they bring back everything we know and love about Woody and Buzz...seemingly without breaking a sweat.  Other iconic characters also return, including Mr. Potato Head, who is not quite off the hook for his false assumptions and subsequent actions from the first film, Ham the piggy bank, who's just as funny and wise-cracking as ever, the ever-loyoal Slinky Dog, the ultimate destruction of a stereotype Rex the timid dinosaur, and many more.  Joining the band are Mrs. Potato Head, Buster the (real-life) dog, Jessie the Yoddling Cowgirl, Bullseye the horse, some green aliens (there were dozens of these guys in the first film...just as a reference) and others.  PIXAR's top-notch animation also returns along with a new gang of voice actors who blend in nicely with the returning ones.  My favorite newcomer is Wayne Knight, who manages to embody the greedy toy store owner who'll do just about anything for a buck...I won't give examples because it'll give too much away.  Joan Cusack shows she can hold her own when she pits her character Jessie against Hanks's and Allen's already established characters.  And Kelsey Grammer, who's been a brilliant voice actor in my book ever since his first appearance as Sideshow Bob on The Simpsons, comes back with a completely different character (Stinky Pete the Prospector), displaying his depth, range, and talent as an actor.  I feel very comfortible saying that, of the Toy Story trilogy, Toy Story 2 is my favorite and I'd give it six stars if I could.  This movie goes above and beyond the bar normally set for sequels and I can only hope that work like this could actually raise that bar.  Anyway, if you've seen Toy Story, this film must be next on your list.  Enjoy.
B005PK553C|5.0|Great series. It worked well on PC. Few lags when viewing. With Amazon Prime it was free! Enjoy the show!
034580404X|3.0|One of the best values that purchased for my wife, didn't have to go out and try to buy individually and keeps the books together in box.
B005UG542S|5.0|I thought this final movie was one of the best of the series. All the actors have been playing their roles for a while and everyone is fairly comfortable in their characters, the book wraps it all up nicely and this final movie is fairly true to J.K. Rowling's book. And perhaps because the movie producers split the last book into two movies it is easier to pull in additional details that you might not have seen if they'd tried to capture the last book inj one movie. The actors who have grown up in their roles do a great job in this last movie. I watched the series on a TV marathon that showed all the movies except the last one, so I had to rent this on on Amazon and watch it to finish the tale.
B0009MAO46|5.0|It should be a Disney Classic...right up there with \\"Snow White\\" and \\"The Lion King\\".  PIXAR proves from the start that they will only produce and release top-notch quality films.  Here, the animation is flawless, the plot is superb, and the characters are the type you just can't help but root for.  Leading the pack is Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, a cowboy doll who is soon in a fierce rivalry with speace ranger action figure Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen.  For two people who were probably only rarely in the same room together during the making of this film, Hanks and Allen play off one another perfectly.  And it was awsome to see two actors known for such different film genres come together like that.  Toy Story earned every one of it's positive reviews, it's awards, and so much more and is a must-add for any movie buff's collection.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I liked the movie, but if I'm honest to myself, it really did have some flaws.  Here's this family seemingly unperturbed, driving in rush hour traffic...and 'all of a sudden' pandomonium is breaking out.  Yet, we heard in a prior scene something on the television about marshal law being invoked [somewhere].  There's a kind of disconnect here that didn't seem real and was confusing.<br /><br />Zombies are in vogue these days, but the notion of anything entering our bodies, virus or otherwise, that can 'transform' us in, what was it, 12 seconds...well, we suspend rationality in scifi and horror that we can descend our imagination into the world being created, but the writers still have to respect 'plausability'.  Still the speed of this 'turning' did add a new dynamic where it acted like a 'wave' that surely would be terrifying if real.  Other than the speed of turning, I didn't see too much new in what is becoming an overused genre, ie 'Seen one, seen them all' kind of thing.  Not to say I still didn't enjoy the movie...almost watched it a second time in fact. Apocalypse movies always make me 'think and wonder'.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Good story, but there never seemed to be any good news in the book.  Two thirds of the way through it got so depressing that I almost put it down.  However, I finished it and was glad I did.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've been playing blitz for only a month and I gotta say that I am totally addicted to the game. I absolutely love bingo blitz. It's the best bingo game bar none.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|the variations of tiles and backgrounds are nice.  i find it annoying that amazon requires a certain length to these reviews.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I enjoyed some aspects of the book. The story was easy to get into and kept me turning the pages. Some of the technological foresight was cool, and the psychological implications for Ender, the main character, were kind of interesting at times. I also found some of the themes thought provoking -- for example, using children as weapons of mass destruction, manipulation, isolation, fear-mongering, etc. and the video game sequences were a welcome breeze of creativity in the midst of prose that often was frankly dull.<br /><br />I just wish a better author had written the story. The constant shifting between narration, dialogue, and internal monologue -- by multiple characters nonetheless -- was often annoying. Card attempts to defend himself from 1st edition critics in his preface that he wanted the book to be accessible to a wide audience and makes a swipe at higher-brow writing. But I think he misses the point. Writing doesn't have to be weak in order for young adults to understand it.<br /><br />Worse than the prose issues though were the problems of characterization. Many of the characters in the Ender's Game had an almost identical voice and personality, making my impression of them simply muddle together. And the characters who do stand out typically do so in an overly simple and extreme way: Peter's malevolence, Bonzo's arrogance, Chamrajnagar's zaniness. I will say though that Valentine, Alai, and Bean weren't too badly constructed.<br /><br />The other main issue I have is that the plot is quite unbalanced and implausible. The battles and strategy at Battle School, while necessary, went through way too many iterations and became quite boring after a while. Yet the end of the book was considerably rushed even though it contained many of the more interesting ideas. The subplot of Peter and Valentine's take-over-the-world-by-pseudonymous-blogging was quite implausible (though I'd admit probably an exciting concept for a 12 year old reader) and was poorly developed at that.<br /><br />In my opinion, Ender's Game is a decent sci-fi novel for an adolescent. There is too much good science fiction out there to recommend it to anyone else though.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this game keeps you on your toes. it is every thing I love about hidden object games while also having a fun story line. You can accomplish a lot without having to spend real money. this game has several different modes in which to find objects so its always something different. Definitely a worth while app. :) :) :)
0375869026|5.0|I love books like this.  It makes you laugh a little, cry littler, but in the end, makes you want to be a better person for reading it.  I can't wait for my kids to read this book.
B0063IH60K|3.0|there's not a lot you can do to solitaire to make it different, so this is just exactly what you'd expect.
B00902UH5M|3.0|Not a bad book by any means but nothing terribly special either. More space is dedicated to the intricacies of body-building (who cares?) and politics (who cares as well?) than to the movie making side of Arnold's career. Some of the points he tries to make, like the fact that his affair with Briggite Nielsen \\"underlined\\" his desire to marry Maria Shriver (who he was already living with), will leave your eyes rolling.<br />Throughout the years much has been written about Arnold's darker side but the book only deals with those cases he couldn't possibly avoid, thus naming it \\"Total Recall\\" is truly a stretch. Then again, the book was written by his biggest fan which, rather evidently, is Arnold himself.
B000XT1P3E|5.0|My wife and I like both these movies and glad that it is two separate discs as opposed to one movie on one side and the other movie on the other.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I'm giving it 5 Stars because its is a 5 star movie and I don't want to see it receive a bad rating because of product issues.  Great movie, cast, and story.  I don't like spoilers but if you love Star Trek and are open minded to the franchise evolving with being handed to a new storyteller then this should be right up your alley.<br /><br />Okay so the product gets 2 to 3 Stars in my book.  The extras for the 2009 Star Trek film are way more abundant &, most importantly, elucidating.  The package for Into Darkness underwhelms.  Disappointingly so.  It's a 3 disc package.  You should get 1, the movie with great commentaries, 2, a digital copy portable into iTunes etc, and, 3, over 2 hours of behind the scenes content.  This third area can include deleted scenes but it should greatly expand on how the movie was put together.  Give you a great perspective on the end-to-end production.<br /><br />Word on the street is every different package has different extras.  This is a major \\"Boo!\\".  If you buy the flagship package, you should be denied nothing.  (Period.).<br /><br />~mc
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The way that he explores all the different family relations and how truly small our world is was wonderful. The fact that he started  such a detailed story from a simple image of a Radio Flyer wagon on a dirt road in Afghanistan is why Hosseini will  continue to give us stories that fill us completely while we read them.

B0055EDCGU|4.0|I first heard of Trivium years ago.  I owned a copy of Ascendancy and thought it was pretty good, but never really hit it off with their brand of music.  I knew they were still active in music, but they were always just kind of there.<br /><br />Fast forward, I heard a bit of In Waves from some friends and decided to give it an extended preview.  I liked it. It was a fine piece of Metal Core and worth ownership. I found it in the Amazon marketplace for a penny plus $3.99 shipping.  For $4 it was worth it to me to check out.<br /><br />I have enjoyed this CD for about six months now. I have several songs in multiple playlists I listen to while running or working out. However, I discovered I did not have the extended version. I had the plain old version, version.  There is an addition of this CD out there with extra songs on it I wish I had known about. From listening, there are some strong songs on the expanded addition that could push this CD up to five stars.<br /><br />I give it four stars due to some songs being a little mundane.  The title track and Forsake not the Dream are the best tracks with Dusk Dismantled and Skyline Severance being strong four star tracks.  It is worth the listen, but I would recommend looking for the expanded version to get the most bang for the buck.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is great fro those who love ninja Turtles.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Since I get tired of playing the same old games this at least makes a pleasent diversion. Does tend to suck the life out of the battery though, overall good solid entertainment.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is a fantastic app. I open it each day when I have the time. It shows you a brief overview of all stories, on which you cna click and read or watch the details on what's happening. You can also customize which categories you'd like to see by default (World, Technology, etc.). And, no advertisements in this app, which makes the whole experience more pleasant. Thanks BBC!
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|Both of my three year olds love this app! I would love to see the other Duplo apps available on kindle.  My godson has the a zoo app as well as on his tablet but there is not a kindle version yet.<br /><br />The graphics are great, easy for kids to figure out on their own, because of all the different choices you can make to build your train kids keep wanting to play again and again.  If you get a passenger car ur train stops at the train station. Or if u get a flat bed, you can pick things to carry like a motor cycle or a lions cage.  After making ur train u go through different activities.<br />Best of all it is free!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the most addictive series I have ever watched. If my time allowed, I would watch the entire season in one sitting. Love it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The dramatic ending leaves you very impatient for the next episode to begin; a widower with a child and a widow with an infant--hmmm...
B00ACBN9CI|1.0|Although the app seems to work and the plane flies and fires, I don't find the overall experience worthwhile. I don't feel like a strike fighter playing this game.
1857885082|3.0|Watching the English is an insider's view on the English. It dissects elements of English life and explains the parts.  Parts, that I am sure, most English take for granted. The book has prompted me to look at my own actions within the context of social interaction - examining my own behavioral quirks, and habits. Kate approaches her study armed with the tools of anthropology to decode the strange English culture, governed by complex unspoken rules and Byzantine behavioral norms. A fun read - but tends towards the academic in parts.
6301599977|5.0|If you haven't seen or at least heard of this flick I'll give you a brief recap because this movie is worth seeing over and over and etc. Boy has want to be baseball playing father who wants his son to follow in his foot steps. Son rebels and leaves home. Son marries and becomes a corn growing farmer in Iowa who hears those now famous words : &#34;If you build it he will come!&#34; So he tears up part of his corn field and builds a baseball field, stands and all. At first only he and family can see the ghost baseball players. One of the ghosts has another message for him and the adventure begins. This excellent film is for everyone who likes baseball, ghosts and a good mystery. It is a haunting good flick. Watch it!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy and Simple setup.  Great streaming of Netflix and Youtube.  Very impressed with the quality of the stream and ease of use.
B00D4K8SBQ|1.0|The product is only for iPad I thought it works with iPhone too but it is not . Also I don't know how return it.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I love it on my iphone, but i've installed it on my cruz tablet and can not get it to link to my facebook account, i cantw find anywhere to try to get any answers, i loved it, but now I'm disappointed!
B003ZMF26W|4.0|This is a great mouse, very precise and very customizable but the only problem is about the z-axis issue, the mouse is very sensitive to the vibrations, at first i was going to get the mouse RMA'd because i couldn´t even use it, it starts moving itself can´t double click correctly then I saw that it was the vibrations of the desk because of the speakers so i shut off the speakers and everything was fine but typing or everything that move the desk and the pointer its getting wild, is a little problem for me cause i´m used to a claw grip but now i have the get a firm grip  so when clicking the pointer stays still but besides that is an excellent mouse and very comfortable.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|For me this app is completely useless!!! Why doesn't it download and work like any other app?? I just want to use it like any other, and I can't.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is an entertaining soap opera based on a British house with nearly everybody having some part in the intrigue. It begins before WW I and runs ( well we haven't seen the end of the 3rd season yet.)  Probably catches our attention because (though not royalty) we have family or friends in very nearly the same situation as each character.
B00BY9GQHM|1.0|I was hoping that the game would not be so boring after I was moving my way from HO screen to HO screen...but I was soooooo wrong. Disappointing and did I say boring????????
B00CZF8B68|5.0|This song....  makes me.... (dare I say it?)....  HAPPY!  Took the grandkids to see the movie, and came away with this gift for myself.  :)
0143039881|1.0|Hannah Arendt is just echoing and repeating the usual holocaust stories. The real genocide/holocaust happened in the conquered countries in the east by the securitiy-squads.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I am loving it! My favorite show! I can watch the same episodes multiple times and never tired of it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I live in a small town &amp; most weather reports only show the largest town nearest to me. That town is @ least 10&deg; warmer &amp; they don't get anywhere near the storms &amp; allergens we get here. TWC has always been 99-100% accurate with our temp, storm warnings &amp; pollen alerts.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is a character-driven show, with a season-long story arc. Yes, the special effects are fascinating and gross. It's really more drama than action-oriented, though. And I am SO glad I got the DVD to watch them marathon-style instead of waiting week by week-- addictive entertainment.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Better than I thought it would be ! She has a style that is fun to fance to and ok sing only when I am alone !
B00973902K|4.0|So, sometimes in life you end up purchasing things for other people in your home - this song was one of those purchases.  Not exactly my type of music, but someone (points at the female member of the family) can't get enough of this type of music and other dance like songs - so I'll review it based off my thoughts and hers.<br /><br />The beat of the music is actually very fun and energetic.  Honestly, anything that can keep you moving and enjoying yourself while out on the dance floor or cleaning the house has got my vote.  And while I don't know much about Carly Rae Jepsen, she has a very nice voice in this song.  Too many music artists these days try to disguise their voices with weird synthesizers, but Ms Jepsen has a very sweet and unique song to her, when combined with the fast paced beat, really seems to work.<br /><br />Which leads me to the message in the song &#34;here's my number, so call me maybe...&#34;  What a fun song to play at a night club.  Girls and guys go through a constant battle of getting, giving, and asking for numbers in hopes of finding Mr/Ms Right (or at least Right Now).  I can only imagine that plenty of evenings were spent wondering if that guy you gave your number to would ever call - and this song kind of says it all - &#34;so call me maybe...&#34;  Not too desperate, not too clingy, not too worried if the person every calls or not.  Seems like a nice girl and one that would likely warrant a call back (but remember boys, not right away, so you don't scare them off either).<br /><br />Overall - a fun song, with catchy lyrics (and a bit of sage advice), a good beat, and sweat vocals.  Give the sample a spin and see if it does it for you too.
0930289528|5.0|this is my favorite graphic novel. The movie is good but does not do the novel justice. A hero for freedom lovers
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very enjoyable read.  Couldn't put it down. Great expansion of the story line original book, characters interrelationships were well enhanced.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|I really like this app because the fish eats other fish and goes down and down to dark abis I really like<br />it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have been meaning to read this trilogy for a few years, so finally downloaded it when we went on vacation for 2 weeks.  I wanted to read it the entire time, to heck with the scenery!!  Great read!
B00BDAP66E|2.0|I just can't figure out what this is even used for. I hate to act/sound/look like a real dummy, but what is it really?
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A real page-turner, absolutely worth reading. Reacher is the ultimate dark knight, an unwilling hero who is not afraid to stand up to whoever steps on his toes. A modern-day errand knight.
B00CFA227C|5.0|Wonderful action & characters. Can't blink your eyes during this one. Great script & impressive list of actors. Clever ending.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son actually told me to try this game and at first I said no........what was I thinking?????? this game is awesome
0446580848|2.0|Mr. Nelson DeMille is my favorite author, however his latest book The Panther does not raise to the same level of amusement, fun, adventure and entertain as his past works.  There were few surprises and nothing that shocked me as a read of his previous books I encountered no new revelations of a continued story-line.<br /><br />John Corey is usually a sarcastic, egotistical, narcissistic, amusing, intelligent but conceited smart ass.  John's character in The Panther was not as out-going or as take charge as he had been in the past, I very much missed his sarcasm and smart ass attitude.  I felt the book was rushed and not a well thought through or written as DeMille's readers are accustomed too.<br /><br />Do not waste your money, maybe his next effort will be an improvement!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a great game. I've played so many of these games that it is now difficult to find one like this. The details are awesome, the storyline is fun, I have a hard time putting it down. I love that it g8 we great hints. If I get stuck at a spot I don't have to search for a walkthrough. Keep them coming!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The book was well written, kept my interest from beginning to end. I enjoyed the characters and mystery of the book.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|What can possibly be said about this??  LOVE.  If you love what Robert Redford did with Gatsby, you won't be disappointed with Leo.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I really like it. Much better than the stock keyboard on my HTC One. Definitely worth 4 bucks. Give it a try.
0345535421|5.0|I'm only about 1/2 way through the book so far, but it's really good and I can't wait to finish it to get to the 3rd book in the series.
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game is a fabulous read for any reader.  I don't consider myself a sci fi enthusist, though I enjoy Star Wars and Star Trek in normal quantities.  Nor am I a voracious reader.  I probably read about 1 book per month.  Enders Game is a thinker's story and conveys the disorientation of space in a way I could not have imagined from prose.
0761169253|5.0|I am an artist, have been for quite a while.  At my mature age this book makes so much sense, and reaffirms all I believe to be true, about the creative art world and creativity in life itself!  Sure there are many things in the book you may already know, but it is great to reread things and remind yourself about important things to consider when creating your work or ideas.  I find that I am constantly opening my eyes to what other creative people are doing in so many mediums.  These creative ideas become an inspiration and spring board for my creative interpretations and expressions.  I teach art also, I am constantly promoting this premise Steal Like An Artist!!! because my students are always so impressed with my creative thoughts and productions.  I have bought and given this book to many people that are in a creative field of work, including my younger son.  At first he kind of scoffed at the book and said he knew all it had to offer.  Since time has passed he realizes the truth of what this book promotes and has applied it to his own creative work.  He is constantly telling me that Steal Like an Artist is the way to expand your creative imagination to its fullest and rewarding potential, in whatever your passion is in life.
B00ET7EON4|4.0|They listened to their parents' albums and got it! It's refreshing to know there are legit songwriters today who can teach the new generation of music lovers how it's done!
B0071XO8RA|1.0|This writing is VIVID.  Reading this book, I felt like I was living in the silo.  These people are amazingly real.<br /><br />And they are dreadfully boring.<br /><br />This is a book that would make a story about a modern American living in Suburbia feel like an action adventure story.<br /><br />If all you care about is convincing characters, this book is for you.  If you like stories where something happens, look elsewhere.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have the unit but I was it was better, keeps freezing up on my.<br />I may need to get closer so it will work. but you would think you can sit away where but I guess not
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I would advise anyone having trouble with a non Amazon micro USB to try this cable.<br />I thought the Kindle was the problem. no it was the other plug  (pin alignment bent<br />pin strip ect)
B0036S4B6M|4.0|It was easy reading and was glad there was not much violence in it.  Informative about life in a women's prision.  Thought that Piper was either very naive or not smart to get involved with such people that led her into trouble.  Was touched that she realized one of her biggest punishments for her actions was seeing what it was doing to her Mother, friends, and her boyfriend.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|What a great show! Despite having seen advertisements and popularity of this show, I am just now learning of what I've missed all of these years.  I absolutely love this series. The producer's and writer's know how to balance the seriousness of trauma, and teamwork in medicine, and the interaction of the characters.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|So easy to use! No need for any instructions for my use. Maybe for others who do more complicated math. Simple.
B000002KHF|5.0|had the album since I was in high school.  Love it!  Disc shipped quickly and secure.  Sounds Great too both on home system and in the car.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Es una novela fantástica.como no aparecen en estos tiempos.me gustó todo; El Amor , la perseverancia de sus personajes. La intriga. El respeto hacia los demás , los inolvidables secretos. La vida y la esperanza de un hombre que pese a todas las penurias que pasó nunca se dio por vencido. Fabulosa novela.<br />La recomiendo a todos.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I like the way Picoult writes, giving you both sides of an important social issue, leaving you to decide what you would do in a similar situation. This book is one you can't put down until<br />it's finished.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Opened up a whole new state of thinking and perspective on heaven and life after death. I was on the fence, this book helped me make a major decision.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast does not work with the Gateway supplied by ATT for their U-Verse DSL service. The Gateway is a Motorola VNG510.<br /><br />Chromecast requires a wireless router that supports UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) to make the wireless connection. The Motorola VNG510 does not support this feature for security reasons.<br /><br />Only way a Chromecast will work is to go into the Gateway's set up and disable wireless security. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.<br /><br />Google, please update the Chromecast firmware to allow it to connect to a wireless network using the normal SSID and PASSWORD protocol.

B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Even though it downloaded to my Kindle, I still can't download the document. Well off to my desk top. Thanks for listening.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|For any geek who grew up reading or watching scifi, playing computer games and listening to rock in the 80s.
B0000X61UU|5.0|This is a great overall workout. It will be challenging at first because it is very much a good system. Expect to limp and ache, but stick with it and you won't be sorry! I use this video Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with rollerskating as my between times cardio. I noticed a body change surprisingly early in the process.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is an amazing site, it has pretty much everything. From. fashion to cool tattoos and helpful life tricks. WARNING YOU MAY BECOME HIGHLY ADDICTED TO THIS!!!!!
B005LAIIN0|3.0|I realize that making a movie from the book was a very difficult job. Although the movie is nothing like the book it was still semi entertaining.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|A glorified pedometer with a heart rate monitor built in. The Bluetooth stopped working on the first day and sent back for a refund.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I recieved my gaming system in brand new condition. Exactly as I ordered it. Did not take to long to recieve.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed it. I could have done with less of the fighting. But it,s a good book.  I'll read the next one.
6305744793|5.0|this goes back to when I was a child, the remake is just as funny, got this one for my Grand daughter and she loves it, would highly recommend purchasing from this Seller, got it quickly and in excellent condition!!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Really recommend reading these series in order. Book Two has most of the same strengths and challenges of Book One.  That is, there are interesting families that you care about; these families are involved in many of the key events of the century.  While the interactions and involvement of these families requires a large dose of 'suspension of disbelief,'  it generally works without feeling too forced.  While I wouldn't recommend it to high school students due to some graphic scenes, It is a way to review (learn?) about many historical events told in a very historically correct manner.  While presenting and personalizing all the major movements of the century (Nazism, Socialism, Capitalism, Republics), the Socialists tend to come off as the most sympathetic if not most effective. This perspective might bother some readers as would the depiction of the Americans as reluctant leaders of the era.  Overall a great follow up to Book One.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The depth of the characters was amazing.    Now I need to get Michael Connelly's other books!  I give it 5 stars!
B0045XKJBI|4.0|......I felt compelled to watch them all to see what the hubbabaloo is about. Yeah, ok. It's Twilight. For what it is it is an ok movie. On one hand I'm glad I watched it. On the other hand, I really could have done without it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The past just keeps coming back to Eva and Gideon but they are determined to work through and make it. Secrets are revealed, relationships tested, etc.... can't wait for the next book
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just as advertised. Limited in its capabilities but still useful. If you were looking for something to beam or mirror from your phone this isn't it. For the average user this will be magic!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|The movie was good the only thing I can say it would be nice if brad got a mature hair cut. Boyish cuts on a man near 50 do not look right. He looks conflicted.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|We were bored and looking for something to watch. After choosing this we were hooked. We've watched all three seasons available. Thank goodness they just signed for season four.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Great game with enough variety and hints to keep it interesting.  The back and forth got a bit much at times, but the map helped. Loved playing a p&amp;c game that didn't rely on ghosts, magic and murder for its storyline.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Fabulous, fantastic and absolutely life changing.  Sit down, hold on an prepare to live the rest of your life on your terms. As l
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app works great for me! No problems with the app at all. I use it on a regular basis!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really liked being able to tap on inventory items and tap where they belong, so many games you have to drag the item repeatedly before it sticks. I loved miles the monkey<br />The map was ok.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Totally worth it it is the best game on my kindle but can use updates to get the same stuff from the computer buy it now really.......
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoying this. love having something a little new and different. The Escape game gets a bit more challenging on each level.
B00F35BV64|3.0|the original Wrath of Khan was much better. It is still the best of the Star Trek series. Ricardo Montalban was a far superior Khan and the character interplay was far superior to this movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have used this app to wile away the bits of wasted time in lines and waiting rooms. It is challenging enough that I occasionally look up tips on YouTube for half the  levels.<br />I did feel really sad that I lost all my progress and purchased items  when my device crashed...so as  that I don't know if can invest that much of my life in a game anymore
B009LQKHIO|3.0|This was the first book ive read by Jill Sanders and while I like the concept of starting over, which is why I choose this book, I personally don't like as much detail about their intimate encounters.  The ending seemed a bit rushed and predictable.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|First time using it I fell asleep so fast I couldn't believe how refreshed I was when I woke up. You can mix your own melodies, it's great. I did notice a deeper sleep than most sleeps I usually have.<br />Great app.<br />I just purchased their other tunes and can't wait to try.<br />Def recommend.
B000F2C7TU|4.0|Love Hunter is a good album.  Not my favorite, but good solid rock.  I can listen to every song on the album and not skip any because they suck.  If you are a true blue Whitesnake fan, I recommend it for your collection.  David Coverdale's voice was so awesome in the 70s.  Total sexy rock and roll/bluesy sound.  I could listen to him sing all day.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I love the way Baldacci writes and the stories he created. His detailed style of writing and his stories Keep me coming back for more. I always feel like I have learned something new and having traveled the US I can relate to his story locations which help me visualize the story even more.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I just downloaded the Pinterest app onto my Kindle Fire and Galaxy SIII.  My big issue is that it often doesn't work right for pinning.  When I hit the &#34;Pin It&#34; button, about 40% of the time my folders don't show in the dropdown menu which means I can't pin posts.  It also freezes up quite a bit and I can never tell if my home feed of posts is up to date or not.  All that said it hasn't stopped me from playing on Pinterest for hours on both of my devices, but I do get irritated on a regular basis.  But as this is the only Pinterest app for Android I guess I have to live with it until the improve it.<br /><br />Afterthought - my issues with the &#34;Pin It&#34; functionality occur both when I am on my home wireless network as well as when I am using &#34;data&#34; on my phone.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|I love all the BBC documentaries and have seen most of them!  I can't believe people are rating this so poorly!<br /><br />David Attenborough is great but Oprah also does a very fine job narrating.  Because Oprah is so well-known in North America, I think it will attract many more Americans to watch this series, particularly those who wouldn't ordinarily watch a documentary.  I think Attenborough is of course a better naturalist, but I think Oprah would be easier for young children to listen to...if we can get more people, especially children, to see these masterful documentaries, the world will be a better place!<br /><br />The style of documentary is also more approachable for children and for those who don't ordinarily watch nature documentaries:  each segment is short, and can be watched in brief segments.  \<br /><br />Finally, the camera work itself is unbelievably good, and deserves 5 stars just for that!
B000K2Q5X4|5.0|At first listen, I wasn't terribly impressed.  After about the 3rd or 4th time through, I grew to love it.  It's basic, solid rock and roll.  Wine, Women and Song is my favorite on the album, but all songs are good.  I don't have to skip any of them.  The bonus tracks are average, not great.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Waited quite a while to get the item and I am somewhat disapointed. It only supports netflix, chrome, and youtube. I thought it would be more flexible. Another thing that annoyed me was once I got it set up and working the video/audio did not match and I didn't want to change to a lower resolution. After I took the unit out of the TV and tried watching some videos I recorded from dish I wouldn't allow me to. Said something about HDCP.<br /><br />I guess for netflix subscribers it would be ok but a lot of work needs to be done.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|How do you say farewell to an epic fan-favorite show?  That is a question the producers of the SPARTACUS series have probably been dwelling upon for a while now.  WAR OF THE DAMNED is the third and final season of this blood-soaked drama, and it does not disappoint.  Chocked full of battles, blood, and brutality, this is one show that I am very sad to see end.<br /><br />This series is truly impressive on many levels.  It is visually amazing, the bloodshed and gore are superb, the drama is intense, and the acting is top notch.  But the storyline never gets stale, either.  It moves at rapid pace, but not so fast as to lose the audience.  The result is an amazing show that is as engrossing as it is vicious.<br /><br />As with its predecessors, SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED is shot well and looks stunning onscreen.  The historical backdrops are vivid and set the stage for a realistic journey back in time.  This allows for full immersion into Spartacus' world, and thus grants a rich entertainment experience.<br /><br />Liam McIntyre once again does a perfect job with the role of Spartacus, and he is surrounded by a stellar cast.  I am happy to see McIntyre finish out the role that Andy Whitfield started; McIntyre does the deceased actor a great honor by flourishing in the Spartacus mantle.  I would wager that Whitfield would be pleased.<br /><br />SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED is a definite win for me, although I am sad to acknowledge it is the final season of this blockbuster show.  If you are not watching the series already, do yourself a favor and pick them all up for a good week's worth of binge-watching.  And be sure to check them out on Blu-ray...the HD picture is stunning.  All seasons are available now, so give them a look.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book--it keeps your attention and the characters are  interesting. Fast read but well done! Must read!
B000F3T7R4|5.0|Of all the Whitesnake albums produced thus far, Trouble is #2 on my list.  Ready and Willing being #1.  It's a great album.  All tracks are listenable. I don't skip any of them.  The bonus tracks are the EP Snakebite, which is also a great album.  So glad they added them to this CD.  The Snakebite tracks are better than the Trouble tracks, in my opinion.  I prefer the early Whitesnake bluesy sound over their more commercial 80s stuff.  David Coverdale's voice is at it's prime on their early albums too.  I highly recommend this one for any true blue Whitesnake fan.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I searched for a really long time for a camera bag that would hold my DSLR and all of my lenses. Many of the other backpack bags were pointless for me because no matter big they appeared to be, once you opened them, there wasn't much room at all. This bag is more than enough room for me and all of my lenses. Not to mention that this bag is WAY cheaper than the other bags that I was looking at. I use a Nikon D600 and then carry anywhere from 3-5 lenses with me, an external flash, a light meter, SD cards, batteries, etc. This bag has so much more room after storing all of my items; couldn't be happier!
B008469DGY|4.0|This game reminded me of why I don't play golf. It can be frustrating to hit that perfect shot. But I have to admit I enjoy playing. Worth the 99 cents.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A great read. Can't put it down. Love the way the stories are woven together into a nail biter! Thanks!
B000K2Q5XE|4.0|Saints & Sinners is a good album.  Not my favorite, but good solid rock.  I can listen to every song on the album and not skip any because they suck.  If you are a true blue Whitesnake fan, I recommend it for your collection.
B000FCK65W|2.0|I read reviews and saw this book on recommended booklists for decades, so finally decided to enjoy the story.  I'm sure that someone who grew up in NYC, or in this time period, could relate to the characters' struggles and successes; I did not.  The main character was whinny and, like most children, self-centered.  Hopefully, she grew up and escaped her unhappy circumstances, but the book did not hold my interest long enough for me to find out.
076531178X|5.0|I really enjoyed the final three books that Sanderson co-authored for the Wheel of Time series and decided to pick up one of his original novels.  In a nut shell, I was very impressed with the first Mist Born book.<br /><br />Sanderson creates an elaborate world that makes for a very unique fantasy novel.  The system of magic is very interesting and the mythology behind the story's nemesis, the Lord Ruller, is pretty awesome.  The plot, while seemingly simple in the first quarter of the book, becomes much more complicated and elaborate as the story unfolds.  The book has a very quick pace... Sanderson does a very good job jumping back in forth between characters and gives the reader an opportunity to see the \\"action\\" from several different view points.<br /><br />I would recommend this book.  Sanderson creates a very unique world that makes for a fun read and ends with a satisfying conclusion.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's not a bad game but it isn't necessarily an exciting game either.  I downloaded it because it was free but I probably will delete it soon because everything in the store (and horses) are too costly.  Earning money is a slow process and I refuse to pay real money to gain gems or coins.
B0078ZTWP4|3.0|I bought this for video light but I found outdoors it's not as powerful as it adertises.<br /><br />for camping or walking around in the dark, it's got plenty of light =)
B0022Y570K|5.0|I first saw them when they opened for Metallica on the Death Magnetic tour and was immediately impressed with their unique sound.
0765316889|3.0|As big of a fan as I am of Brian Sanderson and the first Mist Born book, I found well of Ascension somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />Sanderson seems to loose his way a little bit with this novel.  While Well of Ascension is not a bad story, it is extremely slow to develop... I found the first half or so of the book to be somewhat tedious.  The main characters are faced with several internal conflicts that I found to be very frustrating and in some cases did not make much sense.<br /><br />The story ends with a satisfying conclusion; however, it is very slow getting there.  All in all, I would rate Well of Ascension as an \\"ok\\" fantasy novel that was not quite on par with the first book.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|I have been a fan of Mike Portnoy because of Dream Theater and Billy Sheehan since the DLR and Mr. Big days. I did not know much about Richie Kotzen since I stopped following Mr. Big after Paul Gilbert's exit. But Winery Dogs rawks! I love the timing and tightness this band pulls off. Each member a veteran musician in their own right. Mike Portnoy is even subdued a bit. :-)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Loved the app.  Very very challenging. Very exciting, keeps you on the edge.  Would recommend this app to anyone that want competition.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I am really annoyed with the constant attempts to get me to purchase other games, link in with social media and become \\"friends\\" with others to go further. If You don't mind this, then the game is good for you.
0316044695|5.0|I thought this was an amazing story and a very good read.<br /><br />Lone Survivor details the events of Operation Red Wing, where a US Navy Seals team came under attack by an insurmountable Taliban force in Afghanistan.  While a very sad story, Lone Survivor details Marcus Luttrell's amazing tale of survival deep within enemy territory.<br /><br />I would highly recommend.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|This is the best movie that i have seen in a long time at first i thought it would be a movie about people robbing a bank but its soo much more i dont want to spoil it so just watch it im glad i did
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled on this book, as a recommendation from Amazon. I figured, for a few bucks, its worth a shot. I bought the book, and it sat on my Kindle as I read other books. One day, after finishing something else.. I saw this and thought I would give it a shot. At the start, I was apprehensive about it and not sure if this was the book for me (I love post apoc/end of the world books). Next thing you know, I could not put it down. I read this book in 2 days, and barely got anything else done. I just grabbed up Shift and Dust, as I know I will enjoy them.<br /><br />Hugh has a very easy to read cadence to his writing, and the style mixes action packed with plot twists and great character development. I am sure this review will get buried among much better reviews, but I will add my 5 stars to the mix. More importantly, I will be spreading the word to my friends and family who enjoy this style of book. I am sure it will be a hit with them as well.<br /><br />Good job Hugh, and thanks for getting me hooked. I have a habit of finding an author, and reading everything they've ever written. Welcome to my short list club!
B00A285OOW|2.0|I felt that the author made this queen Elizabeth a wuss.. Her mother Elizabeth and grandmother Jaquetta were more of the daughters of Melusina  and fought harder to keep their family safe using their gifts from Melusina.  Elizabeth was just stepped on  by the king and his mother. It was very hard for me to accept this.The author just dwells on the same topics. I found myself flipping thru 5&6 pages at a time to find that it was still on the same topic..
B00D3LA5WG|2.0|With all the mystique of  &#34;Mississippi River&#34; life,m I felt they missed many opportunities to develop any or several potential dramas.  In stead they tended to overfill the hopper and never fully engage the conflicts.  Certainly felt the actors were capable of the extremes of this area of life.  Bright note is the two young actors and their input on the screen.  Too bad the writer did not offer the same levels to the adults.
B008UWEFU6|4.0|wanted more after first book. the second book so far is saying enough already! lol. but i shall see huh
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I was just not my taste. I am sure it was a good movie for some and other loved it, it was simply not my cup of tea.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I liked Charlie. The story made me care about him. The abuses he suffered got me riled up and also a bit guilty - did I ever treat anybody like that? This is a classic that can appeal to a wide audience. I read it when I was a kid, without understanding all of it, and I have read it as an older adult when the meanings are clear, but I enjoyed all of it. I particularly enjoyed Charlie in the \\"before\\" stage of his intellectual development. I enjoyed the rise of his intelligence, but I liked less his irascibility at the peak of his intelligence. I don't agree that people with high intelligence are necessarily tormented. This book gets the 5 star rating because it is a poignant story, captures my attention throughout, and introduces large questions about life.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this series.  I am currently on the fourth book and can hardly put it down.  It only took a few pages for this book to have me hooked.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was my second reading of a book by the author and I enjoy the author's style. The  kept you story kept me engaged throughout and all the characters were sympathetic:  not definite good guys or bad guys - just flawed human beings.  The ending was surprising and probably unrealistic, yet satisfying.  I liked it.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Not the best Die Hard movie but it was still good. I was so anxious watching it. I thought with his son in the picture that they may kill off John. I liked it and so did the husband!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun and interesting. Love it. Keep me very busy for long periods of time. I really love the completion of the game.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is clear and easy to read.  Too bad it didn't come before my diagnosis.  I just cannot imagine anyone continuing on the path of health destruction knowing the inevitable end.  Change now and take control.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Awesome!!!! Exactly what I hoped for with getting this anthology. Thanks for the speedy process. Have a good one. Bye
0140544518|5.0|Scieszka has a way with turning old stories new again. My son loved the twist, and we always have a good time reading any of his stories.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Based on what I read in mktg matls, I expected to be able to use this device to view Amazon Prime movies.  I may have made a small leap in expecting this, however, it said selected content viewable on Chrome on your PC.  Oh well, it works just fine for Netflix (which I was able to try it on with my son's account.  I just ended up feeling a little mislead.  I would encourage Google to make it work with Amazon Prime movies.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Would zombies have formed zombie-ladders to scale walls? Would they have run faster than most joggers I see? Don't know, but it should made for an interesting movie. I'm looking forward to the next installment...<br /><br />Update: by the way, this is not the gory, bloody-guts sort of Zombie movie, but the behaviour of the Zombies in this movie does make one flinch at times when one realizes just what it would be like to go through this sort of event. At my age I couldn't run fast enough...
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Super quality. Greek subs not available. The movie in general was amazing in HD. If you don't mind about the subs you should have it. the package contains also a digital buck up.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|Absolutely terrible! I think 1 star might be too generous. It locked up my phone, was &#34;synching&#34; my contacts for an entire day, never would open up. Was frustrated during multiple attempts to try to remove the app from my brand new Droid Max. Would never recommend this app or ever try it out again.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|What a magnificent DVD this is! Hugh Jackman and all the actors for that matter were exceptional in this production of one of my favorite plays. The richness of this production is unrivaled. The disc quality is excellent and I am truly spoiled by the Blu-ray player on my big screen LED, LCD Viera Panasonic TV which I also purchased on Amazon.<br />Thanks for a great viewing experience.<br />M. Dowling.
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|Stop reading reviews and get yourself this book. And then, receive a hug from this slow-carber. I hope you enjoy life hacking as much as I did.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Order was processed very quickly - initially they said shipment in 7-10 days, but they shipped it the day after I ordered! Packaging is very simple, easy-to-follow directions are printed right on the inside of the box when you open it. It is truly plug and play -  just follow the directions and you'll be up and running in 5 minutes. Just watched a TV episode on Netflix, excellent picture quality, no lag time or stuttering, really awesome to be able to control everything directly from my phone (I have a Galaxy S4)!
1781162646|4.0|Not was I was expecting from Stephen King (although I'm not sure this is a bad thing). I would regard this as more of a coming of age novel (akin to _The Body_) rather than a &#34;thriller.&#34; I can't say it was a spectacular read, but I did enjoy it.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|A terrific video -- great characters and the picture was fantastic -- I am having trouble with the background music overpowering the vocal portion and may try my ear buds or order speakers as someone said that might even it out.  Overall, I was extremely pleased with Matilda.
B0016BWACI|5.0|Just as great as I remembered it as a kid. This is a must have in my collection of all time favs.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|This is a very intuitive app.  I am hoping more people begin using it.  It is nice to know the traffic ahead of you.  If gives the time of the report which is great.  You can get what is ahead as well as what is around you in case you might be thinking of detouring.
B005K17RU0|3.0|we found the accuracy to be only fair,  the app stated rain on a certain day and we had no rain.
045122499X|5.0|it was in good shape when i received it - just as they said. I'm enjoying reading it right now!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I'm a techy guy so I was impressed with how the Chromecast device found the wifi using an app.  That being said, you need to install software on your computer/phone in order to get it setup and it took a few attempts for it to all get setup correctly.  The streaming quality is good when the signal is strong, but quickly degrades if not.  My biggest gripe is with how they chose to implement the casting software in Chrome.  It's a little wonky and only streams certain things (like NetFlix and YouTube) but sometimes the controls are weird and so if you navigate away from the page you're watching it can be hard to regain control of the streaming video.  I wish I had a more traditional &#34;remote control like interface&#34;.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|I can't play after paying $9 because it won't download or install on my kindle fire HD.I never seen anything download so slow despite 4g speed.It looks great from the pictures and sounds great from the reviews.I think the guy should have had a women as a partner it would have been an even better game I can't play.
B0009UC81A|5.0|I saw The Blues Brothers at the theatre when it was first released in 1980 and ever since then, I watch it at least twice a year.  Once just for fun, and again when I'm feeling down and out and need a pick me up!  True, I always experience a twinge of sadness over the untimely and tragic death of the great John Belushi, but what a wonderful legacy he left us!  This nearly two and a half hour film flies by!  There is never a dull moment as Jake and Elwood, on their mission from God, attempt to raise the money to pay the delinquent taxes on the Catholic orphanage where they were raised.  The musical numbers define the film.  The Blues Brothers themselves, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway and James Brown bring such joy, energy and humor to the film.  I have yet to meet a person from my generation who does not love this terrific movie. It seems that everyone has a favorite musical number, too.  Mine is Aretha Franklin's 1968 hit single \\"Think\\" peformed in her greasy spoon diner in the inner city of Chicago as she tries to persuade her husband not to let the Blues Brothers (\\"his hoodlum friends\\") drag him off and rejoin their band.  If, by some strange chance, you've never seen The Blues Brothers, do yourself a favor and buy it.  It's a hysterical, musically brilliant classic as well as a wonderful testament to Belushi.
B00F35BV64|4.0|i am a Star Trek fan for ever. Looking forward to the next Star Trek film. The new generation Star Trek film are Exciting.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game it is so fun it's just like the movie and u get to fly in a balloon it's so fun buy it buy it buy BUY IT
1455508977|5.0|Another amazing love story by Nicholas Sparks!! If you enjoy his books you will love The Lucky  One. have also seen the movie which is exceptional.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|Basically an arcade-type game with increasing levels of difficulties and opponents to keep it ever more challenging.  The more advanced maps require one to try different strategies until one finds an approach that works.
0321934318|5.0|I have about 20 books written by Scott Kelby.  He never fails to provide useful info and provides an easy step by step learning environment at my speed.  I have some Dementia due to a head injury and sometimes have to cover an area several times to finally get it.  I like all his books and programs.  It is worth every penny  spent.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games. This one is quite adequate! It appears to be a version of a Facebook game that I also liked.
0375869026|5.0|This is fiction, but it could be a real person.  Great insight into the feelings of all the people who play a role in such a situation.  I would recommend it to all teens so that they can learn to empathize with those who are &#34;different&#34; on the outside; they can learn that the inside of a person is pretty much the same the world over and deserves respect and friendship.
B008MM9630|5.0|This is a very cute game. It is relaxing and it's nicely paced and enjoyable. Will recommend it to my friends.
020530902X|5.0|Whether a opinion columnist or research scientist this book will help. It condenses all the tricky rule's for writing the English language in a way that is easy to find, understand, and incorporate into your writing. Anyone who reads your writing will be grateful you got this book.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|At first I was afraid I wouldn't wake up on time because of how quiet it seemed but the first morning I woke up on time and was impressed how easily I woke up! there is a &quot; white water&quot; effect to help you fall asleep with a timer on it so its not on all night! I highly reccomend this app!!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Love the Eagles and love this DVD. I learned a lot about the band and enjoyed their music along the way.

006198969X|5.0|I love this book. I recommend this book if you need a little bit of help on how to make better your style!
B004LWZW9C|4.0|I like it, but not like Valentine's Day.  It's good in it's own way, the end is very good, but I will keep it in my collection and watch again.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I enjoyed this game a lot the controls are easy. There is no lag, a lot of cars  to upgrade and use. It's kinda like forza.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Oh my God, what a movie.  I just love this movie, so much in it, so much going on, keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat.  Like Avatar, it could never get old.  Could watch it over and over again and again.  Love it
140053271X|4.0|Was delivered on a timely basis. Only issue was the charger cord was bad.  Reader is great for my wife and she likes it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I think this is a really good game you all should give it a try.you can build your own military and fight whither it so get it. I haven't found any problems with it yet
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|As with the other games i have downloaded on my kindle i liked it for a while but wanted to try something else.
B00144VBBS|5.0|This is a great double cd for Toby Keith fans.  It has most of his biggest hits.  I thoroughly enjoy listening to this CD.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I thought this was like the game i play on my phone but it wasn't a real game at all.  Maybe i didn't understand it.
B00F91H666|5.0|I have not yet read the book, so right up front I'm telling you, I'm rating it based on the movie experience itself. Ok, yes, you'll find a lot of been-there-done-that, cuz it IS a zombie movie. Let's get over that, shall we?<br /><br />I read a very poor review saying there was a lot of Brad Pitt doing nothing, with sporadic scenes of violence. Excuse me? That's not the movie I saw. Tons of action with brief interludes to start piecing the story together.<br /><br />I also read a very poor review pointing out various 'stupid' actions and decisions. None touched on my own personal major problem with the zombies. Namely, broken bones don't flipping work, alive or dead. One Navy SEAL had a saying, \\"the spine is divine, but the knees they work just fine.\\" For bringing them down. A man can't stand, a man can't fight. Israel should have been just fine, as the zombies simply threw themselves over a massive, incredibly high wall; they would've broken every bone they had, they would NOT have been leaping up to attack anyone, period. BROKEN BONES DO NOT SUPPORT THE BODY. That's my big pet peeve with this movie.<br /><br />But I did enjoy it very much nonetheless. I found the zombies' transformations and modes of locomotion intriguing and fascinating, their method of attacking mouth-first unique and fresh. And very creepy. Seeing how rapidly one infected could wreak total chaos was fun and shocking at the same time, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the tides of infected swell and sweep through the airplane.<br /><br />I'm really surprised by how many others criticized the zombies, how so many complained they were just like every other zombie out there. I myself was fascinated by the way they were presented. I've never seen a zombie not use its hands to grapple its victims, never seen one launch itself at a target mouth-first while holding its hands behind itself. That seemed like piranha-type behaviour to me. More fascinating still was the fire ant type of behaviour they used to breech Jerusalem. Never before have I seen zombies given attributes like that, to use each other as building material, to construct with their own bodies like fire ants do. I was and remain fascinated by the skill set the zombies were given, and by the actions they are usually given that were absent.<br /><br />Oh yeah, another \\"how freaking stupid are you, REALLY?\\" moment came early on when Gerry was driving hell-bent for leather while his wife was turned in her seat trying to get the daughter out of the footwell and back into her seat. In this chaotic, dangerous and panic-stricken time, do you really think you belong next to your wife turned around in your seat and looking BACKWARDS, or do your eyes perhaps belong ON THE ROAD YOU'RE CURRENTLY SPEEDING DOWN WHILE WEAVING AROUND CARS?!? Leave your wife to deal with the kid, YOU deal with NOT KILLING EVERYONE, you moron!<br /><br />I have decided that I will enjoy the movie for exactly what it is, and the book for exactly what IT is, and consciously refuse to compare the two. I believe that the majority of the negative reviews are due more to the reviewers comparing them and disliking the massive differences than in any actual inherent flaw in the movie.<br /><br />Otherwise, like I said, I liked it. >.>d to breech Jerusalem.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome can't wait for Season 4 ,very happy to have tried this feature and discover all the feat shows there
B004LROMSO|5.0|Loved it. So upset it was cancelled after only one season. Love Jamie Campbell Bower. He has a great career ahead of him which I will follow. Nice take on the Authur story but again, wish it could have had even one more season.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|Great action, followed by good historical story line. Good choices for actors and actresses. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00DJWV11I|2.0|I must be missing the boat, but I found this book very boring. Yes its from a guys point of view, but it just seems so silly most of the time that I cant relate. It just seemed like a big game to him and I never saw or felt the whole romance.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's great. I get to keep up with family that live out of state . Play good games please keep it simple especially for those who don't have a lot of knowledge about computers
B01G4N5Q28|5.0|Was so excited for this new release- great price
1611762138|3.0|I have never read the Day of the Jackal, but I know it is a novel that lots of folks loved. So I decided to try this one, buying the Unabridged Audiobook. This was a hard book for me to get through and I love political thrillers. There were so many characters throughout the storytelling that I had to start writing down the names and \\"who\\" they were so I could keep track of their roles. I like audiobooks because I can usually listen to them while doing other things, but not this one. It went back and forth between characters/situations so often that I had to keep rewinding, thinking I had missed something. I think it is a good plot but there is just \\"too much stuff\\" to keep track of, let alone the Middle Eastern names and locations. The author also uses local terms for things and one has to look at the context to figure out that it is a road that is being referenced. In a single sentence, this book is just too hard to listen to...too much work!<br /><br />I think it would make a much better movie!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I love this movie! The acting, the special effects, the music, and everything else. I give this movie a 9/10. And the Kahn performance by Benedict Cumberbatch has a delicious evilness.
B004INHTK4|5.0|I was spellbound and gobsmacked at the same time by this true account of a Chinese mother's relationship with her two daughters and how she brought them up. She is married to a Jewish man who does not seem to have anything like the influence that the Chinese mother wields. This family lives in the USA and the book highlights the massive differences in mothering skills between the typically soft Western mother who is far too forgiving of her childrens' faults and the pushy, goal-driven Chinese mother who is relentless in her pursuit of excellence for her daughters and will tolerate nothing less than that.  One daughter is compliant and the other is defiant from the very beginning and the battle starts from then. This is a true story;  I would love to find out how these girls turned out in the end and although I found the mother jaw-droppingly strict, I begrudgingly had to agree with some of her views.  I felt that somewhere between the two mothering examples would be a pretty good  balance.  An amazing book interesting to the last page.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|This enchanting poetry collection belongs to the genre of Fantasy and Fairyland. As a reader I was fascinated by the magical reality which the poet has created throughout the entire book. It felt like being inside a fairy tale, or inside a mythological journey, a fact which conveyed the reader with an epic and divine tang of eternity. Many of the poems were intuitive and somewhat mysterious, yet not without piety. The way the reader was swinging in moods was fantastic, as some poems were heavy whereas others were light and blithe. It means that the poet has the ability to dictate the mood apart from the wonderful rich description abound. I really enjoyed the light atmosphere in some of the euphoric poems. There was something divine and alleviating in them, perhaps even a tinge of novelty and romanticism alluding to the overall message of universal love. Some of the events were related to the story of Peter, whom is a chivalrous character, a savior that defeated the forces of darkness. The structure of the poems was interesting, as here the poet often used the frames of rhymes, but not above the message and not on the account of the wonderful enchanting drift. The language was rich and powerful, and together with the plays of words it imparted the poems with a spray of stardust. It is as if the poet has developed a new dialect in poetry, which is an indication of originality, intelligence, and evolution. His individual print was fantastic, as I often felt like a fairy was singing to me, or guiding me as a reader. There was a certain rhythm, which was compatible with the occurrences within the poems. The messages, most of which were implied, are associated with the poet's chief doctrine, that love, hope, and faith are the creators of magic, and that despite the fact that evil is surrounding us, we can always win over evil, providing that we do not lose hope, faith, or love. For me it has been a wonderful experience to read poetry in such a genre. It was truly unconventional, as many poets are serious and melancholy. This poet was not only happy; he was also a guide that leads to happiness. My mood was uplifted after reading this book. For me this book has been both a pleasure and a remedy.<br /><br />Poems analysis:<br /><br />In poem 1 'Drawers and Doors' I got the sense of traveling in space. Moreover, the reality of the subsequent poems was introduced through the images of mystery, as if there was a secret waiting to be discovered by the reader. The notion of time, together with the suspense of the unseen danger, just like in the fairy tale about Peter, played a chief role here in both the creation of a mysterious mood on one hand, and in the conveyance of the chief message of being alert, and not drift into the illusion that danger does not exist, on the other hand. In poem 2 `Finding Fingle' I enjoyed the rhymes and the panoramic description of a fairyland reality. The elf and the moonlight together with the motion of nature made me feel as if I was taking part in a fictional evolution of magic. The punch line in the last stanza also alludes as for the magic which is within the poet; i.e. to transform our world into a magical one, hence, the poet is depicted as a healer, owing to his good intentions. He is an ethicist and an exponent of nature and life. The rich descriptions of nature accelerates in Poem 4 `Shylong Woods', as here the first stanza contains a strong tangible object of nature in every line. Sky, stone, grass, frog, fish, and water, all capture the attention of the reader and ushers one into the reality of nature. Hence the magic is in nature itself, a fact which renders the poet a naturalist and a lover of the earth; all strong indications that he is also a Carpe Diem poet whose goal in life is to help mankind to save the earth. In the second stanza the seeds and the reeds proceed with the evolutionary description of magic. The third line breaks the momentum briefly to proceed in the subsequent line with a return to the beauty of nature through the Iris. The viewer is a traveling spectator that cherishes the beauties of nature. Moreover, the assertion in the first line of the third stanza of `always aware' alludes as for the overall message that one should always cherish nature, but at the same time be aware of unseen danger, and/or of unexpected events. Hence, the message here is not to be naïve, and not to ignore the beauties of life at the same time. The poet advocates for life as a miracle, and as for the miracle of life in many of his poems. The last stanza was very interesting, as here the poet uses discernment in order to warn the reader as for the unseen danger. Poem 5 `Frozen Magic' gives the reader not even one moment of abstraction. The wonderful description of a fairy tale made it impossible for me to wander away. The reality which is imposed on the reader is simply wonderful; it is magical and rich, and here Peter's world is introduced with a warning. Stanza 4 in this poem was probably the most enchanting stanza in the entire collection. Poem 6  'Kiylore', however, is linked to poem 4, and to the overall message of waking up into the reality of the poet. The imaginary realism is the real world, the inner world is the way to salvation, not the dangers, not the facile world, hence, I was really moved by the method which the poet used here, and also in many of his other poems. Through sounds and through plays of words the call is to wake up into the fairyland's reality. The sounds' expressionism here was superb. The reality that the reader should seek is the dream world, the unseen beauties of life, not the worries of the rabble. For me the enhancement of the hearing sense brought me to the realization of the paradox of life. Here, the reader is asleep (in ignorance perhaps) in the beautiful world, hence it is all about magic and awareness, just like in the first poem, that the way to salvation is through a hidden path, a narrow gate, an unseen reality. I felt that the poet woke me up to a higher level of consciousness in many poems, thus, the way the poems were constructed in order to deliver a message was brilliant in the sense that the reader is not aware of the fact that the poet, is in fact, a shepherd and a pathfinder. The third line of the first stanza gave the poem a mood of a fairytale, whereas the word hidden in the third line of the second stanza emphasizes the fog of mystery and the atmosphere of magic. The secret, the magic, the mystery, all prods the reader to seek for the hidden treasure of carpe diem. Hence the poet advocates for the treasure of life in the spirit, a fact which renders him a divine messenger and an emissary of the light. The strong punch line in the second stanza, which is a chief message, reminds the reader that evil is always around us and even within us, but that it cannot vanquish us unless we yield to it. Hence, once more, the poet instructs us to remain aware of evil, not to deny it, but simultaneously to fight evil and defeat it with our will to live and find happiness in life. For me it was an injection of hope that brought me back to the will to find happiness in life. The first stanza of the subsequent poem (see poem 7) `A Truth' only solidifies the mood of alleviation as here the abstract elation with a tinge of romanticism and love uplifted me to the notion of nirvana. The `dreams come true' path, once more, is hidden, but it exists, and if we delve deep inside our souls we can find it, and by thus we can make it to the light. Peter in that context is the ordinary reader that seeks salvation. The assertions in this poem render the poet celestial, divine, and overwhelming. In poem 8 `Chantowald' I was impressed with the intensity and with the motion within the poem. It is as if the pace was rapidly exciting, the words crumble and rumbles in the third stanza gave it an aphoristic tinge, as so did the words by and play in the subsequent stanza. There was a wonderful rush of evolution, motion, emotion, and commotion that made me curious as for the end of the event. The structure was terse; however, the rhymes were interesting as they broke the symmetry of the 4 lines and 4 stanzas with their inconsistency, a fact which contributed to the diversity of the poem. In poem 9 `Cauldron' I enjoyed the rhymes and rhythm. The cadence was magnificent, hence together with the message, which appears in the last two lines of the last stanza, they rendered this poem very powerful. The poet's additional characteristics and virtues are exposed, as he is clearly sentimental, emotional, and above all a moralist. In the subsequent poem `The Fever' (see poem 10) I was impressed once more by the breaking of the rhymes in the first and the last stanzas. I believe this was done in order to deliver an important message that digresses from style on grounds of its hidden essence. In the first stanza the words cries and inside subtly distracted the reader form the subsequent rhymes, whereas in the end of the poem the words flash and pass, reminded the reader that it is not a poem of vanity (paradoxically order) and that the rhymes were not totally symmetric for a reason. My interpretation in this poem would be that it was done in order to keep the reader aware as for the reality of the poem. It means that if there were rhymes all the way to the end, in a symmetric perfection, then the reader would have fallen asleep, escape heed, and the poem would have lost its value and message. I find this poem constructed as a genius. The poet rebels against symmetry of rhymes, and the strong message is implied in the last stanza. Time is in constant motion. The miracle of life occurs due to motion, the earth was created owing to motion, and we live life owing to motion. William O'Brien is probably one of the most dynamic poets I have ever read. The message here, hence, is that time cannot stand still as long as we desire to live. Yes, the first line of the last stanza indicates the death has a hold on us, because of our physical existence, but our spirit lives forever, hence death is motionlessness, whereas life is motion. When the poet declares in the punch line that `clock will tick forever pass' he advocates for life, and for the triumph of life over death owing to motion. It should be noted that in his entire collection, motion was appreciated and exercised through the events and the descriptions of nature and fantasy. Hence this poet is an exponent of carpe diem and dynamics. Poem 11 `Cuthbert' reminded me somehow about the classic story of `Alice in Wonderland' (so did poem 39). Moreover, I just loved the rich English language, and I have no idea why I have thought about old Britain and its rich diversity in this poem. The tempo was great, particularly in the first stanza. Furthermore, the end in the last stanza amused me. Poem 13 `Brownies' was simply the epitome of a fairy tale poem. Apart from the motion in the poem, and apart from the strong first word in the poem, `Hidden', I was also compelled to by the intensity of the descriptions of the living creatures, both natural and mythological. Poem 14 `Devil's Wish' was a bit eerie, and here the mood was kind of dark and frightening. The poet can master the moods and create also an eerie and dark atmosphere, which is a faculty that requires a talent. It renders the poet versatile and compelling. There was like a chant, or a spell, hence a ceremony that reminded me of witches and warlocks etc. This poem was brilliantly constructed. It was probably the darkest poem in this book, no doubt, and apart from poem 42 I do not recall any other poems that frightened me at all. The poet is aware of the forces of darkness; he somehow knows them, a fact which terrified me a bit in regard to his image. But subsequent poems reassured me that he has the entire gamut of human emotions, and that his point is exactly that we must know evil, or rather be aware of it, before we can defeat it. The poet could have been a sorcerer, or a dark shepherd if he wanted to, but he chose the bright path of salvation. He chose altruism over selfishness. His empirical knowledge in regard to darkness, hence, can only benefit those who would follow him out of darkness and into the light. Poem 15 `Rickety Lodge' was extremely powerful. Once more the poet appears as an audible expressionist, by using the hearing sense he also deliver a strong message in the chorus. `Are you there?' means, once more, that one should focus on the real world, which is the fairyland reality. The poet hence is a master-mind that compels the reader to follow his instructions and advice, but all in a good spirit and for the higher purpose of salvation (light, life, love). The poem begins with a noise which only intensifies until the chorus. Furthermore, all three stanzas describe noises and tumult which only render the reader more curious about the source of it. The ghost, the host, the clock, the wind, and all the other movements in the poem gave the poem a tinge of madness. It was a brilliant poem in regard to event and motion. Poems 16-20 amazed me as they all appeared as savage, or somewhat predatory poems, aptly constructed in rhymes. I call them the heavy poems, because they had this heavy feeling of dread and even terror in them. In poem 16 `Zombie Queen' the first stanza was somewhat grizzly and savage. However, if I ever had a doubt as for the ongoing events, the third stanza reassured me that physical death and bodily harm are a fairly good reason to stay away from the Zombie Queen. The atmosphere of fear, and the `hunter and hunted' mood also appears in the subsequent poem `Bisquenta' However, I could not help stretching a smile of amusement, for what a pleasure that it was to hear the predator in poem 20 `Quengorn' describes what it will do to its victim in the last stanza. A predator with a sense of humor makes a lot of a difference. In fact, such a witty creation of character has a dual benefit, because it affects the mood of the reader positively on one hand, and transforms the predator from a flat character to a round character on the other hand. In 'Elves and Goblins' (Poem 21) I felt like I was reading a fairy tale in rhymes. Here, in the last stanza, there were some allusions as for the call of the poet. The words divine and prophecies reminded me that poetry is the true religion and that the ethicist poet is the divine messenger, hence the highest priest. Unlike the false choice of mankind, which is to choose ministers of religion and politics by power and social hierarchy, the poet is a free spirit, a divine messenger that proves his ministry through words, deeds, and merits. It is by merits that the poet is deemed a high priest, not by bias, and that is the beauty of poetry. Emerald rain was a term that strongly suggested that the viewer, hence the poet, is one with the creator in the establishment of colors and diversity. What a strong description in two words, for it was not merely a visual description, but rather emotional and uplifting one. Emerald, not only in color, but also in regard to the stone itself, was the notion which brought me higher to the Fairyland sky and reminded me about my own dreams on earth. The poet is so rich and powerful in creation that I have felt humbled as a reader throughout the entire book. In the subsequent poem, (poem 22), 'The Vaandorg Dragon' the warning against the existence of the dark forces resurfaces. In poem 23 `Wildflower Valley' I enjoyed the rhymes and the tempo. This poem reminded me of the old poets and their old English style. There was something romantic, natural, and light about it. The expression of `Oh' and the word `protection' rendered the poem positive. Here the mechanism of the earth is healing, and protected by magic. In `Devic Magic' (poem 24) I was enchanted by the rhymes and by the beautiful descriptions of a fairy world. The beauty of life is hidden and magical, but the poet keeps pointing it out until the reader is compelled to take a good look and learn that the true essence of aestheticism is inside us, inside nature. It is a clear message to cherish life and give respect to the earth. The poet is intoxicated with the love of life and nature, hence, his call to behold the beauties of the forest and the fairies is a call to follow Carpe Diem and love. The blithe feeling in this poem uplifted my mood tremendously. The final verse, however, reassure the believers that the reward is natural, hence that the law of karma, or universal law, has bee retained, and should be maintained by all exponents of the magic of the earth. It is by faith that we create miracles, invite miracles, and enjoy miracles. Hence, faith is the chief message in this lovely poem. As for poem 25 'The Gift', I must admit here that it is my favorite poem in this collection. The opening line of the first stanza has already enchanted me and swept me into this epic divine mood in which I could not escape the embrace of an everlasting bliss. Thereupon the tempo, sublimated, refined and consuming simply lead me to catharsis. It is without any doubt a chastity poem, rare, beautiful, and powerful. The great message in the last two lines spoke directly to me. Here I was guided to think positively, hence no matter how bad things are, we should always keep the flame of faith burning. Because owing to faith we can attain the goal of life. We can find happiness, hence I realized that the poet was a shepherd and an emissary of the light, a savior which leads to green pastures. The final line also implies as for altruism, which is one of the poet's myriad virtues. In the subsequent poem `Eternal' (poem 26) I was happy to discover a new style that had borne a great message. In my view the message was hidden in the first stanza, as the test mentioned is a test of faith. Once more the messages of `don't lose hope' and, `keep the flame of faith burning' resurfaced. The last line in the last stanza, moreover, advocates for the message of motion, hence that life in the spirit never dies. Eternity is implied also through the circle of life through growth and blossoms in nature itself. In `Floating by' (poem 27) I have enjoyed the tempo, the rhymes, and the flow. Moreover, the play of words in the last two lines of the third stanza was magnificent. As for the rhymes, it was an interesting development. The first stanza consisted of perfect rhymes, whereas the last line of the second stanza broke the momentum, as pure and more allowed the third stanza the freedom of being liberated from rhymes. However, there was a twist in the last stanza as here rhymes have returned but not in perfection. Thus we get contrasting stanzas, as stanza 1 and 3 are two complete opposites/contrasts in style, whereas stanzas 2 and 4 are compatible, because both have one imperfect rhyme. In stanza 4 it was, however, the second line that broke the perfection, as grand does not fully rhyme with lands. But the interesting fact was that the rebellious line in stanza 2 was line 4 whereas in stanza 4 the rebellious line was line 2. Thus, there is an order in chaos in regard to structure, patterns and style here, a fact which impressed me a great deal. Moreover, I enjoyed the play of words. The last stanza forged the poem epic. In `Twizzlebumps' (poem 28) I found joy in the chorus. Here the alliteration rendered the poem with a very light and jolly ambiance. In poem 29 `Chanted Spell' everything felt like a description excerpted from a fairy tale. The last stanza, and in particular the last line, imply as for the arrival of a new era, or of a new dawn. The dove which is a symbol equated with Peter and with the poet William, hence the poet is a new age hero of peace; i.e. a deliverer of a new vision. The vision of peace and love on earth, through the discovery of the inner magical world of nature and of mankind (fantasy). Hence, the divine intervention, is in fact, a poetic intervention. Hence, the poetry and literature of William O'Brien are the tools which are used by the individual to create a divine intervention, not from a thin air, but from the tangible physical world, which we ought to respect. The divine messenger is neither a politician nor a priest. The divine messenger is a poet, because neither religion nor politics are qualified to impart mankind with the knowledge  of salvation. It is literature in general, and poetry in particular, that is qualified to redeem mankind and save it from self destruction. The savior is a dove of peace, hence, an artist, an author, a poet. In poem 31 `Bubbles' I simply admire the end. The hidden message here was, in my view, breaking up illusions. The light movement, and particularly the drift in the second stanza swept me in the wind of hope. But once more, the poet warns us not be caught up in illusions, but to be aware of the reality around us. The end could also mean liberation from a trapped situation. In Poem 32, 'Jizzlebugs', the last line in the first stanza caught my attention. Here the words Googly and giggles reminded me of the poet's unique diction, rich jargon, and alliterative idiosyncrasy. It was a pleasure to read such poems throughout the entire book, even though I often took it for granted because of curiosity in regard to the messages. The reality was fantastic, and the last two lines of the poem filled my heart with hope and elation. The law of karma, destiny, and the laws of the universe surpassed my doubts and reminded me that everything in life happens for a reason. Hence, the poet is an advocate of equilibrium, equality, and salvation, and additionally an exponent of karma/divine law. The subsequent poem, poem 33, `The Prancing Witch' reminded me of psalms from the bible, yet the prayer, the hope, the request and supplications are not religious, but spiritual. The call is pure, chaste, kind, and untainted by the external reality of mankind. Hence, the poet is pure in both mission and purpose. It is a chastity poem, no doubt; pious, moral, and positive. I was also intrigued by this poem because of the messages of love, peace, and social harmony. The rhymed stanzas added to the beauty of the poem and to the sense of purity and healing. In `Coloured Arcs' (poem 34) I was enthused by the opening line and its strong play of words. Thereupon, I noticed that the opening line of each stanza consisted of a similar cadence and play of words. Alliteration appeared in many of the poems in this book, but here alliteration has intensified to a huge extent of beauty. I also enjoyed the theme of the colours and the rainbow, and their association with the alliterative style and flow of the poem. The final message has amused me, as here the poet alludes as for the message that the real gold is not the superstition of finding gold at the end of the rainbow. The real gold is inner; it is the spiritual gift and the love of life, etc. The message of carpe diem is the real gold, and therefore rich people often realize that they cannot find happiness despite of their money. Money is not the source of true happiness, love is. For me the end was a clear indication that the poet is a liberator of a biblical proportion. One can keep be deluded by the vanities of mankind, money, gold, power, but the poet deride the illusionists by telling them implicitly: you will not find happiness in gold, or money, or in any vanity, because the real treasure is not there. The real treasure is within us, within life, in human adventure, in human experience, in the journey of life, and in the right path, through the narrow gate, through the road, which he knows and lead. Follow the poet not the mirages of the rainbow, and you will find true happiness in life: that is the chief message here. In the subsequent two poems, `The light I+II (see poems 35 and 36) I enjoyed the description of the fairy and the magnificent magical panorama which is expressed by the poet. Here, alliteration, once again, captivated me. In poem 36, in the first stanza, line three, I felt that I was simply blown off by the fluttering foliage and felt that my spirit was soaring higher towards the sky. In poem 37, `Kipple' which is the first poem of the fourth part of the book, I was struck by the last stanza. Here I knew that the poet's advocacy for faith and confidence is the catalyst of miracles. The subsequent poems in the fourth part described characters and events from the fairy tale about Peter. However, poem 42 `The Man in the Field' gave me the spooks and reminded me how creepy and dark the world can be. Despite the fact that he is described as a lovely man in the third stanza, still, I have found him ghastly and uncanny. However, the last stanza was strong, the word God, and the end of the misery gave the poem a sense of a good end, catharsis, and/or a liberation from human sufferings. In the subsequent poem, `The fortress' (poem 43) I was comforted by the last stanza. As here, Peter, the hero, is going to overcome the ordeal, and by thus, provide all the readers with faith and hope that it does not matter how weak one is in society, one can always make it to happiness when one is willing to seize the day. It is another allusion as for the poets adherence to the Carpe Diem principle that life is precious. In `Little things' (poem 44) I have discovered that the message of the poet is that it is small details, hence small things in life, that lead us to great miracles. Like the parable of the mustard seed in the new testament, I have found out that the poetry and literature of William O'Brien were in fact the seeds of salvation. Just like the mustard seed they are about to explode with grace and beauty. Beneath the obvious, hence, beneath the rich descriptions of fiction and nature, and beneath the storyline there is a hidden divine treasure, waiting to grow up exponentially and save mankind from destruction. William's great vision to mankind is yet to be demystified. It is the vision of love and peace. In poem 51, `A Place of Knowing', which is the last poem of this fascinating collection, I have found the last two lines as the perfect message for sealing this book. Once more it is a Carpe Diem message, but here the message, unlike in many other poems, is neither hidden nor implied. The poet seals the book with an explicit declaration of motion, and here it is clear as crystal that miracles can only happen owing to motion. Remember, the earth without its constant revolution will die, the universe is also in constant motion, hence the call is to adapt to nature, to the earth, to the universe, and most of all to divine law which states that a man reaps in joy what he has sown with tears. William O'Brien has transported me to the heavenly realm in this book. Hence, I acted upon the final message and did not hesitate to write this review in a hope that mankind will recognize poets in general, and divine poets, like William O'Brien, in particular, as the true emissaries of the light, and as the loyal leaders of moral virtue. Salvation can only come from art, not from authority. Social harmony can only come from beauty not from power. World peace can only be attained through love and reason, not through fear and madness. This book was written with sparks of a divine inspiration. Why don't we just call it magic?<br /><br />Poet's additional characteristics: karmic, divine, liberating, fascinating, fantastic, chaste, pious, altruist, alliterative, profound, mysterious, peaceful, loving, hopefully, loyal, intriguing, enchanting, divine, ethical, discerning, insightful, expressive, kind.fit, because it affects the mood of the reader positively on one hand, and transforms the predator from a flat character to a round character on the other hand. In 'Elves and Goblins' (Poem 21) I felt like I was reading a fairy tale in rhymes. Here, in the last stanza, there were some allusions as for the call of the poet. The words divine and prophecies reminded me that poetry is the true religion and that the ethicist poet is the divine messenger, hence the highest priest. Unlike the false choice of mankind, which is to choose ministers of religion and politics by power and social hierarchy, the poet is a free spirit, a divine messenger that proves his ministry through words, deeds, and merits.

What a strong description in two words, for it was not merely a visual description, but rather emotional and uplifting one. Emerald, not only in color, but also in regard to the stone itself, was the notion which brought me higher to the Fairyland sky and reminded me about my own dreams on earth. The poet is so rich and powerful in creation that I have felt humbled as a reader throughout the entire book. In the subsequent poem, (poem 22), 'The Vaandorg Dragon' the warning against the existence of the dark forces resurfaces. In poem 23 `Wildflower Valley' I enjoyed the rhymes and the tempo.

In the subsequent two poems, `The light I+II (see poems 35 and 36) I enjoyed the description of the fairy and the magnificent magical panorama which is expressed by the poet. Here, alliteration, once again, captivated me. In poem 36, in the first stanza, line three, I felt that I was simply blown off by the fluttering foliage and felt that my spirit was soaring higher towards the sky. In poem 37, `Kipple' which is the first poem of the fourth part of the book, I was struck by the last stanza. Here I knew that the poet's advocacy for faith and confidence is the catalyst of miracles. The subsequent poems in the fourth part described characters and events from the fairy tale about Peter. However, poem 42 `The Man in the Field' gave me the spooks and reminded me how creepy and dark the world can be. Despite the fact that he is described as a lovely man in the third stanza, still, I have found him ghastly and uncanny. However, the last stanza was strong, the word God, and the end of the misery gave the poem a sense of a good end, catharsis, and/or a liberation from human sufferings. In the subsequent poem, `The fortress' (poem 43) I was comforted by the last stanza. As here, Peter, the hero, is going to overcome the ordeal, and by thus, provide all the readers with faith and hope that it does not matter how weak one is in society, one can always make it to happiness when one is willing to seize the day. It is another allusion as for the poets adherence to the Carpe Diem principle that life is precious. In `Little things' (poem 44) I have discovered that the message of the poet is that it is small details, hence small things in life, that lead us to great miracles. Like the parable of the mustard seed in the new testament, I have found out that the poetry and literature of William O'Brien were in fact the seeds of salvation. Just like the mustard seed they are about to explode with grace and beauty. Beneath the obvious, hence, beneath the rich descriptions of fiction and nature, and beneath the storyline there is a hidden divine treasure, waiting to grow up exponentially and save mankind from destruction. William's great vision to mankind is yet to be demystified. It isthe vision of love and peace. In poem 51, `A Place of Knowing', which is the last poem of this fascinating collection, I have found the last two lines as the perfect message for sealing this book. Once more it is a Carpe Diem message, but here the message, unlike in many other poems, is neither hidden nor implied. The poet seals the book with an explicit declaration of motion, and here it is clear as crystal that miracles can only happen owing to motion. Remember, the earth without its constant revolution will die, the universe is also in constant motion, hence the call is to adapt to nature, to the earth, to the universe, and most of all to divine law which states that a man reaps in joy what he has sown with tears. William O'Brien has transported me to the heavenly realm in this book. Hence, I acted upon the final message and did not hesitate to write this review in a hope that mankind will recognize poets in general, and divine poets, like William O'Brien, in particular, as the true emissaries of the light, and as the loyal leaders of moral virtue. Salvation can only come from art, not from authority. Social harmony can only come from beauty not from power. World peace can only be attained through love and reason, not through fear and madness. This book was written with sparks of a divine inspiration. Why don't we just call it magic?<br /><br />Poet's additional characteristics: karmic, divine, liberating, fascinating, fantastic, chaste, pious, altruist, alliterative, profound, mysterious, peaceful, loving, hopefully, loyal, intriguing, enchanting, divine, ethical, discerning, insightful, expressive, kind.
B002HMCEJY|1.0|The record skipped, not what I'd expect from a record that was advertised in very good condition.  When I tried to return it they suggested I clean it, which I did.  I even bought a new needle.  It still skipped.  Don't understand why distributers don't want to accept returns for inferior products.  Won't be buying from this one again.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I used to love this app but after I updated it I couldn't get back the ad free version I paid for. I also lost all of the puzzle packs I had purchased/downloaded.  the update completely ruined this game for me, I never play it anymore. I wish I could get my money back!
B0041KVXLK|2.0|I can not believe that a new pressing can skip- I have bought loads of used records that are of great quality.
B00AEBB9O6|5.0|Great movie! The picture quality and sound is even better than I remember in theatre. Defiantly a good reenactment of the Vietnam battle field. They finally got it right.
B00175GCEU|1.0|The quality wasn't as advertised.  Advertised as: AMERICA (180 Gram Audiophile Vinyl)  The record skipped.  A decent sounding recording would have sufficed.
B000JVSUS4|5.0|I didn't care for all the love scenes. I want to see move fighting and us hitting back at Japan. But over all still a good movie.

B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Based on true facts from the takeover of the American embassy in Iran in which hostages were held for 444 days!  Six Americans managed to sneak out of the embassy during the takeover.  They approached the embassy's of two other countries (being turned away by each) before being taken in and hidden by the Canadians.  Their lives are still in danger, however, because pictures of them which had been shredded were slowly being taped back together and soon their identities would be known by the Iranians.  Ben Affleck plays Tony Menendez, a CIA operative, who comes up with an idea on how to get them out (\\"the least bad idea\\")...by making up a phony movie being produced by a real movie production company and sending over \\"location scouts\\" to Iran.  Tensions run so high in so many different ways.  Will the Americans be able to memorize every detail of their cover stories in one day?  Will they be stopped because of the faulty paperwork at the airport?  Will their identities be discovered?<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is so well done.  Bryan Cranston, Ben Affleck, John Goodman and many others give great performances while the pacing of the movie keeps tension levels high.  A FUN movie!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Well.. we love the pool except that one half of the slide won't stay inflated, we have to try to figure out where the leak is, but I doubt if that's a common problem.  The rest of it is good and it's easy to empty, even though it's large.

B00F35BV64|4.0|I had a lot of problems with this movie that I didn't have with the 2009 movie. Mainly that it murdered a lot of pre-Nero canon. The premise of the 2009 movie was that the timeline changed when Nero went back in time. If that is so than why is established canon from before that time not applied? Why were the crew of the Enterprise not taught about the Eugenics Wars in school? Why is Khan white? Why do the Klingons look wrong? The only thing I really loved about this movie was the Kirk and Spock death reversal from Wrath of Khan. It was interesting to see how that played out with Kirk on the other side of the glass.
B00B52F278|5.0|Epic battles and believable story line. Gore lovers will enjoy this. Love scenes are a bonus. You won't regret getting the series.
B008602KQI|4.0|Everyone knows if you've read the book the movie won't touch the image you've already established due to the book. Usually it's a let down but this movie was really close to it.<br /><br />I was under the impression that in Katniss' 2nd on stage interview she was wearing a dress made of jewels, not the fake fire thing. Maybe I was wrong about that part.<br /><br />However, I loved the movie and look forward to the next!
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|My daughter loved the different princesses... worked great with the Disney Princess Dream From the Heart border peel and stick
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman has always been and will always be my favorite series. It had family morals, integrity, humor, sensitive and controversial content.  It was a perfect package, wrapped up with loveable, complex characters that we could all relate to.  I always felt like I was part of the family and town.<br /><br />They don't make shows like this anymore unfortunately.  Really hoping that CBS will create a 3rd movie for the 20th anniversary with all the original cast.  This series never should have been cancelled when it was.  It was a shock to millions of devoted and loyal fans.<br /><br />This DVD set is wonderful.  I received it in a timely manner.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|I'm a Technical Manager, so many issues written in this book exactly fit to problems from my backyard. Funny, when I read first chapter I was in very similar situation. This book points me some areas to explore to be a better leader.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|intertwined stories that were surprising, it was an interesting read and the book was quite engaging and I would recommend it.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|It was good, but not great. Compressing the book into a movie lost a lot. Good for rental, but that's about it in my book.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This Book along with the 4th was as good as the first 3, however I wish George R.R. Martin would tone down some of the chapters where there is a lot of repetitive writing.

0985557834|5.0|Bought volume 1 and 2. These are the best books out there if you want to know how to tie any kind of knot or make bracelets.
B00EL8I8IS|4.0|Its no resident evil but its definitely a good zombie movie worth watching. The kids watched it too so it wasn't too scary or full bad language etc.
098555780X|5.0|A must have! This book is awesome. The book is very good at explaining the techniques. I would recommend it to everyone wanting to make paracord bracelets.
B00DU74U74|3.0|Of course if you're a twilight fan you will probably want to watch this one. Instead of vampires there's aliens in this one. I would have to say that this is probably one of those movies where the book was probably better then movie. This movie is still pretty good especially if you enjoy young romance. The best part is the ending.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|FIrst of all, this was a good book - written by Max Brooks of The Walking Dead, but because the show has been on for 3 or 4 seasons now, I think this movie would have done much better had it been released before TWD TV series. If you aren't a TWD watcher or just read Patient Zero by Max Brooks, you may like this movie. I liked the book, looked forward to the film but have had too much ZOMBIE SURViVAL by now.  I think Brad Pitt played his role good, as he always does though.  There are suspenseful moments and revelations - but all these would have much more impact had they not  been unveiled in TWD, making much of what would have made us say  &#34;aHA&#34;, old news in this movie. It's too bad because I would have rather seen these all these theories and survival methods done the way Pitt came to his conclusions and tried out his theories, and came out victorious. The movie has a good ending that would have also had more of an impact had it been released before 4 seasons of TWD.  It's still a good movie, with good effects - I believe there is a disc included to see it in 3D but I don't own anything that allows me to see it this way.  If you've been following The Walking Dead you probably saw these types of effects already ... can't say one did any better than the other, although the TV series showed some things in a much more ..&#34;gory&#34; way. Although I enjoyed it and watched it a few times today - you may find it predictable - I suppose this would depend on if you read Brooks' book which this is based on (Patient Zero) or if you're an avid fan of TWD. Brad Pitt needs to get a new PR agent or something because lately I've been expecting much more from his movies and his starring in it is the only redeeming factor - they previews have been misleading (Tree of Life, Killing Them Softly) - but I still enjoy them all - probably because I watch them so many times to catch all kinds of cool things you miss if you view these films just once.<br />I PRE-ORDERED THIS FROM AMAZON - GUARANTEED THE LOWEST PRICE- TO BE SENT TO ME WHEN MOVIE WAS RELEASED ON DVD. Well I just received it.  The stores' racks are ghost town shelves with nothing but the &#34;WWZ  Get it for only $14.99 NOW&#34; signs dangling off shelf as if the store was looted.

B00DGMVJAO|3.0|This is a great remake of the kids tale with a few twists that make it a great movie for the kids. It has special effects and action that keep the kids entertained.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Quite a bit different than Ender's Game.  Significantly slower paced far last action.  The author has to start off completely rebuilding the story's universe so it takes a little while for the book to pick up.  This book takes place 3000 years after the events of Ender's Game and is a bit of a stretch.  Technology and health care don't seem to make the advancements you would expect in this time frame.  The entity known as Jane has almost zero character development or explanation for existence (maybe as designed but still odd) but seems to play an intricate emotional role for Ender.  The story is interesting and unique, though a little slow.  Worth a read but don't expect to be wowed.  Definitely not a quick read.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Gangster Squad is a bloody shootemup kind film. Its got a great cast, a good story and its fun to watch!
1405881186|1.0|Using CD, I hear exactly the same recording for words as in \\"Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English\\" DVD. That recording was created by a group of people. I expected a much better Quality of Pronunciation.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Great twist on the old story of Hansel and Gretel. It is definitely not for the kids. Full of action. Great cast. Hope there's a second one.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I have watched many movies in my 60 plus years.  This is one of the worst!  The acting, story and languaged used to try to entertain fell not just short it fell flat.  I found myself challenged to finish.  If it was meant to be a take off on the old Spaghetti Western I wouldlike to label it a Fettucini Flop!  Now I need to try to find a sucker on ebay to buy it!
B00B10CT7A|5.0|Chasing Mavericks is an inspirational movie. A true story about a young man chasing a dream. This movie has a great cast.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|Cost to much to play all not worth it u are charged 2.00 every new table and just the same content just throw money into it
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Best thing about this is its price compared to the Roku and AppleTV. But, all it runs is Netflix, Youtube, and your Google Play stuff. That's it! That's all it does! You like Amazon Prime video? Too bad! Hulu Plus subscriber? Go hang!<br /><br />Also, while the device itself is famously tiny, it still requires a power cord which largely negates the convenience factor.<br /><br />If all you subscribe to is Netflix and you never buy or rent video from the site you are currently browsing, and if you never plan on ever getting Amazon Prime either, and you have no interest in the vast channel line-up of the Roku, then sure, I guess buy this and save a few bucks... otherwise, go for the Roku 3 and never look back.<br /><br />UPDATE: despite several tries at rebooting our Android phobe and uninstalling and reinstalling Google Play, there is simply no way we can stream movies from Google Play to the chromecast, despite being on the same wifi network. The \\"cast\\" button simply does not appear in the app, and nothing will bring it up. It should be noted that the Roku is not limited by a failure on a phone/tablet app since all its apps are stored internally and does not require a smartphone or tablet whatsoever. Anyway, the Chromecast has been an unmitigated disappointment, and we regret the purchase.
B003Y8YXGM|5.0|I first bought this on vinyl in 1974...And out of nostalgia I thought a digital remix would be great. It sounds wonderful..And the loss of John Lennon seems even more profound.
B0054LJGWS|2.0|I didn't really like this book, I found the story boring. I usually like Neil Gaiman, but not this time!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book was well written, capturing my attention from start to finish. Each turn of page pulled me deeper and deeper into the plot.  I did not want to put it down. I love books that makes my heart race with anticipation and this book did just that.  Another plus was the glimpse into the legal system and how it works or rather fail to work.  The ending although not totally surprising was worth all the anticipation. Great job!  Will definitely read more of his books.
B000FC10MU|1.0|Well, I didn't even finish it, so I can't tell you if the end is good. I got so bored I skipped passages and even sometimes pages... I just couldn't bear it. I'm really sorry for this review because I usually like Neil Gaiman's books, I've read four other books by Gaiman and they were great!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I usually have not liked the newer James Bond movies. But this one was awesome! And Daniel Craig is yummy. End of discussion. :)

B007J4T2G8|1.0|50 ways to describe a female orgasm? Nope. Impossible. After the first three I was bored out of my mind.<br />I have a strong aversion to Harlequin type novels. This was even worse, if that is possible.. The writing was embarrassingly weak and immature, the plot was predictable and what could have been an &#34;edge of your seat&#34; shocker, was rather mundane. Lot of hype about nothing. I passed on book 2 and 3.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|A lot of people went into this film thinking that it would explain everything there was to know about Alien, and everyone seems to forget that they already have a sequel in the works. Many people criticize this movie for not having all the answers. But, isn't that the point of a great movie? To ask the audience questions? The sense of mystery is what makes this film great, and basically every other film out there great. Everyone seems to avoid the fact that Alien raised many questions, and left many of them unanswered, maybe even more than Prometheus. 2001: A Space Odyssey is exactly the same way, but that film is praised, and Prometheus should be as we'll. this film does not rip off of Alien in any way, shape, or form. It is similar in many aspects, but doesn't just show the same old thing. It has a very strong female lead with Noomi Rapace, a tense, horrifying atmosphere, and it looks fantastic, just like Alien did, and this is a sure sign that Ridley Scott is back and better than ever. I absolutely loved this film.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|one of my kids favorite movies, just as good as the first one.  very funny movie we laughed and laughed.
0765348780|5.0|I have just started to read this series, and I found this book to be great! I am a fan of the Wheel of Time and Song of Ice and Fire series. But this world is well constructed, the story is beautifully written, the battle scenes are awesomely descriptive. I may have very well found a favorite series that I can read more and more!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Loved it! So funny. I am a sucker for Rebel Wilson, even her smaller part in this movie was hilarious!!! But all around a great movie. Well worth watching!
B000ICXQXS|4.0|This movie is cool because of the suspense. It was a clever story with a hint of mystery. I recommend watching it. A classic to see again and again.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|What Dawn of the Dead was going for before it got sidetracked at the mall. Just try not to laugh the at sailors midship wearing their soft covers.
B008OHV5QO|4.0|Watched and enjoyed and put back on the shelf for one of those 57 channels and nothing on nights. I tend to get out a music video and enjoy when that happens.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I don't like books that are fantasy. I would not have selected this book if I had known it was fantasy.
B0040JHWKS|4.0|This is a good look at the best period Springsteen had in my opinion. Love the early version of racing in the streets. His outtakes and throw away songs are great if you are a real fan. Have listened to a number of times and the cd is still on the changer.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|This game is just as fun as the original.  It is definitely a challenge on some levels, but overall very fun.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Like the early stuff better but this is just fine with lots of the great music that only bruce can produce.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Joe Satriani is the greatest rock musician alive. Satriani is also the greatest quitar player of all time, Any list of all-time-great guitar players that doesn't have Joe Satriani at or near the top is a bogus list.
B00802EYDO|3.0|I'm sorry, I know this album was a 2013 Grammy WInner - for Surround Sound.  And, that's the great achievement with this disc.  Really, it's the most 'live' sounding surround disc I own.  Very impressive sound.<br /><br />But the music... I can see how the Diana Krall crowd would enjoy the breathy, middle-aged, drunk stripper vocals, but it's not for me (and I love Diana Krall and I am a middle aged man).  Track five really sounds like a drunk stripper singing The Doors' Light My Fire - not kidding, she really covers that track and it's that bad.<br /><br />Sorry, I don't review many music titles, but I was sucked into buying this for the surround experience; I love Jazz; I love Jazz vocals; this is just wrong.<br /><br />Want to hear great female Jazz vocals?  Try Betty Carter's \\"Finest Hour\\".
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game. Challenging but doesn't get boring. I like how the energy is easy to get. I recommend to everyone especially on the kindle fire.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|A fantastic read that will leave the reader guessing until the final words. A fantastic thriller for mystery seeker and detectives
B001R4MEYI|5.0|This is an epic album. It embodies the classical progressive metal bands like fates warning. It has that epic story telling format with a mixture that echos progressiiivvvee. Love this album, i never really was into newer age metal until i heard this on adult swim and was like wait wtf is that? this album hit home for me. Love it.
B00EEN7CAK|2.0|This movie might be called The Bling Ring but I call it The Bo-Ring. How many times can we see teens taking photos of themselves, drinking smoking,snorting drugs and dancing. We get it! They are self-indulgent jerks but here is no character development; no rationale for their behavior. Not to mention the poetic license taken with a plot that would show us 'celebrities', many celebrities that would habitually leave their houses unlocked, purses in the car, cash stashes in easy-to-find places and no security in this day and age. Also that you can easily Google where they live, count on their being gone because a magazine article says so and every time they are away from the house no one else is there: no servants, housekeepers, groundkeepers, etc. Yawn....
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|The actors chosen to portray the beloved original Star Trek characters are so fun to watch.  These younger versions of the Star Trek have better special effects to better showcase their story lines.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I use this every day, at work and home.  I charge my phone, tablet and MP3 player (not all at once).  The only small irk that I have is that the micro USB and i Phone connectors tend to not work well with most cases.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Was a very interesting read. The characters were well developed and relatable.  Explores the secrets and dark thoughts we are all capable of.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|It works fine for me, sometimes glitchy, but i enjoy it! :) One thing i would love for them to add on the app is the chat like on Twitch TV while were watching. So, nice app i am able to watch my youtube ppl i subscribed to live. :)
B000HZD168|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Ricardo is awesome in this. Best of the Star Trek movies. The most recent two movies are great too.
B00EVCD9HY|4.0|Janelle Monae is truly an extraordinary talent. This album is awesome (though my fav album from her is ArchAndriod). I think her best songs on this album are &#34;Dance Apocalyptic&#34; & &#34;Primetime&#34;. Love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was my second time reading this book and I loved it more this time than last. I have recommended it to many people.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like how you have a setting in which the alarm starts out quiet... i never liked loud life-jolting alarms
B008SOS63S|5.0|I have bought numerous Joe CD's and have loved each of them.  My husband liked this so much he claimed it as his own.
1616551607|5.0|I will start out by saying I am an art student, so art books at least for me are much more important to me for inspiration/studying different painting techniques than a coffee table conversation piece. With that said I found the concept art in here very beautiful, the mono chromatic approach to concept art that Amano takes is really brilliant, monochromatic pieces in my opinion are the most interesting because you can add just a second color very subtly and it will make your work pop!
B000SEJHRA|1.0|Reading this book was a waste. How it ever got on a list of books that will change your life is beyond me?
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This sequal was very well done.  Just hope they make a third.  The chemistry between Holmes and Watson is explosive.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This was very enjoyable.. I was reluctant to order this at first, but i found it very insiteful and inspirational!!!!
0345479092|5.0|I just referred this book to a friend ... for us, this was literally a life changing book.  We were experiencing acute sleep deprivation with our son waking up 4 times a night.  This went on for months and once I got this book and applied the techniques, he was sleeping through the night in 3 or 4 nights (can't remember exact) ... almost no time.  We were stunned by the immediate results.  I saw a review of someone who said feeding has no affect on sleeping patterns ... after applying this to now two children and seeing it work like a miracle ... I would say you have no idea what your talking about!!!  There is something very powerful about a baby's nervous system that is linked to feeding times and sleeping patterns.  After getting this book I wanted to skip down the street with a basket of Baby Whisperer books and toss one to every tired looking mother.
B0088W6LAK|5.0|It is one of the greatest shows ever made. I have always loved it and always will. Too many words needed
B003G4W49C|5.0|Hard to imagine a better writer out there. To build a sci-fi universe, fill it with gifted children, engage a hostile alien species and learn the gift of compassion all at once. Orson's writing is simply full of amazing quotes and great thinking. And the book's great fun to boot!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very good game I'm glad they took the shine off the double bananas very good and the beach is fun needs to be longer  the slide finally I always said y they never let the doubles be on the slide another good change...and also you guys should add a evil minion battle...and have evil little minion robots chase us n have a bananas as a counter attack object :) if you guys add it I want some credit lol..
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|Yossi, being the second movie following Jagger & Yossi, takes you on a journey from sadness and grief to lessons learned, acceptance of himself, trust in another, and finally the acceptance of love. Everyone has their own story just like this with love and its nice to see a real picture of the process with so much thought, feeling, and heartwrenching pain & joy. I have it on my list of movies to buy and know I will watch it over and over for years to come.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|a great strategy game. a must do game for anyone with a brain to keepnmemory.this is a math remembrance game.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|my family and I actually saw this movie 3 times in the movie theaters. It is that good.the 3d Blu ray itself is almost just as good as seeing it 3d in the theater. Absolutely amazing. You cannot go wrong with buying this movie it is a must have for the family. It is long but the time flies because it is so good it keeps you intrigued time after time of watching it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a nice and relaxing game if you like finding stuff. At the beginning it is not really hard at all. Within a few minutes i already reached level 2, Although i can imagine it gets harder the higher the level is. But it is a really enjoyable game.
B001JNNDE2|5.0|since the first time I watched this movie I have loved it. Watched it so many times and I can still watch it againand always laugh. Hands down a classic and definitely a must have for your collection.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in some time. Though I have never purchased an Apple product , I am  now sorry that  I  so often chose price over quality and ease of use/simplicity.<br />  I  Will not make this mistake again.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|this movie takes a different twist on other vampire movies. It is a thriller that will keep you hooked. we enjoyed this movie so much in the theaters that we purchased it for home. If you have a 3d TV even better, the pictures absolutely amazing!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I've spent hours trying to get this thing to connect to my home wi-fi network.  I've tried with 3 different brands of wifi routers all of which work fine with my other devices (laptops and cell phones).  It worked slowly for a few minutes at one point... but even after a hardware reset I have been unable to get it working again. I like the concept, but for me it was a complete waste of time.  If you're only trying to do something that can be done on a Roku (i.e. Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc) save yourself some headaches and just get the Roku, it actually works.
B00004R99F|5.0|let me just ask one question.... Who doesn't love a goofy movie?I can't think of one person that would say no. This is a wonderful kids movie and even an adult movie. I love this is a child my son loves it and even my boyfriend and I being adults still enjoy watching this!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Best work yet!! This book is another piece of work putting Gaiman at the top of the list of best writers alive
B00540G3G6|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie as a child. As an adult I still love it just the same. The movie is almost better now that it has the 3d enhancement. The picture is so clear it's amazing. You will not be disappointed in buying this movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|When I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  It was fast, interesting and exciting. It reeled me in.<br /><br />I love stories where the characters ultimately meet or have some common interest and acclimate to the climax.<br /><br />This was the premise of this book.  I bought it because it was the number 1 best seller on Amazon.  Ok, it was good.  But it would not Stop!!  Lots of unnecessary verbiage.<br /><br /> The content was good, the story was good, the writing was good, but OMG I didn't think this would ever end!!!<br /><br />I must admit that I liked looking into \\"what could have happened\\" aspect because that truly is part of life.....what if??????...........<br /><br />Please don't let my 3 star stop you from reading this.  It's good, it's just not my kind of reading.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|This is an excellent album. It's easy to see how this band founded a sub-genre of metal. All of the songs are good. The guitar work and vocals are outstanding. The production is the best I've heard. No drums up front BS here. Guitars are front and center where they should be!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|If I could give this six stars I would. The swipe is fun but the best feature is the prediction.
B00F91H666|3.0|I'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this one fell short.<br />I read the book and put that aside before watching this and it was still weak.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game to take your mind off everything. Challenging but easy to understand, tough enough to be interesting and easy enough to not take too much time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It does its job very nicely. I like the simplicity of it.  Easy to set and check. The alarm is not jarring.  I am very glad I found this one.
B00B9366VO|5.0|As a child of the 80s and 90s, I never really appreciated the studio that brought me the major rock influences in my life. As I have played and pursued music in the 90s and 00s, I loved learning about the sound board and musician's experiences in this studio. I am very glad Dave produced this documentary.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I've played nearly every race game available on the Kindle and I've not played one more fun than this one. I would highly recommend buying this game if you enjoy racing games. It's not overly easy or difficult. I don't think you'll get bored with this one playing it all the way to the end. I did find it somewhat confusing when I first started playing and trying to get around within the first page but it didn't take long to find my way around, now I'm fine with it. You won't regret buying this one if you enjoy racing games. ROCK ON WITH YOUR BAD SELF ON THIS ONE.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app works amazingly! I use it for power outages, reading,and as a light source that saves me money. I highly recommend this app! :)
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth Hart has a truly remarkable voice. And Joe Bonamassa is an amazing guitar player. These two really compliment each other. After listening to this album I have purchased the other album these two did (Seesaw) and every other CD that Beth Hart has done. And I am sure I will be purchasing more of Joe's music as well.
B005QUQP76|5.0|I love the sniper button that helps makes aiming easier, cool look, very aesthetically pleasing, very ergonomic, nice braided cord.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|I read where Joe Bonamassa asked Beth Hart to be on this album as well as Don't Explain. Really fantastic music. He could have not made a better choice for a female vocalist. This woman has been blessed with a very amazing voice! And Joe Bonamassa is a very very talented guitar player. Excellent CD!!!!!!
B0000026NC|5.0|I originally had this album after seeing Pink Floyd back in 1987. Its just as incredible to hear now as it was back then and reminds me of the experience of seeing Pink Floyd Live.<br />It was Shipped to me as promised, Just as if I bought it right off the shelf, in perfect condition.
B000EXZI14|5.0|Both the Silver Spoons book and the BeeGees CD were great purchases.  Can't wait to start making some of the recipes in the book.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|This is the best series of books I've read in a while! Wonderfully entertaining, charming, and laugh out loud funny! I was so sad to read the last one!
B00F35BV64|5.0|I love all of the Star Trek movies and this one did not disappoint me.  Love some of the scenes that brought back some of the old series.  The acting was good and the they cast the crew well.
B0012ELLB0|5.0|This album is an important piece of music for me.  Whenever I listen to to it I listen through the whole album.  For me it let's me connect to my feelings in ways I can not describe.  I love it.
034580404X|5.0|This is my 3rd time buying this trilogy. I received mine as a Christmas present. Then my daughter wanted to borrow it so I bought her one because my books do not leave me. Now my step-daughter wanted to borrow them so I bought this. Definitely a MUST READ
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool it updates u are Steve added gender man mine<br />Updated and so cool recommend people for this game nice texture<br />Check your internet my name is McKinney play online with me.
B003VANOFY|5.0|After the first wireless headset that was terrible I was a little worried about getting another. This turned out to work perfectly as soon as they were connected and I haven't had a problem since. The buttons are in super convenient places and everything sounds great. I do a lot of game recording and the mic sounds good as well zero complaints 100% happy..<br /><br />Edit: it's been a few years and this thing is still going strong. We just got another one for our second computer.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The story is told by Death, and who better to spin a story about WWII  and Hitlers Germany. The difference is that this is seen through the eyes and hearts of regular people, living the best they could with very little. The story is riveting, sad, and rewarding at the same time. I highly recommend  this book
B005LAII4E|4.0|This was pretty good.  I was disappointed the Channing Tatum wasn't in it more.  Since he was the main character last time I assumed he was in this one as well.  Oh well.  Good movie, some crazy and therefore unbelievable fight scenes but enjoyable nonetheless.
0767812387|5.0|this is a very good movie, I bough it to show to my Spanish students and they really love watching it.
B009O07NDY|5.0|The hobbit has been one of our favorites for years, and the first movie didn't disappoint us at all ... it was great!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|It. Is very funny!! I  crack up all the time!!! Everyone. Should try this fun app!! I love laughing and making my friends bust a gut laughing!!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Certainly a fabulous fantasy, highly entertaining.  Very likeable hero and heroin, taking the best life would offer them as a couple.
B00EZZ77ZM|3.0|Not my favorite Jack Johnson album, but not my least favorite either.  Check out Tape Deck and Washin Dishes.  The record on the whole was really kind of melancholy for what I've come to expect from Jack Johnson. Not great, not bad...just average.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love my alarm clock Easy to use and full of features<br />Highly recommend this app. I deleted another but will keep this one.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I downloaded it and played a few times and since then have been unable to open it.  Not sure why.
B00B8R1NP0|3.0|This was a bit dark and sad.  It was an interesting book and definitely<br />a change of pace.  suspenseful and disturbing.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I love playing Angry Birds, but each time I have updated Star Wars, my Kindle Fire and app crash. I lose the game, my progress, etc. when I re-install the game, there is NO UPDATE!<br /><br />UGH!
B00A285OOW|5.0|My wife loves this series.  Once she started reading this book she would not put it down.  This book was true to the series.
0761172726|4.0|I buy a few every year for me, family and friends.  We like it and find it very useful to be able to have a look at a whole month.<br />I would like it even more if the boxes were even larger.  The date number doesn't need to be that big.<br />Also, I would love a version in French with the saints, etc.<br />Overall, very good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so f***ing awesome i love it although they need to add creative nighttime,redstone and commands other than that its great:)
B009C7JS14|5.0|Gives very clean n correct forecast.<br />Ads are annoying but if Australian user can NOT purchases due to<br />Geographically restrictions.
B00DR98EYK|5.0|I'm always dubious when there is a lot of fuss and hype about a new album from an \\"exciting new band\\" because it's often just very ordinary stuff being cleverly marketed.  Not here, though.  I tried this without much expectation and was very impressed.<br /><br />London Grammar's sound is haunting and mournful with generally restrained but very smart production so that these songs shine like melancholy gems.  They are tuneful and quite varied, and although they're about well-worn themes they treat them with a lyrical originality which is very refreshing.  I find lines like \\"Stay awake with me...\\" very evocative, for example.  The instrumental work is very good, and Hannah Reid's vocals are both ætherial and powerful by turns - I was reminded of Judy Tzuke in some places and Annie Lennox in others - and she radiates emotional tenderness and integrity.  I'm just an old git now, but listening to this, I was suddenly nursing a bruised and yearning young heart again.<br /><br />This is a little bit of class, and I suspect will become one of those albums whose sound defines a year for many people.  Very warmly recommended.
B003G93ZCM|5.0|I met Mr Cernan at OshKosh in the bomb bay of FIFI in 2012, I told him I had just finished reading Buzz Aldrin's book Magnificent Desolation, we snapped a photo together, He shook my hand and said now read mine, I'll take you there! Gene you were right. Thanks for sharing with me a fantastic life, and a look inside the soul of a astronaut.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I love this case.  It protects my Kindle Fire HD, the stand works great, it is sturdy and slick.  If I had one complaint about this it would be that you have to choose if you would rather have the camera at the top of the screen when using it in stand position, or if you want to charge your kindle.  Since I use mine to video chat which can use a lot of battery power, this can be a little bothersome if a conversation lasts for more than a few minutes.  This is not exactly the case makers fault, but part of the kindle design.  However, along the same lines, if you put your Kindle in the case where the camera is towards the top, you have to leave the case open to charge at any time.  A small cutout along the spine of the case would maintain the integrity of the case and fix this issue.  If that was done, this would be a 5 star case all day!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|This movie was amazing! It is a classic story to begin with, but the way the actors brought each character to life in a setting that is a visual Disneyland made this a movie I could watch over and over again.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|Great horror movie one of the best. The first time I saw I was shocked I loved it from the first time I watched.
B0057UA486|4.0|I Really enjoyed Barry Lyndon.  I was expecting wide screen format, but got full screen.  I expected the Blu-Ray to have a choice of formats, but I guess not.
030759565X|5.0|best cookbook ever....great recipes, great pictures and a very funny text to go along with each recipe!  everything i've tried  has been delicious!  barb
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|this one great game some ads but not bad and besides its free<br />there are a lot of different levels.  wish it had a way to shut off the music though I can only take so much of ig
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|ive played alot of games like this but DV tops them all.  now its just the wait for it on a windows phone device
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very clean simple and easy to use. In other words perfectly made and engineered, well done guys . It's a must for kindle .
B0002TJGQS|2.0|Batteries seem to have very little power and will not work in garage or gate openers because the can not provide a strong enough signal
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I loved the English version and the US remake is almost as good . Kevin Spacey is perfect in the role.<br />The disturbing effect of the theme makes one VERY suspicious and untrusting of ALL politicians.<br />The old saying is true, &#34;It does not matter who you vote for you end up getting a politician&#34;.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Had some trouble with set up because I live in Canada, but other that that it works well. I would recommend it.
B004AO4FJ4|3.0|...and gets much better once Moffat starts writing for the show!  The &#34;special effects&#34;, especially for the first few episodes are abysmal!  But the writing and acting gradually improve and by the time that Moffat starts writing (the writer for the amazing Sherlock series) the acting, dialogue, special effects and general story-line are vastly improved and you find yourself really drawn to the show - wanting to know what happens next.  Even at the beginning, though, despite the cheese it's still original enough and interesting that you want to keep watching.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I had problems with my Kindle Fire and had to do a restart. I Lost all my progress! I couldn't find any info on where to go or how to reclaim it. The progress doesn't bother me as much as the real cash I put into it and lost, really pissed off with the real cash stuff I had to rebuy! If any one knows how to reclaim my old content and/or contact customer service......Please contact me.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|Everyone should be required to watch this movie. It is reality! I have been down and out before and also pulled myself up. Every time I start to feel sad about what I don't have, I pop the movie in to remind me of what I do have.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I've always loved this movie, but the commentary by the writer, Julian Fellowes, made me love it so much more. Its historical accuracy is amazing, but the music of Ivor Novello, sung by the excellent Jeremy Northam, makes me feel as if I'm there in that time. Wonderful!
B00BPA2PDY|3.0|Taxi Driver is legendary now because of De Niro and Foster. The picture and audio quality are excellent. My main complaint is that there are no bonus supplements in the 4K release (unlike previous releases) so fans may not want to upgrade. The 2011 Blu-ray release comes with 3 audio commentaries and over 3 hours of total bonus content (it also sports impressive picture and audio quality). The 4K release is a 5 star film in a 3 star package.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround, French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround<br />Subtitles/Captions: English Subtitles, English SDH, French Subtitles, Spanish Subtitles
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I've been enjoying this app for a long time. I even have spent lots of real money on in app purchases. I know these in app purchases are a blatant cash grab but I still bought them because I enjoyed the game enough. Now I have to endure the constant interruptions from advertising,  even when I'm going to spend cash! I wont be doing that any more. What a shame.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Fans of the original Star Trek films will love this set. You get 6 films plus a bonus disc (containing the new 70-minute \\"Captain's Summit\\" roundtable discussion with 'Trek' stars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart, and Jonathan Frakes). There is a total of 14.5 hours of total bonus content (over 2.5 hours is new).

The price is fantastic and it has held its value very well. There are also collections available for the multiple Star Trek TV shows and later films.
B000Y5JFNY|3.0|I ordered this as a gift for my mother - it's one of her favorite movies of all time.  The description says there is a music box, but when I asked her what song it plays, she said neither her or her husband could recognize the tune.  I assumed it would play &#34;My Favorite Things&#34;, but not so.  Does anyone know what tune the music box plays?  My 3 star rating is due to this one glitch.
B000SW2F8A|4.0|but I ended up actually enjoying it,,,,which is a good thing because I had to watch it three time...imagine my surprise
0345803493|5.0|Loved the book! Very detailed and can picture each aspect of the places the characters were! Couldn't put it down!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|A waste of my limited time on earth. A movie that is impossible to follow as it jumps around in time. Save your money and your time, don't watch this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so good! I've read it three times and found it more amazing every time. John Green is a fantastic writer, this is a must read!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is the first book in a long while that had me thinking about the characters even when I wasn't reading it. The voices are authentic whether or not the description of life in North Korea is accurate, which are shocking and almost too horrible to believe. It deserves a Pulitzer and more.
0061122416|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, very insightful and very well written. I like the story and the message, all around great read.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|Where has he been ?  This album is fantastic modern rock with a progressive touch.  Not just for anyone who likes say: the Lamb lies down, or Trick of the Tail, or Wind and Wuthering (peter had moved on - but Genesis with Phil sounded better than ever) this album is very refreshing and instantly likeable.  Wow, Phil must be really proud.  Simon mentions Gavin Harrison as an influence, and some songs even reflect Porcupine Tree's music.  From the opener, which reminds me of Yes Close to the Edge, to the last song, I really like this CD !<br /><br />John Phx AZ
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I recommended it to everyone, it's a great movie and story line.  Wish it could be a part 2 for.
B007EDZ20O|5.0|I loved this book.  How pitifully sad that millions of dollars were raised for the facilities she ran yet her vow of poverty was so strict that she refused to spend even a few pennies on the people who were dying of starvation and poverty.  Needles were rinsed in cold water and used over and over. Medication that could have brought thousands to health and eased the suffering of those who would never recover were strictly forbidden.  While she enjoyed the best medical care money could buy.  She enjoyed kudos from Presidents and officials all over the world.  How pious and long suffering she was.  How meek and obedient. Balderdash! She was a silent killer who needed to be stopped!  She is responsible for thousands of unnecessary deaths! What a shame.  And she continues to be lauded as a healer and a faithful servant of God.  It's just sick and wrong.
B0031RS42K|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, I couldn't put it down, just when you think this must be close to the end, you check the pages and realize there is more to come!<br /><br />I was wondering if all this equipment exist, why do we still have trouble makers around?<br /><br />I know it is a novel but the deception and greed of some of the characters is very real, it is quite sad.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anybody to make them think about their actions and Maybe , just maybe by thinking that this is wrong, people will change for the better?
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Everyone knows the story but nobody knew the day to day details.  The book is very well written but is very graphic.  I am not sure why I felt the need to read this.  Just the thought of what a little girl might go through in a situation like this was just so horrible to imagine that I never allow myself to watch movies or television shows about this.  I don't enjoy reading or hearing about someone's struggle through horrific abuse.  But somehow I made myself read this book.  It was not easy to do and it made me cringe.  It was hard to take a deep breath the whole time.  The story is just so horrific.  But what a remarkable young girl she is.  I will never understand how anyone can go through something like this and not just survive but thrive.  But she has. I'm amazed by her resilience and strength. She is amazing!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|If you are looking for a movie to get you thinking and like having curves thrown at you this is the ticket you want to get.  It is easy to get caught up in and keeps you wondering from start to finish.  Very well done and not a movie you'll fall asleep watching.  If Magic makes you wonder then you'll be really wondering watching this.  A bargin if you rent through Amazon Prime and worth a watch as it is different from everything else you might have seen.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|because I'm not generally into Roman Empire Gladiator movies, right? And I clearly assumed I'd have to feighn interest the whole time and fake my reactions to all the metal clanking and Roman jibetty-jabbety-ju while I kept up w/ my FB page on the sly. Maybe it was the golden packaging of the DVD or mayve the swords and the horses, and all long-haired Mel Gibson stuff... IDK, lets just suffice to say I was willing to TOLERATE it ony because it was only 3 more hours til the Kardashians were on, and it just all kinda came together somehow.<br /><br />What I EXPECTED to see however never manifested itself, and instead, a most intense story about bravery, paternal admiratin and respect, coming of age, a very well executed love story unfolded, creating the impetus for conflict, thus leading into a movement by the Scottish to free themselves from English rule at most impossible odds. This movie surprised me at just how beautifully it was done. Triumphant and virtuous, inspiring to a fault, and a wonderful movie - just wonderful.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a lot of cool and awesome games. I am addicted to this game. it is very cheap for the amount of game you get
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Loved it - expected something way more violent and jaw dropping, but was incredulous at the grace, beauty and message within this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. and I love horses so it makes sences right .this game is so fun I like that they came out with it!&lt;3 this game!#@!#
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Storyline is great. Action is also good. Too bad they cancelled the season. You have to watch it even if you're not into sci-fi. I am surprised not too many people knew about it when it was out, even myself, but i love every moment of it. It's very addicting and action packed.
B00005214X|5.0|There is really nothing else to say about this cd, it is beautiful in all aspects,<br />if you love George, or if you are new to George's music, this is where to start.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Riveting. Hard to put it down. The story is not just about sex. There is a real story here. E.L. James is all that
B000FZERIG|5.0|I can play it over and over and never tire of listening to it.<br />Highly recommend this cd if you are a fan of George's.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I found these books prior to the movie making them popular, and even still, as the fanbase has somewhat shifted due to the mainstream attention...I have to say that I still love these these books. It is hard to nitpick at any one detail. The characters are all strong and vastly different, the plot is well thought out, plenty of suspense, plenty of romance, plenty of action, and just enough drama to make you roll your eyes once. Maybe twice. I love the series and am currently re-reading them because I find that not a lot matches the quality of this series.
B008LA7RM0|5.0|Definitely a more mature work from Endless Summer but still retains some of the lightness and innocence of youth.<br />Great with headphones.  Love it.
B006C45CFG|5.0|Action from start to finish.  This is one of those you can watch over and over again.  Very entertaining.  A must have in a home collection.
1400106877|5.0|I read this novel many years ago and enjoyed the return journey.  As I don't have much time for actual reading, but do enjoy listening, this was a very nice way to revist this novel.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|Wonderful story of love and the quest for love.  Never a dull moment here,  A must have for a movie buff's collection.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Please see Blood line review..........As stated in &#34;blood Line&#34; review. I don't remember story line, but sent both book titles to my reading friends as a MUST READ...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's so much fun, I can't believe how much I'm enjoying it.  All my friends are now playing, they seem to make more Bingo's then me. lol
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I was looking for a basic bedside alarm.  This one caught my eye.  The reviews seem honest, so I'll give it a try!
B00DC3DGSK|3.0|I dont think this is Buddy Guy`s best album !! There is lot of Bluesrock in this album and to little blues !!!\\"Slippin In\\" and \\"Damm Right, Ive Got the Blues\\" is better !!! Sorry Buddy !!
B00A285OOW|4.0|This was a great book.  I think it was as good as all of Gregory's books. I wish th  book would have gone on to the queen 's death.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|Clean fun! Very entertaining! Travel the galaxies with the SG-1 Team! Discover new Worlds. A bit corny at times, but nonetheless something worth watching.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|When I first started this book I was very afraid I would hate it. I was very wrong. This is the most beautifully written book I have ever read in my entire life. It is so amazingly descriptive, heart-wrenching, and enveloping story.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Totally captured me throughout the entire book. It made me want to laugh, cry, and everything in between. GREAT read and quick too!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it .. was easy to set up with both my galaxy and laptop .. within 10 minutes I was able to cast with both .. onlything I didnt like was the wait ..
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I like all of the Star Trek movies.  I also am a fan of all the Star Trek T V series.  I liked \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" and would recommend it to any Star Trek fan.  However I saw a lot of similarities to \\"The Wrath of Khan\\"--only the characters are younger.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I installed this app on my android tablet.  I have been looking for years for an alarm clock that does not shock me out of bed.  This is it! It starts out with very low sound and crescendos slowly up until you wake.  Several different alarm tones and very easy to install
B0058YPL66|4.0|\\"Once Upon a Time\\" is an original show. I really enjoyed the characters and plotlines. I have watched since the beginning of this season. Classic tales of good vs. evil.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works well with all my devices. Quick easy and no nonsense. Keep up the great work. Any other good apps i should try with a kindle fire hd or a quad core android tab?
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a fast moving, compelling book.  Everyone in the book club loved it too.<br />A great read!!  Don't miss this one.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Really great and interesting. This book makes you glue your eyes to it for the whole day! I really recommend it!<br /><br />Hannah
B00C3MK9ZO|4.0|Let me start by saying Leprous is my absolute favorite progressive metal group, even over the likes of Animals as Leaders, Dream Theater, and Opeth. I fell in love with this band from the first five seconds of \\"Tall Poppy Syndrome\\". It was that immediate. They are all the best darkness, melody, and beauty of Opeth meshed with all the best wacky time signatures and jazzy influence of Dream Theater or AaL. For me, at least, that's perfection.<br /><br />I loved \\"Bilateral\\". I missed some of the more straight-forward prog of TPS, but that album was complete. It was almost like a pop album for a metal band but not in a bad way. I mean that in the best possible fashion. Think Katatonia \\"Night is the New Day\\". The vocals were beautiful, the arrangements entrancing, and the tempos combined the best of metallic aggression and jazz-induced complication and experimentation. Songs like \\"Mediocrity Wins\\" and \\"Forced Entry\\" were absolute groove fests. If you're head isn't moving while listening to those, you don't have a pulse. The complete change to a more accessible, yet still nuanced style made me very, very happy.<br /><br />Now for \\"Coal\\". This album, as almost everyone has mentioned, it darker. It's not \\"ZOMG!!! EVIL VOCALS!!!\\" darker. It's more heavy in the atmosphere like classic 90's doom. Don't get me wrong. There is plenty of upbeat stuff to go around and the vocals are pretty much completely clean this time around, but the arrangements are clearly more heavy in tonality and focused. There is much less dynamic riffage per song and things seem more direct than ever. The usage of heavy atmosphere using the keys, deep and heavy distortion, and otherworldly vocal harmonies creates a feeling they have rarely administered to their sound thus far.<br /><br />My favorite song on the album, \\"The Valley,\\" has quite possibly the most haunting vocal melodies ever in a Leprous song, the very reason I love the song so much. It is a nine minute slow build into a crescendo that is undoubtedly as metal as anything they've ever done. Then the final two songs welcome their long-time friend Ihsahn back and show the more aggressive side of the album. Largely though, I'd have to say this album is less aggressive than either of their last two offerings. Large portions of songs(2-4 minutes in segments) are mostly vocals. It's somewhat like Opeth's \\"Damnation\\" in that way, as one reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />The only reason I knock a star of is because I was expecting a bit more. This is merely personal preference but I loved their style on both of their last two albums and I'd just like to see a bit more experimentation. This one is much more direct and, while it has its amazing moments, I just wish it was a tad more like their previous efforts. Either way you cant go wrong. Leprous is on a stage all their own. No one sounds like them and they copy no one. I don't think they'll ever do anything I don't thoroughly enjoy. Please come to Boston ASAP!!!doubtedly as metal as anything they've ever done.

B0053TMP24|5.0|This  book is so good. I recommend it for adventurous, Greek mythology bookworms. Hope you enjoy it too!<br />Hannah 😍
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a amazing game and I think every one should play it cause if they didn't then they are missing out on lots of fun. It doesn't cost a thing as well so get it know!!!!!!!!!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|scares me so much but so addictive.  i recamind it for anyone all ages plz play it wont dissapoint lol thanks guys bye
B00F91H666|5.0|I cant believe this movie didn't get awesome reviews. What a carefully thought out plot about Zombies. It was a real great movie. I was totally into it the whole time. Pretty intense action pretty much throughout the movie. Definitely recommend. Brad Pitt was great and the guys who played the seals were great. Did I mention this movie was awesome? Its awesome. Rent it cheap-o's.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Jesse is such a great character I enjoy all of the shows in the series, I wish they were all free to watch.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Good movie but has the high school vibe. Non the less, kept me watching. Good movie to watch with your mate.
B006BQM762|3.0|This is a very loud movie, lots of yelling, before the incident during what should have been normal conversations, the older I get the more I dislike screaming in movies that doesn't need to happen to make the movie realistic.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I really like this. The pen nibs kinda annoy me with falling out sometimes. But it depends on how you like to hold a pen while writing. I wish it was metal. Like I really, really am scared of breaking it or something because it's plastic. Sonic Screwdrivers should be metal. Not plastic. That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating. But all together, I'm really happy with this and I'll be getting another one for my kid :)
B00AR83PN4|3.0|This was an ok game.  I don't play it often, but its a nice distraction.  There are other games that hold my attention more.
159562015X|5.0|Our managment team has been through all the standard team building, colors, animals, Myers Briggs,  this opens up new opportunities for conversation within our team around strenghts.  I found the information easy to read, understand and apply to my daily work within my program.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This games has become my new addiciton on my Kindle Fire.  I used to always start with Words with Friends when I turned on my Kindle, now this game gets played first.  I like that you can pick the slower camera mode, or the faster puzzle or timed modes.  I would recommend this to anybody, I really like this game!
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|Interesting sci-fi movie.  It is believable and could happen in our future.  Christian Bale was great in his role  and really convincing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Even the second time around, I find the plot is still engaging and the characters so beautifully drawn.  There is just as much drama upstairs as downstairs, and many times the stories are similar, wrapped around a common theme.  I would give it more stars if I could!
B0063IH60K|4.0|My daughter and I enjoy playing solitaire, so we got this app. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that  I don't care for is the ads that pop up every time you try to start a new game.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|love love love this movie! I can still watch this years later and laugh every time! everyone should see this movie. very funny
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Can,t wait to read her next story. Loved the international touches and the tiny bit of romance tossed in for flavor.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Fun easy morning read on the bus while i tried to drown out obnoxious commuter people who talk on the phone
B00000331V|5.0|Always loved this one and it was a big part of my childhood summers. Every party started with House Party! I gave the cd to my 21 yr old son and he loves it too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Delete that crappy news and weather app that comes with and get AccuWeather!! It is awesome and gives you the temp on your top info line(samsung) so you've got it at a glance. Hour by hour with outdoor fitness report is awesome!
B004ZH66XO|5.0|First off, I don't know what the other reviewers were complaining about. I am up to level 4-4, and I have yet to see an ad, nor have I been asked to purchase anything.<br /><br />I have been playing this game off and on throughout the day, on my Nexus 7.  The levels are challenging, but not so much so that it is too hard, or starts to lose the fun. I have played several levels over again, in order to earn enough coins to buy the power-ups.  I have earned enough through playing to have bought the extra slot, the magnet (for coins) and a few others.  Once you get the coin magnet... It is a whole lot easier to earn coins.<br /><br />So far, there appear to be 12 levels for every location. So by getting to 4-4, I have beat 39 levels. Not bad for a few hours worth of play. You have the ability to earn 3 stars for each level, so this adds to the replay fun to beast your best score, and earn all 3 stars.<br /><br />I really like that there are 3 options for controlling your fish. Personally, I prefer the single finger direct control, but you can also use the &quot;joystick&quot; option or the tilt option. I have played a very similar game, Chowder, on my computer. It is from the makers of Snood, and has always been a fun way to pass some time.  It is great to see the same idea available for my tablet.  All in all, it is a pretty good game, and I can't think of a negative.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Pulls you into the story. I can't wait to read his other books.
B00005JKNC|5.0|This is the best movie John Carry ever made. I would recomend this movie to anyone who loves movies and are touched by the past.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, but you have to wait awhile for the tasks to get done, otherwise it's flawless. It's rarely blurry or runs slow. I recommend it especially if you love horses!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This has awesome music features and displays.  I love the sleep timer and the music choices.  I reccommend it.  Definitely worth a dollar.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I was sceptical at first wondering how a mosaic of noise was going to be reloading all but with just my very first try I fell in to a deep sleep with ease and it is wonderful to set the volume to each chosen sound and a timer feature that take the worry out of having a dead (kindle) in the morning you can also save your favorite sound combo can't wait for the purchase I am making now for the full version
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Incredible read - don't miss it.  Covers the '70s through the future, and the complex and fascinating world of the music industry.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|This is a love story like all love stories: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.  In this book it's still the same old story but told with wit and humor and insight and such beautiful use of the English language.  It has never been done better since and it was written in 1813.
B00F91H666|5.0|good film. great graphics. would def reccomend to anyone that likes zombie movies or brad pitt. My boyfriend loved it
0810971089|1.0|I wish there were negative stars. This book advertised as NEW was not new. Dog eared back cover, crease to front cover, white cover margins, etc.  It took about 20 emails to have my purchase price and shipping refunded.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It gets a little more challenging at each level, but it always &quot;plays fair&quot;. Almost! It once made me search for something that was invisible on the screen. I look forward to the updates.
0984183523|5.0|The book feels right. Whether I make it into the top 3 or not I'll have enjoyed myself trying. (With this book)
034580404X|5.0|Good price and I loved the books!
0061122416|5.0|Everyone should read this great adventure. I havent finished it because I am in lawschool but I will eventually lol.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|For the price its a great deal.  After all the discounts and deals I only paid $10 for it.  Not the best but for the price a great deal.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Ordered the second season because this is by far my favorite show in recent times. It came as I expected it and I will cherish it forever.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun game and the graphics are awesome!  I look forward to more rooms being added! It's a good change of pace for people wanting a game that makes you think a little more.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed the book very much. The authors depiction of the characters daily lives through their domestic minutia made it very real and entertaining for me. As to those critics who found  the plot a stretch--if you grew up in a small town or some neighborhoods even in big cities such coincidences are possible and as the epilogue suggests  our lives and decisions are often impacted by people and events of which we are  blissfully unaware.  This book is not a travelogue or a historical novel.  It is a character study with the plot unfolding through the reflections of its real, and often flawed, participants. I loved and respected all of them. \\"Please don't hate them because they're human. \\"
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minions are back in this awesome game with FREE UPDATES!!! I LOVE THIS APP SO PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT SO WE CAN HAVE MORE UPDATES!!!!!!!!! Love Minions forever!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|love, love, LOVE IT.  bought several for gifts.  never a dry eye in the place, no matter how many times seen. should be a classic like 'where the red fern grows'
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a Pinterest freak, and this app is awesome!! It loads great and I haven't had any issues with it. Perfect for when I need my DIY fix!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the story and hated for it to end. This author has written another great book! Hope he has another coming!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game!<br />Liked solving the puzzles!<br />Could play for hours but of course you have to sleep some time. Good game all around.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Awesome movie and great wrap up to a brilliant show. Great, memorable characters that are tons of fun. Fun plot lines, great &#34;action.&#34; Somehow crosses western and sci-fi with genius. I'd vent my grief about it's early demise, but there's plenty of other fans that are taking care of that.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Get it  its d best app for cleaning your tablet  or anything rather, because i have it on my desktop computer to..
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Awesome show. Great, memorable characters that are tons of fun. Fun plot lines, great &#34;action.&#34; Somehow crosses western and sci-fi with genius. I'd vent my grief about it's early demise, but there's plenty of other fans that are taking care of that.
B0053KWDES|5.0|It's exactly that an amp! I like ear deafening music if theres no other noise you can hear the headphones downstairs about including the stairs i would say a good 30 feet. Not even I can listen to these beast all the way up I keep the grain on high not totally sure what that is but it's louder soo yayyy I do receive some crackling when it's all the way up but only if the headphones are on your ears sounds fine with distance I noticed some people say the battery sucks well O bought a spare just in case it does and last Saturday I listened to this amp all day like 8am-7ish pm before I had to switch batteries so I would say the battery is beyond fine the charger not included :( does slide out cause you'll notice it's not big enough for the battery and I was like dafuq? anyway i'm a metalhead slipknot, adrenaline mob, slayer, sabaton you get the point anyways I listened to them relatively loud would be uncomfortable for some for that long! its a good amp
B000JPRT82|5.0|This was by no means a pinnacle of Kansas' music, considering that all of their earlier albums displayed unparalleled creativity and talent with huge sound, but it was a crossover of their talent (which was already very clearly defined) and accessibility. Whether they compromised anything at all, is more for the member's personal opinion. But, as a fan - it's another stepping stone in the journey of a prog band who stood apart.
1781162646|4.0|I'm a sucker for Stephen King it seems. No matter the topic, the fright-factor, nor the era: I'm a sucker for Stephen King.<br /><br />His short crime-noir \\"Joyland\\" is a wonderful read. Always so evocative of place, time, and his characters' life-stage, King has built another undeniably real, and relatable world in an early 70's down-stage amusement park.<br /><br />The story zeros in on a rising college senior who's spending his summer working at Joyland, a small Carolina coastal amusement park, that's more akin to traveling town carnival than a Disney theme park.<br /><br />Devin Jones is an aspiring writer (quite a surprise, right?). Reflecting on what was simultaneously the best and worst summer of his life, he comments, \\"When you're twenty-one, life is a roadmap. It's only when you get to be twenty-five or so that you begin to suspect you've been looking at the map upside down, and not until you're forty are you entirety sure.\\"<br /><br />King bakes a supernatural mystery within a softer, larger murder mystery - several years ago, a young woman was killed during a ride on in Joyland's haunted house. The whodunit is interested, but merely drives Jones ride to self-realization and his emotional growth from young man, to adult.<br /><br />The story contains love, and lost love: both precisely described with King's astute insight, and subtle hand. And he still writes a child's perspective that connects with me like no other author.<br /><br />He's known as a `horror' writer, but the truth is, King writes about human nature. The horror, the mystery, the crime, are simply the vehicle to convey what makes us human, and he does so in a way that creates an intimate relationship between author, reader, and character.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Joyland\\"...the conclusion to the murder-mystery itself ends a little flat, but the rest of the story more than makes up for it.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|This item is exactly what I ordered.  I would order again from this seller.  Thanks for a great purchase experience.
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|Great WWII action film. Didn't know it was out on Blu-ray. It is now and I have it. Seems to be very realistic.
B00820N2JG|5.0|so so funny! there is a need for more movies like this! i can watch it over and over again....
031623480X|5.0|I read this book in two days.  I agree with the concepts in this book because they work.  I was introduced to these ideas in The Primal Blueprint & The Paleo Answer.  This book explains how grains are killings this society by ruining our health.  Weight loss is effortless.  My skin and hair are glowing.  My gastric reflux is resolved!  I give this book my highest recommendation!!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is the best game for 3-7<br />And yes I am 10 years old<br />But little pet shop is great<br />And I like it too:);(
B005FPT51K|3.0|I never have managed to connect to it through the Internet, but finally got it working with my network after moving the router.  Alarms had to be set way low or were constantly going off. Waited too long to return it so will make do.  On the plus side, customer service was really pleasant , calling me back to explain that it needed to be used with my iPad or iPhone, not the desktop PCM.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|The story line was easy to follow along but I feel the main character never took on true hero status. He was a tool for channeling power and I am supposed to accept he was a good kid doing thr right thing and that just never happen.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|Great new toy it makes the te fly bye. Good quality sound easy to use and enough storage to hear plenty of my favorite tunes
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this trilogy because it is a perfect example of stomach turning suspense, an interesting love triangle, and a fight for freedom and happiness.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is really really really really real really really super super super super ultra super fun I love it
0765357151|3.0|The book arrived on time, and it was slightly more than gently used. The cover of the book is that of Will Smith in the motion picture, and not how it is shown in the photo.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Great and fast paced as always. Can't wait to start the next one. Love to see the whole gang happy together.
0812986180|2.0|I was excited and had heard good things about this book but was totally disappointed.<br />If you want a Martha Steward version of prison knock yourself out.<br />Having done some work in prisons I found it to be a fairy tale version.<br />Maybe it should have been titled &#34;A White Princess' Journey Through Prison&#34;
B004ZH66XO|5.0|This app is way better than all of the other fish games. I'm addicted to it its so much fun!!!
B000W4E3OS|5.0|I'M NOT  A FAN OF \\"COMPLETE WORKS OF\\" ANYBODY UNLESS IT'S THE ONLY WAY OF HEARING CERTAIN PIECES. THAT IS THE CASE HERE. I DID NOT KNOW OF MARIA LETTBERG UNTIL NOW. I AM VERY IMPRESSED! SCRIABIN IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT MUSIC TO BRING OFF. EVEN VERY GREAT PIANISTS HAVE RELEASED LESS THAN SUCCESSFUL RECORDINGS OF THE LATER WORKS. IT TAKES A SPECIAL SENSIBILITY TO MAKE THE MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF NOTES COALESCE INTO A SATISFYING PERFORMANCE. I HAVE NOT HEARD ALL OF THE PERFORMANCES IN THIS RELEASE (THAT WOULD TAKE DAYS OF UNBROKEN LISTENING!) BUT THOSE THAT I HAVE HEARD ARE WONDERFUL. SHE HAS A GIGANTIC TECHNIQUE AND GREAT UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCRIABIN STYLE!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR A LOT OF MUSIC THAT YOU PROBABLY WON'T LISTEN TO.
B0058OUJA4|1.0|This game is very bad. I got it as the free app of the day. It is very confusing and its not fun. Don't waste your money on it.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is the best one yet and i have ALL of the angry birds games! I love it so why are you still reading? GO GET IT!! :)
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|love it so much fun. I can not stay off of it. I get anxious for the energy to build back up. fun fun fun fun fun fun
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I couldn't put this book down, once I started reading it, but I found the main character, Victoria, very contradictory.  I guess that was the point, to some extent, anyway.  At times I could hardly stand her, and couldn't see why anyone else would, either.  Then, she would show another side of herself, and I was full of admiration for her.  Understandable, considering all she had been through, but still unsettling.  I would recommend the book, but with reservations.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was very suspenseful and done creatively. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Cannot wait to see the next one done.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Keep me on my seat during the action parts. If you like action this will be a good one to view
0307352153|5.0|I don't mean that extroverts can't create the culture and technology that define modern scoiety - but, in disproportionate numbers, the introverts do. So why hasn't society created more niches (as opposed to ghettos) where we can be happy and productive?<br /><br />Cain has done a great job of opening the discussion - and it's a complex one. Introversion is not a uniquely human trait. Just as some human children are knee-huggers and some not, we see the same among our cousins in the great apes and among our more distant relations. And, some of the liveliest and most engaging people you could hope to meet are introverts at heart. Oh, they can go out and interact as closely as anyone, but time spent that way comes at a price, paid in time away from the \\"madding crowd,\\" restoring the thoughts that have been tugged in too many directions by too many people. I found myself and most people I know described clearly in this book's various explorations of introversion. But, although I consider myself as introverted as any, a surprising number of extrovert charactetistics seemed to match, too. It's not a simple or one dimensional phenomenon, which just makes it more interesting.<br /><br />Despite generally well informed and well researched discussion, at least one serious misunderstanding marred Cain's discussion. On p.147, Cain talks about exploratory vs. shyer personalities among guppies, depending on prevalence of predators. Although she notes how little time it takes \\"... for their genes to mutate\\" in adapting to a change of predation, the mutation happened way back. What she describes comes not from new updates to DNA, but from co-existing versions of genes waxing and waning in the population, according to the survival advantage each confers. (Although people rightly bemoan loss of species, loss of gene variations within species carries all the same dangers.)<br /><br />In general, though, Cain offers helpful suggestions about introversion, both for those who live it and those who live with it. She speaks from experience, not just her own but that of others who study introversion or succeed in an extroverted world anyway. She also offers some travel notes from her forays into the most aggressively extroverted of worlds, the Tony Robbins motivational training seminars. Truly a bizarre and alien experience for someone like me to hear about. But then, I've been fortunate in living among thought-workers for my adult life, in academia and hi-tech industry. Those few who don't have a strong native streak of introversion in those careers have learned the basic survival skills in dealing with us.<br /><br />The basic message comes through loud and clear, despite not being loud at all. Introverts, not that any one crisp line defines the term, form a major part of the world. Our role models are easily shouted down, shadowed, or left in the background. But they're there, every vert, intro or extro, needs to understand our needs and our ways of interacting, and once those are accomodated, the very great gifts we bring to those around us. (My wife once said she like nerd guys. Maybe it's hard for a lady to get their attention - but, when she does, they bring an intensity of attention to her that's not equalled anywhere else.)<br /><br />-- wiredweirdd those who live with it.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very moving story about a teenage boy. Once I began to read it I could not stop. Easy read and worth it.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Off beat and quirky, I have recommended this to others who have also thoroughly enjoyed this book. A wonderful depiction of an original character with a great story line and some very humorous scenes. Read and enjoy!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Its Angry Birds Dressed up in Star Wars Clothes. A whole new level of exciting, fun, far out game play..You are given an excellent tutorial..Very cool graphics, animations and new stories..The entire \\"Star Wars\\" theme and music just add to background..The more coins collected you get to release more \\"Star Bird characters\\" with special powers..We already got \\"Captain Panaka\\"..We have the 6 pack \\"Angry Birds Star Wars\\" character pods, with \\"Emperor Palpatine\\" which his special power is \\"chain lightening\\"....\\"Darth Maul\\" which has the special power of a \\"double lightsabers\\" that causes massive destruction..You have to continue to play to unlock the \\"Pork Side\\" where then you can switch forces.
B000022TSY|4.0|Great Item, Reasonably Priced. Recommend to anyone who is in the market for this type of selection. Get Yours Today
B00CHILW64|5.0|No comparison to anything else.<br />Smart people doing smart things in a crisis.<br />Even the children were made to look good.
B004478AS4|4.0|Great novel telling a story set in Africa, good ending tying the book together, it is truly phenomenal, studied it in class, read it over the summer. One of the great books I enjoyed
B0042X9L6A|5.0|After 4 years of being a &#34;natural light&#34; kind of photographer, I'm starting to get into using a flash.<br /><br />It allows for so much more creative options and control of light... I wish I had gotten into this sooner!<br /><br />As far as the flash goes, I'm using it on my Nikon D90, primarily with my 17-55 F2.8 and the image I'm getting using iTTL are very good. Next  step is to branch off into full manual mode!<br /><br />The LCD on the back clearly shows all your important stats and is easy to read.<br /><br />I recently shot my 20-year high school reunion, indoors in very low light, and this flash with the supplied diffusion dome did a great job in groups of less than 3 or 4 from about 8 feet away. For larger groups, where I had to stand back close to 15 feet,  there wasn't enough power to cover everyone with the diffusion dome on, I'm talking groups of 8-20 people. But, that's not the flashes fault. Just my current lack of complete understanding of how to properly use it.<br /><br />Overall the build quality is solid . I love it.<br /><br />If you're looking to get into flash photography, I would recommend this over the SB400, because as you become more advanced, this will allow you to do just about everything you could want without having to buy another flash to replace your SB400.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing playing it is excellent compared to fruit ninja want to play it again, The graphics are brilliant it's really good
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is season six and I still find this an extremely engaging and funny show. I am still amazed by Jim Parsons who plays Sheldon. Will Penny and Leonard ever marry? I imagine the final season, whenever that occurs, will show us. I find all the characters very well cast. The writing is great and the acting is superb in my unsolicited opinion.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Was REALLY hoping to see the ORIGINAL (as an added feature) ending that was re-shot before release in the theatre.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Mission Impossible meets Danny Ocean meets The French Connection. Fewer chases and more back stories would have helped the plausibility.
1400052181|4.0|I like this book, and the seller met my expectations.<br />I would recommend it to anyone, there is a lot to learn from it.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Best app ever.  I wish I would have came across it earlier.  Great app to help you through some of those ever so challenging levels that keep you up waiting for lives to regenerate.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Have all their DVD's & most of the group's CD's.  Just love them.!  If you've ever been &#34;into&#34; choral music this is a not to be missed group.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Creative and Imaginative. Great to have a incredibly strong female lead character. Much more inspiring female character than twilight. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I like how I am able to sync my files from dropbox directly into this app and the fact that it's so easy to use.
B0012Q732O|5.0|I dont know why but I really liked this movie. Yes, it is fully of inaccuracies... but for something to watch and enjoy the passing of time without thinking to hard this is it. The actor who plays the main character to me did a wonderful job, and really is what engrosses the viewer. But again, I guess its always personal preference... to what constitutes a good movie.
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|The best metal album ever. Simply, the best metal album period. Hard, Bass Heavy and , of course, Mo's Theme Song...Nuff Said
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Easy read. Kept me wanting to read more.  Good beach read. Wish ending was not so abrupt.  Could have gone on a bit more
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I could write several pages about this. I wont. Suffice it to say, there is almost nothing I own that I love more than my Kindle. This app is a great enhancement. I also subscribe to Audible. Any and all books I now have, (over 600), are now seamless between my computer, my Kindle, and my phone. This includes any audio books. Stop listening on the phone, pick right up reading on the Kindle, and then go back to listening on the phone. For free. In my opinion television is garbage. This is my form of personal entertainment, and this app is free. I couldn't love it more.
B000HEVALC|4.0|Great CD!!<br />This is a real treat for fans of the early days of Rock and Roll. So many influences are heard and it sounds like a real Jam with friends. Elvis, Jerry Lee and Carl can be heard jamming, laughing and really enjoying themselves between songs. I was sad that Johnny Cash is in the picture but can not be heard at all on this CD...you couldn't miss his signature voice if he was on it. It is debated whether he left before the mic was turned on. Either way I would recommend it as a must-have for Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis or Carl Perkins fans...it's a real treat. They did it for fun not money and you can tell. 4 stars because it's really a 750 000 dollar trio.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Love this show Jacs is such a great character. He fights with his love of his biker family and his wife and kids. Wants to protect them yet is torn. Great season ahead.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the love story that keep the series of events flowing. Every girl & woman has dreamed of meeting a Christian Grey!
B000NY12CI|5.0|This was a very, very good book.  Our entire book club voted it TOPS...highly unusual for this group of women!!
B000ZP8174|5.0|this is my fourth Crocs pair. first pair was the navy blue original design with the holes.<br />they lasted the longest but finally had a hole on the bottom.  second<br />pair bought was navy blue but slightly too small. third pair is white which fits<br />perfectly but didn't have the nonslip material on the bottom. this one is<br />hard to keep clean. so bought the fourth pair Navy blue same size as the<br />white but it came with the nonslip material which seems to work great.<br />haven't slipped or fall yet. these are very comfortable shoes that you can<br />wear almost anywhere but they're not design for jogging or walking shoes.<br />still using 3 of the pairs for different reasons.  the bad side of buying these<br />online is you can't try them on first. but might be a good idea to buy a<br />size slightly bigger than what you normally wear.  this may not work for<br />everybody but that's how I found the perfect size.  perfect fit allows you<br />to wear them all day without pain.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This is the best offering from Rovio since the original Angry Birds! The graphics pop and there is a TON of background object interaction. The Good vs Bad aspect of the game is fun and was one of the things that was missing from Angry Birds Star Wars I. Sure you can purchase additional characters via medals or $$ but you get so much with the app purchase that it really didn't matter that much to me. Best looking/playing touchscreen game of the year!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|It gives me something to do in my down time at the hair salon waiting to be serviced or while getting a pedicure
0756407915|5.0|It's rare for me to find a book that I enjoy as thoroughly as these. I can read most books in a day or two but I took my time to savor these for a few weeks. Day One was excellent. Like a new and improved mixture of the Dresdon Files and Lord of the Rings.  It's not just fantasy though and that's what makes it so deeply interesting.  There is real wisdom presented in unique and often utterly honest but often raw ways.  The main character is a fellow that you sincerely like despite, or perhaps more so because of, his faults. Surprising twists are not just presented to entertain but to give the story a sense of fate unfolding naturally, not forced. I cannot wait for Book Three. Thank you, Mr. Rothfuss.  May you write many, many more tales of this caliber.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I was really looking forward to seeing what TR came up with this time around. I enjoyed the Slip well enough, but it didn't speak to me quite the way Year Zero did.<br /><br />Hesitation Marks was totally worth the wait. On first listen, it's...interesting, but very weird and unexpected for a NIN record. After a few listens though, the songs really start to shine. It gets better and better on each go around, with the effort TR put into the album really apparent. It's both minimal and lush at the same time. Technically it's gorgeous, and there's a lot more range in both song style and in TR's vocals than I was expecting from NIN. It's especially excellent on headphones, and I'm excited to see how these songs sound live.<br /><br />Sonically it's precursors are mostly The Fragile and The Downward Spiral if you had to choose something, though it really is it's own beast, like every NIN album. Lyrically it's a bit all over the map in terms of quality (as always)- some greatness, some not so greatness, but certainly not his worst. The content is pretty dark, which you'd expect given the album title. I know some read it as a \\"happy\\" album but I'm certainly not getting that. (The divisive \\"Everything\\" may have floaty Cure guitars, but if you pay attention to the lyrics it's in line with the rest of the album.)<br /><br />I will say a friend remarked \\"a lot of fans are going to hate this\\" as we listened to it together for the first time, which is probably true.<br /><br />If you've appreciated the evolution of NIN's sound throughout all their albums, like it when TR experiments and aren't married to what you think a NIN album should sound like, you will probably love this as well, though you may not.<br /><br />If the Downward Spiral is your top album, you're the type to decide that bands have \\"sold out\\" when they sound a certain way, you want the majority of your NIN songs to be loud and full of guitars and/or are one of those that wishes bad things would happen to TR because \\"he's so much better when he's angsty!\\" there's a good chance you won't like this.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I found the marigold hotel a delightful movie.  Judi Dench is one of my favorite actresses and I thought she added that extra something to the movie.  Of course Maggie Smith was great in the movie too.<br />I highly recommend the movie.
1439102813|5.0|I did not want to read it but a friend highly recommended it to me. I am so glad I did read it.<br />You were able to feel the emotions of both the family and Alice through the author's  incredible descriptions and writing style.<br />It gave me a deeper understanding of the disease and how devastating it is to  the victim as well as the family.<br />I was moved by the way each family member was able to deal and change to support Alice. The most poignant  part of the book was Alice's progression and how she tried to survive.
B001I9WK14|5.0|Yeah U2 are severely obvious NOW, but in 1988 they were The Biggest Band In The World (literally) and THEN they reinvented themselves . . . and got even bigger. Obvious, but actually very good.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Thank God that series is over. With every new book, the writing and story just got worse and worse. It just sucks that you read alllll of these books, and she ends it like this. It was awful. It's sad it ended on such a bad note. The series started off so strong. Really disappointed.
B003M6FGTE|2.0|the view was good but the show sucks. Keep enjoying people. I can't grasp show concept it feels like the jersey shore meets the hills with music.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Very fun movie. I love surprises and thi movie did it at every turn.  Loved the magic along with the story line
B003U6BE8I|5.0|love the movie great cgi and the story was awesome. love the theme of gods and demigods  good way to get kids to appreciate a little bit a greek literature.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|The concept of the game is so simple, yet it's a very attractive game to play. I rally like it!
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|love the fact that she sound like a teenage diary and woman feeling all through the album. I love it can listen to this album over and over again
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It seems like the weather info is not updated as frequently on the app as the weather channel's actual webpage. More than a few times the app told me that there was a zero percent chance of rain when it's pouring outside and the webpage says differently. I also don't like the new interface, it's not as user friendly. I still use this app frequently, but if I actually need something reliable Ilook elsewhere for the info.
B00C5ZORES|4.0|Great band have to listen more than once to get with it. preferred other albums awesome. Better hear before purchase
B003WKOTXE|3.0|Very interesting. I enjoyed seeing how babies are raised so differently in the different countries. My 7 year old loved it.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|This got off much to slow for my liking I would rather of seen less of the cadets traing and more of the battle with the covenant
B00CJGP116|5.0|I really like most songs on this CD.  It had been a while since he had come out with a  CD like that.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I have read and enjoyed more than a few books by Nicholas Sparks, but this was by far the worst one I have encountered. The ex husband was such a villain he was almost a caricature, all he needed was a moustache to twirl before spouting his latest Bible verse and taking another drink. The abuse was disturbing, and the redeeming relationship was based on a lie, so it was hard to feel any compassion for Katie as she got more involved with Alex and his family. I will stay away from books by Mr Sparks in the future.
B008J05EL8|1.0|The program never fully downloaded. Locked my tablet. Paid for app but never got the download. Would hope they would refund my money. Do not try to download this app.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I get hours of entertainment pouring through my digital music &amp; finding interesting ways to keep a &quot;flow&quot; going for hours at a time. I have a fairly large collection of 90's alt on cd that I transferred to add to my current digital collection recently, &amp; with edjing I haven't had this much fun jamming since I dj'd local clubs in my 20's! (I'm 41 now) If you love music &amp; have a decent collection, DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It's a No-brainer.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I like Inc. magazine and have read other small biz books but this is different. Most things I have read are out of touch with a truly small biz or micro business. They talk about VC investors, &#34;my team&#34;, etc. Most of us are just trying to get started and have no chance of ever meeting a VC nor the inclination to do so.<br /> The $100 start up is what the title suggests. It guides anyone with a tiny bit of money to start a business they can make really good money but not necessarily become a millionaire from. There is plenty of actionable advice and stories of successful micro business owners so we can try and duplicate their steps to success .Chris (the author) is an interesting guy this book was written in a way that was super easy to follow. Read it in 3 days even with my busy schedule.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Seriously, everyone needs to read this. It's a great book and I plan on reading it again and again. The journey is great.
B00B935SUY|5.0|I want it! Very enjoyable and informative. Great sound track! All my hero's in one movie. Love seeing Paul McCartney playing a cigar box.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|Not a bad way to teach environmental responsibility  I am using this with AP Environmental Science Students to illustrate environmental issues on a simple level and build from there
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Great cast, a pretty faithful adaptation of arguably the best Batman story ever written, if not one of the best graphic novels of all time.  I read the book yearly.  At first I was disappointed at the lack of the voice over, but they were able to work the best lines into the dialogue.  I think this is a hard book to adapt given its stature but the cast and crew delivered a stellar interpretation of the source material.
B000FC10IO|5.0|This book is well written, engaging.<br />There are the correct number of character (not too much not too few)<br />Garth Nix rules!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series, it is so wonderful...make sure to watch all three! Awaiting anxiously the fourth season to start.
1451673442|3.0|I don't know if gratitude can prompt a magical response or make things happen for the better. I've yet to encounter this kind of far-reaching magic that the author suggests. It's not easy to conger up gratitude for all the mundane things that one is presented with on a daily basis, especially when it's been a bad day. Yet, I do know that when I followed some of the exercises, i did have a sublime appreciation of the all the wonderful  people and happenings in my life. I am grateful for this because it was enlightening.  I truly would like to believe in &#34;Magic.&#34; as the author presents it. Yet, as I read through the book, I couldn't help thinking of all those millions of disadvantaged people throughtout history who were told to be grateful by their priests, kings and political leaders. For me, it's was all about appeasement for a better life yet to come. I believe, if we want &#34;Magic&#34; in our lives, gratitude, wishes and dreams will not alone make things happen. It's perserverence that brings magic into our lives.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|We're not normally Star Trek fans, but this movie was excellent.  The story was good and the graphics were amazing.
1439170916|5.0|I am not quite done with this book but far enough to say I absolutely love it! I am very interested in medical research and cancer research in particular...I do have a medical backround but still did need to look up a few words..but totally worth it . I really like how the author interweaves patients from current time with historical cancer treatments as well as discussing all of the doctors and researchers along the way.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I'm hooked! This is by far one of the best series I've watched! Keep it coming... Can't wait to see what's in store for the MC.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I always meant to own the dvd of this movie (used to have videotape!) and I'm very pleased with this purchased.<br />Great quality and made me wish I have a better TV to support its enhanced quality..
1601252463|5.0|I bought this for the Inquisitor and the alchemist, kept it for the Cavalier, and love it for all the bonus information that I can use.
B00632HWOG|1.0|When I get on my computer to use att.net emails I HAVE to go to yahoo.com but this Yahoo app says that it's an invalid email address. No, no it's not because I use it daily at work on Yahoo!'s website.
B00AH8FTT2|2.0|Very abrupt ending - thought there was a lot more that could have been said so was disappointed from that aspect
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The book was entertaining enough that I chose to keep reading through the almost 400 pages.  Sometimes,I felt that the characters stories were way too over drawn.  The twist did surprise me. This is a good book for a beach or plane read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting and totes ridic. I hear u subway surfers but I'm only rating this to get coins. Peace. Love. Respect.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I love how Dawkins brings a common sense view to the discussion of human's arcaic sense of a need to submit to and worship something. As an author who uses Jewish mythology as a base for fiction, as Greek & Norse mythology now is, I too am convinced that theology should now diminish as a way of living one's life and be explored in the realm of philosophy.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is an amazing RPG for the kindle fire sooooooooo much fun can't wait for the next update. all and all great game
B00003CX6P|5.0|A talented Matt Damon!!!<br />I love Matt Damon. I saw all his movies, but this is my favourite.<br />And Italy is the best setting....
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Writing was meh, plot was fantastic. A mix of twilight, the hunger games, and Harry potter. I'm addicted. TEAM JACE <3
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I was kind of horrified that I just loved a serial killer. I hoping like heck he doesn't get caught. What a good actor Michael C. Hall is to go from &#34;Six Feet Under&#34; to playing Dexter Morgan. This was so different and so wild. Kind of like the good vampires that only kill the bad people.
B00AKFG15S|2.0|I have read all three of the Clifton Chronicles. Was intrigued by nr 1, then could not wait to buy nr 2. Was a bit disappointed that the plot was written in such a way to compel readers to buy nr 3. And it's a sequel, and I was curious, so yes, I bought nr 3. That was my first Kindle online buy ever by the way. But where it concerns the Clifton Chronicles, I think it will be my last buy. Archer lost it somewhere after the first 30 pages. Characters become shallow and the plots seem artificial. A kind of resurrection at the end of the story is not inviting enough to buy nr 4 (due beginning 2014), so bye bye 'Clifton Chronicles' for me. Truly disappointing.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|I was bored at the beginning and turned it off. Maybe too soon but it didn't look to be going anywhere.
0062255657|5.0|I knew nothing about this author Neil Gaiman but the title of this novel intrigued me, so I bought a copy. It is only a short novel but I was so intrigued by it I read it in one sitting. It is an adult fantasy about a man remebering his childhood which had not always been happy. I have recommended this novel to a friend who had an unhappy childhood with the hope it would form some kind of therapy for him. I have also given a copy to a friend for her 70th birthday.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this book.
B003QP4NPE|4.0|Set in a world eerily familiar... A great first novel which introduces characters we root for and/or hate. Can't wait to get started on the next one.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Illinois just signed in to law that as of the first of next year, cell phone usage is illegal while driving unless hands free. This seems to work better than a lot if units that are pre-installed in cars
0316228532|1.0|I loved the Harry Potter books.  I hated this book so much that I couldn't get past page 85. I don't find pornography to be entertaining. I never found the plotline.
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|The name and association with Ozzy is an albatross not worth embracing or escaping. 13 is karaoke Sabbath - individually, there's things to praise, but in total, the album is a patchwork of self-referential laziness. Compare Sabbath to Deep Purple's newest album is a lesson in giving a damn about growth or, at least, perceptible movement.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use Ebay all the time I have bought 2 Kindles Fires one for me and one for my 3 year old granddaughter. I did have trouble with two I bought and they returned my money to me and paid the shipping. Then I bought two more without any problems. They were half the price of a new one and refurbished back to factory settings.I have bought many things and would suggest it to anyone.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Gabriel Macht is fantastic as Harvey Specter.  I love the character and the intrigue created by the constant threat of Mike's lies being discovered.  Fun show!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have put this app on every device I own because i never get bored with it I love to play cards and this game does it for me.

B0012DW6W4|5.0|Fine cast with great script. Fledgling Uma supports Glenn and Michelle along with Swoozie Kurtz. Who could ask for more......?<br />maybe John Malkovich as the rakishly brutal Valmont.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love Google I must use it 10 times a day to look things up. There isn't a better app out there I've tried them all.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was a good book but did not hold me like his previous books. I chose this book because of the author and it did not disappoint me, however, was not the favorite of his other writings.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I ordered this for my grandson as a reward for his good behavior at daycare and he absolutely loves it.
B005NFJAMG|5.0|Again quality and cast makes the difference here very entertaining because it kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through loved it! loved it!
B000002GB2|5.0|I love this album it brought back memories of the time I owned the LP. The CD was delivered fast and in great condition.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Now you see me is a captivating and fast paced movie. I was exhilarated with the excitement of the magic element and an unexpected ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie !
B001XUPH9K|4.0|Good to see the classic on Amazon.  Thank you for the Prime choice. I enjoy the choices.  Keep it current.

B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|Why Newly Born Babies Can't Talk and Other Stories is a blessing to have. A very thrilling collection of folk stories that will get any child excited. Highly recommended for parents who are looking for something to entertain their growing child, and educate them in the process.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|An unusual series but very interesting and memorable characters. And to think there are 12 more books in the series! Great children's book!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Being a long time fan of John Wagner's Judge Dredd comic, I came into this movie with little to no expectations.  Comic book fans have been forced into a sort of prolonged cynicism in regards to movie adaptations.  So many poor movie makers, like Chris Nolan and his ilk have been granted access to these properties with little to no oversight or knowledge until now, comic movies are by and large purely trash.  This movie is an exception.  I took away the feeling that the makers of this movie were actually fans and somewhat knowledgeable of the very things that make comic books enjoyable and vital.<br />Not to say that this is an accurate depiction of an actual comic book.  In all fairness though, I don't see how a movie could be.  It is like the difference between Star Wars and a Moebius comic.  The movies were visually styled after his artwork but really look nothing like it.  So instead the makers gave us the \\"feel\\" of Judge Dredd.  The style in which they worked is very John Carpenter and it is a perfect fit.  Recreating this in a digital format is in itself quite an accomplishment.  Their ability to mimic the look of 1970's-80's Carpenter action movies within a brand new filming technique is a great sign for all filmmakers.  The technology seems to work well.<br />Karl Urban does a fantastic job of portraying Joe Dredd.  He adeptly captured the stoicism of the character with simple lines and excellent physical acting.  Urban has become known for this ability throughout his career and was an excellent casting.<br />Fans of the comic will be pleased with this.
