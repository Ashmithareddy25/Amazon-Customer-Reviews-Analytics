B0006A9FKA|5.0|I love this movie.  The perfect spoof on the zombie genre because it manages to make you feel scared, tense, appalled, and happy all at once.  It's British humor at its best.  If the boys from Monty Python were still all together, they would have done this movie, but not as well.  My hat's off to the cast, and crew.  Kudos for a great movie.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|When I first heard they were making this film without Brosnan, I lost interest.  I didn't think Craig could be a good bond.  I chose not to see it in theatres, but it came to a local budget theatre and my brother said it was really good.  HE WAS RIGHT.  This is now my favorite movie.  I have seen it now 6 times.  Can't wait for Bond 22 to come out next year.

B00005JPG1|2.0|By now most already know enough about the story that \\"Zodiac\\" is based on so I won't do into the details of what is without a doubt not an easy story to tackle as it takes takes place over many years and there is no neatly tied ending. After seeing the preview, I was hooked as I am a huge fan of the 3 main actors and wanted to see what a talented director like David Fincher would do with it.<br /><br />I saw the movie yesterday and could not have been more disappointed and not for the reasons that most people would think as I was not bothered by the lack of \\"closure\\" nor the running time of the film as some films require a longer run time than others to tell their stories, but this one simply fails to entertain.<br /><br />The starting culprit is a script is simply a mess. It is very unfocused, characters come and go without rhyme or reason, and rarely achieves the level of suspense that it should have generarated. One could argue that the script reflects exactly what it was trying to do, which could be to put you in the mindset of those involved and how nothing seemed to jell. While there may be artistic merit in the thesis, it fails as a movie must find a way to entertain even telling this frustrating tale. I was especially bored by the detectives'/writers' home scenes as they seem cliched and with the exception Ione Skye (great job in a tiny role), the story relegates women to being who happen to share a sleeping pace with men.<br /><br />I do aplaud David Fincher for trying to tackle the story as it's miles apart from most of his previous work, and while he succeeds at times (especially at the beginning), gets the 1970s \\"look\\" without going overboard, and delivers with some interesting visuals, the movie as a whole simply a big bore. It would have been such if it had been 90 minutes long so again it's not about the running time.<br /><br />The performances are good across the board, especially of the actor playing the main suspect and Mark Ruffalo, once you can put aside that he looks a little too much like Columbo is his early scenes. But then you could put Mark Ruffalo in anything in he would be great. Jake Gyllenhall does an OK job but he seems to be playing himself and Anthony Edwards does not really bring anything special to the role. Robert Downey Jr. manges to create some sexual ambiguity and presence to his role, but not nearly enough to keep you interested in him.<br /><br />There are so many alleged horror/suspense movies being released now and they are all making all sorts of money as they appear to be upping the ante on the old \\"Friday the 13th\\" \\"Nightmare on Elmstreet\\" movies. This movie, thankfully is not one of these cheapie attempts at capturing a teenage audience by grossing them out, but it is not the adult suspense thriller that it is being marketed as. It's more of a traditional procedural, and for those who liked it could be described as the anti-\\"CSI\\" as modern technology certainly does not play a role on it.<br /><br />It's hard to only give 2 stars to this movie as it has so much talent behind it and one should not penalize it for that but only for what it delivers. So using the \\"deliverabilty\\" barometer, it barely registers a 2 as it did not find a way to make this frustrating story more compelling and the whole \\"Zodiac\\" angle in presented in a rather chessy manner and nowhere as flashy as the previews would have you believe.<br /><br />David Fincher is a talented director but here he seems to rally be trying heard to get away from his usual strengths and the movie only succeeds when he goes back to them: scenes of unexpected violence and the psychology ot lack thereof in the acts.

071563318X|5.0|The Zombie Survival Guide presents the reader with a multitude of scenarios, bits of advice, and words of caution pertaining to a zombie outbreak. Written more like an actual survival guide than comedy/horror prose, the book actually gave me the feeling I was much better prepared in case zombies ever start popping up. <br /> <br />Other reviews have made reference to the book not having any humor. Personally, I found humor in the sheer ridiculousness of a survival guide written for a completely (or perhaps not..) implausible occurence, written as seriously as a heart attack. Take a minute to step back and realize what you're reading, and you should at least get a wry smile from it. <br /> <br />The amount of detail included adds to the comprehensive \\"survival guide\\" feel. For example, Brooks advises against using loud or heavy weapons such as chainsaws, as they'll draw other zombies, and tire you out. He obviously put a great deal of time and thought into the subject, and the book's various sections certainly reflect it. <br /> <br />All in all, this guide is a must have for fans of the zombie subgenre. It's engaging, and despite being quite in-depth, refreshing. Personally, I enjoyed this so much I bought World War Z, just because Brooks wrote it.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|Rocky Balboa is the final installment in the great Rocky franchise that began thirty years ago with the original film winning the best picture Oscar. The final film goes back to the roots of the series and focuses on Rocky as a person, and as a man, and ignores the flash of Rocky IV and the silliness of Rocky V.<br /><br /> Rocky is older now, and all he has left are memories of his boxing career and memories of Adrian, who died a few years ago. Rocky spends his nights entertaining customers at his Italian restaurant (called \\"Adrian's\\") with stories of his boxing glory. On the anniversary of Adrian's death, he tours the location where they first lived, their first date and then visits the grave. A reluctant Pauley goes with Rocky but his son Robert is absent.<br /><br /> Rocky sees a computer simulated fight of himself and current champ Mason Dixon. Rocky wins the computer fight and this gives Rocky the bug to do a little fighting again, to maybe try and get in shape. Meanwhile, Mason Dixon's managers are urging him to fight an exhibition with Rocky in hopes of improving his reputation and to make tons of money.<br /><br /> Rocky Balboa has several strengths and weaknesses. First, Sylvester Stallone is excellent in the movie. He plays Rocky as a man just trying to be good, trying to be a good father, trying to please the people in his world. Out in public, he graciously signs autographs and poses for pictures even though you can tell he's been doing it for years. Paulie is good in the movie and through flashbacks we see Creed, Adrian and Mickey. The final fight is done as an HBO broadcast and the fight is really awesome. It is much more realistic than any of the fights from the previous movies. Also, the Bill Conti score is exceptional. If you are a fan of the series, this will be a great conclusion for you.<br /><br /> Now for the complaints. Some people can nitpick about how he deals with his son and another kid that he befriends, but those subplots didn't bother me. Rocky spends the first hour of the movie moping around his restaurant. Knowing how the movie ends, I would have liked to see a little more of him staying in shape, because he'd have to be in shape to fight they way he does at the end. That being said, the training they do show via a montage is set to \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" and is predicable, boring and short. The fight is realistic, but the story told via the fight is pretty bland. Again, minor complaints, but I want you to know this isn't a \\"perfect\\" movie.<br /><br /> Rocky Balboa is a good movie, not great, but to a diehard Rocky fan, it could be considered great. It wipes the sour taste of Rocky V out of our mouth and will leave you presently surprised to see that Sylvester Stallone still has it. ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!bother me.

B000J10EQU|4.0|Great special effects herald the return of Krypton's sole surviving son.<br /><br />Superman returns, thus the title, to Earth after a five-year sabatical in search for the remnants of his homeworld.  Despite his absence mankind survives and is still in need of his unique skills.  Lois Lane however, moved on with her life.  Unfortunately Superman's intergalactic search for his roots and inadvertant failure to show up in court provided Lex Luther a legal loophole to exit prison.  Thus we have our two stories with Superman coming to grips with Lois' new relationship and Lex Luther's plot to finally do away with Superman.<br /><br />One of the best things about SUPERMAN RETURNS is that there are very blatant nods to SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II numerous times during the film.  However, the references to the earlier stories are done in a manner that would easily be recognized by fans of the Christopher Reeve films, but not make a new audience feel as if something was missed in not seeing the first two movies.  A few examples: Superman's Fortress of Solitude is similar to the sets we came to know in 1978 and 1981.  A reference is also made by Lex Luther's tag-along that it appeared that Luther had been to Superman's retreat before.  We have Marlon Brando's dialogue from the first film.  The meteorite from Addis Ababa.  Throughout the picture we also find numerous line-by-line reiterations of dialogue from 1978's SUPERMAN.  Finally, if you recall in SUPERMAN II Lois and Superman's relationship reached its apex and they were officially a couple, that is, until Clark Kent erased Lois' memory of the affair.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's Lex Luther is a much better villain than Gene Hagman's earlier character.  Though RETURNS' Luther has the same fondness for real estate as his predecessor, this Luther is just plain mean.  With Luther, as with most super villains, the question always presents itself as to why a person who has everything he could possibly insist on having more.<br /><br />Brandon Routh is good as Superman, though he does appear a tad young for this film's scenario whereby Superman has already spent several prior years in Metropolis as Clark Kent.  Routh benefits in the fact that he could easily double as Christopher Reeve's younger brother.<br /><br />Gone are Frank Langella's days as dark-haired Dracula.  He is not quite the Perry White with whom we have grown accustomed, but he does a commendable job.<br /><br />Also, look for television's original Jimmy Olsen, Jack Larson, as the bartender.<br /><br />SUPERMAN RETURNS is superior to the original 1970s and 1980s films in terms of special effects, story continuity, and above all else the fact that RETURNS portrays the comic book super hero in a serious light.  Earlier directors Richard Donner and Richard Lester (more so with Lester) treated the movies as a light comedy.  Though Christopher Reeve was perfect as Superman, the supporting characters and screenplay were too silly.  Unlike televison ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN George Reeves' portrayal of Clark Kent as a tough as nails reporter, Christopher Reeve's Kent was an exaggerated bumbling nerd.  Worse yet was that in the original films, much like the BATMAN sequels, there were so many things going on that that the story was lost.  Scenes jumped from one to another without explanation or any logical transition.  The only constant was that the conclusion of the movie would find Superman soaring over the earth and smiling at the camera.<br /><br />SUPERMAN RETURNS' only shortcoming is that the end of the film drones on for want of something to happen.  Some of the storyline smacks of the 1990s DC Comics about the death of Superman.  In fact, so much attention is devoted to the question as to whether Superman lives or dies that the original story is almost forgotten.<br /><br />Still, this is hopefully the beginning of a new Superman franchise.  By the way, Superman again soars over the Earth and smiles at the camera..    <br /> <br />Brandon Routh is good as Superman, though he does appear a tad young for this film's scenario whereby Superman has already spent several prior years in Metropolis as Clark Kent.

B000J103PC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I do not have many DVDs, but this is a must buy for me. It allows me to laugh out loudly. No violence but pure fun. In reallity this is not fun, but being seen from the outside your spirit gets high. Fast pacing movie. Lovely actors. In ten or better twenty years you will say: This is what it was like in the beginning of the 21st century. (Hopefully we will not say: This is when it all started.)
B000002KLQ|1.0|When this was first released on CD the sound quality was horrible.  It was fuzzy, like it was taken from an LP with lint on the needle. <br /> <br />This is not my favorite Dire Straits album.  But, if you must get it, be sure you get the remastered version. <br /> <br />When many CD's were released in the mid eighties, the sound quality was horrible.  That is why there were vinyl snobs who thought LP's were a much better technology (in spite of the hiss, and pops).  That is also why you see so many \\"Remastered\\" CD's today. <br /> <br />It is interesting that the Dire Straits would release such crappy sounding CD's when they were the vanguard of the digital recording movement with wonderfully sounding Brothers in Arms.

B000060MWU|5.0|Here is how the story goes. My friend is a big David Lynch fan. He gave me some ideas for his birthday and this and Eraserhead is mostly what he wanted.  <br /> <br />I was disappointed. I knew these movies were rare and I was told I would have to pay a pretty penny for both. Little did they know! <br /> <br />I went online here and couldn't believe it. I actually found them! Such reasonable prices for 2 great movies! I was so excited that I ordered this and Eraserhead right away. They were delivered fast and both movies play wonderfully.  <br /> <br />I, too, am a big David Lynch fan now and am tempted to buy these movies for myself. My friend was thrilled. Everyone was satisfied. <br /> <br />This company is amazing. I won't order online from anywhere else. Thank you Amazon!
B000002GQE|5.0|1967. It was a deeply troubled time: American troops fighting & dying in the Vietnam War; the Six-Day War between Israel and the nations of Egypt, Syria & Jordon; race riots finally spread to Washington, D.C.; etc.  It was also a time of achievement: NASA was preparing to send men to the moon; Thurgood Marshall was sworn in as the first African-American U.S. Supreme Court Justice; Airbus unveils the first supersonic airliner called the Concorde; the Beatles released their legendary album \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\"; and the band known as The Moody Blues release their quintessential concept album called \\"Days of Future Passed\\".  With a mix of haunting harmonies, poetic readings, speed changes, accompaniment from the London Philharmonic Orchestra and an amazing amalgam of songs that are based on times of day (sunrise, morning, lunch, afternoon, evening, sunset & night), \\"Days of Future Past\\" captivates the mind and spirit in its unique mix of acid rock and post-modern classic music.  Best known for the song \\"The Night: Nights in White Satin\\", all of the other songs on the album are equally impressive: \\"The Day Begins\\", \\"Dawn: Dawn is a Feeling\\", \\"The Morning: Another Morning\\", \\"Lunch Break: Peak Hour\\", \\"The Afternoon: a) Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?) b) (Evening) Time To Get Away\\" and \\"Evening: a)The Sunset b) Twilight Time\\". <br /> <br />Overall, I rate the remastered copy of the 1967 album \\"Days of Future Passed\\" by the Moody Blues with 5 out of 5 stars.  Many thanks goes to the members of the Moody Blues for writing & performing such an amazing album (Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Mike Pinder, Ray Thomas and Graeme Edge), as well as conductor Peter Knight and the 1967 London Philharmonic Orchestra. <br />
0375714669|5.0|In this volume of Marjane Satrapi's graphic autobiography, she describes 10 years of her life from her youth as an immigrant in Austria to her return to her homeland, Iran, and finally her decision to leave again. While labeled as a \\"young adult\\" book, its references to pretty mature subjects lift it to another level - the volume includes references to drug use, premarital sex, gays, infidelity, homelessness, a suicide attempt and various other experiences that make it more appropriate for mature readers, which is not to say that many young adults wouldn't surely identify with much that Marjane goes through.<br /><br />The years covered by this part of her story, 1984-1994, saw Iran's war with Iraq and the bombing of Tehran, followed by years of \\"peace\\" under the Islamic Revolutionary government, while the Gulf War heated up after the invasion of Kuwait. Politics find their way into her story, as well as the repressive measures of the regime that suppressed dissent and robbed women of personal liberties they had known before the revolution. Meanwhile, in her personal life, she tries a number of ways to find an identity first as an Iranian woman in Europe, then settling for a more conventional life in Iran, marrying a fellow student to avoid the governmental and social strictures circumscribing their lives as lovers. In the end, she chooses divorce and a return to a world outside Iran where she can be free to experience a fuller life. Like the first volume, her story is a mixture of sorrows and humor, told in a compelling way.

If you're in management getting ready to interview another horde of candidates for a job with a revolving door...  If you just happen to recognize that human behavior is frequently illogical and wonder if there are any sane people left on the planet...  THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. <br /> <br />I'm not a baseball fan.  I'm not a data jockey.  But I heard Michael Lewis speak at a business conference, and was hooked.  In fact, after reading this book, I went out and bought three copies - one to give to my boss, a copy for his boss' boss, and one for my library.   <br /> <br />Great read.  Funny.  Intriguing.  Good stories.  A number of slippery insights.  No preaching.  Do yourself a favor and read it.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|Will Ferrell joins fellow comedians like Robin Williams and Jim Carrey in assuming a more serious, downplayed character.  He's Harold Crick, a really boring IRS auditor, who discovers he hears a woman's voice narrating his daily actions.  And he hears that he's going to die.  Seems the woman is writer Emma Thompson who is known for killing off all of her heroes.  Thompson is displayed as a neurotic, tense workaholic who chain smokes and spouts meaningless philosophies.  Dustin Hoffman shows up as a professor who tries to help Ferrell deal with his dilemma.  Maggie Gynlenhaal plays a baker who Ferrell is auditing and ultimately falls for. The whole thing has an interesting premise but I didn't like the fact that there's never any explanation as to how this whole thing could really happen.  The performances are overall good, with Gylenhaal and Thompson very effective.  However, Queen Latifah's unusually lifeless performance as Thompson's aide is baffling.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Great classic with memorable songs and a poignant message that still applies to today. I cried in this movie; it was really touching. However watch out for Natalie Wood's 'accent'--she gets it for the most part but some parts it's just painful to the ear.
B000LC55F2|4.0|THE PRESTIGE is a sumptuous, atmospheric, if ultimately empty tale of deception and misdirection.  MEMENTO's Christopher Nelson uses his typical enigmatic writing and directing style to weave an interesting if sometimes confusing tale of magical revenge.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale competently portray the two competitive magicians constantly trying to outdo the other, particularly Jackman who holds Bale responsible for the tragic death of his magician wife.  The ineffable Michael Caine plays Jackman's mentor who tries to help him best his competitor but also give him good advice not to go too far.<br /><br />I found the movie entertaining, but wasn't completely satisfied with its protracted resolution.
0446677450|1.0|This book unfortunately aims at the hopes of the poor and middle class with what the author presents as an easy and unique way to go about making money. Asides from the conceited and superior tone the author takes, this book gives dangerous advice telling people not to diversify, looking down on education and emphasizing real estate. His books seem easy to follow and lets you think that you can achieve it just as simmply. While a few percentage may, most people will not, and will have to learn the hard way (i.e. losing their money on real estate or gold because they didn't diversify). <br /> <br />Kiyosaki has a knack for speaking to you as if he knows your problems and that he can provide the solutions to that. But listen, his own facts don't line up, and if you want to risk it, then you just might learn the hard way. By the end of the book, you will wonder, \\"Just how exactly am I supposed to achieve this wealth?\\" He provides no measurable steps for you to take and instead of preaches phrases and easy to remember slogans. <br /> <br />I strongly advise against this book, as most experts in his field would never recommend his writings. He is a salesman, not a financial planner.

B00005JPFQ|3.0|Nicholas Cage is Johnny Blade, stunt motorbike rider by profession. At night he turns `Ghost Rider' who has a burning skull, and rides a huge burning bike. Marvel's comic book character who signed a contract with the devil (played by Peter Fonda, nod to his \\"Easy Rider\\" role) comes with delightfully histrionic acting from wide-eyed Cage and corny one-liners and silly puns (including reference to `bonehead'). You may smile or just groan, but I loved the film for the silliness that I believe is intentional. <br /> <br />I used the word `silliness' in a positive way. Obviously \\"Ghost Rider\\" is not trying to be `Spider-man\\" and its sequel, another film franchise based on Marvel comic with which many people would compare this film. I like Sam Raimi's films, but if you feel they are getting a bit too serious these days, maybe -- just maybe -- you like this film. Nicholas Cage's over-the-top performance as likeable Johnny Blade in modern Western film mood is fun for me and he is clearly enjoying playing this role while some may say his is plain bad acting. <br /> <br />I don't mean to say \\"Ghost Rider\\" is a great film. The film is mostly fun, but it rarely gets emotionally involving. The romantic part of the story is weak and the pace is sometimes rushed and most supports are unmemorable. Wes Bentley's Blackheart and his minions are not strong and menacing enough to generate the really thrilling battle scenes. Eva Mendes appears as Johnny Blade's love interest, TV reporter holding a microphone before the camera, but she is not required to do more than that. <br /> <br />The film turned better than I expected and I actually enjoyed watching the film for what it is - exaggerated styles and acting with lots of special effects, thinking at the same time, however, a better writer and director would have made it more enjoyable.

That is the language of giving.  I did apprecaite this book and found it one of the better relationship books I have read.  It has provided me an insight to myself, one that will help me improve some of my relationship ways. I purchased this one for me and the mens edition for my fiance.  Our relationship improved dramatically.
B000E1ZBH2|2.0|I didn't like this version.  I think Keira Knightly is a great actress but she's a little bit too assertive and aggressive for this role.  In my opinion, this is a little too Holywood.  Most of the women in this version lack a sense of inner peace from the Victorian time.
B0000640VN|4.0|First off, I am a history and sci-fi freak, so this movie really hooked me when I first saw it on TV and I had to get a copy.  The idea of using time travel to tell a story of romance is not new.  But the idea to also show that men, no matter what age, could still be honest, charming and truthful to themselves and others was perfectly displayed by the character of Leopold played by Hugh Jackman.  The only reason I took away a star was Meg Ryan.  I am sorry but all her characters seem alike to me.  I enjoyed the performances of both Breckin Meyer and Liev Schreiber who played important, if not major, characters in the movie and really added to the intelligence of the story.<br /><br />The extras, such as the commentary of Director James Mangold, the On The Set featurette, and the deleted scenes, are great and really allow you to see how the movie was thought out and crafted.

Although I may not agree with all of his points of view (I must be honest I am a middle-right-wing Republican), you would be hard-pressed to find anyone that can dispute that this man has the wisdom and foresight of a man WELL beyond his age or tenure in the senate.  This [his wisdom, foresight] coupled with his charismatic, honest, and direct manner of speech will hopefully provide him with a bright political future.  I wish him all the luck in 2008, and although he might not win the Dem. \\"nod\\" I could certainly see him getting asked to run as a running-mate (hopefully not with Hillary though).  Good luck anyway Obama!
B000IAZPKM|5.0|Let me start with saying I am not a big Kamelot fan, not by choice, I may well be after this DVD, and I do own their albums, but really havent heard much, but now my cdp is playing Epica and Black halo over and over again !     After reading reviews for this dvd, I was curious to see why this dvd was getting so much praise. Basically, when it comes to concert dvd's, you can get bored in the first 10 minutes. I have had several dvd's which I just stop after 10 minutes or maybe just skip to the more popular songs.    This dvd on the other hand is one of those that gets you hooked. I couldnt stop it, I had other stuff to do, but no, I just had to continue watching. The quality is of the highest standard, both audio and video. And the performance, great. I read so much about Kahn, and I was like \\"I dont get why people like him so much, how good can he really be\\". But damn, he is awesome. Highs, the lows, the flow, the feel, perfect. If you have interest in metal music of any sort, this dvd is a must own.     Even for casual rock music listeners, you need to see this concert to realise what potential metal music has without being offensive, without swearing unnecesarily, without just singing about murder,death,and violence and bringing classical music elements into metal.     The direction, camera work, and lighting work are exceptional. I wouldve liked a few more explosions occasionally, but thats more because of the grandeur of the whole show, its not lacking as such. I only wish more artists would give this much importance on their dvd releases, and not just transfer the tape to a dvd and release it.
B00005JPDS|5.0|This movie was truely a different role than what I am use to seeing played by Will Smith. This movie took me on an emotional rollacoasta!!! To see him through his struggles throughout the film was draining and yet inspirational at the same time. Being a father myself I can relate to his love for his son and trying to make a better life for his family. This is a must see film but be prepared when you do. This is not your average Smith movie. Although I am already a Will Smith fan this movie showed he can play any role.
B0006J28L4|1.0|I'm not going to waste my time on this much more than say Spike Lee's movie making skills are terrible.  The only good parts of the movie were when he gets killed and the credits roll.  Don't waste your time with this garbage.  You want a good movie full of black actors go see Ray.
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|I can sum up my review in four words:<br /><br />Music okay, vocals hideous.<br /><br />A longer review would consist of my stating that listening to the singing on this album makes me want to run and hide and forget that recorded music ever existed.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Jeff Shannon's online, Amazon editorial review says it all.  He's nailed it.  Just a word of advice.  When you watch the movie on this dvd you absolutely must activate the subtitles.  Otherwise you will not have a clue as to what is being said for approximately 75% of the dialogue.  The genre and Michael Mann style all speak, of course, but if you want the actual words as well you've got to get them at the bottom of the screen.  Otherwise, the movie is like a Dick Tracy story in which every character should be named Mumbles.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I have read several of the reviews of this film, and I have trouble seeing how anyone can give this masterpiece less than 4 stars. It is really a great piece of work. <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both put on top notch performances as obsessed and highly talented magicians. Michael Cane is superb as the magical-engineer. The rest of the cast is perfectly placed, and wonderfully directed. <br /> <br />The story is complex. Perhaps one of the most complex plots I have encountered in a while, and this was refreshing. Far too many overly simplistic, dumbed-down plots have been prevalent in cinema for quite some time. Seeing a good story that requires that you pay close attention to make sure you do not miss some subtle element made this film even more engaging that it already is. <br /> <br />The only flaw, if it can be called that, is in the characterizations. Niether of the protagonist magicians is really all that likable. Jackman's character is a showman, and an egotist' Bale's character is a compulsive liar and a man seemingly only at peace when others are not. Still, at various points in the story you see a softer side of each character (but never at the same time). This means that you find yourself hoping for victory in one character, then the next -- thus, I doubt this is a true flaw more than it is a cinematic device. <br /> <br />The very end pay-off (or reveal, depending on your perspective) is the only reveal in the film that is telegraphed. The *fact* of this plot twist is known far too soon, and far too 'matter-of-factly' to be a true shocker. But that point asside, all of the other smaller reveals that are taking place at the same time are enough to keep you at the edge of your seat though it all. <br /> <br />The DVD claims you will want to watch it again immediately after you see it. It is correct. I did... and do... want to see it again. I will watch it a few more times, I am sure, before I move on to another film.
0618551050|4.0|Even for someone with a physics background like myself, this is a hard book to judge.  Without the \\"in\\" into the world of professional physics that Smolin has, it is hard to say whether or not views outside of string theory are getting properly pursued in the upper echelons of physics.  Certainly, even from my limited experience as a graduate student in physics, his criticisms of hiring practices, research tracks and grant committees rings true.  Still, Smolin's own work and the stories he tells of others pursuing other lines of research belies some of his own conclusions.<br /><br />Whatever else this book may do, however, it does offer an interesting history of recent physics; in particular, the development of string theory.  Most compelling is his description of how string theories infinite number of coherent solutions make it almost useless as a theory to lead us forward with new predictions and experiments.  If he does go on a little far and, perhaps, a little deeper into the physics than necessary for his arguement; well, I guess the reading public is used to science writing being opaque at times though I wishes the middle of his book would have been a bit more accessible.<br /><br />Still, ultimately, this book is not about physics but about how physics should be done.  The last section of the book, Part IV: Learning from Experience, has a lot to say on this point.  It is perhaps the best part of the book.  Though I may not agree with his analysis entirely (his disagreement, yet use of Kuhn; his sharp line between seer/craftsperson, what science is), it is here I found the most food for thought.<br /><br />In the final analysis, if I worry less about the state of the physics community than Smolin, it is because of points that Smolin himself brings up; namely, that most major physics revolutions come from people working outside the physics community--Newton exiled to his farm, Einstein to his patent office.  Already, the next revolution may be brewing from some self-educated person working out his ideas on a blog.  Who knows from whence it will come?  But I believe it will come, government genius grants notwithstanding.om some self-educated person working out his ideas on a blog.  Who knows from whence it will come?

B000KCHZK6|4.0|While the first two albums were dominated by covers, \\"Not Too Late\\" is all solo or co-written original material.     It's not startling, as these songs continue her pop-meets-country with a dash of smoky cabaret style. Nor is it exactly revelatory. Firstly her life, apart from the fame, has been remarkably normal and uneventful and lyrically the new material is mostly observational. (\\"I have a wonderful boyfriend. So how am I going to write a tortured break-up song? My life is really good and I don't want to ruin it just for a good song.\\").     Still, there are a few pointed lines about misplaced love and even some mild political commentary in \\"My Dear Country\\".     The album has its share of strong tracks, like the Dylanesque \\"Wish I Could\\", with its unexpected half-note elisions, or the trad-jazzy Tom Waits-like \\"Sinkin' Soon\\", or the haunting, whimsical, cello-darkened \\"Broken\\".     The mood is mostly dreamy, lazy country-rockers, quirky waltzes, a little earthy bluesiness and bits of laid-back funk, and there's even a demurely delivered anti-Bush song.     Jones's voice, always more characterful than the easy-listening tag ever implied, sometimes shifts to a strange place between Madeleine Peyroux's or Diane Krall's jazzy smokiness and the sultry, jazz/soul balladry a la Billie Holiday..    But Norah's and partner Lee Alexander's tunes need to improve if the singer isn't to retreat to covering classics again, as she almost certainly will. It's pretty music (though the sugary \\" Little Room\\" gets to tooth-twinge point), beautifully performed.  But Norah Jones has more to offer than this, and the needs of the EMI boardroom probably won't help her find it.
1400032717|5.0|This is truly a unique story in that it is narrated through the experience of a young man with autism.  Struggling with the challenges of the inability to relate to human emotions - devoid of any empathy - and easily triggered by those external stimuli which set him off, Christopher tells the story of a dead dog, an absent mother, a loving father, a gift for mathematics and complex equations, and an inability to communicate with almost everybody. <br /> <br />Haddon really has an ability to create characters and plot that would have you believe he was Christopher himself.  I concur with reviews that give this novel critical acclaim hailing it as a superb achievement and a moving book.  It is both of those things.  While it is initially difficult to adjust to the writing style and frequent tirades presented by the narrator, one quickly becomes attached to Christopher and enters his world, which is often scary, threatening, and much more complicated than we can imagine. <br /> <br />It's wonderful book that is a pleasant read.

0143038419|5.0|A spiritual memoir unlike any other!  A friend who was absolutely smitten by the style and spirit of this work recommended this book to me - I can absolutely relate.  First, it must be stated, as obvious as this will appear to the reader after picking up the book, Elizabeth Gilbert is an extraordinarily talented writer.  Period.  Her style is fresh, unique, descriptive (but not overly so), charismatic and vivid.  While I have not, yet, read another of her books - I look forward to discovering them in the near future - I am convinced that her literary talent is likely to keep her work in print for a very long time.   <br /> <br />This book is about the three things denoted in the title, eating, praying and loving.  Her journey is one of tremendous power and insight.  Starting in Italy, after a difficult divorce and love affair, she learns to \\"unwind\\" and enter into a created time and space designed for pleasure and recovery.  That is precisely what happens.  She is then off to India to study at a Yogic Ashram, seeking deeper communion with her Creator and the world as creation.  That is precisely what happens.  Finally she journeys to Indonesia, Bali to be specific, seeking to follow a prophetic invitation issued to her years prior to live and learn in Bali.  This and much more happen.   <br /> <br />I have purposefully left my summary vague in order to leave the reader the joy of reading first-hand the experiences of Gilbert.  While her journey is indeed unique and what she most needed, it speaks to the heart of every human who longs for balance and understanding in his or her life.  Gilbert is witty, intelligent and honest which cloaks this book in an authenticity rarely found today.  (In my opinion, the only other book in the same ball park is James Martin's \\"My Life with the Saints.\\" [Loyola Press]).  Regardless of your nationality, ethnicity or religious background - this book is a treat and will change your life.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This has got to be the best thrash album of all time to prove it here it is well first the lyrics are just insane and unpredictable un-comparable in brutality to any other album ever realesed period TRUE. <br />second consistency the entire album even the extra tracks on the new release never let up i have listened to alot of thrash albums and this one will never let up somebody say master of puppets bla lets up like a little B**** all over the place peace sells same same same same with all other albums none as consistent. third  the vocals and precision of the guitar attacks are like no other maybe some other bands one or two song hypes but never a whole album never never never never like this. finally the artwork which is just icing on the cake but does very well depict exactly what you are going to get so there it is i proved my point. anyone who disrespects this #1 thrash album of all time is not a thrash fan or just can't swallow somthing so insainly perfect or is just a jealous moron. until you seen them perform this thing in it's entirety right in front of you, you have no right criticizing this masterpiece the cd is great but when it is actually played right in front of you you will never expereince the precision involved so all underage or jealous FAGS shut the F*** up.
B00005JPG1|5.0|MOVIE: David Fincher has become a name that makes people sit up and take notice. His body of work is small, but I think we can look at it as quality over quantity. Terrence Malick is another director who has a small body of work, but every time he makes a film he knocks the ball right out of the park. The same goes for David Fincher, he has not made a bad film yet in his career and yes I am counting Alien 3. With films like Se7en, The Game, Fight Club and Panic Room I think it is safe to say that the man can direct and can tell a gripping and thrilling tale. He is one of my favorite directors and in some ways is a modern day Hitchcock.<br /><br />The film itself chronicles a period of time during the 1960's and the 1970's. I think what will surprise most people going into this movie is that this is not your typical serial killer movie. So, if you're expecting another Se7en then you're going into the movie with the wrong state of mind. I am incredibly happy that Fincher went with a different side to the genre and didn't repeat himself. We open the movie with the first murder that sparked the chaos. The rest of the film shows how obsession consumes the characters and the lives of everyone involved. James Vanderbilt constructed the screenplay so that there is really no main character here. The story shifts focus amongst the different characters, and that's why the film needs to be as long as it is. Even though the focus shifts around a lot we never lose focus on any of the characters, every single one is thoroughly developed. The screenplay is incredibly captivating despite throwing so much information at the audience.  We are with this story until the very end and are in no way being dragged by the arm. Also just as important is the ending. How do you end a film where the outcome is publically known? I won't say, but our characters complete their journey and that's the most important part and it does serve closure. You will not be disappointed with an open ending.<br /><br />Let's move to the technical aspects of the film. The number one reason I get excited about a Fincher film is the cinematography, and boy oh boy does Zodiac have perfect cinematography. David Fincher decided to use the Thompson Viper FilmStream Camera to shoot the entire film on uncompressed digital. This is the first time Fincher has shot digital, and the first time a Hollywood film has used the Viper camera to film in uncompressed digital. It makes perfect sense for Fincher to use this method since his films are almost always shot at night for the most part, and with digital you need less light to film. With that being said the picture is very soft and the atmosphere is indescribable in words. Lighting is perfect in every scene, it seems as if each light in the frame is glowing, there are no harsh shadows. The color palette is very muted and the film captures the time period perfectly especially within the art direction and costume design. Harris Savides was the Director of Photography on the film. He worked as an assistant photographer on Se7en so I'm sure he had a good sense of what Fincher was going for, and it certainly shows that he did. The look of the film has Fincher's name all over it. Some scenes will remind you of Panic Room while others will remind you of Fight Club, and as a whole the film has the feel of Se7en and The Game. The pacing is absolutely perfect and there will be some scenes that will have you curl up in anticipation and tension.<br /><br />Another aspect of the film worth mentioning was the score composed by veteran composer David Shire. I was almost devastated when I found out that Howard Shore wouldn't be scoring Zodiac. Fincher's collaboration with him on Se7en, The Game and Panic Room was remarkable and Shore composed some of his most memorable scores with Fincher. However I can see why Shore could have been a misfit with this movie, and I think David Shire did an excellent job. David Fincher wanted to do a more character driven film in the vein of All The President's Men. I don't think it's a coincidence that David Shire also composed the score to All The President's Men. Zodiac isn't structured like most films and the movie has almost no score anyway. You do have to acknowledge the music supervisors' selection of period songs to create the right mood and tone. I really didn't even notice the score until the third act of the film. Even though I love my movies with strong scores I never felt there was a need for it, and that credit has to go to Fincher's magnificent capability to thrill us through the filmmaking itself. Zodiac is as detailed as it gets and it's brilliant.<br /><br />ACTING: The cast is remarkable. Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance in my opinion. He comes across as a very thorough person who always likes to understand everything, and then the Zodiac case itself consumes him.  Robert Downey Jr. is equally brilliant as Paul Avery, the reporter who becomes obsessed with the case and goes down a path of self destruction. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play two inspectors who are partners. Edward's character quits before it grabs a hold of him while Ruffalo's character continues down the path. The performances are absolutely amazing, this is truly one of the best efforts I have seen from a cast as a whole in awhile.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The film is atmospheric and will envelope you from beginning to end. Your heart rate will rise during some scenes and you will be tense with anxiety and anticipation. The characters will captivate you and you will become as obsessed with the case as the characters are. David Fincher turned out a very mature, intricate and entertaining film. It's a bit of a thriller, a bit of a drama, and a bit of a study of obsession. This is a fantastic movie.driven film in the vein of All The President's Men.

B000J103OI|3.0|Lauren Weisberger's, Tell All, gets the Hollywood Treatment with some success.  Yes. I have reservations, but we'll get to that in a moment.

Her \\"Emily,\\" what Streep calls her assistants, they don't last long, so they're all called Emily.  Anne Hathaway with the slim figure and botox lips plays the swell journalist student with a short, chef boyfriend, living as if they were on a Friends\\" style sitcom in the big city. Their existence is chic shabby post college. \\"Yeah, we're working [...] jobs and livin' in a cracker barrel, but aren't old sweaters and skirts cool? Apparently not as Hathaway has somehow fallen upon the chance-of-a-lifetime job in the fashion industry she really doesn't want for she is a journalist you see.  Working for Streep, a fashion icon, playing footsy with handsome millionaires, and driving around in limos in a whirl of designer glamour, or attending runway shows in Paris are so, so, faux.     Now we have the Cinderella story told to a delighted audience of sophisticated women and their jaded boyfriends. I'd say, okay, get the woman her coffee and make sure her plane can get out of LA in the middle of a tornado or blizzard, so that Paris Fashion might survive another day.  Remember all the little people that make it happen.  I'm paraphrasing one of Streep's restrained speeches on why Hathaway has clothes on her back.    The question, shall a woman have career or a simple life with her boring boyfriend in Boston? Let's see, glamour, maids to wait on you hand and foot, and high style versus family and screaming babies in a small apartment?  Hmmm, what would the lady choose? Come on Hollywood.  Tell them the truth.  Success is good and self-imposed failure stinks.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Children of Men portrays a futuristic Britain where everything has gone to Hell, about 20 years from now. The avian flu came and went in 2008, leaving devastating consequences, a reduced pollution. The war in the middle east has spread forcing immigrants toward Britain which is now the last surviving nation, while it appears the US has fallen into Civil War and anarchy, and Africa was destroyed in some kind of nuclear conflagration. It's also implied in expository dialogue that NYC has been obliterated in a terrorist nuclear attack. Worst of all, perhaps as a side effect of the bird flu(it's never fully explained) or just pollution or, natural extinction, no woman has been pregnant in 18 years. The result is a dying, depressed race, where the youngest person on earth who was 18, has been killed by a raving fan. Like V FOR VENDETTA(but less poetic than that film), the film reflects current politics and conflicts to their logical end-a totalitarian, police state society where any foreigners or those of another skin color are frowned upon, or outright locked up, tortured,killed or sent to an immigrant camp that resembles the West Bank. In all this we meet Theo(Clive Owen) a government worker who becomes, forcibly involved in helping a group of freedom fighters/terrorists, to secret out of England, the first pregnant woman in 18 years-Kee. Because she's African in origin, it's apparent why she has to be kept secret from the authorities and gotten to the altruistic \\"Human Project\\", a group of scientists attempting to jump start the human race. However the terrorists-called \\"the Fish\\" are anything but altruistic. What follows is a journey into hell itself when we see what a country becomes when almost everyone you are supposed to trust in authority is corrupt, including the police. Will they survive? Will Kee's child be the one hope humanity has?   <br /> <br />The film is cautionary science fiction. It's a tough watch but it's terrific. I'd put the action into the catagory of FULL METAL JACKET or even PLATOON, just with a science fiction edge.  All the stars give great performances-Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine being the noted actors.  Also, it has a terrific music soundtrack spiced with some great tunes such by Donovan, John Lennon,Deep Purple, King Crimson and a cover of the Stones' Ruby Tuesday-all add up to a poignant and nostalgic audio experience.

0345410025|3.0|After reading a couple of chapters, I was readily able to remember reasonable lists of items for our shopping trips better than my wife! ;-)  However, upon reading more, I realized that the whole book could be summarized in just a few statements: To remember, you need to make the effort to remember.  To help in that endeavor, associate each item with something you find easier to remember (example: the name Tony could be remembered as the guy with a toe sticking out of his knee).  The book also uses sound associations for numbers in order to remember the specific order of things.  With those two techniques applied to every situation, you can remember.  But part of the key is - you made an honest attempt to remember it in the first place instead of just glazing over and hoping for the best.  Not particularly ground breaking information!  However, it did help me to some extent, so I still give it a 3 (as in \\"okay\\").
B000GRUMPU|4.0|O.k. first thing first, the 1972 \\"Poseidon Adventure\\" is still one of my favorite movies and one of the better disaster movies of the 70's. A rethinking(that's all i can call it because it is so different) in this day and age isn't that bad an idea. This one is better than most of the retreads we have had of late (Planet Of The Apes, Gone In 60 Seconds, and the endless T.V. show remakes come to mind), and that makes this one worth the price. The c.g.i. fx's are great and the action is first rate. Sure the story has holes(so did the 1972 version) and the people are cardboard cut outs( though well played by Kurt Russell, Josh Lucus, Richard Dreyfuss, and Kevin Dillon as the jerk that you can't wait for him to die) , but it all works under Wolfgang Petersen's direction. The warning about the level of violence is well worth stateing again, people die very \\"mean\\" deaths and in full view of the camera, so if you are disturbed by this beware!!! Other wise, relax, sit back and watch an adventure unfold \\"in an upside down hell under the sea\\"

I realized this was the same girl, but forgot what she looked like. I was amazed when I heard the rest of this album. I can't believe she's only 16! What an amazing voice! You won't be disappointed with this album. I eagerly await her next release.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I was amazed how fantastic this film looked in the 2 disc Platinum Edition DVD! It is hard to believe this gem is 70 years old! The restoration is nothing short of incredible and there are tons of worthwhile extras too! I'm glad to see nothing was censored in this film! This is the way to treat all the Disney animated classics, completely restored and unedited with lots of extras. Come on Disney! Haven't we given you enough of our money!? Please stop editing these historical pieces and give them the treatment they deserve. If you must edit them, then release them both ways. One for the poor kiddie's parents who can't deal with some \\"PC\\" stereotypes and one for the purist who want to keep things they way they were meant to be seen!
0786715103|5.0|I had high expectations when I began reading this book due to the praise it had received. When you start with such high expectations, you normally end up being disappointed. That wasn't the case here, this book lived up to my expectations!  <br /> <br />Dallaire's book is, I believe, the best account out there of the tragic events that unfolded in Rwanda in 1994. Due to his responsibilities, he was aware of most of what was happening in most places within Rwanda, and he was also aware of what was going on at the UN and at the security council. He's the one person who was in the best position to tell this story as it happened. He also did a fine job writing it, the book reads quite well.  <br /> <br />The main lesson that seems to come out of this story is that all the people or organisations that could have made a difference were too self-interested to take risks for innocent people. The RPF (the Tutsi rebel army that eventually took over the country and ended the slaughter) took their time to advance since they tried to minimize their casualties, the Western countries in the security council didn't want to spend money or send soldiers, and the moderates in the Rwandan government watched silently in order to save their prestige or for their security. In the end, a handful of UN soldiers (none from the West besides Dallaire and a few Canadians) and brave and generous Rwandans were the only ones that tried to help, despite the odds that were against them. <br /> <br />This book does a great job at informing us and in drawing lessons from this horror. In essence, it's a great work.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|One of those films that was overlooked at the box office, my wife and I were probably two of ten people who saw this in a theater back in 94'. We almost passed up seeing it as the name just sounded boring. I'm so glad we took a  chance because this is one of the greatest movies ever made! So much more than a prison film, this movie is an inspirational triumph of the human soul.<br /><br />A movie that can be watched over and over again with a great cast and story. It will keep you engrossed from beginning to end. A story about friendship, endurance, compassion and most of all hope! If I had to list 50 films that I could not live without, this would easily be on that list. Morgan Freeman acting and doing a narrative?!.... you know it's going to be good! This guy could recite the phone book and make it interesting ;-) I recently bought the Blu Ray edition and it is a huge improvement in picture and audio, but the extras are carried over from the 2 disc edition. It's a worthy upgrade for the film transfer quality. How the heck did Forrest Gump beat this out for best picture????!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I am amazed at how Bob Dylan keeps producing amazing albums year after year.  Really it is not that surprizing since, like Zappa before him, Dylan can call on the best musicians around.  When you combine a genius lyric writer like Dylan and great musicians, you come up with great songs.   <br /> <br />Depending on my mood, I think Blonde on Blonde or Highway 61 Revisited is the greatest album by Dylan but at times, such as days which don't get above 12 degrees outside, I almost prefer his newer records. <br /> <br />That is a sign of a great artist, that he can to produce great material.  I just wish he would branch out into World music as Ry Cooder and Peter Gabriel have.  That would be really interesting!
032147404X|3.0|Good book for the beginner. Does not go into enough detail. The first 5 pages are the only thing I got from this book. I am not saying it is not worth the money ( for around $10.00). I just think he just wanted to get a book out to sell because he needed some fast cash. Each page has about 1 to 2 paragraphs on it along with a beautiful picture. I think he could have given the setting he used on his camera and the setting and placement of his flash for taking that shoot. That would have been the s$!t, along with the description.  From what I read about the book it says he will tell you all the secrets that the pro will not tell you. I only found about 4 one really good one that I just never though of. I guess that is worth about $10.00 I guess. To me just a bunch of fluff and showing off what pictures he can take not telling where the flash was placed or the f stop and the shutter speed that is not to techy  I think most just starting out photographers could grasp that. It just pissed me off I was all excited to finally find out how the pros do it and he basically tells you what tripod to use what time of day (not hard to figure that one out) to shoot were to angle your camera, shoot in the shade not in direct sun light, things like that. Things you can ask the guy at Walmart selling cameras. Oh and buy the good lenses. This is all common knowledge to me I don't know about the rest of you. Just a bunch of fluff to me. I guess I will keep searching for the holy photo book grail. <br />If you can find this book for $10.00 or less I say get it and add it to your collection one or two things might be useful. I am just a little disappointed. I guess the saying is still correct you get what you pay for. <br />I know there is a book out there that has what I am looking for and I will keep searching. I know you all are thinking go to class for this become an intern for some great photographer. I say come on be nice!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I think someday we will look back at Al Gore as the guy who saved us all - that is if we wise up and heed his warnings. I was impressed with his tireless approach, and patient, hopeful demeanor. If you are a global warming sceptic, I dare you to watch this movie. See if it doesn't make you want to buy a Prius and some energy efficient lightbulbs.  <br /> <br />I know there are some Republicans who argue that higher MPG standards and environmental laws are bad for corporations and therefore bad for the economy, but I honestly can't think of anything worse for the economy than mass environmental chaos. Just think of it this way, if global warming isn't real and we find alternative energy sources, and learn to take care of the planet better, what have we lost? If global warming is real (and even that crazy George Bush is acknowledging it now) and we don't act, where will we be? Let's clean up our act. It is not that hard. Thanks Al Gore!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|March 6th, 2007 has come and gone and so has the latest release date for 'Chinese Democracy'. I sit here and ponder on perhaps the greatest hard rock band in history and what it once was.More than a  decade has gone by since the 'breakup' and this greatest album never made could have been the best thing to happen to the limping and almost broke music biz. A real tragedy because the tracks that have 'leaked' out on French websites and other bootlegs are very well done. Axl and his current Gunners recently performed them live on their US Tour.(Outstanding in every way possible-also performing for no less than 3 hours!) No doubts about Axl: He's still the most amazing vocalist alive with his tremendous range and charisma.So what the hell happened? Was it the constant firings of execs, Axl running over the sample CD's with his silver Ferarri,the revolving door of musicians that couldn't handle 'The Dictatorship' of working under Axl's demands:(16 takes of one solo from one song delivered to Axl each day) or was it the unpaid royalties, lawsuits,and past-life therapy sessions? Perhaps it was the life-sized chicken coop that had to be built for Buckethead to record in, made out of real chicken-wire and plywood or the impromptu trips to Disneyland Axl had to take with poor Buckethead so he wouldn't quit the band? Whatever the reason is, it looks like the plug has been officially pulled by Geffen and Interscope. At one time Axl had envisioned it as a 'trilogy'. I'm just thankful for the 4 or so 'new' tracks. As for any others? Who knows? I was lucky just to be able to see GNR perform in L.A. ( Axl cancelled the remaining San Diego and Sacramento shows ).Finally, I think that history will be kind to the Axl/GNR Legacy showing them as the rock icons they deserve to be.
B000089QEN|5.0|Okay, I haven't seen the newer version with Reese Witherspoon or read the book, so maybe I'm not completely qualified to write a review on this film. But I loved it so much I just can't resist! Natasha Little is fantastic as Becky Sharp, although at the end we are sort of left wondering if she is really good at heart, despite all her appearances of being selfish and uncaring, or if she helped Amelia get Amelia's guy for her (Becky's) own benefit.<br /><br />And Frances Grey is wonderful as Amelia Sedley, which leads to... William Dobbin. I don't know how he does it, but Philip Glenister just played that part perfectly. Here's why: When he is first introduced, I looked at him and thought, \\"Ew, why does he keep looking at Amelia that way? He's not even that good looking!\\" And hoped wildly that he would not stay in the story. But by the end, he was completely embedded in my mind as THE ONLY guy for A, and suddenly he seemed amzingly attractive. When an actor can do that, it just blows my mind. My sister wants to marry his portrayal of William Dobbin.<br /><br />On another note, the sets, costumes, and score (especially the score!) are beautiful and realistic. I loooove the music in this film! I can't say enough good things about it. Or the rest of the movie, for that matter. I highly recommend it!!!! It's one of my favorites, right up there with Pride & Prejudice (1996). Every aspect of it is fantastic. You must see it!
B000FFJ85I|3.0|Seems this review can hardly stand as much more than a verdict of a binary question: which conclusion will I spout? \\"For every step backward there's a step forward\\" or \\"for every step forward there's a step backward\\"? Like any partner to the age-old \\"glass of water\\" metaphor, it's an empty question, impossible to address either objectively or informatively. I'll say this about Decemberunderground, however. Its steps are larger, nay, more consequential than those taken on 2003's (rather impulsively, in my opinion) \\"classic\\"-tagged Sing the Sorrow. That album, with a handful of singles and critical acclaim, was seen as a totally premeditated stylistic leap, and is remembered to this day for overcoming the necessarily petty doom `n' gloom of their hardcore goth roots. Some fans were disappointed, but the album was no more \\"poppy\\" than it was happy. At its best, it simply sounded vital, a godsend for any band singing about sins and blood. <br /> <br />But though Sing the Sorrow was solid and a definitive statement of purpose in many ways, it was not a bona fide magnum opus, (if you'll excuse the Latinus ad nauseam) and neither, I'm cheerless to say, is Decemberunderground. I suppose that would be too good to be true. Apparently Davey Havok et al haven't yet acknowledged their capacity for resonance, because instead of taking their success slowly they continue to squirm in style and songwriting. Time and time again, their successes boil down to Havok's vocals and what he twists them into. It's tough to explain why alone his paper-thin nasal tones can sound so bleak and fragile and yet in layers - while his peers rarely manage more than \\"drunken graduation party\\" ambiance - they have the conviction of a fascist army. I swear I thought of it before seeing the \\"Miss Murder\\" video. \\"Silver and Cold\\" alone had so much presence that (and I'm as guilty as any) it's no surprise people saw the album as a perfectly initiated new chapter in their careers. The context of Decemberunderground illuminates that album's relative lack of ambition, because this time they really went for a leap - in several directions at once. <br /> <br />This being an album defined more by its chilly expanses than the ever-tumbling momentum of its predecessor, uptempo tracks feel more like lip service than ever. \\"Kill Caustic\\" and \\"Affliction\\" are veritable rehashes of \\"Dancing Through Sunday\\" in their efforts to lace together smooth albeit compressed hooks with verses of earthy screams. The infamous synthetic elements (drum machines, electronics, ethereal choirs) are actually not needlessly schmaltzy in and of themselves. When they dominate, such as in \\"The Interview\\" and the \\"Affliction\\" breakdown, they have enough emotional focus to avoid superfluity; meanwhile, when they're smoothly integrated into standout tracks, such as the brief multidimensional pops of the \\"Miss Murder\\" drum machine or the ratting reverb in \\"Love Like Winter,\\" the result is the most significant music the band has ever made. And indeed, Havok's signature vocal monoliths blast through enough songs that I'm almost biting my nails about whether it's less conscious moderation than mere songwriter's block. <br /> <br />The sad truth is, then, that Decemberunderground's downfall isn't its restless style per se inasmuch as a restless style without an exoskeleton. Things start to feel amiss around \\"The Missing Frame,\\" which is the beginning of the end for the tragically frontloaded album. Sure, it's conceptually disenchanting when the army of Zion breaks down into an 80s-dancehall rave (\\"37mm\\") but aesthetically it's less appealing to people than the worst Sing the Sorrow tracks simply because people would rather have dirt on them than syrup. Losing substance without corking style can be a real mess - just ask Coldplay or the Flaming Lips - so in that sense it's a relief that AFI still have it in them. Decemberunderground hits more powerful apexes and more depressing nadirs than Sing the Sorrow, butit feels more than ever like a band testing their strengths, figuring out a direction, and preparing to make that masterpiece they surely have in them. Hell, I'd wait five years for it, `cause the best of this album isn't all that easy to outgrow.
1563894696|4.0|Writer Jeph Loeb along with artist Tim Sale drag us kicking and screaming through a full year of criminal turnoil in Gotham in \\"Batman: the long halloween\\".  A killer who 'makes the most of the holidays' lurks, throwing suspicion everywhere and bringing the crazies out of the woodwork (the Joker doesn't want to be knocked off his pedestal as the 'craziest killer in Gotham' so he gets into the act).  In true mystery novel manner the reader questions the sanity of even the 'most sane' characters.  While not being a huge Batman fan, with the exception of the ElseWorlds TP's, I found this to be a truly enjoyable read and recommend it highly.
0671015206|5.0|One of my favorite things about reading is the feeling of satisfaction I get from learning. Simple enough statement, I guess. It is really just an appreciation for what it took to write the book, compile the facts, getting published. In the case of this book, the perspective gained validates the purchase completely. Insightful.
B000L212HC|4.0|After reading the reviews I had high expectations fro this movie, and for once I wasn't disappointed.  This is the movie that got me to buy a Blu-Ray player after owning an HD DVD player since its launch last April.  This is an entertaining movie with lots of plot twists, mystery, and intrigue.  Couple that with an all-star cast including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson and you have the ingredients for a great movie.  Hugh surprisingly holds his own and the movie kept my interest.  The movie falls back on some supernatural silliness at the end, which is the only low point of the movie.  As much as I liked this one, I liked The Illusionist a bit better.  The Blu-Ray picture quality was OK, but the movie is mostly dim indoor scenes, which do not show as dramatic an improvement over DVD as bright outdoor scenes.
B0007KTBIU|4.0|great storyline - a bit of history in animation . teach the children while watching a great film. The music is very well done and a great film to watch.
B00005JKJA|3.0|But I round down because it doesn't deserve a four.  It was a good film, it held my attention for the most part, and if you're going to watch a David Lynch film you have to expect some unfinished story lines, some confusion, some weirdness, because it's David Lynch.  He's an artist not a filmmaker, he's an absurdist, who places his absurdities in reality.  He's quite brilliant in doing it.  I give it three, as for my personal taste.  I can appreciate its brilliance, I can appreciate it's uniqueness, I just personally did not completely like it.

0743496728|5.0|In 'Nineteen Minutes' Jodi Picoult takes on the subject of school shootings. In it she spins a tale of hatred so deep that it can only be called mental illness. She describes the killer, a high school student who has been bullied since kindergarten by his peers and his atheletic older brother.   <br /> <br />In Ms. Picoult's story the child is captured (by a detective from one of her earlier stories) rather than killed as is more usual. This gives her a chance to investigate his motives, his thinking. The story is complicated by the interaction of the Judge in the case and the Judge's daughter being a key witness to the killings but who can't or won't remember what she saw. (Wouldn't that cause the judge to recuse herself - but if she did where's the story?)   <br /> <br />'Nineteen Minutes' will continue to boost Ms. Picoult's reputation as it makes it to the Best Seller List.
0743535308|3.0|<br />I listened to only half of this, on CD that claimed it was unabridged. <br />This note is only about the recording, not the book, and not the ideas and recommendations  <br />expressed in the book.  The author deserves credit for stating his method takes work <br />over an extended period to make the method work. <br /> <br />The narrator was a disappointment. He was very slow. There were many long pauses, and not only <br />where a long pause was appropriate. Several times I thought the player had stopped. This guy was <br />so low key he made Mr Rogers (TV kids show) seem hyper. Each chapter ends with a question <br />intended to be thought provoking, something such as \\"By the way, when did you last ....?\\" <br />The tone of these otherwise good questions made me think of someone addressing a preschool child. <br /> <br />What bothered me might not bother you, or might even be characteristics you prefer. <br />Hence the average rating. <br />
1582701709|4.0|I am a Christian, an avid reader, thus also a writer.  I read the book and, in several places, I crossed out \\"The Universe\\" and wrote in \\"God\\"; the great \\"teachers\\" and put in \\"Jesus\\" because I know it to be the truth - not by religion, but by experience.  I cannot even begin to tell you how many times I wrote the scriptural reference in the margin beside what the authors wrote (John 10:10, 2 Cor. 10:5, Psalm 18:21, etc.).  The Secret is not new, but man that book cover is really neat! This book is definitely New Age and I would not recommend it to another Christian who does not have sound Biblical knowledge so that he/she can filter the truth from what may have been added to give it mass appeal.  There are laws that apply to anyone - Christian or not - because of the so-called \\"Universe,\\" but the fact is - there is a Creator of \\"The Universe\\" and that Creator is God, and all things do work together for the good of those who love Him (Romans 8:28).  My belief is that God will use this book to lead others back to His heart - which is the source of all peace, joy, and love.  For me, this book was a pleasant reminder of God's promises and it urged me to revisit Hebrews 11.  For those who want a more biblical perspective, I would recommend Andrew Womack's: You already have it, so quit trying to get it.  God Bless!
B000HT3Q3M|4.0|I was disappointed when I first played this CD.  Then I replayed it again and again.  It's not the best work of either George Benson or Al Jarreau.  I would have liked this CD better if Al would have done more than just sing background or just did his \\"scat\\" thing.  Same goes for George - I would have preferred to hear more of George's voice.
0446528056|5.0|It's been said that a great author shows his love his craft by writing great books. Nicholas Sparks shows that he enjoys his craft. The simple fact that it only took two days for his agent to get the manuscript for The Notebook picked up by a publisher proved it. The Notebook was made into a movie. His next book was picked up on an option and was made into a movie while Nick was still writing it. I have been a fan and an avid reader of Nick's books since just after Message in A Bottle. He is a great writer. When Dear John came out I bought as soon as it was published. Yes, Amazon sent it as soon as they had it. Having spent 7 plus in the military I wondered if Nick would be able to capture much of the military mind and some of the thinking that goes on with \\"grunts\\" or the foot soldier who gets the real work of combat accomplished. He does and in the process and gives us enough detail that we know he did his homework after his research. Personally I saw a number of younger military men receive the dreaded \\"Dear John\\" letter. Most fell apart, however all eventually moved forward. It's a part of growing up. The way his character, John Tyree, handles it is quite normal. This point, dear reader, is when you expect things go a certain way and they do and they don't. As a 64 year old male, I am supposed to be pretty well composed. Without divulging anything from the falling action of the plot, this book had me hooked from John's return from overseas until the end of the book. I lost my composure as expected and filled up a few tissues. They were tears of joy and disappointment. I finished this book feeling like John and Savannah both ended up with what they needed. This is a great book. Join the legion of Sparks fans.
0743496728|5.0|I purchased \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" today and I have to say after reading the book that it is an exceptional novel. Obviously, the subject matter, a school shooting and its aftermath, may rub some people the wrong way, but this novel will make you think, especially when you read the parts that makes you think of past incidents. <br /> <br />I think that this is a book that should be read by anyone who is concerned with this topic and particularly by those who are in a position of power in schools. <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult's latest novel is a true masterpiece and I would highly recommend it.
0618680004|4.0|Anyone at all familiar with Dawkins will understand the review title.  Dawkin's new book \\"The God Delusion\\" is even more merciless in its dissection of religion than \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" was in its dissection of \\"intelligent\\" design.<br /><br />In many ways, being audience to Dawkin's thinking, as in this book, is more spectacle than it is the affirmation/negation of one's beliefs/opinions.  The skill this author possesses insofar as applying logic to a thought-problem, and the subsequent finesse he shows in illustrating this logic to the reader is simply astounding, provided one reads carefully, without bias or haste.<br /><br />People have questioned Dawkin's motives behind writing this book:  did he experience negative religious-themed events, does he feel that religious types are embarrassments to logical thought, or does it just irk him terribly when someone persists in disagreeing with a (in Dawkin's view) clear-as-day truth?  Personally, I feel that the last motive is closest to the truth, but his motive should not be what one examines when reading his book.<br /><br />Some of Dawkin's arguments:<br />1.  God should not be excluded from the scientific method as far as evidence-based theory is concerned.<br />2.  God and religion should not be granted special priveleges of \\"untouchability\\" in debates or the like.<br />3.  Religion establishes unfair and unjust identifiers for people, especially children, and is essentially a divisive construct.<br />4.  The God-as-separate-from-natural-laws theory is essentially a constructed loophole for theologians to dive through.<br />5.  Belief systems held and regarded with awe for thousands of years should nevertheless not be excluded from intensive scrutiny.<br />6.  Many \\"proofs\\" for the existence of God made throughout the ages are circular arguments, infinite regressions, or just plain bad thinking.<br />7.  Proving the non-existence of anything is an impossibility, and much of current religious belief is based upon this scientifically inconvenient impossibility.<br />8.  Atheism and ethical, moral behavior are not mutually exclusive<br /><br />This is a courageous book, no matter what anyone says.  A challenge to an individual's religious beliefs is one not easily shaken off, for someone will eventually recover from having one's honor, valor, virility, popularity, or intelligence insulted.  But it can be a dire threat indeed to challenge one's belief of achieving everlasting life and supernatural vindication for living a \\"good life\\".  Any reflective and sane individual possesses a will to live, and any honest person understands that, should the ability to live persist beyond the grave, the will to live will persist right along with it.<br /><br />Dawkin's, although far be it from his only point in writing this book, is incredibly unconvinced of God's existence.  He also makes a case for religion being an important cause of much of the world's divisiveness, suffering, cultural problems, and war.<br /><br />This book is not perfect.  Dawkin's argumentative style is here, tougher and more logical than ever.  His imperturbable sense of the absurd makes appearances here and there, much to the reader's delight or chagrin, depending on one's perspective.  Also, his skill with analogy, illustration, comparison, and example are well displayed.  Where the book is not perfect is perhaps best described as breadth.  Please understand that I am not suggesting he include endless examples of religious atrocities or hundred's of pages of theological argumentation here, just that he limit this book to debunking God's/religion's immunity for argument OR religions' various negative impacts OR God's immunity from evolution OR...  This book perhaps should have been written in two or three parts.<br /><br />No matter the breadth, this a brave book addressing a topic where many authors fear to tread.  It will make you think, make you smile, maybe even make you angry beyond belief, but it will notbore you.  Richard Dawkins may be many things, but to be naive to his writings is to be inexperienced with the workings of perhaps one of the greatest minds of the last thirty years.<br /><br />Atheist readers:  Do not read it because it is \\"your side\\".  Read it for the argumentative style, thought points, and because its Dawkins!<br />Religious readers:  Do not read it prepared to be offended.  Consider his arguments, read the peripheral topics, and go from there.inexperienced with the workings of perhaps one of the greatest minds of the last thirty years.

1582701709|1.0|The other day, as I was chatting with my mate Pierre Jesus Merovingian (we were at university together secretly), he told me about this book. He told me that he had been self believing that for some time, this book had been guiding his life.

B000MGUZMU|5.0|Personally, I was terrified as I waited for the Arcade Fire's second album -- so many bands have made exquisite first albums, only to disappoint with the second.<br /><br />But there are few missteps in the amazing \\"Neon Bible,\\" which tries out a new sound for the Montreal band -- it sounds darker, eerier, and thoroughly exquisite. They take the chamberpop sound to a stormy cliffside over the ocean.<br /><br />It opens with steady acoustic guitar, and a swell of windy synth that sounds like waves crashing on the rocks. \\"I will walk down to the ocean/After waking from the nightmare/No moon, no pale reflection/Black mirror, black mirror,\\" Win Butler murmurs over a rising tide of clashing piano.<br /><br />They slip into the shimmering rock'n'roll of \\"Keep The Car Running,\\" which cascades down into a beautiful folky tune wrapped in synth. The songs that follow continue this feeling: the quietly taut title track, ghostly experimental, transcendent little guitar-piano ballads, soaring organ pop, and even a sparkling, catchy indiepop tune or two.<br /><br />The Arcade Fire obviously took their time crafting this album, and making all the kind of intelligent rock people expect from them. But the sound is entirely different -- it's darker and stranger than its predecessor, as well as sounding a bit more processed.<br /><br />Granted, I wasn't crazy about the pipe-organ blues of \\"Intervention.\\" However, the other songs are sheer brilliance musically -- a beautiful thunderstorm of instrumentation, with the sound of a sonic religious experience. Just listen to the crescendo of soaring voices, drums, horns and strings at the end of \\"No Cars Go.\\"<br /><br />As for the instrumentation, it's packed in dense, shifting layers. Flexible guitars, clashing piano, tinkling xylophone, accordion, hurdy-gurdy, bells, dark drumming, strings and samples. The keyboard is the finishing touch, giving everything an otherworldly sound.<br /><br />As if the music weren't powerful enough, we're given Win Butler's wailing vocals, often backed by one or more soaring female voices. No wonder he sounds so depressed -- the lyrics are full of bombs, flight from hostile countries, and the sorrow of living in interesting times. \\"Every night my dream’s the same/Same old city with a different name/They’re not coming to take me away/I don’t know why but I know I can’t stay...\\"<br /><br />The Arcade Fire pour out a powerful, exquisite second album in \\"Neon Bible,\\" one of the most compellingly beautiful albums this year.ugh, we're given Win Butler's wailing vocals, often backed by one or more soaring female voices.

They take the chamberpop sound to a stormy cliffside over the ocean.<br /><br />It opens with steady acoustic guitar, and a swell of windy synth that sounds like waves crashing on the rocks. \\"I will walk down to the ocean/After waking from the nightmare/No moon, no pale reflection/Black mirror, black mirror,\\" Win Butler murmurs over a rising tide of clashing piano.<br /><br />They slip into the shimmering rock'n'roll of \\"Keep The Car Running,\\" which cascades down into a beautiful folky tune wrapped in synth. The songs that follow continue this feeling: the quietly taut title track, ghostly experimental, transcendent little guitar-piano ballads, soaring organ pop, and even a sparkling, catchy indiepop tune or two.<br /><br />The Arcade Fire obviously took their time crafting this album, and making all the kind of intelligent rock people expect from them. But the sound is entirely different -- it's darker and stranger than its predecessor, as well as sounding a bit more processed.<br /><br />Granted, I wasn't crazy about the pipe-organ blues of \\"Intervention.\\" However, the other songs are sheer brilliance musically -- a beautiful thunderstorm of instrumentation, with the sound of a sonic religious experience. Just listen to the crescendo of soaring voices, drums, horns and strings at the end of \\"No Cars Go.\\"<br /><br />As for the instrumentation, it's packed in dense, shifting layers. Flexible guitars, clashing piano, tinkling xylophone, accordion, hurdy-gurdy, bells, dark drumming, strings and samples. The keyboard is the finishing touch, giving everything an otherworldly sound.<br /><br />As if the music weren't powerful enough, we're given Win Butler's wailing vocals, often backed by one or more soaring female voices. No wonder he sounds so depressed -- the lyrics are full of bombs, flight from hostile countries, and the sorrow of living in interesting times. \\"Every night my dream's the same/Same old city with a different name/They're not coming to take me away/I don't know why but I know I can't stay...\\"<br /><br />The Arcade Fire pour out a powerful, exquisite second album in \\"Neon Bible,\\" one of the most compellingly beautiful albums this year.ful enough, we're given Win Butler's wailing vocals, often backed by one or more soaring female voices.

3937406328|4.0|As a blues lover, I accidentally discovered Chris Rea on a compilation blues album that included '90's Blues' that gained my attention. Having listened to some of his other output, my feeling was that he was an artist who had some feeling for the blues. On an internet crawl last year I discovered the `Blue Guitars' album and after reading the reviews had to buy a copy. This is an incredible undertaking: 128 songs on 11 Cds based on the history of the blues. Each CD features one historical and geographical environment. The album comes in a hard cover book (unfortunately the CDs tend to fall out), that includes an interview with Chris Rea, paintings by Chris, a description of each album's basis, lyrics and includes a history of blues instruments used. Also included is a DVD detailing the production of an earlier CD, `Dancing down the road'. <br /> <br />The first album, `Beginnings' blew me away. The album gives you a feel for the misery and despair suffered by people captured and transported. In addition it highlights the hope that the slaves envisioned via religion and the misunderstanding of their situation. The album is especially inspired as a result of the use of African instruments. This CD alone made the album worthwhile providing brilliant blues playing and incredible blues lyrics. <br /> <br />The second album, `Country Blues' does not general reach quite the same heights. However, it is still superb, particularly `KK Blues'. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the other 9 Cds do not reach the same level. Each CD has some high points and some sparkling moments, but never reach the same high point that the `Beginnings' album reaches. Many of the CDs provide a musical style, while probably accurate, does not appeal to my music tastes. <br /> <br />In general, each subsequent album gets slowly poorer. The biggest disappointment is the last album `60s & 70s'. I grew up in this era and discovered the blues. Unfortunately, this CD offers blues that I do not identify with.<br />
0394716787|5.0|I've always had a liking for Edgar Allan Poe, with his tales of horror, mystery and suspense, done in the atmospheric prose of a master writer. Since I live close enough, I've even made some trips to his gravesite, a place that is always surrounded by a sense of sadness.<br /><br />Poe was a tormented genius who died young, under mysterious circumstances, and at the time of his death he wasn't deservingly popular. Certainly his work was not cute romances for the masses -- he explored the darkness of the human heart, love, satire, and the earliest whodunnit stories. And \\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" brings together all of his poetry and writings in one book.<br /><br />Poe's fiction writings include short stories and novellas, which tend to be rather weird -- a treasure-hunt and a golden insect, a ship caught in a whirlpool, a hypnotized man talks about the universe, and stories of despair, madness, and occasionally beauty. There is also his trilogy of Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin stories, which were the first to feature a brilliant detective solving an impossible crime.<br /><br />Most people know about \\"The Raven\\" (which even has the Baltimore Ravens named after it) but Poe actually wrote a lot of poetry, most of which readers never heard of. Sometimes dark, or whimsical, or even both. \\"By a route obscure and lonely/Haunted by ill angels only/Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT/On a black throne reigns upright...\\"<br /><br />And, of course, the horror. This is what Poe is best known for, including such well-known stories as \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher.\\" But there are also lesser-known gems -- tales of a plague invading a party, being buried alive, a portrait that siphoned the life out of its subject, and a nightly visit to an Italian crypt leading to madness.<br /><br />Don't read \\"Complete Stories and Poems\\" all at once. It's too intense. It's better to soak it in a little at a time, so that you can get a better feel for the different kinds of writing that Poe did, and how he excelled at pretty much everything he put down on paper. Most great writers can't boast of that much.<br /><br />Poe's writing is what makes even his least story or poem come alive -- he brought a gothic, misty vibrancy to his stories, and could make his quiet dialogue seem utterly chilling (\\" \\"I have no name in the regions which I inhabit. I was mortal, but am fiend...\\"). It's not hard to see why he was an influence on authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle and Franz Kafka.<br /><br />\\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" is a must-have for anyone with an appreciation for great literature and beautiful, dark writing. wn reviews, so the voting buttons appear only when you look at reviews submitted by others. ***inds of writing that Poe did, and how he excelled at pretty much everything he put down on paper.

B000FS9FCG|5.0|Admittedly, I don't go to the theatre much these days with all my deadlines, but I still know what is dead-bang good (for me, at least! lol).  I have not been impressed with this endless stream of regurgitated remakes this past year.  It's like Hollywood has gone brain dead.  Worse, these remakes are sooooooooo weak.  So when a movie moves me, spellbinds me, leaves me breathless, I am so thrilled to find it.  This movie has the pinch of 1984 (odd, since John Hurt was in that film, too), Zorro, Phantom of the Opera...heck, even the \\"V\\" is so much like the telly series V!!!  With a film striking so many \\"chords\\" within us, it's bound to find an audience, but is it original?  Damn straight it is!<br /><br />This movie, obviously, done in the UK, gives visions of grace and beauty, of the every man wanting a voice, wanting justice, wanting to believe.  It gives you humanity; it gives you romance.  The writing is fast paced, inventive so what was old is new again.  And Hugo Weaving is THE actor for the role of V.<br /><br />Remember, remember the fifth of November...a haunting film that stays with you.  Yes, you will remember, remember!!

0374105235|5.0|This book is stunning.  It is a powerful story of redemption from the depths of human deprevity.  I wonder if we couldn't use some of the same rehabilitation techniques to end gang wars instead of just locking people up.  It might require too much love.
B00026WU7I|5.0|Written with a broken heart, an album that can make a grown man weep.  One of Dylan's great efforts, arguably the best album of the '70s.  If only he could sing :).  As with a lot of Dylan's songs, the instrumental track grabs you and it's a bit of a let down when the familiar nasal voice enters the proceedings, but you're soon swept up in the sheer brilliance of the lyric and phrasing.  You can listen to this album a thousand times and never get tired of it.  One of the big 5 Dylan albums, along w/ Freewheelin', Blonde on Blonde, Highway 61 and Bringing it All Back Home.  My personal favorite, and I'm in the minority on this, is Bringing it All Back Home, which is IMHO the greatest album ever made in the rock/pop genre.  Dylan changed music forever when he did his Ben Franklin imitation and discovered electricity.  Before that he only introduced a theme song for a generation (Blowin' in the Wind) and the most powerful song of the '60s (A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall).  Rock music grew up with Dylan.  He broke all kinds of barriers (the length of songs, fused various genres and brought intelligence to lyrics).  The Beatles could no longer sing She Loves You Ya ya ya after Dylan raised the bar.  Jerry Garcia:  No Dylan, no Dead.  Check it out and you'll discover what I did: that the Jewish kid from Minnesota has the goods!
B000KGGLCU|2.0|Esperaba algo grandioso, pero me siento decepcionado. <br />hasta cuando esta mujer seguirá restregando la entrepierna ahora con el toro mecánico, más tarde con un caño, luego con un stéreo gigante? ya stá grande, y en su intento desesperado de capturar audiencias más jóvenes, puso más street dancers lo que la hace lucir vieja, desgastada y casi patética. Ninguno de los bailarines en cuestión (suponiendo que fueran straight) le llevaría el apunte a una veterana como ella. No digo que no está infinitamente mejor que la mayoría de sus coetáneas, pero no alcanza con parecer jóven. Uno puede mantenerse actualizado, entender a los jóvenes, disfrutar de su música, pero NO PUEDE ser adolescente a los 48. No puede pretender seguir atrayendo a quinceañeros, sin embargo sigue insistiendo en shows mesiánicos en donde, muy a la norteamericana (way of life que ella supuestamente critica) trata de sermonear acerca de cómo vivir la vida. Un adulto no precisa que otro le diga cómo tener conciencia social, ni que madonna le diga que hay un presidente que es un necio. <br />por otro lado, la estética de la edición del show es agotadora, repetitiva. Una lástima. Me solía encantar esta señora pero no creció. <br />Debería aprender de otros artistas -más cultos e informados y menos autocomplacientes- como, por ejemplo, los Pet Shop Boys.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Super movie. Great Story. The second best of all the Rocky Movies. This should have been part 4. A great movie that was very emotinal, if you were really into the series. <br /> <br />Let your kids watch 1-3 and then let them see this movie for a moral view.
B000EF7W3Y|5.0|When I first heard Fisherman's Blues back in the late 80's, I absolutely fell in love with this band.  The music was so soulful and honest, it was impossible not to feel it.  Yet truthfully, for me, there was always something about this recording as a whole that I couldn't get my arms around to fully embrace it.  It seemed as though it was trying to throw too many different musical genres into one release, not really devoting enough time to one particular style.  The individual tracks were great, but the album itself was fragmented.  After reading the liner notes from this new re-release, it completely makes sense as to why this occured.  This album was the result of a full two and a half years of recording material.  How do you select one album's worth of material from nearly one hundred recorded tracks?  What this reissue does, is begin to fill in those gaps.<br /><br />Like the previous reviewer stated, the bonus material on this album is absolutely phenomenal.  It's simply a shame that it took nearly twenty years for music as beautiful as this to be released.  To name a few, there is an alternate version of \\"When Ye Go Away\\" titled, \\"Killing My Heart\\".  For my money, it is infinitely more compelling then the original.  \\"You In The Sky\\" is quite simply, majestic.  I believe it rivals any song on the original album.  This release has also seen fit to provide us with extended versions of the original album's tracks \\"World Party\\" and \\"A Bang On The Ear\\".  I personally believe that both songs benefit from the newly extended formats, and I particularly love the natural ending to the World Party track.<br /><br />If the additional unreleased material is anywhere near as good as these two discs are, then like the other reviewer of this record states, we really need to have more of this beautiful music heard.  And please, let's not wait another 18 years for the next round.....

B00005JLPK|2.0|Frida is a visually attractive, yet over the top glamorization of egocentric, self-righteous artists that just click.  Besides the fact that the film tries really hard to come off as artsy, Hayek's acting shows too much effort and the continuously very short sequences have a TV sit-com feel.<br /><br />Hollywood loves taking stories like these and making lives that are degenerate look like sacrifices for noble causes be it art, politics or love.  In the end Kahlo and Rivera were great artists and poor humanitarians, with a penchant for stupidity.  From this movie you'd think that's a wonderful thing.<br /><br />It must be hard to make movies about artists because there are so few that are that good.  Pollock, Vincent And Theo, Basquiat, Lust For Life, Modigliani, Surviving Picasso all were enjoyable films in degrees; but they all focused on and romanticized some of the worst aspects of the artists' lives like egotism, womanizing, alcoholism, mental illness, and drug addiction, and rarely show the more vulnerable weakness's that was the cause of the problems. The characters in all those movies just end up seeming like two-dimensional modern cliches of what we expect from artists.  Frida is yet another example of that but one of the poorer ones yet.
0784011710|5.0|Sophie's Choice is a very powerful story of a woman whose strength did not desert her in imaginably some of the most traumatic moments in a person's life. Whether it was her abysmal life in German concentration camps or her Brooklyn existence with her schizophrenic boyfriend, Sophie did not have much to fall back up on with the exception of her inner core - a core that was so solid that it did not falter, did not waver, did not even flinch as she lost everything that a human heart deems precious. In the end she appears calm and poised even after having lost what every one holds dearest to heart - life.<br /><br />In her Academy winning performance, Meryl Streep is peerless. Arguably it is one of the most powerful and yet sublime performances ever - an incredibly realistic portrayal of a character whose numerous shades of existence are impossibly difficult to depict. Streep delivers what easily can contend for an Academy among Academy winners. Other actors, the direction, the script and the milieu are all flawless but this movie belongs to Streep who stands head and shoulders above the rest in a performance bound to leave an indelible impact on the audience.
1582701709|1.0|Catchy review title?  Thought so.  Robert Cialdini, renowned psychology researcher and author of Influence: The Power of Persuasion (perhaps the best book ever written on the subject) identifies six basic rules employed by  politicians, advertisers and scam artists alike to persuade others.  Each of them are employed quite adeptly by Rhonda Byrne in this book. <br /> <br />Cialdini's first principle is SCARCITY; people want what's expensive, exculsive, or otherwise attainable.  Byrne's mastery of this principle is clearly shown by the very name of the book: The Secret.  We all learned this the first week of kindergarten as we felt the jealousy of watching two classmates, hands cupped over ears, sharing a secret out of earshot. <br /> <br />This message is reinforced throughout the book and its advertising campaign which pitches \\"The Secret\\" (whatever it actually is) as jealousy-guarded information hoarded by the happy, wealthy and successful.    Whenever someone tries convincing you of something, whether it's a way to make enormous sums of money, to lose weight, etc - be wary of when it's pitched as \\"the knowledge THEY don't want you to have.\\"  Think about it - everything from the \\"secrets that Wall Street doesn't want you to know\\" to \\"uncovered - celebrities' secrets to staying young\\" are phrased not simply to pique your interest but to make you jealous.  Appeals to our emotion are far more powerful than appeals to reason, and Byrne demonstrates mastery of this principle throughout \\"The Secret.\\" <br /> <br />Cialdini's second principle is LIKING.  We like those who like us, and in turn, we do business with them.  Positive thinking and emotional intelligence has been linked to strong interpersonal relationships, academic and professional success, and good health, but there is a fine line when positive thinking crosses over to unjustified exuberance.  Instead of simply noting the substantial benefits of positive thinking (a well-accepted principle which wouldn't sellbooks), Byrne crosses the line     so blatantly that anyone with a modicum of modesty would find it blasphemous.   <br /> <br />AUTHORITY is another Cialdini principle, also in play in \\"The Secret\\" in quite subtle ways.  Another technique which differentiates this book from just another book of positive thinking is the heavy use of quasiscientific language, which gives the impression that the \\"law of attraction\\" is (or will become) an accepted scientific principle, just like the law of gravity or the law of attraction of oppositely-charged particles in chemistry.  Many people are both intimidated and confused by the authority of science, a fact exploited by manipulators ranging from Byrne to peddlers of magic weight-loss pills.   <br /> <br />Since no respected physicist would ever publish a paper on the universality of the \\"law of attraction,\\" Byrne indirectly seeks experts in other ways.  She attributes the success of people ranging from Einstein to Beethoven to adherence of \\"The Secret,\\" thereby manufacturing experts.  After all, if Einstein and Shakespeare mastered \\"The Secret,\\" who are YOU to question it?  <br /> <br />The last two Cialdini principles are CONSISTENCY and SOCIAL PROOF.  The success of this book should leave little doubt it will be followed by more (and more expensive) forms of media peddling \\"The Secret.\\"  The audio recordings, weekend seminars, advertising tie-ins, and other follow-up products certain to follow will exploit these two principles.  Once people commit themselves to believing happiness will come from \\"The Secret,\\" they will attribute future successes, whether a promotion or a great new relationship, to adherence to it.  Conversely, setbacks will be even more powerfully in committing people to \\"The Secret,\\" as people will attribute their failures to not living up to \\"The Secret\\" (and buying more of Byrne's books). Consistency dictates it will be less painful to buy more books and immerse one's self further into \\"The Secret\\" than toaccept the whole premise is a quite ridiculous; while not as pernicious as a domineering cult, \\"The Secret\\" promises to charge you handsomely for a positive outlook on life. <br /> <br />Byrne's book is problematic on many levels.  On it's face, it's a manipulative marketing tool meant to flatter, confuse and deceive.  It's also pseudoscience at its best, the last thing we need to encourage in an increasingly technological world which requires healthy skepticism and critical thought.  Most damaging, though, is how the book perverts reality by encouraging people to equate a positive outlook on life with a childish, idiotic narcissism.  Ayn Rand must be rolling in her grave hearing about the modern manifestation of her objectivist movement reduced to the intellectual equivalent of canned pork.    <br /> <br />If you're interested in \\"The Secret,\\" I highly encourage you to read the book - yeah, READ the book - if for any other reason so not to be manipulated by its brilliant marketing.  Read it with a critical eye, with a copy of Cialdini's book in the other hand.  You may not learn the secret of happiness, but you WILL learn a lot about manipulation and influence from a master of the subject in Rhonda Byrne.
B000B8QF00|3.0|While this CD includes a lot of excellent songs, it completely misses its mark of giving a representive overview of Alanis' career. I will even say that in many cases, it actually includes mediocre tracks that were not hits (case of point: That I Would Be Good) and leaves out better songs that were hits from the same albums (the popular So Pure, and the brilliant Unsent and Joining You). Furthermore, the CD includes rare material like Mercy (completely out of place), Princess Familiar (should be titled Princess Forgettable!), and the much maligned Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love (which, apparantly, I'm the only one who liked) which would have sitten better on a rarities collection than on a \\"Greatest Hits\\" (even though, admittedly, this is titled \\"The Collection\\" rather than \\"Greatest Hits\\"). The Collection therefore stands as a very uneven record in its current form. <br /> <br />All this is a pity, because Alanis might just be the greatest (female?) lyric (and song) writed in music industry at the moment - and to this, I'll add that I actually consider her much acclaimed \\"first\\" album Jagged Little Pill the least good of her releases! One could EASILY fill two CDs with amazing songs and make a much more satisfactory compilation than this one - and there would still be great songs one would have to leave out for lack of space. <br /> <br />My suggestion for an \\"Ultimate Collection\\" would run like this: <br /> <br />Disc 1 - Hits <br />1. 21 Things I Want In A Lover <br />2. 8 Easy Steps <br />3. Crazy <br />4. You Learn <br />5. Thank U <br />6. Ironic <br />7. Flinch (ok, this was not a hit, but it's an amazing song, and sits perfectly next to Ironic) <br />8. So Pure <br />9. Hand In My Pocket <br />10. Precious Illusions <br />11. Unsent <br />12. Head Over Feet <br />13. You Oughta Know <br />14. Sister Blister <br />15. Simple Together <br />16. Hands Clean <br />17.

B000MGUZM0|4.0|I'm sure that there is no pressure for an artist quite like the weight of anticipation for the follow up to a hugely successful piece of work. And as we all know, Funeral was a hugely successful piece of work. <br /> <br />Funeral's appeal stemmed from its youthful vigour, its rabid energy, and the way it captured a moment. It was completely liberated and showed no signs of self-conscious pre-tense or calculation. <br /> <br />Neon Bible reveals to us a new, matured, and significantly more beaten down Arcade Fire. The album exudes the pressure that was placed on it. It is ripe with dark imagery, morbid apocalyptic lyrics and sombre moods. It is also meticulous and considered where Funeral was loose and spontaneous. <br /> <br />The songs are just as huge, if not more so, than its predecessor. The utilization of church organ on `Intervention' gives the track a weight and force that the band have never reached before. Massive swelling strings and horn sections lift the songs into anthem territory without ever feeling like empty retreads of anthem rock, mostly due to what Arcade Fire do best... emote.  <br /> <br />The songs follow more classic structures and sounds than Funeral in a way that gives them a timeless and sophisticated feel. There is a strong Bruce Springsteen influence as well as Bob Dylan's sprawling poetry creepy into `Antichrist Television Blues', a post 9-11 paranoid romp about a father pushing his daughter into showbiz. <br /> <br />`Ocean Of Noise' provides a particularly beautiful moment of distress when Win can't escape the world he's in. A lament of love gone wrong is still polluted by the `ocean of violence' that we now live in. Midway through Win asks `Now who here among us still believes in choice?', to which the group vocals mournfully reply `Not I'... The song ends with a triumphant yet despondent horn section that flirts with hope but never quite gets there. <br /> <br />The only real reprieve from the forlorn imagery comes in `No Cars Go',reprised from the bands first EP and given a shot in the arm. The re-make of this track is positively spectacular and provides a brief ray of sunlight in the album's shadows. The motoring beat and shouted `Hey!' vocals give life, as do the lyrics expressing a utopia that the band want the world to escape to.  <br /> <br />Closer, `My Body Is A Cage' returns to the shadows with a bluesy, dirge like beginning, a return of the huge church organ, and an explosive climax. By the end Win is pleading `Set my spirit free' and you can see why. The band have landed in a world they don't recognise and have reacted accordingly.  <br /> <br />Neon Bible's epic scope, anthemic climaxes, apocalyptic lyrics, and slightly muddy production all add to it's dark and brooding appeal. Those looking for a youthful jaunt through some energetic and quirky indie rock will not find it on Neon Bible. But they will find a deep and dark beast that shows Arcade Fire can put find themselves in whole new context and still write an album that captures a moment, but also rewards the listener in the longer term.  <br />
B000EWBNMS|4.0|The show is really good.  I love the dream sequences and I don't think it's too violent, it's an adult show.  Two things bother me: Patricia Arquette is too whiny.  The real Allison seems more together and up, not dark and whiny.  The second thing is that I don't like Jake Weber at all in the part of Joe.  He's completely miscast, he must be related to someone.  He's exactly like David Spade, even looks like him.  He always looks haggard and sloppy and is not the caliber of actor that this part calls for.  He's no rocket scientist!  Just the idea that he's matched with Particia Arquette makes my skin crawl.  Sort of like Heather Locklear and David Spade, ewwwwww! <br />A final thought:  STOP TRYING TO SEXUALIZE THAT LITTLE GIRL!  The oldest daughter, with her pouty lips, is already being shot from behind and portrayed in a sexy way.  She's too young, plays a young girl who still sleeps in her parents bed, for heavens sake.
B000BSNPR6|5.0|I bought this DVD about a month ago and have seen the concert several times already.  Setting aside the fact that Sharon is beautiful and has a beautiful voice, the whole band is just awesome together, they put on a show that is infectious making you want more.  I haven't been this excited about a DVD album since Iron Maiden's \\"Live after Death\\" and Rush's \\"Exit Stage Left\\".  The only sad thing is that Within Temptation and others like Nightwish, After Forever, etc rarely tour in the United States.  I wish they would so that they can infuse the uninteresting and mind-numbing US music scene with some energy.
B000N6TX1S|5.0|A horrid futurist nightmare that couldn't be better described by the title of the famous rock song from Black Sabbath's album, \\"Master of reality.\\"<br /><br />If \\"Soylent Green\\" in the early seventies, became a cult movie due its powerful bitterness around the utopist solution of food for an overpopulated world, this somber film deals with an interesting and even sharp proposal; the question of infertility in the mankind, and the way the children are considered as a transcendental fact.<br /><br />The whole social body is mentally messy. All the world has collapsed, except Great Britain in which the conditions of life are far beyond the poorest nation of the Third World. Misery, hunger, hungry, fear, desolation, hopeless conform an apocalyptic frame in which the violence appears as the final result of antagonist forces. Terrorist cells, occupation forces, and the presence of two curious antiheros: an old, caustic and outlaw man, wonderfully featured by an unrecognizable Michael Caine and a man who works for a department who once was engaged with a woman who has become a terrorist leader Julianne Moore in a very brief but powerful performance with the only mission: to preserve by all means a young mother to come.<br /><br />An acidic gaze respect the post industrial future, that it may sin of being extremely awesome but pretty original in what concerns the exposed issues of an unthinkable reality.<br /><br />.
140679239X|5.0|I agree with the previous reviewer:  this takes time to read.  You cannot speed read this book.  I find myself having to concentrate on almost every phrase, certainly every sentence.  I also find that I cannot read more than one \\"chapter\\" at a time, except for some of the real short chapters.   <br /> <br />But if you take the time, shut out all other distractions, perhaps some soothing Norah Jones or Connie Rae in the background (at very low volume), and absorb each word, phrase, sentence, you should really enjoy \\"To The Lighthouse.\\"   <br /> <br />I am about a third of the way through.  I don't even know if there's a plot.  I doubt that there is.  But the observations that Virginia Woolf makes of those around her is incredible.  I can understand why she often recorded that she could only write for an hour or so each day. <br /> <br />Her understanding of the relationship between a child and a mother is phenomenal.  It heightens one's appreciation for all moms.  Maybe this was the mother's day card Virginia was never able to give her own mom. <br /> <br />(Incidentally, \\"To The Lighthouse\\" concerns a family with eight children, which sounds a bit far-fetched, but in fact Virginia was one of eight children growing up in London.)
006056251X|5.0|Loved this book, from beginning to end, how the heroine treated the hero and how he responded. Great. i read it over and over again
B000M341QO|4.0|Some of the stuff @ the end you just never saw it coming.  It kind of reminds me of the ending to Lucky Number Slevin, JUST NOT AS GOOD.  Lots of twists.  I didn't mind the love triangle between the cops & their psychiatrist lady but it kind of made it distasteful.  The ending would have been just as good without Dicaprio's character & the psych chic having a relationship.  Anyway - beside all that I was quites surprised I liked the movie that much.  Some parts of the storylines we've seen before but oh well.  If the script writers were gonna remake a Japanese movie they might as well do a good job.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Much has already been said about \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\".  It's inspiring, it's educational, and it points out a desperate need for change in our society.  For those who do not believe that global warming is a problem, or even those that do believe it is a problem but do not fully understand it, go see this film.  You will then realize what a serious problem this is.    A lot has been made about Al Gore being the presentor.  \\"Al Gore?  You mean the guy who thinks he invented the internet?\\" ... \\"Al Gore isn't a scientist!  Why should I take him seriously?\\"    No matter what your view on Al Gore's stance on other political issues, or of him as a credible souce of scientific information, he is very passionate about this issue and is a very intellegent and pursuasive speaker.  Give him a chance before you write him off as an enviornmental wacko who is trying to scare you into voting Democrat.    As far as science is concerned, Al Gore lays no claim to being a scientist...and he doesn't have to.  None of the information presented in the film is his own.  It is data from the world's leading scientists that Gore has thoroughly researched and learned as much as he can about.  He's not making this stuff up for political gain, and no he's not trying to garner support for a presidential run.  Al Gore has seen an issue that he is very concerned with, and it's something that we have all of the tools at our fingertips to fix!  We have just chosen not to.  That's what he wants to change.    Lastly, I'd like to point out one of the things I like best about this film and Gore's character:  He has faith in the people.  You would never imagine, with all of the crap he must have thrown at him from deniers, how incredibly confident he is that once the American people and the people of the rest of the world know the truth, they will not only want, but DEMAND change immediately to solve this crisis.    Special features include a 25 minute update from Al Gore about advances in the scienceof global warming since the release of An Inconvenient Truth.  This is just great added value on top of an already excellent film.  If you're not one to buy movies you've already seen in the theater's, it's at least worth renting it to watch the update.    If you are interested in learing what you individually can do to help stop global warming pollution, log on to the film's website at [...] and click on the \\"take action\\" tab on the right.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Not many movies today have been expertly written in recent years, concentrating on showy explosions with 3rd-grader childish dialogue.  Not so with KISS KISS BANG BANG.  An interesting movie taking a simple movie cliche of mixed identity, combined with a detective mystery straight out of a pulp novel, the best part of the movie is the dialogue between the characters Harry (Robert Downey, Jr.) and \\"Gay\\" Perry (Val Kilmer, is one of his most memorable roles to date).  Plus the narration of Downey through out the piece is nothing but hilarious, especially when it digs into said Hollywood cliches (there's even a good dig at Return of the King that made me laugh). <br /> <br />If you need a thinking-man's action/mystery movie, then this is perfect for you on any night.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When this came out in 1997 I read all the reviews praising it to the skies, many calling it \\"the greatest recording of all time\\" ...<br />\\"know nothing 20-somethings with no perspective!\\" I harrumphed. What about Pablo Casals' 1950 performance of the Shubert 'cello quintet with a young Isaac Stern on 1st fiddle? what about the original cast recording of Candide? What about Kind of Blue? Exile on Main Street? Abbey Road? But the praise went on and on so I had to order it and see for myself...<br />Then, during the third listen, increasingly entranced, came Thom Yorke's ellongated \\"SOMEDAAAAY \\" at the end of \\"Let Down\\" and I was elevated to a higher plane, on a magnificent trip.  Of two last tracks, I loved \\"Lucky\\" right away - very intelligent music, and lovely lyric (\\"The head of state has called for me by name; I don't have time for him\\") and \\"The Tourist\\" is a perfect landing, again, musically, lyrically experientially...<br /><br />It eventually took falling madly in love with \\"Kid A\\" when that came out (one of the greatest recordings of all time) - but, golly darn it, those kids are right - what an achievement - \\"OK Computer\\" just might be, as absurd as the idea that there even is such a thing is, the greatest recording of all time.<br />Certainly Radiohead are the most intellectually ambitious and most artistically acomplished musical organization working today, regardless of genre.<br />If you care about music, any kind of music, you need to own this recording.
B000IZJZLM|1.0|We should begin to boycot albums that shortchange us with too little music.  No matter how good it might be, 39 minutes is about 20 minutes too short!
B000007S5B|3.0|WAITING FOR THE SUN might be evidence that Jim Morrison was either a tapped-out lyric writer (\\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" and \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\") or just totally stoned out of his mind (\\"The Celebration Of The Lizard\\" poetry). But then, we see flashes of the sort of brilliance that permeated the first two DOORS albums, tracks like \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" and \\"Five To One\\" stand up against any that this band ever recorded.<br /><br />Musically, WAITING FOR THE SUN often sounds tremendously dated-- perhaps it was outmoded even in 1968. Fuzz guitar and calliope-like organ are everywhere-- there's waltzes (\\"Wintertime Love\\") and schmaltzes (\\"Love Street\\") and all sorts of filler. A pattern of inconsistency established here followed the group right through to [[ASIN:B000MG1ZGA L.A. WOMAN]]. The DOORS were a band that the \\"Best Of\\" compilation was ideal for. Like [[ASIN:B000002I2G THE SOFT PARADE]] and [[ASIN:B000MG1ZG0 MORRISON HOTEL]], WAITING FOR THE SUN is only for their most devoted fans and perhaps '60s rock completists.

B00005JOCU|4.0|Paramount just announced \\"Dreamgirls\\" for May 1, the campaign starring a double-disc \\"Showstopper Edition\\" with a glitzy package of extras. The title also is coming out with in two-DVD sets for both HD formats (unusual) and a single-disc DVD version with some deleted scenes.<br /><br />The box art mentions Jennifer Hudson's Oscar, but the big type goes to the film's Golden Globe for best picture. Smart marketing since the movie didn't make the cut to get into the Academy Awards' best pic race.<br /><br />Par promises \\"12 extended and alternate scenes including a DVD-exclusive, never-before-seen performance by Jennifer Hudson of 'Effie Sing My Song,' a feature-length documentary entitled 'Building the Dream' presented in nine chapters, behind-the-scenes featurettes on the costume design, editing and lighting of the film, cast member auditions and screen tests, previsualization sequences and more.\\" Most but not all of the extras come formatted for HD.<br /><br />Specs: Widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TVs (single disc also available full screen) with Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround, English 2.0 Surround and French 5.1 Surround with English and Spanish subtitles. Sorry, audio buffs, no DTS. It's a real shame to see a musical this rich come out without the superior audio format. Perhaps the HD formats will get to show off their superior sound abilities, an upgrade that by and large we're still waiting to experience. Guy can dream, right?
B00003CXRM|5.0|Great film............   <br />It's quite unusual.  It's a comedy with music, long but pretty funny.   <br />The southern characters are depicted comically well past hillbilly. <br />The film takes place in the depression era Bible belt south.  Southern Hymns \\"Old Timmy\\" style music is sung throughout the film which is quite beautiful. (Historically the music is from real depression era artists.  George Clooney's song and singer received a Grammy award for this film).  The meant to be absurd deep, deep, deep, south accents, names (\\"Hogwallop\\") and dialog (\\"Hemp ya sef \\") are hilarious. <br />Even the KKK's ridiculous song singing and choreographed dancing, takes the seriousness from there goal. <br />George Clooney plays an intelligent guy with the \\"gift of gab\\" who's also obsessed with his hair needing pomade and a hair net regularly, \\"My hair\\".      <br />John Turturro plays a pretty serious southern companion of Clooney's, \\"You stole from ma kin!\\"  And Tim Blake Nelson's plays a naïve partner, \\"Friend yah foldin money dun com unstowed\\". <br />
B00003CXD5|5.0|This is a flatout amazing piece of work.  It's one of the greatest films of John Huston's and Humphrey Bogart's career, and it has one of the greatest endings I've ever seen.  I really admire old Hollywood stars, especially Bogart.  When you go back and actually watch his film, you realise how really good he is, and that you understand why people love him even to this day.  Here he plays a down and out guy panhandling in Mexico.  He meets up with Tim Holt and Walter Houston (the director's father), and they set off for gold.  They find it, but Bogart becomes paranoid, and tries to take the gold for himself.  The 3 central characters are so well drawn and believable.  You feel like their real people, and the performances are first rate.  When the ending comes on, you feel happy, despite the fact that it's also kind of sad.  John Houston was/is a great filmmaker, making several masterpieces even into his autumn years.  This is just one of them.  This film shows that Hollywood once made great films, and maybe can make them again.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Anyone who has read \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" knows it takes a little courage to disclose what we actually see and hear. when the rest of the world sees and hears somthing radically different.    While the director is masterful at evoking tension, it tends to be unremitting, and the events depicted -- such as a child wringing the neck of a live chicken, a woman being shot randomly while sleeping on a tourist coach, or a lonely, deaf adolescent exposing her genitals to strangers in a cafe -- are generally off-putting. The film purports to make serious statements about violence, about the regressive impact of the press on society, about the randomness of human fate, but it falls flat. And why cast Cate Blanchett in the role she has here? She's been cast to play a corpse!    Except for the thoughtful musical score, this film was physically revolting. I could only watch it for about half an hour before returning it to the video store -- and I rarely abandon a movie in midstream. A pretentious, overpraised, prurient work.
B00005JMXX|3.0|I give this movie 5 stars for special effects. The effects truly are amazing. I think that the theory that the \\"Atlantic Pump\\" (the current in the southwest Atlantic that \\"pumps\\" warm Caribbean air into Europe) could fail, thus turning the northern Hemisphere into a new Ice Age is an interesting one to ponder. Some scientists think it could happen. I found that a bit intriguing.  <br /> <br />The movie, however, is full of set-piece cliches (the homeless guy and his dog, who \\"understands\\" better than the rest of us, the UN conference with the politically-correct Arabs, asking inquisitive scientific questions (we all know that one is realistic). After the first 10 minutes, I was saying to myself, \\"I wonder what interesting headgear they will show next\\". It was like a \\"parade of diversity\\". They had two guys in the UN scene with a fez on their heads. Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't the fez go out in about 1918, with the Ottoman Empire ? Costumes, please call the director, please. This is an odd film in some ways, because those kind of amateurish elements are mixed in with some truly spectacular special effects.  <br />The plot and characters are mostly two-dimensional.  <br /> <br />The scene with Mexico was pure political correctness. By the way, the Rio Grande is bigger than 40 feet across (!).
B000001GPX|5.0|\\"For all Kleiber's notable work, there will be a lingering regret that such a natural and brilliant talent did not achieve even more.\\" - The Guardian <br /> <br />Even Beethoven legends like Karajan could not emulate Kleiber's success with these 2 symphonies. The 5th Symphony, as commercially overplayed as it is, becomes something completely different under his baton; the final movement is especially dramatic, rivaling the energy of an actual live recording. The 7th Symphony is not so superior - other conductors have come closer to this benchmark - but the 2nd movement (again overplayed) is truly something special. The recording, made over 30 years ago, sounds just as good as anything made today. <br /> <br />With 100+ recordings, my review seems somewhat superfluous, as well :)
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I am in total agreement with customer reveiwer Donnis Kelly. What more can be said!!!  Except for the fact that my husband has beautiful \\"new girlfriends\\"!!!

B000M4RG42|5.0|Flags of our Fathers is one of the best WWII movies I have ever had the privilage of watching. It gave me a sense of what it must have felt like in that time period, of who the greatest generation truly were. The movie conveys perfectly the horror that the men on Iwo Jima must have faced. The scene when the men find a cave with dead Japanese was horrifying. The acting was perfect, and the actors themselves bear a lot of resemblence to those that were shown in the photographs.  <br /> <br />Some have critiqued the film with low ratings because of the flashbacks or not enough battle sequences. Though the flashbacks can be a little distracting, I was able to get used to it by simply \\"paying closer attention,\\" and as for the battle scenes, I thought the ones that were shown were breathtaking. Those that complain that there are not enough of them, stick to Saving Private Ryan (another good war movie I might add), because you must be missing the bigger picture that Flags of our Fathers is trying to show.  <br /> <br />Overall, I give Flags of our Fathers 5 stars. A terrific watch. Also recommended is Letters from Iwo Jima.
B000N3T0DW|2.0|Maybe I am not the best reviewer of VOLVER because, by my own admission, I don't \\"get\\" Pedro Almodovar. I consider myself fairly well-versed in world cinema, but--no matter how many Almodovar films I view, and then re-view--I inevitably fail to find anything truly appealing about them. Then I read critics raving about them (such as the New York Times reviewers, one or two of whom, I seem to recall, named TALK TO ME as the best film of its respective year). And previously the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences (although the taste of the AMPAS is dubious, at best) named ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER as the best foreign film. And also [...] reviewers seem, almost universally, thus far, to love or at least somewhat like VOLVER.    But VOLVER is essentially a melodrama that is not emotionally affecting and a farce that isn't particulary funny. If you've seen a few Almodovar films, you probably know the formula: \\"eccentric\\" (but never terribly interesting  or \\"real\\") characters, absurd and maddening plot coincidences, and melodrama ad nauseam. VOLVER does not deviate much from this recipe. The story (in the abridged version): A daughter murders her father when he attempts to sexually abuse her. The mother (Penelope Cruz) hides the body and decides to take the blame for the crime if it is discovered. She moves the body, with no little effort, to a freezer in an acquaintance's nearby restaurant. (The acquaintance is out of town.) Other plot points which are somehow woven into this central story involve: a dead mother, a dying aunt, a purported ghost, flatulence as a vehicle for memories, a \\"Russian\\" hairdresser's assistant, a tabloid talk show, an androgynous friend of the family searching for her missing mother, a hijacked restaurant, a film crew, a prissy sister, and many, many ridiculous coincidences and misunderstandings.    All in all, my problem with Aldomovar's films isn't that they are flamboyant, but that they aren't really interesting or engaging. Aldomovar always seems to stretch believability beyond any and all conceivable limits, leaving us with a story that is so essentially bizarre and unlikely that it is difficult to relate to on any level. Sure, many people in the world, unfortunately, can relate to being sexually abused, but not many can relate to the extended circumstances (which I won't divulge) which render this film so nonsensical that it fails to have any true emotional resonance.
B000H5U832|5.0|Though we knew we'd like the animation we were a little skeptical about a movie with a NASCAR-theme because we are not particularly fans of it. But we were pleasantly surprised to find a nice love story and moral lesson woven into it. We ended up seeing it twice in the theaters and just had to buy it.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This British quartet, who have had a cult following for many years now, could truly be the next big rock band to shake some life into the music world again. As radio stations have literally lost any sense of keeping a freshness to rock music in the last few years, Porcupine Tree have a hard hitting sound mixed with layers of psychedelic and progressive rock. They've also honed in on a sound containing a variety of their favorite influences as you hear their Moody Blues meets Pink Floyd meets Jethro Tull meets Rush background. But what makes them so intriguing is how they sound so modern. Steve Wilson can lay down an adrenalin vocal while the band jams to songs like the title cut, \\"Shallow,\\" \\"Halo,\\" and a twelve-minute masterpiece in \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here.\\" But all the songs help to create a musical meltdown with lyrics filled with emotion and intellect. Deadwing is like taking a dark, mysterious journey of the heart and mind. What better album for the old-time music lovers to embrace music again, while grabbing the attention of a new generation. Like the way grunge surfaced in the early 90's and breathed new life into the music scene for years to come, Porcupine Tree can offer the same kind of resuscitation to lead the emergence of a new musical subcluture.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Montreal's Arcade Fire follow-up their breakthrough effort \\"Funeral\\" with the powerful \\"Neon Bible,\\" a CD about the search for spiritual answers and release. Musically the songs range from the pounding drums and piano of the opener \\"Black Mirror\\" to the prayer-like title tune \\"Neon Bible\\" and \\"Ocean Of Noise\\" to the bombastic \\"Intervention,\\" \\"My Body Is A Cage\\" and \\"Windowsill\\" where the layered Wall Of Sound arrangements threaten at any second to spin off into cacophony but remain firmly rooted by the lyrics which will resonate with all listeners, e.g. \\"Mirror mirror on the wall/Show me where the bombs will fall,\\" \\"the lion and the lamb ain't sleeping yet\\" and 'singing Hallelujah with the fear in your heart.\\"<br /><br />The Arcade Fire aspire to the ability of U2 of Bruce Springsteen to bring spirituality to an arena sized package and have the lyrical gift and chops to nearly get the job done. If you're not touched by the Springsteen-ish \\"Antichrist Television Blues\\" go back to Britney Spears' ouevre.<br /><br />Well worth the time and money. You will be moved and rocked. And that's a great combination.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|If your a true audio nut like me, sound reproduction is very important to the listening experience.  After reading a few reviews, i was compelled to add my two cents.  The use of melody's and arrangements can stir up all kinds of emotions.  Not one person i've played this for did not get goose bumps!  The DVD-A version is truly stunning.  If you don't have DVD-Audio (different than Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1) capabilities, than your not getting the full treat.  The DVD-A is High resolution UNCOMPRESSED audio.  the later is a compressed version and doesn't have the same data that the DVD-A has.  Think of it as having 500 times more information than a standard CD.  More data equals more density and fullness.  <br /> <br />If the record labels would have done a better job of promoting high-resolution audio (DVD-A or SACD), this format would surely be a huge hit (it is with me, but so little is available!).  I wasn't a huge beatle's fan, but always liked their stuff.  This has changed the way i feel about them.  My 17 month old son has never heard a single beatles song until i bought this.  No other music has done this to him, but now he actually points to the DVD player and starts shacking his shoulders wanting me to play it!!  It's very cute!  Anyways, my point being, for such a little guy, the music even effects his emotions. Music the way it should be.
0316779237|3.0|This was my first David Sedaris book.  While some of it was not as funny as i expected, Season's greetings was worth the price of the book for me.  I thought it was hilarious.

B00005Y228|5.0|This is a great CD.  The songs feel much more modern than on Light Years but feel more 70's disco than Body Language.  She creates a electric sound that will get you on the dance floor in a matter of minutes even without your concent.  This is expertly crafted pop.  In Your Eyes is one of the, if not the, best pop songs I've ever heard.  From begining to end it's hot.  An amazing CD.  Don't pass up your chance to listen to this gem.<br /><br />The Key Tracks Are:  In Your Eyes, More More More, LOve Affair, Love at First Sight, Can't Get You Out Of My Head, Give It To Me, and the bonus japan verson track Tightrope.
B000068FY0|5.0|Wow! This is Supertramp's 3rd album and how they have grown! The first two albums Supertramp and Indelibly Stamped were good and leaps and bounds ahead of what others were doing at that time. Something apperently clicked and a super band was born! Every song stands strong on its own merit here. If you are looking to start a Supertramp collection, buy this first. So if you end up stranded on an island and some genie grants you musical wishes, well now you know what to wish for.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|Ok so I had some pretty high expectations for this album, but somehow I had a feeling The Arcade Fire were too good to blow their second album. <br />I was right! <br />Upon hearing the first track and single, Black Mirror, I didn't know what to expect, it sounded a bit repetitive and not nearly as good as the first track off Funerals. However, as soon as track 2 started, I knew that The Arcade Fire were here to stay. <br />The album is rich with thought provoking textures and melodies throughout the album. <br /> <br />The lyrics in particular have matured to a level often not seen in the music of today. <br /> <br />In the end, it is sarcastic realization that dependancy on religion will get you nowhere. And the holy war was pointless: <br /> <br />\\"Now I'm overcome, <br />By the light of day. <br />My lips are near but my heart is far away. <br />Now the war is won, <br />Howcome nothing tastes good?\\" <br /> <br />This album is sure to end up being a classic that will be played years from now. <br />Its a new sound for the Arcade Fire, and one that you will love if you give it a few listens. <br /> <br />the only weak point is track 1. <br />While its still good, it pale's in relation to the rest of the album.

0812550706|5.0|I read this book because of all the good things I had heard about it and was overall quite satisfied.  The book isn't the most detailed of books and leaves a lot of plot holes I feel, but I enjoyed it, because it's  straight to the point and you can use your imagination to fill in the details.  This was a quick and easy read and I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sci fi.
B000068FWC|4.0|Music has always represented time travel to me in a way. When I hear certain songs from my past now, the song will turn on the projector inside my head and visions will appear. When I hear this CD, I get so many flashes of the 70's. The great part of this experience is good songs always bring back good memories. Breakfast In America plays one great memory after another for me and I hope you can tap into some wonderful memories listening to some of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson's best work. this very well could be this duo's best collaberation.
B000FS9FCG|3.0|Missed this one in the theater and it finally came up in the Netflix queue. As seems to be the case with movies made from graphic novels these days, the filmmakers did a great job of capturing the visual style of the comic while not necessarily retaining the story or underlying meaning. This was even more egregious in this case, where V is portrayed as a heroic figure whose victimization justifies the means by which he extracts his revenge with the added bonus of freeing the enslaved citizens of a nation. Sorry, but I think I understand why Alan Moore chose to remove his credit from the movie: in the graphic novel, the ending is ambiguous and serves to underscore the question of whether the means ever justifies the ends. The most effective sequence is Evie's torture and subsequent \\"freedom,\\" but the film breaks down in the last fifteen minutes where the directors fall back on hoary blockbuster tropes with slow-motion mega-violence and big blow-'em-ups. For a movie that wants you to take it seriously as part criticism of where the U.S. and the U.K. might be headed in the name of fighting terrorism, the ending betrays any thoughtfulness for spectacle. Disappointing, to say the least. It's not the fault of any of the actors, who were uniformly wonderful, including the understated Stephen Rea as the inspector. This flub has to be laid solely on the screenwriters and directors.
0553583182|1.0|I bought this book because it turned up in the listings after a search on \\"Subconscious Mind.\\"  This book has nothing to do with the Subconscious Mind or hypnosis, as one might expect from a book on the Subconscious.  This book is Judeo-Christian religion repackaged and not even cleverly concealed in the guise of self-improvement.<br /><br />This book made me very angry because the title is deceptive and I feel I was ripped off by yet another Xtian trying to legitimize his own delusions.  This book, like \\"Intelligent Design\\" is just another example of religion masquerading as something real and worthwhile.  This book is a lie, inside and out.<br /><br />If you're looking for a no-nonsense book on accessing the Subconscious mind, then this book will be about as relevant to you as a bicycle is to an asteroid.  It is page after page of stories about how the Easter Bunny is all you need to make everything in your life go swimmingly.  It is offensive to anyone who is interested in real-world study of the workings of consciousness.  It should be packaged with a BIG BLACK LABEL with a skull and crossbones on it, because that's how we treat poisons in this country. If you have even the most basic intelligence commonly known as \\"Common Sense\\" this book will disgust you.<br /><br />Everything this author has to say boils down to his own narrowminded religious world view.  He extensively quotes material from the Judeo-Christian \\"The Holy Bible\\" and makes it very clear that what he lacks in education and legitimate credentials, he more than makes up for in psychotic hallucination and outright delusion.<br /><br />This is not a serious work, the author is clearly just another Xtian charlatan out to separate you from your money and your sanity as he brainwashes you around to his way of thinking.  Save your money.
B000002KDX|5.0|It's odd how some bands release medicore albums for several years, never have any hits, and somehow manage to retain a fan base, one example would be the band POCO. Then low and behold just as you're about to write the band off they hit big with songs like, \\"In the heart of the night.\\" <br />Then there are bands like BOSTON who hit the ground running with a huge Monster first release album only to fizzle out down the Peter Frampton highway. (He was a big 70's star for about 10 min's). <br />Then you have a band like AMERICA who released an outstanding first album 35 years ago that still sounds just as new and fresh as it did way back in 1971. Granted the band itself has been reviewed as a mellow rock marshmellow Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young wannabe band but.... <br />over the years they have proven their staying power. <br />And to be honest the only song that sounded like a CSN&Y rip off was, \\"Horse with no name\\" which can only be compaired to Young's, \\"Heart of Gold.\\" After that both bands as groups and solo performs had their own sound. To make the point more clear, The BEATLES sounded just like THE BEACH BOYS when they recorded, \\"Back in the USSR.\\" Guess What? <br />They did it on purpose it's called a HOOK. <br />Now that we have that issue cleared up let's judge this first album and the band for the total body of work and not just one or two songs. <br />This album is filled with some of the best folk/rock, soft rock of the 1970's campairable to that of James Taylor, Jackson Browne or the Eagles. <br />Songs like \\"Riverside,\\" \\"Three Roses,\\" \\"Children,\\" \\"Here,\\" \\"I never found the time.\\" This album is so tightly recorded, edited, produced and polished that it almost comes across as a concept album. These guys did one hell of a great job putting this record together along with the help of Ian Samuel sitting in as the producer. <br />Oh by the way this record was recorded four years before Beatle producer George Martin took control of the panel board. <br />Andin 1972 America beat out the Eagles as best new group at the Grammy Awards. One more thing after you buy this CD and admitt that you really love these songs, and take a step further... go buy the new America CD, \\"Here and Now,\\" it's the best recording from these guys within the last 30 years. Final word, (America) the first album earns a 5- star rating.
0743298020|5.0|Diane Setterfield has written an old-fashioned gothic that immediately draws in the reader and keeps her spellbound. With its timeless quality, its intertwined family secrets, and, yes, even the cold rain of its fog-bound moors, The Thirteenth Tale kept me up well past midnight and served as a reminder of all the reasons I love reading.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
0618680004|5.0|It's nice to be reminded, if only once in a blue moon, that there are other atheists out there too.  As a very enthusiastic member of the choir, I'm sure I laughed at all the right places and just as hard as Dawkins could have hoped.  I might have more of a soft spot for anti-religious aimed humor than you, but I guarantee that if you only get a quarter of the enjoyment I did from the book, it will be well worth your time.  Not to say the book is entirely humor--I hope people pay special attention to Russell's celestial teapot example, which explains the concept of burden of proof, since it goes to the heart of most of the flawed religious reasoning I've heard people subscribe to.  For those who have commented that Dawkins's book is polemical, 1) of course it is, and 2) it's commendable that he didn't focus on the crusades, inquisition, etc., which are the most obvious (and tasteless because they're largely irrelevant now) fodder for the \\"look how terrible religion is\\" tactic.  Bravo for holding back on that.    The book has also sealed my contempt for theologians, whom I've long considered a waste of our educational resources.  If universities are so dead set on squandering money on highly improbable ventures, I'd rather see them fire the theologians and replace them with Tolkien historians, because I think it's more likely that Lord of the Rings actually happened than that god exists.    I'm really curious whether I'll be alive to see Dawkins's foretold \\"critical mass\\" of atheists shape up, but I've got a while to go, so I'll just keep praying to the invisible man in the sky.
B000068FXX|4.0|I'm sure you are familiar with Supertramp from Breakfast In America or possibly Crime Of The Century (both most have albums). Well, this CD is right up there as being one of the greatest Supertramp recordings. For my money, Supertramp was on fire during these years and was pumping out some seriously good music. Fool's Overture - turn it up, lay back and be amazed!
1582701709|4.0|I love this book, and I decided to visit Amazon and buy a few copies for friends. Then I started reading the reviews and was shocked at what I read. I decided to write a review and address some of the broad categories of issues raised.    The amount of negativity in these comments should be your first clue that a book like this is relevant. If you need additional proof, just visit any political blog. The vitriol that people heap upon each other is astounding. These are not happy, healthy people. Their way of life is not something I want to adopt. And I'm certainly not going to make decisions based on their rants.    The charge that The Secret is nothing new is hilarious. So what? Old ideas are repackaged every day and offered for sale. Greatest hit albums, collections of old books bound in a single cover, box sets of movies and TV shows, etc. If you have a bunch of old books that contain better material, then pass this book over. But don't try to dissuade someone else who may have never been exposed to some of these ideas.    Don't dismiss something just because someone may be making a ton of money from it. That is ridiculous. This lady has been working to bring out this book and DVD for many years. It is obviously something she believes in very strongly. It doesn't sound to me like she is trying to make a quick fortune by tricking people. And the book is pretty cheap really. It's not like she is suckering people out of Enron-sized retirement accounts.    There are a lot of Christian reviewers who think this is evil because it doesn't give enough credit to God. Some of you even admit that you haven't read the book. Don't you know that you make all of us look like dolts when you rant against something that you've not even investigated? Get some intellectual courage. And ask yourself this; Would you rather people read this book, or would you prefer them reading some of the garbage on the newstands? If something is generally steering people in the right direction, shutup and get out of the way.    For those who are distraught about the weight-loss section of the book, just calm down. She's not saying that overweight people are bad. She is trying to help people that are not happy with their weight.    For those that are upset about the healing section of the book, she never says that you shouldn't seek medical help for cancer. She says to let the doctors do their job, and YOU focus on ways to calm your mind and allow the body to fight.    Take from this book whatever you need, and discard the rest. You are smart enough to figure out which is which. In my opinion, it is well worth the price.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Now it is my turn to chime in. I orginally saw this movie in the theaters with my partner. The movie theater was packed with all people both straight and gay. There was not an eye that dry when the movie was over. I liked this movie for what it is and what it stands for. It is a story about about two men that find each other in the early 60s and fall in love. If everyone remembers what the early 60s were like for people of color, and everyone that  was a different faith than Christian. This was not a time of safety for anyone that was different from the white Christian hetrosexual family. With that being said, Jack and Enis did what they had to at the time the movie took place for the safety of themselves and their families. I find it very interesting what people are saying about this movie and why they don't like it. All that they are talking about is how these two men in love cheated on their wives. I ask myself, can these reviewers see the trees through the forest? Or better yet, can they see past their own noses (the reviewers) and walk in these men's shoes in that era being who they were? No, they would not have the strength to be who they were in those times. I am a person that came out in the 80s, into a society that was not accepting of me or my partner. I can only imagine what it was like in the 60s where everyone was hated for being different than a white hetrosexual Christian male. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see pure strength and a fearlessness for who they love.
6305781427|5.0|Although this is Yanni's performance the violinist, the drummer and the band members hide the fact I am not a true Yanni fan. The best drum solo I have seen and I have seen a lot. Also the woman in red if you will who performs miraculous works of art and music on her violin are not to be missed.  Became a favorite CD of my nine year old daughter and you must see to love it.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Hey kids, I miss this show as much as you do but I have season 1 and didn't want to get another copy of this.  Currently Target is selling EACH season, including the abbreviated Season 5, for $19.99 each until 3/19/07.  As much as I love Amazon, the total for all seasons would be $139.93, much cheaper than this boxed set's price.  Unless you're paying for extras that would be in this set and not in the individual sets, save money!
1582701709|1.0|A review of the book or even the movie is one thing.  Are they entertaining?  Sure.  But this book is not being read as entertainment.  It is being read as an instructional manual to one's life.  This is extremely dangerous.  This book denies a judgemental God and therefore denies a true and moral right and wrong.  It serves a selfish person's ideals that \\"whatever I want is right\\".  PLEASE BE CAREFUL IN LIVING THIS WAY.  Although success may be found, and happiness attained through the narrow minded self-believing taught in this book.  You may begin to forget what others around you desire and need as these teachings bolster a selfish \\"I want MY way\\" mentality.  I would say that if you choose ONE BOOK to just dig into and follow, make it one that teaches humility and serving your common man.  You may not win the lotto, but you'll definitely make a big difference in the world.
1400103282|5.0|Steve Wozniak's IWOZ comes to life in an excellent audio narrated by winning audio narrator Patrick Lawlor, who spices up the 9 hours of unabridged cd action. Thirty years after Wozniak's dream of a personal computer, the world's been transformed - and his company Apple has risen to become an industry giant. IWOZ documents the sources of his inspiration and in audio provides even more impact than the written word.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|So, the wife slipped on her \\"Bond Girl\\" necklace and off we went to see Casino Royale.  Without a doubt, Daniel Graig is very much his own man.  That's a pleasant departure from the previous model.  Although mine is a minority opinion, Mr. Brosnan's steely gaze wore thin early on.  There was a reason he was a success on television.  He's a television actor! <br /> <br />But, back to Bond.   <br /> <br />Director Martin Campbell must force himself to spend more time in the editing room.  This was a one hundred and ten minute film needlessly stretched to two and one-half hours.  The post main credits chase on foot grew mind-numbing.  The collasping building (read model) in Venice was simply daft.  And composer David Arnold merely phoned in another of his forgettable string-enhanced soundtracks.  One immediately longs for the days of John Barry.  The time has come to strap Mr. Arnold under Goldfinger's laser. <br /> <br />Here's hoping Campbell and Co. trim more than a bit of fat from the next entry.  Anyone and his brother will tell you the best Bonds stop at the two-hour mark.  And for God sakes... put \\"M\\" back on the other side of the gender scale.  The gimmick that was introduced with Brosnan's portrayal has grown increasingly tiresome.   <br /> <br />Despite the complaints, EON has set its series down a new and exciting path.  Well done.
B000002JEV|5.0|This is a great collection of songs. All 3 comunication breakdowns are good the last sounds like jam sandwich from Deathwish. The girl I love is realgood it has all the elements. Something else has good piano from Jones. The long version of you shook me is the best version it has it all Thank yous much better than the studio. This Starway to Heaven is the first time they played it live. This version of Whole lotta love may not be has good has the one on How the west was won but its good and different.
B000002U82|5.0|From a 48 year old rocker who saw Led Zepplin and Pink Floyd as often as possible I want to welcome the new members to the fan club. It is so great to see teens and twenties loving these two bands and I put them together because I was told by a 15 year old yesterday I needed to. It was great when working in a comic book, retro stuff store that I was told over and over by the youth of today that my Dark Side of the Moon Baseball Jersey from seeing Roger Waters in concert in October was really great. Mom and Dad don't worry.  The concerts are either old or young people and us old suffered the consequences of a wayward youth in many cases and we are making sure new Floyd Fans do Floyd in a nice way.
1400079179|3.0|This book is good at times, but I personally didn't understand what all the hype was, even after reading it.  As someone who grew up reading Robert Ludlum, Clive Cussler and Ian Fleming, I was more than ready to dive into this suspenseful novel.  The ideals behind the plot are not what bothered me; it was the archaic, cardboard character of Robert Langdon that was somewhat ridiculous.  Langdon seems to suddenly possess kinetic skills as well as somewhat supernatural athletic abilities.  He can jump 20 feet and land without breaking an ankle, and seems to be able to dodge bullets better than any character from \\"The Matrix\\".  I have no affiliations that would present themselves to be biased on the material presented, I was just hoping for something a little deeper.  Langdon to me came across as a poor man's Dirk Pitt or Jason Bourne, and although he has a superior intellect in cryptology compared to most, the story was not to my particular liking.  That doesn't mean you should take my word for it, others may look at what I read and scoff away, so it is all up to opinion.  I have heard good comments about his other, lesser-known novels so I will maybe give Digital Fortress a try.  In all due respect, however, the plot did wrap up fairly well and considering how this topic is something that could \\"shake foundations\\", I found the ending to be something to nod in agreement with.  It doesn't mean I believe it or not, but the seriousness for which it took on was more believable than Langdon's constant \\"courage under fire\\" persona.
0393035158|3.0|It looks that Sam Harris is too obsessed with religious estremism like suicie bombing, terror rooted from religion..etc. while he is at his best getting the philosphical ground for irrationality of religion, I believe he fails to dip into more sociological and pysochological factors that keep religion alive in society. The foremost flaw through the book is that he has spent too much time to contemplate on irrelevant subjects like pragmatism (he seeminlgy studided philosophy!) with no succesful linking to religion. I think Richard Dawkins is far better than Harris
0380789035|5.0|I'm not going to say this is the greatest thing I've ever read, but I loved this book and I can't find any fault in it.  I've read his Sandman comics and Stardust, so I think it's safe to say I understand his style as a storyteller.<br /><br />The story is very interesting, detailed, and I never got the sense that it was formulaic or \\"the same ol' Gaiman\\".  Well, except that it is a dark fantasy novel with plenty of depth, so it is Gaiman being Gaiman in that regard.<br /><br />There are tangents to other side-stories throughout the novel and I didn't find them awkward in the slightest.  It provides a foundation to the story at hand. In my opinion, it was never long-winded or simplistic.<br /><br />\\"American Gods\\" is a dark fantasy story, and I think within that context, it's a great story. It could have been excessively melancholic or fantastic and I would have rolled my eyes at how cheesy it would have been in the end.  It could have been really complex and word-laden and it would have left me behind as if I was reading \\"Gone With the Wind\\". It strikes a nice balance and it never assumes you're dumber or smarter than you are.
B000ICM5VW|3.0|I thought the movie was pretty bad itself with story line and I got grossed out with the bugs, but the picture quality is sure great to watch.  Probably the best movie I saw in HD DVD and I own willy wonka, Last Samurai, Fast and the Furious, and Spactacus.  The picture quality does not even match close to king kong.  I give it three stars just because the movie itself was bad.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|This was my first Pain of Salvation album and I wasn't sure of what to expect. Upon hearing the first track, I was shocked to hear aggro riffs on top of rapping! I was almost disappointed because this is supposed to be progressive metal right?  I guess I kind of expected something along the lines of Dream Theater's `Scenes From a Memory Pt.2', you know, epic structure, virtuoso musicianship, what you usually come to think of when you hear the term `progressive metal.' Soon the bits of lyric that I could understand on the track `Scarsick' began to catch my attention, so I picked up the booklet. From that point on, this album had grabbed me by the balls and dragged me through the entire performance. Before I knew it over an hour had passed and the album was done. I had literally felt like I had watched the human race fade into black.<br /><br />You will react to this album upon first listening in one of three general ways. One, this album will fly right over your head and you will say `What's the big deal?', or Two, you will read the lyrics and immediately junk it. The lyrics on here are extremely clear, brutal, and honest, and very offensive to some people, or Three, you will `get it' and realize that this is so powerful and meaningful, that this could possibly be the strongest album ever written.<br /><br />What we have here is basically a dark and pessimistic approach on two similar subjects. Tracks `Scarsick' to `Disco Queen' (1-5) focus primarily on the faults of American pop culture, and the `rap' tracks are all in this section. (Make sense?) Musically the first section is the most diverse and eccentric. The second section, marked in the album booklet as `side two' focus on American politics and religion. And who doesn't know that in this modern age, `politics is religion'? Musically on the second half, PoS leans towards their more signature breed of very melodic and passionate industrial metal. Each track, reguardless of the style, is equally powerful and rewarding. There are no 'skip' tracks in my opinion. (even though it seems that nobody likes the electronica 'disco queen', I personally find it quite catchy and enjoyable.) It is almost impossible to specifically classify the actual music in `Scarsick', so when I try to classify it, I am just speaking in generalities.<br /><br />What this album does lyrically is basically takes all the pretty little toys that make up our society, peels the paint off and exposes the dark, ugly core. The lyrics are very straightforward and to the point. There is not much translating that needs to be done, and the only abstract metaphors used are for color and are not the main theme.<br /><br />Everyone should give this album a try, though I'm sure that most `wont get it'. Surely not destined to be mainstream, but a true masterpiece executed with conviction, style, and diversity.no 'skip' tracks in my opinion.

B00008J4P5|5.0|Really enjoying this album, the raw sound and throwback effects are intelligent and have great appeal.  This is my first listen to this band so I am not an expert of their background or other albums.  Still, I just love this CD and this is coming from someone who does not listen to many new bands as of late.  When I first heard them I was expecting someone to tell me it was some underground band that had recorded years ago.  Now I know they are here to stay.  I enjoy the vocals and the guitar and piano that the duo performs.  My favorite songs are Black Math and of course, Seven Nation Army.  I like it all though, even red influenced album covers they seem to do.  There are not many new bands I like, but this one has to beat them all with songwriting that is flowing and an art rock style that is not often seen anymore, when compared to music of the past.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I just dont understand how anyone could like this watered down garbage.  Its not artistic enough to get by as something other than rock...and it definitely doesn't rock.  That leaves Coldplay somewhere in no-man's land...making forgettable nonsense.  Want straightforward rock...try The White Stripes or something.  Art-rock is a genre mastered by few...The Beatles did it.  But when Coldplay goes there...it sounds like elevator music.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|A troubled young boy with the memory issues (Ashton Kutcher) is suddenly able to transport himself back into moments from his past, change them for the better and return to the present. The changes he makes affect not only his life but the lives of his close friends. The problem is - he never knows how exactly the changes made in the past would affect the present. The idea of the movie is anything but new - we all read Ray Bradbury's \\"A Sound of Thunder,\\" an unforgettable short story about a time-traveler who steps on a prehistoric butterfly and causes the horrible changes in the fate of the whole humanity. We've seen the films Frequency, Groundhog Day, and Memento - Butterfly Effect borrows a lot from them. BE is not as good as they are but it is a compelling and intriguing movie about making choices and taking responsibilities. I recommend watching director's cut with the ending completely different from the theatrical release. The ending that I saw really made this movie for me.<br /><br />Very respectable even if not completely successful effort for Kutcher to do something different than Cheaper by the Dozen (2003), My Boss's Daughter (2003), and Just Married (2003).<br /><br />3.5/5 or 7/10
0757302661|5.0|I bought this book only a few weeks before I gave birth, so I didn't even have time to practice the techniques much. This system worked anyway. It will change your whole perspective on giving birth, and it will give you a very effective way to manage your pain during labor and delivery. My midwife actually told me: \\"Your labor should have been on The Discovery Channel.\\" Certainly every body is different, but it is definitely worth a shot. Also effective for dealing with stress and relaxation in your daily life. Outstanding, and definitely worth a shot.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I got turned on to the Peppers in '92 when I was in the tenth grade. BSSM was in my rotation for a few years! However, as of late I had not listen to much of their music.

Stadium Arcadium will not disappoint!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This line spoken by Rocky in the movie couldn't be more true. This movie was surprising to all Rocky fans. Sylvester Stallone closes the greatest underdog story of our time by taking it back to it's roots. Rocky back in Philly, as it ended in Rocky V, original music by Bill Conti, and old characters from the first movie. What a way to end a classic series. A must see for any Rocky fan.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|Five solo albums in five years. Oha!!! <br />Neal Morse today could perfectly be called \\"Mr. Prog Rock\\". Without any doubt.  <br />All who love this style since the late 60s are able to find in his music all the elements that make us feel kinda \\"different\\". <br />Four movements. Three large ones, one average.  <br />The cd title may induce you think that this is another christian piece. <br />YES, IT IS. BUT WHAT PIECE!. Neal comes and goes with his visions of peace, hell, doors, pathways, God; all going up and down without a bridge to let us take a rest.  <br />My advice: take a seat, shut your mouth, open your mind. LISTEN, not only the music, but also the words.  <br />If you, like me, are not a native english speaking person, anyway, find a dictionary and try to understand. <br />Is this Morse's best effort?. Arguably not. Or may be yes. All his career is his best effort.  <br />Thank's Neal, again.
0684859106|4.0|I regularly use this book and everything that I have made from it has turned out wonderfully. The reason I have not given it full marks is because of the requirement of 3 or 4 layer pans for some of the cakes. Although an avid baker, I neither own 4 pans of a particular size nor have the oven space to bake that many cakes at once. This is a bit slack in my opinion and more effort should have been put into translating from a professional's recipe to one suitable for a home cook considering they expect us to pay for the book. Having said all that, I get around this problem by baking in one or two pans and slicing the baked cake into layers afterwards as required.  <br /> <br />I too am puzzled by some of the negative reviews and people complaining about the amount of sugar or butter. What do people expect!! These are desserts and that's what makes them taste so good.
B000850IHW|5.0|This is a great album. How many albums do you come across that get 5 stars from EVERY reviewer. For me this band was a much better listen than any other 1970's band and this album is a good place to start... so get it, listen to it... it's amazing stuff...
0374105235|5.0|This is an autobiography about a boy who loses his family and innocence to war. He becomes a child-soldier in the Sierra Leone Army, in order to have some place to belong, and takes part in the killing that causes other children also to lose their parents.  He kills in order to stay alive, and in order to kill his mind is numbed to violence.  There are a few people in this world that have the courage to help others without asking for anything in return, and UNICEF is one of them.  They showed Ishmael that love still existed and that he was not responsible for reacting to the pain around him.  Ishmael also has a lot of courage to be able to see that life had more to offer than being a product of his circumstances.  For anyone who has been through a lot of pain in their early life and is not easily inspired, this book is an inspiration.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|Just take a look at the key words and see if that is what you want to sit down and expose to your family.  Dark Comedy is an understatement.  While the plot is fresh, keep kids away from this movie.  The time spent to get to the punchline is filled with shocking dialogue and cold, vapid, wasted space.  Nothing warm here.  If any family resembles the characters in this movie, they need to be in therapy rather than watching movies.  Sure, Alan Arkin won an Oscar, but that is a sad testimony to what Un-Holywood considers Oscar-worthy.  Any of his previous performances were better.
B000QXDED6|3.0|I've waited a long time before watching this film (to the point that this review is mostly irrelevant).  As a history fan, I needed to take some time to separate what I know about Thermopylae from the Frank Miller comic book.  I knew that if I viewed this film as anything other than a \\"fantasy\\" film I had no chance of enjoying it.  So, my mind-set is adjusted, my sense of history is checked at the door.  I'm ready to watch a mindless action \\"epic\\".  I actually bought the DVD so that I was invested in enjoying this film (I.E;\\" I hope I did not waste my money\\" therefore \\"I hope I enjoy this\\").<br /><br />Well, thankfully I bought it on sale.  As hard as I tried, I did not enjoy it as much as so many other people did.  I can't deny that lurking historical facts were leeching out of my \\"pragmatic\\" brain into my \\"pleasure\\" brain.  So take that for what it's worth.  But I still managed to watch it mostly as its own story.  I believe that if the terms; Greek, Spartans, Persians, Thermopylae, Leonidas and Xerxes had been omitted from this film and replaced with; Wooshnicks, Furbees, Gargoyles, Narrow Pass, Studly and Pierce I could have completely separated the history from the fantasy.  That's my problem; understood.  However, I often found myself laughing when I wasn't supposed to, snickering at some unconvincing Special FX and overall, not buying into this surreal fantasy.  That's the film makers' problem.<br /><br />In my ever futile attempt to write a shorter review, here are a bunch of categorized vignettes to clarify what I saw while watching this DVD:<br /><br />PS; I can't guarantee \\"no spoilers\\" but if I think it is I'll give one of these; #<br /><br />-THE VIOLENCE<br />I have no problem with violence in film.  Since this film is primarily about a specific BATTLE it really is the focal point of the film.  BOY IS IT THE FOCAL POINT!  Unfortunately this is one of the things I snickered at.  The goal was clearly to recreate comic book-like action poses; mission accomplished.  Every time a cool pose is achieved the action slows down so we can get a nice look, then it speeds up again so we can get to the next cool pose.  Sometimes this was cool.  Sometimes this was tedious.  I liked the way I could see how the warriors killing ballet worked out, but I was longing for a sense of the action in real time.  The only time I felt the weight of the Persian's numbers was in the initial melee.<br /><br />-THE NUDITY<br />I have no problem with nudity in film.  I don't own any pornography but this is the closest thing I have next to \\"Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n\\".  Though there are no genital shown you get to see everything else.  The one big sex scene seemed really jammed into place.  I had trouble figuring out why it was there (other than obvious marketing reasons).  Also, the scene of Xerxes tent was just bizarre.  Xerxes decadence was almost ridiculous.  He had half naked women squirming about, even standing in one spot (just standing there, wiggling), and several reject Cenobites from the \\"Hellraiser\\" films.  Also, body piercing and body chains are sure signs of evil for some reason (bondage?).  However, this scene served more of a purpose than the big Leonidas sex scene.<br /><br />-THE STORY<br />Well, don't get me going on \\"History\\".  In my opinion, the \\"real\\" story of Thermopylae is a more complex and enthralling tale than this fantasy.  That said; this story as a fantasy could have been so much better.  Get rid of the queen; useless.  Get rid of the politics; pointless.  Get rid of the awful narration by Van Helsing's sidekick monk; because that's what he sounded like (it's the same guy FYI).  Since historical accuracy is not the point in this film, quit trying to explain everything.  I'd buy into it more then.  I have no problem with a shallow story about a battle; that would be great.  I thought most of the story elements in this film that were not the battle were extraneous.<br /><br />-VISUALS<br />Now this is what gets people interested in these types of movies, right?  If the goal was to recreate the look and feel of the comic; mission accomplished again.  From what little I've seen of the comic, I'd have to say they hit the mark.  Unfortunately I did not like that look translated to film.  It was well done but I had a key problem with this; this is a live action motion picture, not a comic book.  When I watch a movie (fantasy or otherwise) no matter how surreal or fantastic the environment, I want to believe I'm there.  I always felt like I was in a green room with computer FX surrounding me.  Also, since so very often swords and spears would impale people, CGI was used to create the \\"other end\\" of the weapons coming out the bodies.  But often the trajectory of the \\"in\\" side of the weapon did not seem to line up with the \\"out\\" side of the weapon.  I don't know if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but something did not look right.  Lastly, the blood being copious (comic book style) was also CGI.  I've no problem with this fundamentally, but often it looked unnatural or painted in.  I can't buy into the fantasy if the blood looks fake; sorry.<br /><br />-THE ACTING<br />Hey, what does it take to shout \\"SPAR-TA!!\\" and \\"WHOOT!\\" But seriously, as a hyper-drama the actors were asked to act hyper-dramatically.  Everyone did a decent job accept Faramir (David Wenham).  His character voice was inexplicably the same voice he used in \\"Van Helsing\\" which is not much like his \\"Farimir\\" voice.  I actually had a hard time not imagining him in his monk's costume.  He was not the worst actor but he did seem out of place.  There was some bad acting in this but it was limited to minor players (or the directors fault?).<br /><br />-LITTLE THINGS THAT BUGGED ME<br />#When Leonidas explains to Quasimodo the requirements for fighting like a Spartan, he describes the Greek Phalanx.  Since Quasi can't stand erect, he can't raise his shield to defend his mates.  The King was very cordial to Quasi.  Quasi still was not happy.  When the fighting begins the phalanx is employed and the Persians receive the subsequent piercing.  But wait. Leonidas soon forgets this unfailing tactic and resumes later melees in open order, mano-a-mano combat.  Quasi!! Come back!!! You can fight!  This made The King look disingenuous.  Another annoyance; I have real trouble with massive armies sending their soldiers in sequence to fight one on one (like in Kung Fu movies).  Granted, they come fast in this movie, but rarely do they do what most would if given the opportunity; surround the exposed guy with 10 guys and attack at once.  Since the Spartans were not in Phalanx most of the time, this is what would have happened.<br /><br />-MONSTERS #<br />Here's where I knew I had some level of success separating the history from the comic book.  I honestly had no problem with Rhinos and Elephants showing up at Thermopylae; it never happened but so what.  I had no problem with Xerxes' Cenobites or his giant ogre guy.  Heck, I had very little trouble with Xerxes being a transsexual giant.  I understood the attempt at clarifying good and evil (there's a whole lot wrong with this but I'm not going there).  I thought Quasi was a pretty clever idea.  As a rejected/rescued Spartan baby reared as a Spartan in seclusion, this character, in the context of a fantasy, made a lot of sense.  The only \\"monster\\" that bothered me was the \\"Orc\\" immortals.  What was that all about?  Everything else seemed to fit in a weird way except the \\"orcmortals\\".<br /><br />-THE DVD<br />I bought the one disc version so I didn't get any extras at all; kind of cheep when you think about it.  Most one disc versions have, at least, a couple of extras.  Sound and picture are good enough.<br /><br />Well, I failed again at being brief.  Watching this film and evaluating how I felt about it were a little more complex than I thought (since this is a pretty simple film).  I clearly did not hate it (once my mind was in the right context) but I did not think it was well enough executed to garner exalted status either.  Overall it was a little (well actually, A LOT) too hyper dramatic for me to take seriously.  The posing and shouting of lines, the creatures and unconvincing visuals (intended as surreal or otherwise) came off as somewhat goofy to me (like a few other comic book movies I've seen).  I don't think that's what the film makers were going for.  I know I'm in the minority, but if you have the same mind-set as me (you like to believe what you are watching for 2 to 3 hours) you might not think this is so great either.  It's sort of fun but not in the way I was expecting or hoping.sequent piercing.  But wait. Leonidas soon forgets this unfailing tactic and resumes later melees in open order, mano-a-mano combat.

B00013F38K|5.0|What good things can I say about the television series \\"Kung Fu\\" (1972-75) that haven't already been said?  More than 30 years after the original TV show left the airwaves, it remains my favorite American network series.  Not only were \\"Kung Fu's\\" writing and acting all superlative, but its highly unusual, Zen-like take on the all-American genre of the Western -- in case you don't know, the show is about a Buddhist monk roaming the Wild West -- still resonates.  For my money, the first-season episode titled \\"An Eye for an Eye\\" remains the finest thing that American episodic TV has ever created.  Here is the best way for me to sum up how much I love \\"Kung Fu\\": of all the decorations in my home, only one is a photo of a celebrity -- an autographed picture of David Carradine as Kwai-Chang Caine.   <br /> <br />Now that you know how highly I regard \\"Kung Fu,\\" I would still like to make a few comments about it.  As much as I respect the series for popularizing the Asian presence in U.S. history at a time when hardly anyone else was doing so, the series did cut a few corners, and this bugs me a bit.   <br /> <br />ACTING: \\"Kung Fu's\\" weakest link is Radames Pera as the young Kwai-Chang (a.k.a. \\"Grasshopper\\") in the famous flashbacks.  While the performances by the cast and guest stars are usually excellent, Pera's recitation of his lines totally lacks any convincing emotional undercurrent.  Also, he doesn't look very much like Carradine, who plays the character that he's supposed to grow up to be.  I have a hard time believing that Pera was the best choice for this part.   <br /> <br />ETHNIC ISSUES: The country of China, the setting for the show's flashbacks, is a patchwork quilt of various ethnicities.  However, the country's dominant ethnic group is the Han people, the first folks we Westerners tend to think of as \\"Chinese,\\" while the others, such as the Uygurs and the Tibetans, are considered \\"minorities.\\"  In \\"Kung Fu's\\" pilot, when Master Kan (Philip Ahn) tells young half-white Caine that the Shaolin monastery has never accepted anyone other than of \\"full-Chinese birth,\\" I take him to mean anything other than full-Han ancestry.  My response to this is: \\"Why, then, does Master Kan have a Mongolian name?\\"  It's a small point, to be sure, but one that could have been avoided.  (For my thoughts on Carradine, a Caucasian actor, playing the half-Chinese Caine, see my Amazon review of \\"Kung Fu's\\" second season.)   <br /> <br />ACTION: The element of \\"Kung Fu\\" that dates the poorest is its fight scenes.  Prior to the series, Western popular culture was not greatly exposed to Asian martial arts.  One of the few exceptions was Bruce Lee's high-kicking acrobatics on another TV show, \\"The Green Hornet\\" (1966-67), but this did not have an immediate impact upon large American audiences.  So, \\"Kung Fu's\\" slow-motion fight scenes were quite innovative for their time, and I remember being thrilled by them when the show first aired.  To speculate, it may have been because of \\"Kung Fu's\\" popularity that American movie screens soon made room for martial-arts films from Asia, especially those from Hong Kong, such as \\"Five Fingers of Death\\" and Bruce Lee's starring vehicles.  Once American audiences got a taste of them, however, their dynamism made \\"Kung Fu's\\" heavily stylized fighting less satisfying.  In fact, compared to the unarmed-combat movies from Hong Kong, \\"Kung Fu's\\" slow-motion fights come off primarily as a means to cover up Carradine's lack of mastery in the martial arts.  Still, this isn't enough to wreck the series for me.   <br /> <br />HAIR: This is the show's flaw that really bothers me the most: the hairstyles of the Chinese men.  From 1644 to 1912 (which includes the years when \\"Kung Fu\\" is set), the Qing Dynasty required men (but not women) in China to wear their hair in queues.  This meant not only wearing a ponytail, but shaving the area around the crown and temples of one's head as well.  The Qing Dynasty, which had conquered China from Manchuria, compelled the Han men to adopt this Manchurian hairstyle as a symbol of native-Chinese subservience to their new rulers.  Those men that refused to wear the queue were summarily executed, giving rise to the saying, \\"Lose your hair and keep your head; otherwise, keep your hair and lose your head.\\"  The only adult Chinese males who did not wear queues were Buddhist monks, who, as \\"Kung Fu\\" more accurately depicts, shaved their heads entirely.   <br /> <br />Chinese men in America were not exempt from this decree.  Until 1952, racist laws in the U.S. prohibited Asian-born immigrants (most of whom were men) from becoming naturalized citizens.  Therefore, even on American soil, 19th-century Chinese men, who theoretically could be deported back to their native country at any time, were obliged to follow this Qing Dynasty law.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, \\"Kung Fu\\" does not deal accurately with Chinese men's tonsorial traditions in the 19th century: most of the series' Chinese men wear contemporary 20th-century hairstyles.  If a queue is present at all, it's usually just a braided ponytail attached to a contemporary coif.  The one time the subject of queues comes up on \\"Kung Fu\\" (the third season's \\"This Valley of Fear\\"), Caine says that wearing one is only \\"a personal choice.\\"  Regrettably, the moment is a missed opportunity to educate the audience about the significance of Qing-era hairstyles.   <br /> <br />So, every Chinese man in \\"Kung Fu\\" not wearing a queue, and who is not a Shaolin monk, does not have an authentic period hairstyle.  However, I'm not saying that Carradine ought to have worn a queue.  In fact, knowing about 19th-century Chinese hairstyles makes me appreciate his shoulder-length mane all the more: it instantly marks Caine as an outlaw. Still, the unusualness of his hairstyle on a Chinese man of the Qing era should have immediately signaled something amiss to the show's other characters.  For example, the Chinese railroad crewin the pilot would have remarked about his grown-out shaved head before they noticed the Shaolin marks on his arms.  The crew cut on the Chinese dissident Wong Ti Lu (Mako) in the first season's \\"The Tide\\" also makes sense as a political statement of someone opposed to the Qing emperor.  Otherwise, the 20th-century hairstyles on the show's other Chinese men are a nagging reminder not only of a historical inaccuracy, but also of a thematically rich element ignored by the series.  Would it have been so uneconomical for \\"Kung Fu\\" to have put its non-Shaolin Chinese male characters in bald wigs with queues attached to them?   <br /> <br />Still, I hope that none of my comments about \\"Kung Fu\\" discourages anyone interested in the show from checking out the DVD.  After all, the reason I know as much about Chinese history as I do is because \\"Kung Fu\\" made such an enormous impact on me.  I'm glad that the series continues to move audiences today.   <br /> <br />(Note: I have also written reviews for the second and third seasons of \\"Kung Fu.\\")  <br />

B00000420F|5.0|A great singer is one who dedicates singing to the text itself instead to himself/herself.<br /><br />This is achieved 100% by Ms. Bartoli in this earlier album of hers. The recordings here cannot be termed otherwise than 'immaculate'.  The very opening song 'Gia sole dal gange' is a display of Bartoli's unique timbre in its full beauty - glorious, rich and full. Many singers could tackle the range of this song, mezzos or sopranos, but who could pull it off in the manner as Ms. Bartoli? Credit to the one who picked this as the opening song of this fantastic album.<br /><br />The songs following come in different styles and moods, all given full authentic interpretations by the singer.  Compare the 'Vittoria, vittoria mio core' to 'Intorno al'idol mio' or 'Amarilli, mio bella' the vast contrast of mood, brought out equally well. The songs' requirement of versatility of interpretation is fully catered for.<br /><br />I hate it when people say that this is a learners' album accompanying the 24 Italian Songs edited by one publisher.  Such remarks could barely do justice to Ms. Bartoli's superb artistry, though admittedly, this CD would be an invaluable one for THAT purpose. What about the songs NOT included in the 24 Italian songs?
B00005J6UP|5.0|I can remember watching this film as a child and being both thrilled and scared in equal measure. At breakneck pace it takes the viewer into a world of friendship, skulduggery and adventure that has only improved over time.<br /><br />Now, as a parent, I've watched this with my eldest son countless times and it never fails to entertain. If you enjoy this kind of rollicking, adventure mystery, yarn you may also enjoy the films: Raiders of the Lost Ark and Monster House; and the books: The Hardy Boys Mysteries and Beatrice Beecham's Fearsome Feast.
B00005BI4G|5.0|At that time (actually just before my time, sadly-I never saw them live during this period), they were taking us into new realms of art and mind. The stories are both intrinsically harsh and majestic, narcissistic and devious. Like John Anderson's Yes lyrics and even Ian's Tull lyrics, and of course Floyd's, they took us to places we didn't even know we wanted to go, no matter how desperate we were to go anywhere but here. But Genesis's, that connected with old world teaching in such a disconcerted way- that is the way we wanted to start looking at things, it was all too real. And the music changed in new ways so much the same of the new horizons being breached by the words. We wanted to use what we had learned, but we wanted to look at knowledge in a different way, now. They all taught us that, but here they all started saying it with such punch and charisma. <br /> <br />Sadly, the sound quality is harsh. Methinks they just didn't have access to the better equipment (even the best so very far behind today's standards) available at the time. <br /> <br />I care not. The music prevails. <br />
B00005JPFO|3.0|In his youth, Johnny Blaze (Cage) made a deal with the Devil (Fonda) .  He gave up his sould to the to save his father's life.  Years later, as the world's top stuntman, nothing can stop him from the most crazy of stunts.  The Devil won't let him die.  When Blackheart (Bentley) comes to Earth to take it over, the Devil makes Johnny into Ghost Rider - a flaming skeleton on a bike - and tasks him to defeat Blackheart and his minions.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider\\" is clearly on the B-list of Marvel superheroes, and that is evident in the film.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, as the movie is enjoyable in its own way.  Surprisingly, despite its subject matter, \\"Ghost Rider\\" does provide a number of lighter moments that contribute to its enjoyment.  The actors are all adequate, none a standout.  The effects are nicely done.  Hollywood has come a long way in animating digital flames.  In the end, \\"Ghost Rider\\" is an entertaining, but forgettable, superhero movie.

A group of children go on a road trip to find a body rumoured to be lying in the woods.<br /><br />As a movie this is not only one of the best Stephen King adaptations it also stands the test of time. Sterling performances by the late River Pheonix and Cory Feldman aside, this movie captures the soul of youth and the destruction of innocence with consumate ease and sensitivity.<br /><br />Bob Reiner, better known for Spinal Tap before this, is confident in his delivery of what has ultimately become a classic tale of childhood's end.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|So i purchased the album to one of our favorite movies of all time, and I must say I was a little dissapointed.. Maybe I was just over excited about getting the cd, that I built myself up for dissapointment. First, while all the songs that were in the movie were on the cd, I had my heart set on hearing \\"All You Need is Love\\". In the version on the movie, you hear the trumpets, the guitar, and the flutes at key points in the song.. However, the recoring sounded awful! Very faintly in the background do you hear these instruments, and the \\"keyboard beats\\" are horrible.. Otis Redding is amazing, as is Joni Mitchell. Olivia Olsen made me forget about Mariah Carey (not a fan). She has an incredible voice!<br /><br />All in all, I did like the cd, and I do recommend it, but beware! A couple of the songs have been recorded badly..
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I went to this movie thinking that it would be a light fluff. I absolutely feel in love with it. This film deals on relationships of all types, from Kate Winsletts relationship with forgotten Hollywood royalty, Jude Law's relationship with his family, to Camron's relationship with men in general. This movie is an absolute must have if you love romances. It is that and so much more!!! This movie was totally overlooked at the theater.  <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|In Joss Whedon's vision of the future, a hybrid superpower known only as 'the alliance' dominates a solar system still ravaged by a war long since done. Settlers occupy the outer rim, facing a literal final frontier as they battle with the hardships of poverty and technological breakdown and raids by cannabalistic humanoids known as 'reevers'. Amid this chaos add a ship full of brigands who harbour two fugatives on the run from the alliance, one of whom may be the most powerful weapon known to man.<br /><br />It should be run of the mill space fantasy but Whedon's strengths as a writer and first time big screen director hone this movie into a rewarding experience for the viewer. The dialogue effortlessly flits from wiscracking humour to social commentary. The action set pieces more than justify a round of applause.<br /><br />Once an axed TV show now Serenity is a 'leaf on the wind.' Watch how it soars.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|As my title states, I believe this album is the culmination of S&G's evolution from a message-driven anti-war folk duo to phenomenal pop music artists. Some may find that evolution distasteful, even a betrayal of what their previous work accomplished. For me, what overcomes such thoughts is the simple beauty of the music. Yes, the title track sounds a bit overproduced, but the message and feeling still come through loud and clear, and no other performer of this song has come close to conveying what S&G were able to in their original recording.  <br />El Condor Pasa brought Peruvian music to the pop world, an inkling of Paul Simon's later penchant for integrating world music into his work. My mother will forever quote the second line of that song when she wants to motivate me to do something (\\"I'd rather be a hammer than a nail\\"), and I guarantee that that song, as well as almost every other one on the album, will be remembered long after we are all gone. <br />One of the much criticized tracks in this forum has been \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\". It happens to be one of my all time favorite recordings. Mr Wright was and is a hero to me, standing for American originality, defiance of the status quo; the song is a fitting tribute. It is stunning in its simplicity, and Garfunkel's vocals are unmatched in their angelic tenor. And what pop or rock guitarist today could play the lovely guitar part in this song? <br />The rest are memorable, except for their live cover of \\"bye bye love\\", which, I will agree with others here, was a mistake to throw in. Certainly in my top 10 albums of all time.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|My 4-tape, VHS version of this miniseries is 372 minutes long (6 hours, 12 minutes) according to the box.  How is it that this DVD version is 240 minutes?  Am I missing something?  Is one version mislabeled, or has this DVD been edited?  Is there really over 2 hours missing?
B00028HBKM|5.0|I will revise my review after I've seen all of the movie , right now it's interesting I saw a face when I paused it to do something.  After going back several times I located an image of a face after the 17 minute and 17 second count from my dvd player.  The beginning is stunning in sound and visual, the arabic language brings the entire ensemble together, I am emotionally engaged in the story and visuals.  Mel Gibson knows how to make use of  the widescreen, you won't catch much on full screen.  I will write the rest of my review afterwards.         This film has me locked in, I am totally a bystander witnessing the event that takes place.  I am taken into the film probably just as the director had wanted the viewers to feel.  I also wanted to scream, \\"stop this\\"  as some of the people (mostly the women) are objecting to the soldiers brutal torture of an innocent flesh and blood man.  I feel just as Mary does, seeing her son take such inhuman punishment that no ordinary person would withstand and yet her image of when he was a little boy falling and getting hurt, her outreached arms ready to cradle and caress him in comfort from his pain.  She wanted to be able to do that now but she felt helpless.  Any parent who loves their children will feel the pain and I am writing about the last part of the movie where you are veiwing the scene from above, the image turns into a teardrop and falls from the sky.  That is so touching.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Sir George Martin - the man who produced the original Beatles sound - has gone into his archives and put together a whole new blend of Beatles music. Layers upon layers of Beatles clips are woven together to create 26 fantastic memorable cuts. Over 130 songs are represented in the mix. The sound editing is simply brilliant. The transitions between the songs are inspired. And the clear digital sound allows you to hear these classic songs in a whole new way - the vocals are sharper, the music crisper... Any true Beatles fan will be floored by the creativity of Sir George and his son Giles, who co-created this gargantuan project. The album took 2 years to complete - and the Beatles (and their surviving spouses) approved of every clip during the making of this album. The CD was designed to be the soundtrack to the incredible Cirque show in Las Vegas - but it easily stands on its own as the latest Beatle album. It's a must for every Beatles fan and collector. Put on your headphones, crank up the music, and enjoy!

B000J3EEBY|5.0|I finally got this CD. After listening to all her other CDs and believing there was magic in every.. note.. instrument.. voice and lyric I found that this CD certainly passes beyond the limits of emotions that transcend understanding. It does have a familiar quality to it.. because the music from a distant song of Loreena's plays in the background of a new song on this CD. At one point I had to look and make sure I didn't put the wrong CD in.. thinking I grabbed one of her others. Even so.. there is a reason for all that she does.. and if you listen to this CD you will find the new song fits the old (Bonny Swans). It's sort of like retracing your steps to find hidden treasures. The song \\"The Gates of Istanbul\\" is so beautiful that it's easy to want to listen to it over and over again.. it will give your spirit a feeling all it's own.. like a freedom from within.. a flight of light and peacefulness.. like a lucid dream. This CD is the continuation of an astonishing journey. Follow this journey and you can learn from it.. look into it and be a part.<br /><br />\\"One never can see the thing in itself, because the mind does not transcend phenomena\\" (Hilaire Belloc).<br /><br />Loreena's Music is phenomenal! Don't just listen to it.. experience it!<br /><br />Peace to you all..
1577314808|5.0|I read the two star reviews and can see where the reviewers are coming from. On first listening the statements do seem to be repetitious and similar.  By the seventh listening I was able to maintain presence throughout the CD.  By the 20th listening, I recognized every statement as very precise and necessary in blocking the destroyed ego from re-entering through hundreds of different back doors.  The CDs do not teach you anything; there is no information here for the ego.<br /><br />I've been waiting for decades for a product containing no ego and finally found it here.  Personally I believe Eckhart has a thousand times the wisdom of anyone I've encountered and hold him in the highest esteem.  My self image caused me suffering until I dumped it so it is possible that you may only really *get* this audio book if you've gone through the same situation.  Also, many of my friends don't like the audio version because they dislike his voice; he speaks from presence and many people have never experienced being present even for a moment.

B000002KXV|5.0|This recording is nothing short of amazing. Donald Fagen has the ability to create some of the most catchy and beautiful songs ala Maurice White. Whether in Steely Dan or solo, he always makes delectable music. From start to finish, Nightfly is a great recording. As usual, the production and musicianship are exquisite. The music sounds as fresh today as it did 25 years ago. All the songs are good,however, the best songs are \\"the goodbye look\\", \\"I.G.Y\\", \\"green flower street\\" and \\"the nightfly\\".
B000NA28IE|1.0|Many people have already said this but I will say it again, this movie is a cheap remake of a book that deserved the Peter Jackson style of dedication to the story line. Eragon is a great story and has so many opportunities at being a great motion picture trilogy, this just halted the trilogy at one. If you liked this movie don't read the books because they are very different and far better. I really understand when they can't put every detail from the book into the movie but in this translation the story was changed so much that I was lost and did not even know where the story was going to end and I have read the book at least 3 times. Terrible movie and it lacked the effort that a book of this quality deserved. I would plainly not recommend this movie to anyone, just go and buy the book its great.

With that in mind, I wandered into a store and saw Legend. \\"Hey, I've heard of Bob Marley\\", and I happily took it home to see what this was all about.  <br /> <br />AMAZING!!! <br /> <br />It doesn't seem to matter what kind of mood I'm in, what kind of music I just had on, or what I'm doing, this CD is always great. Every single song is worth listening to over and over and over, as I have done. Something about Bob Marley's music is able to step inside of you, so you don't just hear it with your ears, but your heart as well. I guess that's why he is a legend.  <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Three Little Birds\\", \\"One Love\\", \\"Redemption Song\\", \\"Could You Be Loved\\", and so many others on this CD are simply amazing, worth owning if you like just about any kind of music at all. Also, \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" is a phenominal ballad, performed live in this collection, which has become one of my top 5 favorite songs in any genre. <br /> <br />In short, if you are looking for a place to start exploring the waters of raggae, its HERE.  <br /> <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw the show last May at the Gershwin Theatre, and was so blown away by the show's musical score I immediately bought the soundtrack.<br /><br />I never get tired of this album. (In fact, I had to buy another copy when the first one wore out!)  The music is so fresh and real, with singers/actors singing to an actual orchestra instead of studio equipment altering the sound.  All of the songs are well-written and passionately sung. (You can hear the emotion in the singing) The best part of this CD, I think, is that even people who never saw the play can follow the plot and enjoy the music at the same time.  Of course, I highly recommend seeing the show since it was fantastic, but if you decide not to, the CD is still nothing short of mesmerizing.  Don't miss it!
B000J103N4|5.0|&#34;I wonder who they are<br />The men who REALLY run this land?<br />And I wonder why they run it<br />With such a thoughtless hand.<br />What are their names<br />And on what streets do they live?<br /><br />I'd like to RUN right over.<br />and give them a piece of my mind<br />...&#34;<br /><br />Still true, 40 years later, huh?<br /><br />Crosby combines the services of people from The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Neil Young (see above), Joni Mitchell and others. Everybody sings and plays. Hippies who loved harmony. Great harmonies that float around the room like organ chords flying in Grace Cathedral. Very San Francisco Haight-Ashbury. In the late 60's these groups often gave free concerts, just set up amps in Golden Gate Park and played. There was none of the competition that would come later, music was communal! People report getting a contact-high just from listening.<br /><br />Particularly wonderful I have always thought, is &#34;Orleans&#34;, the laid-back &#34;Mt Tamalpais High&#34;, the Title track and Neil Young's song quoted above, is just as true today as in 1969. I like all but the edgy &#34;Cowboy Movie' but don't let that keep you from buying this masterpiece. Jerry Garcia, new to the pedal steel guitar, experimented and took risks a seasoned professional wouldn't do and they all succeed marvelously!<br /><br />Crosby is at the heights of his powers before drugs and coke would ruin his life.<br /><br />The new CD version is much better sounding than the murky older one, but is a tad bright in places. The LP still has the best sound.
037571457X|1.0|Man, was I disappointed.  This book is a comic strip.  It may have had a lot of meaning, to those involved at the time it was written, with many government stings hidden in the strip, but for enjoyable reading, it stunk.  I got through it in half an hour, hardly my idea of buying good reading.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Like another reviewer, I heard Paolo on the Today show and had to go find his album.  I bought it and found that he had a show in Denver, so bought tickets for that show, too.  This album is simply addicting; it's difficult to believe he is so young and has written all of his own songs.  His songs are so honest and romantic, well, I am far too, um, \\"mature\\" to be gaga over a 20 year old boy, but I find myself there (shhhh...don't tell my husband!).  \\"Jenny Don't Be Hasty\\" and \\"New Shoes\\" are the catchy songs, but the real meat of this album is in the rest of it.  Even though these songs are obviously written by a young person, there isn't one song I don't enjoy and \\"These Streets\\", \\"Last Request\\" and \\"Jenny Don't Be Hasty\\" are probably my favorites. His obvious love of his family is very endearing and refreshing.  I think this guy is a singer/songwriter to watch. (Sheesh, do I sound like my mom, or what??) <br /> <br />**Also, keep listening to track 10 (\\"Alloway Groove\\").  He follows it with another song (I think) and then there is about 2 minutes of silence followed by another version of \\"Last Request\\" just before minute 11 on the track 10 song.
1400032717|5.0|I read this book for a course in special education. I sat down one Saturday to get started on it, and before I knew it I had read the whole thing! The story is in the first person as told by a young autistic boy.  It's a fascinating (and from what I understand, authentic) view of the world from an autistic child's perspective providing vast insights to how these children process information and interact with their world. An absolute must-read for special education majors and family members of autistic children.
0770430074|4.0|A charming, observant and humorous story of an Indian boy who grew up in a zoo, later survive a shipwreck and even later survive being trapped on a lifeboat at sea, with a tiger, a hyena and an orang utan onboard. How a mere boy could possibly survive in such a situation perhaps might seem unbelievable. However, the author has managed to present a very plausible and ingenious case of how this could actually happen in real life -- with numerous little nuggets of information on how animals behave (and could be manipulated to behave) under certain circumstances.<br /><br />At certain points, however, the narrative (though humorous and observant) could get a little tedious. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it much more if the story were a little shorter or the writing more concise.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Oh, oh, oh.... the might have beens...  John Bonham not dying, Hendrix not choking, David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen not hating each others' guts.... and one of the Greatest Rock Bands of All Time not going up in unfathomable self-induced flames...   <br /> <br />I didn't like GnR that much when they were together.  Sure, I liked Paradise City when I heard it on the radio, I liked the November Rain video, and I couldn't get that Sweet Child O Mine hook out of my mind... but it was after I bought this CD and listened to it about 50 times that I came to realize what a truly MONSTER band this was.   <br /> <br />What a waste.  What a waste. <br /> <br />For those who know GnR, my reviewing each song is pointless.  You know them all.  For those who don't know GnR very well, I'll just say this is a great place to start. <br /> <br />The one thing I WILL say after listening to this CD is that Sweet Child O Mine has to be one of the most perfectly crafted rocks songs ever made.  Slash's tone is about as sweet as you will ever find anywhere. That hook is the stuff of legend.  Axl's voice is spectacular, one of the greatest rock vocalists of all time.  Steven Adler still had all his faculties, and is relentless.  And the WAY the song is put together--- HOW and WHERE they use the main hook, the several secondary hooks, and the spectacular guitar and voice solos.... I'm in awe.   <br /> <br />So, finally, to conclude: <br /> <br />What an absolute freakin' waste. <br /> <br />
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I have already written a review on this site advocating readers/lovers of Bronte's novel who want a FAITHFUL version of Jane Eyre to buy the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version as it is (especially with deleted scenes restored to the DVD version, making it truly a complete filmed version of the novel) the MOST true to Bronte's book in casting/acting, scenes played out, etc.  However, while I wasn't wild about this version the first time viewing it, I did enjoy it much better the second time through, having taped it off Masterpiece Theatre.  I think that Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson did a fine acting job, though, as others have stated here, he doesn't truly physically fit Rochester, and he also doesn't seem to have some of the edginess/hysteria that Dalton portrayed so well in the scene when Jane leaves him.  That scene, shown in a flashback in this version, has Stephens and Wilson steamily smooching on a bed - her lips are saying 'no' while simultaneously saying 'yes.'  This, to me, while very romantic and, probably in the director/screenwriter's choice, meant to show that Jane's temptation was great not to leave him and to become his mistress (which clearly WAS Rochester's intention in the novel, no matter the silly line inserted in this version that he would live with her as 'brother and sister' - something clearly NOT intended by the Rochester of Bronte's creation), the book clearly states that Jane will NOT kiss the 'husband of Bertha Mason' and Zelah Clarke very well shows how she had to steel herself against Rochester's attempts to break her down with kisses - though NOT in the bedroom.  No self respecting person in that day and age, especially someone who cared for their respectability and who would want to find employment again in a respectable household, would have dared to let a man who was not their husband alone in their bedroom.  This fact alone 'compromised' men and women into marriage proposals, whether things happened or not.  (Or have none of you EVER read Regency fiction?)  Even as recently as the 1940s and 50s, it was common for women in gals-only hotels to have to leave their apartment doors open when having a male friend visit - if they were unmarried.  These social mores were clearly stronger and more evident in Bronte's day.  Since Jane now KNEW that Rochester was NOT free to marry her, she would not have dared, divorce being almost unheard of in that day, to allow him into her room alone after she was enlightened about the existence of Bertha.  In the novel, her steeling herself and making herself appear 'cold' to Rochester is the only way she can preserve her own sanity and self from giving into the temptation of his suggestion to run away with him to become his mistress.  She tells him that everything is changed, and that she must change too - and that she loves him, when he desperately pleads with her that she never did truly love him, but that that was the last time she would be able to say it.  I reread that scene in the book after watching this version again the second time and the Clarke/Dalton version got it right - Dalton clearly shows the wildness and desperation Rochester is going through while Clarke shows Jane's steely determination not to give in.  I find it much more heartbreaking in that version, the parting scene, following as it does, Bronte's novel, than this more modernized version.    There were also quite a few liberties taken with the speech in the novel - the Dalton version remains the most faithful in this department as well.  For me, the best parts of this version where when they kept to the words as written by Bronte.  I also did not care for the occult game played by the guests in Rochester's house - this was also not in the book and would have been abhorrent to Bronte's puritanical upbringing - and it was too bad that the director would not allow Toby Stephens to try his hand at playing the gypsy as Dalton did, which is what Rochester did in the book, rather than having a real gypsy brought in. Helen Burns and her important influence on Jane's outlook and character are also reduced to almost nothing.  I don't know if this is because many people at large have an antipathy to Christianity, but the part of the book where Jane describes her hunger for human love being so bad that she would endure things such as having an animal kick her or her arm broken, etc. countered by Helen's calm, wise advice on not putting too much emphasis on human love in this life, but rather focusing on the love of God - this to me seems to be a crucial scene when seen in light of Jane's drawing upon her spiritual resources to find the strength to reject Rochester's proposal to run away with him.  I found it sad that the screenwriter could not have considered at least inserting some part of that aspect of Jane and Helen's relationship in the film.    All that being stated, there were touches in this film that I thought were nice - Jane's clear forgiveness of the unforgivable Aunt Reed was nicely portrayed and written, though again, not quite true to the description in the book, by Ruth Wilson, showing her generosity of heart.  Stephens' acting during the Rochester blind scenes was especially sensitive and heartfelt. I also liked that this version kept all three of Jane's cousins, though it would have been nice to have a St. John Rivers that truly was blond with the 'grecian profile' which the actor, while good, who played him, did not have either that Or was better looking than Toby Stephens, something which really should be considered in casting St. John Rivers.  His physique and face is part of the reason why Miss Oliver is so obsessed with him!  Again, the guy in the Dalton version who portrayed Rivers was much better cast - both in looks (as what was 'beautiful' in those days) and also in his portrayal of Rivers' hardness of heart and determination.  I thought it was a nice touch to show Jane and Rochester's 'happy ending' with their family together for theportrait at the end.  Most versions either just leave it to the viewer's imagination or just show them sitting together sedately by some water while quoting Jane's comments on Rochester gaining back his sight by the time their first born comes into the world so that he can see his son has inherited his large brilliant eyes.    That all being said, while Dalton's version still remains my favorite, this one has beautiful cinematography and has the spirit of the book and has done a nice job with some of the backstory with Rochester and Bertha, making it probably the second best version in recent years - though for me, Orson Welles and George C. Scott approach Rochester's true physical outward appearance than some of the more handsome actors that have played him recently.  Ciaran Hinds comes closest of the recent ones, but his voice doesn't have the 'rich baritone' described of Rochester in the book.  Too bad NONE Of the versions ever showed Rochester and Blanche Ingram singing together.  I will still love Dalton's first, Orson Welles second, and probably this third of all the versions that have been made.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|In his past movies, Will Ferrell has taken up roles which portray him as a wild and sarcastic funny character, such as in Elf and Anchorman. However, this time he actually pretends to be a normal person with unusual problems. Although the film is categorized under \\"comedy\\", I did not see that many jokes being made or find myself laughing that much. But the humor that is included here is more of a subtle type, where other people act weird and the audience can relate to Will's reactions. Overall the movie was enjoyable to watch, with both Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman giving great performances. It's not award-winning material, but at least you can be entertained while seeing Will in a different light than before. The cookie scene was hilarious.
B000J103X4|5.0|I grew up listening to NWA, Ice Cube, and Ice T. This album took me back to the era in hip hop where the West Coast ruled the game. Game has put togeather a great album from front to back. There is no stand out pop single every track is quality gangsta rap. My favorite track is California Vacation where Xzibit just kills it, his verse on that song is great. This is an album to own since every track is hot, and it has a high replay value. My only complaint is Game's constant name dropping. This is a small problem I have with the album, I still give it a 5 star rating and highly recommend this album to any hip hop fan.
B0007ODLCS|5.0|It's too bad this compilation of Townes Van Zandt's music is getting harder to find--it's got his first 7 complete studio albums, which includes all of the music he made in the 60's and 70's, plus most of the live album he put out in the 70's as well.  Why is this box essential?  First of all, because of the quality of Van Zandt's music, and second because of the value--just check around.  Some of these individual albums go for $60 or more, and here they can all be purchased together for much cheaper (I got my copy from caiman_com through Amazon's alternate sellers for $22).  If you're looking to start getting into his music, it's a no-brainer that this CD has the most complete introduction at the best price.<br /><br />If you haven't heard Van Zandt's music yet, you've probably at least heard ABOUT it.  It's country-flavored, but definitely not straight up country, nor is it the slick \\"country-rock\\" put out by bands like the Byrds.  No, it's not easy to stick TVZ into one genre, but he does touch on country, folk, rock, and pop.  His earlier work sounds lyrically much like Bob Dylan, though he eventually develops more of a unique written voice for himself.  Van Zandt's singing voice is definitely unique--southern, understated, yet capable of powerful, wavering emotion and subtle texture.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is the best place to delve into the merits of each album, since that would take way too long, but I can say that each of these albums has great highlights, and each album is worth listening all the way through.  Van Zandt does get the best around The Late Great Townes Van Zandt, which includes his best-known song \\"Pancho and Lefty,\\" but he's also a great interpreter of gospel tunes and classic Hank Williams.  If you're interested in Townes Van Zandt, I urge you to start with this collection--even if you pay $40, you'll still come out saving a lot of money at $5 per album.  Hope you enjoy checking out one of folk music's best kept secrets!

B00005QDW5|5.0|Trying to make a greatest hits cd out of Pink Floyd's catalogue is a very hard task indeed, in fact, it just might be an impossible task.<br /><br />As we all know, most of what Pink Floyd does, if not all of what Pink Floyd does is a conceptual affair. All their albums flow seamless along and take the listener on a ride. So how do you put a hits package together that captures that vibe?, well the way the have here. From the first track, this incredible cd flows beautifully along and it's hard to imagine at time these tracks have come from different albums and time frames. It really is that well put together. The sound quality is excellent and it really does give the listener a very good background of what this band is all about.<br /><br />This cd is a must have for anyone who is into prog rock or just good rock in general. This cd is truly a great work of art.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Having never been a comic book reader, I was skeptical about \\"Smallville's\\" ability to hook me into its story arc.  I do, however, happen to be a fan of the coming-of-age story, whether in print (e.g., Salinger) or the big screen (e.g. \\"Stand by Me\\").  So I dove into \\"Smallville\\" with the hope that the characterization would be solid enough to overcome any ignorance I had toward the \\"Superman\\" comic series.<br /><br />The series greatly exceeded my expectations.  Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk have incredible chemistry as Clark Kent and Lana Lang, respectively.  But Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luther steals the show.  His acting and his character are rendered in such a way that -- even though one knows he winds up being Superman's antagonist -- the viewer is left to ponder just exactly HOW this transformation will take place.<br /><br />And this leads me to another significant point: even though, as I said, I'm not familiar with comic fiction, I quickly came to realize that Superman is a deeply-rooted American myth.  I found myself immediately understanding the overall theme of the show, and also grinning with delight at each double entendre.<br /><br />Season One does have two main weaknesses.  One is the character arcs of Chloe and Pete, played by Allison Mack and Sam Jones, III, respectively.  Please note that I felt the weakness was in the characters, not in the acting.  Both actors do a great job; but I think they could've been given more substantive emotional roles.  I realize this may seem ironic given the season finale, but I thought Chloe's development, in particular, did not flow smoothly.<br /><br />Season One's other weakness has been mentioned repeatedly: the monster of the week.  While the writers do a good job showing how Clark, Lana, etc, deal with these Krypton-influenced villains, it was difficult to continuously suspend disbelief throughout the whole season.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this season is essential for Season Two, which is one of the best coming-of-age story lines that I've seen in a long while on television.<br /><br />Kudos to the actors, writers and directors for a job well done and kicking off a fantastic series.e best coming-of-age story lines that I've seen in a long while on television. <br /> <br />Kudos to the actors, writers and directors for a job well done and kicking off a fantastic series.

B000M5AJQS|2.0|Marty---are you listening?  Now that you got the damn award get rid of Di Caprio and drop Nicholson.  Remember less is more.  Read Hitchcock and Kubrick  again.  Return to your roots:  do more original organized crime stuff (try Albanians) or think about a post post  modern Taxi Driver.  Knock it off with the blatant attacks on the Church. It's embarrassing for you. Do it more subtly if you really need to expiate your past.  Ask Daniel Day Lewis to act in your next film.   He saved Gangs from the waste basket.    And oh by the way...is there any way we can just buy the last 5 minutes of this flick.  The rest of it was just a rehash of Miller's Crossing...and sorry but that was done lots better.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|An incredible story about courage and values set to an incredible finale. This should be one of three martial art flicks in your collection. Another one to consider is \\"twilight samurai\\" a very cool, original, and well done movie itself. These two movies are drenched in realism, story, and are character driven.....And also,save the money and just buy \\"seven samurai\\" as a single disc movie. I dont think the extras add that much value to the movie and the visual quality is about the same. It seems as if the extras here only serve to help market the re release and then drive up the dvd cost. If you truly wish to learn, read a book on the subject.

This story is something that I can't believe was even thought about, let alone could possibly happen to someone.   <br /> <br />Ms. Flynn shows us the dark side of a well-to-do family and the long term effects on the psyche.

B000003FMY|5.0|From the moment the brass open the Promenade, it's instantly apparent just how flawless and precisely this orchestra plays.  This is the most perfect intonation I have heard on any recording, ever.  I have to agree with other reviewers in saying that even being 50 years old, this recording sounds better than a lot of recent CDs I own.  Everything is unbelievably crisp and clear.  Congratulations to Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for an amazing job.<br /><br />I should mention though, the previous reviewer is right, there IS tape hiss throughout the CD.  It isn't loud and I for one don't find it irritating, but it is more noticable than on other recordings I have.  The liner notes also explain it- \\"to preserve the quality of the source material during transfer, we rejected any process by which tape hiss or other minor imperfections in the source material could be minimized at the expense of the original musical program's sonic integrity\\".  I am glad at this choice.<br /><br />All in all, an absolutely fantastic version of one of the great masterpieces of the 19th century.  At the absurdly low price of $7.95, I don't see any reason to pass this one up.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|I bought this movie not knowing what to expect. It got such awful reviews when it was in movie theaters. It was a wonderful surprise. It's funny and poignant and watching Max turn into Uncle Henry is great fun. I've wanted a SmartCar ever since I first saw one--I loved watching it dart through the French countryside. Gemma is priceless. Russell Crowe looks great in all those horrible baggy clothes. The supporting actors are fabulous. My favorite scene is the tennis match between Max and Duflot--it's a visual zinger--Harry Nilsson's music fits it perfectly. My recommendaton--don't listen to professional reviewers--they have a tendency to give low ratings to anything that might be thought of as a \\"chick flick\\". As a result a lot of great movies are treated unfairly.

1593975635|5.0|I am a Dan Brown fan but I was skeptical of this book after seeing some of the reviews.  I'm glad I didn't let the bad reviews influence me. This book on cd was great... an \\"on the edge of your seat\\" thriller; but I think that to fully appreciate the story, it helps to be a little computer savvy.  The audio cd was very well done.  My husband and I listened to this while on a long trip in the car and the hours flew by.  The reader on this cd is very good with believable changes in characters.  I have experienced almost all of Dan Brown's books and Digital Fortress is one of his best!
B000B8IA2G|4.0|No, it isn't perfect.  I'm reminded of how awkward some of the very first Star Trek Next Generation episodes were, and compared to that this epic spinoff of an existing epic series gets off to a rip-roaring start.  I love the \\"Several Million Years Ago\\" scene at the very beginning of the pilot.  I was totally engrossed, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Sure, the new cast took some time to grow on me, but I think the reason the cast did grow on me is becuase the show grew the cast during the course of the first season.  I don't expect perfection with a new cast and a new show.  Chemistry can take time.<br /><br />Of course, at least half the value in DVD sets is the extras.  The commentaries are as entertaining as the episodes themselves, and there is a smattering of additional documentary type features as well.<br /><br />The one big disappointment was the \\"Stargate Set Tour with Martin Wood and Peter Deluise\\".  It took about five minutes of the juvenile editing and the stupid jokes about sex and drugs to make me roll my eyes and turn it off.  I really wanted to see the set and learn something.<br /><br />Also, the DVD menus were meant to be cool but are really just a cluttered mess.  Do I really need an animated mock-up of some futuristic control panel with all kinds of stuff changing all the time and with the episode titles buried in there somewhere?  I like the straightforward menu design of the Stargate SG-1 series a lot better.<br /><br />Still, this first season of Stargate Atlantis is a lot of great entertainment for the money.
0307237699|4.0|I got this Saturday and have enjoyed reading it.  <br /> <br />Essentially, Obama calls for an end to the paritsan bickering and tendencies to demonize in American politics today. While he criticizes some of the stands of Presidents George Bush Jr. and Ronald Reagan, he also admits to the good he finds in both men as well as admitting some of the mistakes of the far left. <br /> <br />The chapter on race is a good articulation of the feelings of post-civil rights movement African-Americans who do not subscribe to either the extreme Christian right or the extreme Black nationalists. Nice to know that there is an ideological place for black centrists of our generation. <br /> <br />The chapter about the Constitution shows his background on teaching Constitutional law, which may be a bit much for the nonacademic reader, but his sentiments on this and other issues seem heartfelt. <br /> <br />I found this book similar in tone to Bobby Kennedy's \\"To Seek a Newer World\\" (1967) and Booker T. Washington's \\"My Larger Education\\" (1911).  <br /> <br />He adds a lot of personal anecdotes (especially about his family) to prove his points, which makes the book more engaging. <br /> <br />Political reconciliation almost seems like an oxymoron in these polarized times, Obama tries to prove this is not necessarily the case. Read it and see what you think.

B00020HEL6|5.0|I had to respond to a comment made previously;<br /><br />\\"Another standout moment is her duet with Peter Cincotti on Neil Sedaka's \\"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do.\\" Cincotti is clearly the superior singer here; he does piano here as well.\\"<br /><br />Cincotti does have a very nice voice, and when he begins the song one is immediately impresses with his voice. Unfortunately, Renee then chimes in and like a cat dancing with a pig, she trounces his vocals. He simply is out classed by this little girl! Like Sinatra, Cincotti has a nice voice, but he seems even more limited than Sinatra in his range. Sinatra was a fantastic singer, but he know what he could or could not sing, and Concotti is likewise challenged.<br /><br />In contrast, Renee seems capable to singing anything ever written with the style of the greats such as Ella, and Lena Horn while also having the strength of voice of say Ronstadt, and Streisand. She may not be quite Opra ready yet, but I did say MAY not, as she darn well may be ready. At this age PERHAPS Charlotte Church had a stronger voice, but she certainly lacked the nuance which is needed for Jazz, and which young Renee has in abundance.<br /><br />I good friend of mine who worked closely with bands like Huey Lewis and the News, Earl Scruggs, etc. quickly picked up on her youth when he heard her sing, most would not I suppose, but he was stunned at her ability.<br /><br />The CD is not perfect, there are flaws, but as a package it is one heck of a musical ride this little girl takes you on! Last year I was hearing stories about her next CD out of Hollywood, but so far nothing. I just hope she stays with Jazz as I think it is the only formate where she can really demonstrate the full extent of her enormous vocal talent. I am very anxiously awaiting her next CD.
B000E1MTYU|4.0|I saw the movie in the theater along time ago. I'm glad I waited to watch it again on HD-DVD, the action scenes are beautiful and the humor is pretty funny. Arnold still can make movies, but I think this is his last Terminator. Maybe if James Cameron does the next Terminator, Arnold might be in it. Anyways I think this is a great movie for the HD-DVD collection.
0521008433|5.0|This book provides a great overview of all of the major, and some of the minor, approaches to language teaching. This book is laid out into three major sections. In the first section the authors deal with major trends in twentieth century language teaching. This gives an excellent historical look at where language teaching has come from and the thought process that accompanied such trends. The second sections deals with alternative approaches and methods. These include TPR, suggesopedia, whole language, etc. These methods are not commonly used on their own anymore, but used in small ways in overall teaching. The last section is current communicative approach. This is a great chapter on the origin of communicative teaching and how it has changed over the last 20 years.<br /><br />What is really useful in this book is its layout. Each method is titled in the table of contents for easy access. Then once you are at the appropriate chapter it is subtitled with such useful headings as: approach, method, design, teacher's role, student's role, and types of activities. This really made each method easy to understand and see how it would work in the classroom.
B000GFLEAY|5.0|This HD-DVD movie is AWESOME in so many ways. The movie just pop's out at you in HD, the colors are so rich and Gary Ross did a wonderful job on directing this film. I think Gary Ross put every he had in this movie, I really like how he started the movie off in a documentary kind of way; with the narrator David McCullough and all history is really what made the movie come together. The acting was phenomenal, with Toby Maguire(Red Pollard), Jeff Bridges(Charles Howard), Chris Cooper(Tom Smith), Elizabeth Banks(Marcela Howard), and the great William H. Macy(Tick Tock McGlaughlin). I think this is one of Jeff Bridges best performances in along time, the same goes for Chris Copper I love when his character(Tom Smith) said \\"You don't throw a whole life away because its banged up a little bit\\". William H. Macy was hilarious as Tick Tock McGlaughlin and Toby Maguire was just born to play as Red Pollard in every way. I was really overwhelmed by Gary Stevens(George Woolf)performance which is not any actor, but was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1997 at the age of 34.    <br />   Every time I see this movie it just puts tears to my eyes, such an uplifting movie in every way! The movie should have got a lot of Oscars, but The Lord of the Rings- Return of the King- killed everything that year (which it really did deserved every Oscar it got). A must have for every HD-DVD collector!!! I don't think their will every be another horse movie that can be done like this again period!
B000MTDRKE|4.0|The album does open up strong with a very nice 5-6 minute Transatlantic-style passage and then moves on to some pretty nice pieces througout the first two songs with put together are almost 1 full hour. There's plenty of excellent musicianship and guest guitarist Paul Gilbert absolutely shreds in the few places he's used. The songs are very Nealesque which might be my problem with the album.<br /><br />\\"One\\" was great because it had a nice theme, some great songs even if it lost some of it's momentum toward the end. \\"?\\" was a wonderful album with lots of great moments as well.<br /><br />Sola sort of seems like 2 parts \\"One\\", 1 part \\"Bridge Across Forever\\", 1 part \\"?\\" and some scattered Spock's Beard type pieces thrown in for good mix.<br /><br />There isn't really much of a strong theme in the album like in One....it's really more of a nice riff that carries some of the instrumental passsages but doesn't do much for me by itself.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm getting a little burnt out on Neal lately or perhaps this album just seems like material we've already covered (though this album is definitely a little darker/heavier than previous releases which I like) and not done particularly well, IMO.<br /><br />That being said, Neal easily blows away 99.9% of all other songwriters out there right now and Sola is easily a better effort than just about everything else that will probably be released this year. It just doesn't compare favorably with his last two albums and I think it's time that maybe Neal took a year off, maybe hit it with a fresh perspective in order to maybe come up with some newer stuff.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I saw this movie when I was in college (1998). I saw it again recently, I enjoyed it even more today (March 6, 2007). I absolutely love this movie.
B000M4RG42|4.0|While I have not read James Bradley's book of the same title, others have noted that this movie is more or less about one chapter in the book rather than a movie version of the entire book.  Some see this as a flaw, however, it is impossible to tell the full story of hundreds of pages in a book in a feature movie.  This movie focuses on providing us with some notions of what really happened on Mount Suribachi and what happened to the men in that famous and iconic photograph of that flag raising during the Battle of Iwo Jima.<br /><br />It wasn't the first flag raised there.  The photograph is of a replacement flag being put up because the first flag was requisitioned for historical and political reasons.  However, the photograph by Joe Rosenthal (who died in 2006) hit a strong chord with the public and earned him a Pulitzer Prize.  Since there were two flag raisings there was confusion about who was in the famous photograph and this movie deals with the pain that caused the families.  It caused the pain because one of those in the first flag raising was originally identified in the second flag raising and one who was in that second raising was originally left out (although his mother believed it was him).<br /><br />This happened for three additional reasons: none of the faces are seen in the photograph, none of the men who were there paid much attention to the flag detail - staying alive during the fighting was their main focus, and half the men in the photograph died shortly after the flag raising (including the young man mistakenly not given credit for being in the detail), as well as the young man who was in the first flag raising but identified in the photograph.<br /><br />The movie tells the story in a rather random series of flashbacks.  It is set in roughly present time with some of the participants as old men who are telling their story and the story of the men they knew to a younger generation.  This is not only an important thing to do, it is essential for both the passing and the rising generations.  The telling gets a bit more complicated when the three survivors of the second flag raising are enlisted on a war bond fund raising tour and they have flashbacks to their service before and on Iwo Jima.<br /><br />One of the other misconceptions people have about that photograph is that it was done after the victory on the island.  However, it was done after that mountain was taken five days into the battle.  The fighting after was furious and went on for another thirty days.<br /><br />Some have noted that this movie is anti-war and that Eastwood might be using it to criticize the Iraq war.  I suppose one could see it that way.  I didn't.  However, Eastwood is headed towards being eighty years old.  Old men do not see or often believe the stories of heroism and valor that motivate younger men.  They call such notions lies and delusions.  Yes, war is indeed a horrible and awful thing.  It requires men to do barbaric and even inhuman things.  But it is too glib to say it is unnecessary.  It is too pat to simply dismiss war as the machinations of old politicians or corporations or \\"obsolete\\" nation-states.  To me, what these young men gave is too sacred to say they died for nothing.  To say they only fought and died for their immediate buddies is possibly true in the heat of battle, but not in the larger sense of the cause.  If we should beware of being misused through patriotism and love of country, we should also beware of being misled by a kind of sedition fueled by nihilism; a belief in nothing.  Nihilism has become fashionable and we should beware of mistaking transient fashions, especially fashionable beliefs, for truth.<br /><br />However, it has to be left to you what you get out of this movie.  For me it was sad and elegiac.  War does not, life does not evaluate and select only those most fit for a situation before it requires them to live it.  These men who survived after the flag raising were certainly required to live with survivor's guilt made much worse by the adulation they received on the publicity tour for the bond drive.  They were constantly called \\"The Heroes of Iwo Jima\\" when they knew they were just ordinary soldiers.  This duty their country demanded of them crushed them more than they understood at the time.  Nevertheless, it was duty they fulfilled as best they could.<br /><br />A fine film, if a bit difficult to follow at times.  But war is often unclear and confusing, isn't it?se by the adulation they received on the publicity tour for the bond drive.

0688163173|4.0|As has been brought out by quite a few reviewers, there is a lot to like about `Shutter Island', but as has also been brought out but the other spectrum of reviewers is that there is a lot to balk at in `Shutter Island' as well.  The key is to take this in with a balanced view and enjoy all that there is to enjoy without getting too judgmental in regards to the faults.  Not every work of literature can be perfect...but while that is the case we can still gather quite a bit from Lehane's follow up to the critically acclaimed `Mystic River'.<br /><br />The story revolves around a U.S. Marshall by the name of Teddy Daniels.  Teddy was a code breaker during the Second World War and so he's asked to travel with his partner Chuck Aule to Shutter Island off the coast of Boston where an inmate has escaped from Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  This inmate is Rachel Solando, and finding out just how she escaped a locked cell guarded by brute men could in the end cost these men their lives, or worse yet...their sanity.<br /><br />As they progress towards answers they begin to uncover what appear to be illegal experiments being performed on the inmates and a cover-up that may jeopardize their survival.  Dennis works at a break-neck pace to make sure the reader is at all times absorbed in the characters and the plot.  Every chapter spirals down speedily towards the dramatic and brilliantly composed conclusion where everything you thought you knew blows up in your face.  It's here, in the gut-wrenching conclusion that we find our reason to love this novel.<br /><br />Some reviewers have done the disservice of explaining the ending with no regard for anyone who has yet to read this novel.  I will not do that, but sadly, if you read some of the other reviews you most likely will find out anyways.  Just know that, even if the ending is spoiled for you, it's not just the `surprise' that's impressive for that alone is far from original...it's how his surprise fits together with the rest of the novel that makes it so brilliant.  The character development, the intoxicating story complete with twists and turns and then there's the final pages that just rip out your heart, all of which make this a worth while endeavor.<br /><br />Sure, there are some deterrents, but honestly, if you can find them then your just being too picky.ts together with the rest of the novel that makes it so brilliant.

B00005JPG1|1.0|...the two deadliest sins of movie making.  After reading the reviews I had really high hopes.  Man, were they ever dashed!  Forty-five minutes or so into the flick I didn't care what happened.  I was actually thinking of walking out.  An hour later I was kicking myself for not acting on my instinct.  IMHO this movie stinks!
0451213092|5.0|A very exciting and well-wriiten book.  I couldn't put it down till I have finished the last line. <br /> <br />While it is true that two EDS employees were rescued and smuggled out of Iran, the details were obtained from EDS men and Poss Perot.  Whether they were completely true and authentic is an open question.  Thus far, I have not heard from anyone challenging the facts. <br /> <br />Mr Follett, you did an excellent job.
B00007FOMP|4.0|In my opinion this ranks as one of the most overrated recordings in the history of popular music. Sure, it's plenty good...and made a big impact at the time of its release. But, there are several weak songs, and it has not aged particularly well. I can think of a dozen soul records that deserve greater accolades: Prince's \\"Sign of the Times,\\" The Isley Brothers' \\"Brother, Brother, Brother,\\" three records by Stevie Wonder, a few by James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, Al Green, Ann Peebles, Otis Redding, Smokey Robinson, Aretha Franklin...and others. Keep an open mind and look beyond what is \\"pushed upon you on the street\\" Right on!
1582701709|5.0|I was skeptical when I started this book - I missed Oprah, hadn't seen the DVD, so I came into this to see what gives with The Secret. This is a more metaphysical version of The Power of Positive Thinking. You are the captain of your life. It all deals with the order of the Universe - what thoughts you send out will come back to you in kind. Re-adjust your thoughts to give them a more positive twist, like instead of saying you'll never get out of debt, focus on your ability to be debt free.  Think you are in health, thank God (or the Universe) for that health, and things will start changing.<br />Make a list of what you want - rethink it to allow what you want to come into your life, and things may turn your life around. From large things to the smallest things.<br />With all the hype, this book is very simple - What you think is a powerful tool - use it for better or worse. I choose for the better.
B000002OR4|5.0|I have many of John Williams' most celebrated music (soundtracks, olympic music, etc.) and he is a great composer with big, full, dramatic sounds. However, this soundtrack is very different than much of his other music- simpler, understated, and incredibly somber. It captures and complements the dramatic sadness of the movie, but it also stands quite well on its own apart from the film. The score is just beautiful.
0380789019|4.0|Like pretty much any of Gaimans stories, the setting is a surreal other world within/below/parallel to our mundane everyday world.  In this case, it's the story of the protagonist's journey from being a nice but spineless guy leading a mediocre life where his friends treated him as a commodity, to becoming a confident, brave person, and eventually realising what's really important to him. <br /> <br />The main criticism raised by the reviews that only give a couple of stars is that the plot is extremely simple.  That's true.  But it's not the point.  The inner journey is meaningful, and the setting is enchanting.
0072435097|5.0|The only criticism that I have to give (which was actually pointed out by a classmate of mine), is that the stories all seem to have the same author after a while.  <br /> <br />But I'm going to argue that it is exactly THAT which makes this novel better! Amy Tan is so in tune with the makings of a mother-daughter relationship that it seems she has met not only my mother and me, but also all the mothers and daughter in the world, in every age.  <br /> <br />What is also fantastic about this book is that after you have finished reading it, but you have a bad day, you can always pick it up and read a chapter at random -- and STILL BE INSPIRED!  <br /> <br />This book should be given to every girl by every mother some time during her early adult life (because some of the issues and scenes are too graphic for young teens). And even if you have never had a good relationship with your mother, this book will change your mind about her. Believe me. :-)

B00024YVJU|5.0|1977's Ocean was Eloy's sixth album and the second with the Bornemann/Schmidtchen/Rosenthal/Matziol lineup. The orchestra from Dawn was ditched (no surprise there, given the cost of hiring an orchestra, just ask ELP around the same time touring for their Works albums). Ocean was based on the rise and destruction of Atlantis as told by Plato. There's a doomsday/apocalyptic theme to this album, no surprise given in the 1970s there was that genuine threat of nuclear war (which people forget there still is to this day), and the lyrics talk about the creation of the planets and Mankind, and then Mankind decided to get power-hungry and greedy, which ends up in war, all using Atlantis as a metaphor. Without the orchestra, it allowed Detlev Schmidtchen to really shine on his keyboards. I get a bit bothered that he gets credited to Mellotron and you don't notice any (same for his predecessor Manfred Wieczorke on Power and the Passion), although I might suspect I hear some tron strings buried on \\"Poseidon's Creation\\", it's hard telling giving the heavy amount of string synths used throughout. Other than that, he really shines big time on Moog and string synths in total '70s fashion! Many people regard this album as the very finest Eloy ever done, and I have no argument over that! \\"Poseidon's Creation\\" has some David Gilmour-like guitar work from Frank Bornemann. Lots of lush spacy string synths from Schmidten, with some great drumming from Jürgen Rosenthal, who tended to use roto-toms, rather than a more traditional drumset. I really love that Moog solo and that slap-bass work from Klaus-Peter Matziol, which ends in some nice use of chorus. \\"Incarnation of Logos\\" features more fantastic spacy string synths, and here Bornemann sings about the creation of the Universe and Mankind, with Rosenthal giving some occasional spoken dialog. I really love how the middle part gains speed with some great spacy synth solos. \\"Decay of Logos\\" starts off with more spacy synths, but much of the rest of the piece tends to be heavier, with heavier use of guitar. \\"Atlantis' Agony...\\" is the closing piece, obviously referring to the destruction of Atlantis. The beginning of this piece features Rosenthal's narration, with an extended synth drone from Schmidtchen. Rosenthal refers to the \\"divine guided missile\\", which you can be certain is a metaphor for nuclear missiles. There's some really majestic pipe-organ like sounds too (not a real pipe organ), as well as odd wailing sounds produced off an ARP 2600 synth, and after several minutes the music kicks in, not unlike \\"Poseidon's Creation\\". I especially dig that Moog solo, and how the guitar closes the piece with that echo effect.    In 1977 prog rock was starting to face some serious troubles because it was smack in the punk and disco boom (let's not forget in America, aside from disco, there was a rise in AOR and arena rock bands like Foreigner and Boston that obviously did not endear many fans of prog rock and hard rock/heavy metal since those groups sounded like the worst tendencies of hard rock/heavy metal and prog rock distilled to formulaic cliches, and while I have to include Styx in the bunch, I actually think they were one of the better bands in that field). Many of the British bands released what many regard as their last great album (like Yes' Going for the One or Genesis' Wind & Wuthering) or the decline was starting to show already (like ELP's Works Vol. 1 and 2), but in Germany it's like none of that happened (my suspicion was Continental Europe was a bit behind the times compared to Great Britain, which I thought worked to their benefit, after all, you don't find a whole lot of great British prog rock albums from the late '70s, especially from groups that started there in the second half of the decade, but in Continental Europe, you could still find great prog released as late as the early '80s). Ocean ended up outselling well-known groups like Genesis and Queen in their native Germany! And this is an album that detractors call \\"the epitome of pretentious\\" and \\"the reason punk happened\\". But for me, there is little I can find wrong with this album, simply one of the greatest prog rock albums ever, in my book!
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phil Collins was one in a rather select club of pop-meisters in the 80's that just seemed to turn all they touched into gold. Along with Madonna, Prince and Michael Jackson, it seemed that every time you turned on the radio, you would hear something either by them or a pale imitation. For Phil Collins, that meant being the cottage cheese of British nice-guy pop for most of the decade, and into the early 90's.<br /><br />His divorce in 1980 was the grist that created \\"Face Value,\\" and before you could say \\"mike up those drums,\\" \\"In The Air Tonight\\" became the new sound of percussionists everywhere. Only Phil and Peter Gabriel had this kind of pummel in their music, and the song's inclusion in \\"Miami Vice\\" burned it into the national subconscious...even enough to start an urban legend about the lyric's subject matter.<br /><br />There was still some left-over emotional baggage for \\"Hello, I Must Be Going,\\" but it was Collin's choice of a Motown cover that landed him on the charts. \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" was the beginning of his nascent blue-eyed soul string of hits. By the time the monster album \\"No Jacket Required\\" appeared, Phil was making songs that aped Prince (\\"Sussudio\\") and carried a full-on horn section that was reminiscent of Earth Wind and Fire. He even became an in-demand producer, and gave EWF's Phillip Bailey his only major solo hit by duetting on \\"Easy Lover.\\"<br /><br />That demand extended into films. He added the Oscar nominated \\"Separate Lives\\" and \\"Against All Odds\\" to his resume and starred in \\"Buster.\\" (He also had a memorable cameo in the HBO AIDS drama \\"And The Band Played On.\\") But he was also beginning to push for larger things. On the next album, \\"But Seriously,\\" he tried to get - well - serious. \\"Another Day In Paradise\\" took a look at homelessness, but it was balanced by the peppy \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\\" and the more rocking \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down,\\" featuring Eric Clapton.<br /><br />But on the increasingly introspective and world-weary \\"Both Sides,\\" the title track addressed urban and domestic violence...perhaps a bit too much for the popsters awaiting another catchy \\"Sussudio\\" or a dreamy ballad like \\"One More Night.\\" It took three more years for \\"Dancing Into The Light\\" to appear, but by 1996 Phil's hitmaking days had passed.

Also, since this \\"Hits\\" set was released in 1998, there have been a few missing links since then.

B000003TAB|5.0|Brilliant collage of Nirvana works and a must have album for any Nirvana fan.  Whenever I hear Incesticide I think back to when i was 15 - 16 years old and would mosh around my basement in flannels with long hair and converse sneaks.  We all were influenced so much by his music and style in the short time he was in the spotlight.  That in itself is a special acomplishment.  But that is now somewhat overshadowed by an eerie feeling every time I hear a Nirvana song, knowing that he (kurt)is dead and the circumstances of his death.  He died a year younger than I am now at 27.  What a bad ending to what couldve been a better story.  He was one of the best singer/song writers of our time.  Too bad it was such a short run.  At any rate buy the album and peek into the mind of one of the great artistic geniouses of our time.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Russell, Brad, Eric, Clive - Listen up.  The guys in country music understand that women do the buying and women like a good romance.  As it goes this one is pretty good.  More depth in the characters is needed.  Those lovely lines he utters to her when he comes back - yep we need more of that.  But that is not the reason I write this review.  Check out the music videos.  Russell is my hero, both forceful and playful in the Weight of a Man.  Well done.  I watched it 9 times in a row.  Do it again.  Better yet, expand this into a great romance story.  Be inspired - and tell me how I can get a CD of these songs!  Thanks!
B000IHY9SE|3.0|When I heard about this CD, I got excited to hear some new Em that wasn't \\"poppy\\" or \\"soft\\" like all the stuff I was hearing before.  I figured that with G-Unit and Shady's new recruits would shine, but instead they just glimmer.  I was hoping for some sort of showcase to really feature Shady's new artists, but it doesn't live up to the hype.  Hands down, Obie Trice and Proof are strong and consistent on the album.  It's a shame Proof died, because he was probably the only real lyricist on D12 (except Em)...  Fortunately, 50 seems to be improving, but he still falls short.  Ca$his and Creek are just on par with some of the stuff that's already out there, nothing too special.  The Remixes aren't anything special either. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is just straight to bump to and would probably get a higher rating if we all didn't know what Shady/Aftermath/G-Unit are really capable of.  The fact that it's got their name written all over it and doesn't really grab you is a complete let down.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The film starts out very slowly and I almost thought I wouldn't want to sit through it, but it picks up within about 20 minutes and makes you want to see how far each rival magician will go to outdo the other.  Other reviewers write about how surprising the ending is, but don't kid yourself:  unless you have been lobotomized, you will notice what is happening very quickly and have to sit through the end as they painfully explain what has clearly happened.  Perhaps they do this because they have low expectations of the American audience's ability to decipher the plot, or perhaps they expect everyone to be dazzled by David Bowie and hypnotized by his dashing good looks and magical stare.  Well I've got something to tell you, Hollywood.  I have an Anti-Bowie Coating on my glasses that prevents his illusions from penetrating the lenses, and it may have seemed like an impulse buy at the time, but now I see that it has its purposes.  Thank you Empire Vision for protecting my fragile mind from Bowie's powerful gaze.
B000NA28IE|2.0|I agree with most people about this movie. I have read the book, which was awesome, by the way, and movie does not even come close to serving the book justice. Now I know what your thinking, heres another \\"book\\" person who complains about a movie loosing the details the book offers.\\" That is not the case at all. I understand that movies cannot be like books. There is way to much information to cram into a movie. I understand that the screenwriters and directors have to find a way to make it fit in a shorter timeframe. But i have read Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, and seen the movies. The movie, yeah, had some things missing from the book, but they were still great movies KEEPING the story that was already written.<br /><br />Peter Jackson said that his main goal in making the Lord of the Rings trilogy, was to keep to the book as much as possible. I think the director of this movie just read a few internet reviews about the book, maybe even a synopsis on the back of the book, and said, wow! i think i will make a movie about that.<br /><br />  What i am trying to get across, is that, i thought the actors in the movie were good choices, the visual effects were amazing(everything i imagined from the book) the the story was just what we call a \\"blockbuster\\" film. This is something that 20th century fox is good for.<br /><br />They started doing it when they made the Star Wars Prequels. I am A Major StarWars fan and i liked the prequels, but they did not have the same effect like the original ones did. They made things  bluntly obvious and quick. What they did for the movie Eragon, was wanting to make another LOTR type movie but didnt want to front the money to make it as long. LOTR was over 3 hours long (and i love every minute of it) and this movie was 1hr 42min. You cant make an EPIC movie from an amazing book in under 2 hrs. All the 20th century fox cared about was making money off the box office. I wish they would have went back rupt for ruining what SHOULD have been one of the biggest trilogy since LOTR.<br /><br />  My final thought. If you want cheap thrills, yeah, Eragon the MOVIE is good, if you have the intellectual mindset of a seven year old. But if you want a great journey into an amazing story, read the BOOK, or wait until I remake this move, the way it SHOULD have been.hat SHOULD have been one of the biggest trilogy since LOTR. <br /> <br />   My final thought.

0307120007|5.0|My 9-month-old adores this book; it's his favorite.  Sometimes we read it to him, but he will flip through it on his own over and over again.  Some of my favorite times are when we sit together reading on the couch.  I read my book, and he reads Pat the Bunny.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I could write some long-winded, overblown, pedantic, rant on this adaption of the Beowulf Saga - however, I won't. Suffice it to say that if you like this sort of thing, it's worth a couple of hours of your time. If you want to comopare it to say, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" you'll disappointed, however, as it is an adaptation of the Old English Saga (or Norse, or Dane, or whatever) it stands on its own. Blood, guts, monsters, myths and heros...I told my wife that Beowulf and the \\"Danes\\" (aka relocated Vikings, Norsemen, etc) were really the ancestors of the Klingons in Star Trek. Look at it from that angle and you really get it then...(is Beowulf really Kahless?).
1904233023|5.0|I'm not an avid sci-fi reader, but I thought this book was a great read. Its not mind blowing but it stays with you after you have finished it. It has its incites and it reels you in. I was very impressed with it, and i thought it unique & imaginative. I recommend it completely. Though don't expect some kind of illumination rather go into it expecting to be entertained through the imagination and depending on the person you may glean something more.
B00005JPG1|5.0|Director David Fincher's latest film \\"Zodiac\\" does a remarkable job of recreating a period of California history in which a diabolically clever serial killer taunted police and the public beginning in 1969. <br /> <br />Once that attacks were commenced the individual calling himself the Zodiac Killer sought to use the San Francisco Police Department, the media, and ultimately the citizenry as metaphorical mice to be taunted by a megalomaniacal cat seeking to convince everyone that his superior intelligence enabled him to rule with the public no more than unfortunate pawns.  The least fortunate became his murder victims. <br /> <br />The documentary style employed by director Fincher via an intelligent script penned by James Vanderbilt takes a page from the popular current technique used in television true-life criminal case file dramas from such popular presentations as \\"48 Hours\\", \\"Dateline\\" and programs presented on the \\"Court TV\\" network. <br /> <br />The film is reminiscent of the 1971 cinema hit \\"The French Connection,\\" which was also based on fact and involved the interaction between two determined forces, New York policeman Popeye Doyle and Fernando Rey, who played the mastermind of the Marseille drug cartel on the loose in America's largest city.  Gene Hackman won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar playing a dedicated policeman whose search for the drug kingpin becomes totally obsessional. <br /> <br />In \\"Zodiac\\" the consistently obsessive figure is San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who provides a performance comparable to his excellence effort alongside Heath Ledger in \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\"  The film is adapted from Graysmith's bestseller about his true-life experiences, \\"Zodiac Unmasked.\\"   <br /> <br />Gyllenhaal's dedication and efficiency in marshalling facts prompts the Chronicle's crime beat reporter Robert Downey, Jr. to form a working alliance with him in pursuing the Zodiac Killer. <br /> <br />Gyllenhaal and Downey play off of one another superbly as viewers observe an \\"odd couple\\" relationship involving a former Eagle Scout who does not drink, smoke, or curse with a San Francisco rebel from the Bob Dylan and Woodstock sixties who can scarcely believe his dissimilar investigative partner is for real.   <br /> <br />Downey is curt and rebellious to the point where the boozing, smoking, cursing and highly rebellious reporter ultimately quits the Chronicle rather than agreeing to toe the mark and operate the way his superiors, fearing repercussions from the police and community at large over his hands on, aggressive investigative approach, insist that he behave in conformity with their standards. <br /> <br />While more polite and doggedly determined in the manner of a tenaciously determined Boy Scout rather than an \\"in your face\\" and \\"I'll do it my way\\" rebel in the Downey tradition, Gyllenhaal pursues the case to the point where the young lead detective assigned to the case becomes exasperated just as he earlier had with the rebellious member of the duo. <br /> <br />Mark Ruffalo plays the determined young detective who becomes a victim of the case when he is finally pulled off of homicide detail after Chronicle reporter Armistead Maupin, who will later become a famous San Francisco fiction author heralded within the city's large gay community, accuses him of pawning off a letter he actually wrote and represented as the work of the Zodiac Killer.  While it is ultimately revealed that Ruffalo actually did not write such a letter, the damage has been done and leaves Ruffalo with a bitter taste in his mouth. <br /> <br />Gyllenhaal, in the determined tradition of Hackman in \\"The French Connection,\\" operates with undaunted tenacity.  He encounters anyone he feels can benefit his investigative efforts and tenaciously refuses to let go.  While Ruffalo mumbles with exasperation during one late night unannounced call at his apartment to discuss the case that he will \\"grabhis revolver and shoot\\" Gyllenhaal he not only fails to turn him away, as intended; when the zealous investigator captures his interest they leave together and share an early breakfast at a local all night eatery to discuss the case. <br /> <br />While Downey moves from the Chronicle to the Sacramento Bee while his destructive drinking continues and his marriage ends, he remains within Gyllenhaal's determined sight.   <br /> <br />Gyllenhaal's efforts take him to Vallejo and Riverside in Southern California as well in pursuit of information to crack the case.  His efforts ultimately prompt him to focus on a Vallejo eccentric who works at an automotive store, Arthur Leigh Allen, played by John Carroll Lynch.   <br /> <br />The byplay involving Gyllenhaal's investigations and police interrogations of Lynch generate much curiosity.  Viewers can make up their own minds as to the significance Lynch holds in the overall scheme of the case.  \\"Zodiac\\" ultimately becomes a fascinating fill in your own conclusion film in that it follows the thrust of Graysmith's book. <br /> <br />The most dramatic moment of the case from a confrontation standpoint involves a previously arranged telephone call to a popular early morning San Francisco television talk show.  The Zodiac Killer agrees to call and be interviewed with the understanding that famed flamboyant San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli be present as well. <br /> <br />This scene is rendered with dramatic fidelity to the actual event, which has been shown recently in various television documentaries about the Zodiac Killer case.  Brian Cox clearly studied Belli's personal and speech mannerisms in careful detail, as he evidences in this film, playing the famous lawyer with convincing accuracy. <br /> <br />\\"Zodiac\\" is so accurate in its reverence to detail that it brilliantly recreates the period as well as settings in which the crimes and the investigative events occurred.   <br /> <br />Viewers are taken through a journey into the past so real that one believes they are part of a time machine experiment focusing on an elusive and diabolical subject that held San Francisco with helpless fear as its citizens pray for answers and ultimate resolution through the serial killer's capture.
B000001FO4|3.0|In the lazy crazy dayz of '88 nobody knew that the Seattle shoegazers were only a few years away. Certainly not bands like Cinderella who peddled honest enough hard rock that's perfect for downing beers to while sporting the dodgiest stage clobber this side of a Scorpions gig circa '86.<br /><br />Which is a pity as just like their debut, Cinderella have put together a good few tunes and padded them out into an album with filler tracks that - well OK they're filler but not bile inducing.<br /><br />As per their debut there is a lot of mid paced chugging riffage here. It's not awesome but it is wholesome. Keifer continues to expand on themes of rockin' out, good times and even some introspection albeit through an empty bottle. Solid stuff that any half decent bar band should be able to make their own (that's a compliment - this is bar room boogie rock in many ways) and the band seem a little tighter which shows what getting out and touring will do for you.<br /><br />Just like the debut album this has a number of guest musicians, simple production which is totally appropriate for this sort of staff and seemingly a band really believing in their mission.<br /><br />Three stars for this one as there is a chunk of filler here betwixt good sweat soaked hard rock. If you can pick up both this and Night Songs cheap then do so but otherwise the newcomer may be better off getting Still Climbing, the bands 1994 album and best work. Then come back to this and Night Songs.<br /><br />There, hope that helped...
0618477942|5.0|A friend had recommended this book and, given her immaculate taste, I picked it up without a second thought.  I remembered that she had mentioned that there was something unusual about it, but I didn't recall what exactly.  I purchased the book and stepped outside to find a quiet place to read.  When I opened the book, I realized what set this book apart. <br /> <br />It's a graphic novel. <br /> <br />I groaned.  I have never, in my nearly 40 years, read even a comic book; somehow the format has always seemed confusing to me.  However, after the first few pages, I knew I was holding a very special book.  Alison Bechdel's portrayal of her father and troubled family dynamic is daring and brilliant.    <br /> <br />I'll leave it to you to pick up a copy. I can hardly praise Bechdel enough.
B000MHUI0I|4.0|Tattoo You contains some raucous rock 'n roll and a couple of beautiful, soulful ballads. Although not considered to be amongst their very best albums, there is enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />The opener, Start Me Up, is the Stones at their high powered best with its killer riff and insistent rhythm, whilst the melodic Hang Fire with its impressive vocals comes a close second. These were big hits and can be found on many Stones compilations.<br /><br />The bluesy Black Limousine and the reggae-influenced Slave aren't bad either, but ballads like Tops and Heaven fall somewhat beneath their high standards. This may be forgiven though, since the closing number, the poignant Waiting On A Friend sees them at their soulful best. It's a moving ballad on a par with earlier great moments such as Wild Horses and Dead Flowers from 1971's Sticky Fingers album.<br /><br />Overall Tattoo You is thus an uneven work but the aforementioned highlights more than make up for the few tepid and uninspired ballads. I give it four stars but that is judging it by the high standards of their own work.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|i just watched zodiac in the theatre, and it was so horrible that i had to come back and watch something completely opposite to get that movie out of my brain. I loved this version of the Longest Yard and still have yet to see the origial, i think i have seen this story enough times in various movies not to really care about seeing the original. Never really been a fan of originals from the 70's anyway. (I don't know when it was really released)<br /><br />I found the characters entertaining and original with everyone from the hamburgerlar (you know, the guy with cheeseburgers stuffed down his pants) and goldberg (as well as the rest of the well-known wrestlers) as a role that suited him all too well. Maybe not completely original characters, but they worked the roles out well. It was actually most amazing to see Adam Sandler sidetracked by his entire supporting cast which had come close before, but not to this degree. it's just too bad that the movies the WWE was releasing weren't as entertaining as this Happy Madison production.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|i loved this movie just as much as the first one which was just as much as the critics hated it. I don't know why i still read what they have to say because they had led me astray way too many times. Especially when it comes to a movie like this where i know before hand that i will probably like it.<br /><br />I loved the fact that they continued this movie damn near right after the ending of the first one, and i enjoyed the graphic nature of the series. Who cares about the special effects if the story keeps you engaged all the way through, at least enough to get over any possible crappy FX scenerios. if you want great special effects, but crappy plot, go watch Van Helsing. That's one movie i consider terrible.
0307346609|5.0|As a viewer of the Sci-Fi and History channels, I felt at home in this book.  It was so well thought out.  Max Brooks took a subject that many of us think we are familiar with, zombies, and examines their impact on society, economics and military strategy.  Documenting \\"first person accounts\\" of people and nations breaking down and then learning to build themselves back up was quite realistic.  This is a big story and I hope there is a sequel.

0142000655|5.0|Human nature at its finest and worst, this novel peeks into the human heart, showing prejudice, emotional blindness, evil vs. good, and the tie that binds us all together through a life span. Sometimes Steinbeck's pace is so slow that it is difficult to chew through the pages, and yet at the same time it's rich and worth the wait.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Many reviewers seem to have already said what I wanted to say, but still I want to add my words about hits enchanting little film about love and life. You can think of lots of words to describe the merits of \\"Before Sunset\\" - charming, sweet, poignant and beautiful - in other words, the film is very realistic in showing how people meet and love each other.  <br /> <br />Nine years after \\"Before Sunrise\\" in which Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) spent fourteen hours together in Vienna, they meet again in Paris, but Jesse must leave the city for the airport much sooner than before. During the short time, Jesse and Celine talk about what happened to them since the ending of the previous film. <br /> <br />The premise is simple, but the resonant story is honest and becomes deeply emotional as it goes on, much deeper if you fondly remember the original film \\"Before Sunrise\\" made in 1994. Its sequel \\"Before Sunset\\" reflects the lapse of nine years, and how these two likable characters have grown up. Like \\"Beofe Sunrise,\\" \\"Before Sunset\\" is filled with dialogues, but the new film is more focused and compact, as if reflecting that they (and director Richard Linklater) really became more mature during the nine years.  <br /> <br />Probably they did. The conversations exchanged between Jesse and Celine are most thought-provoking when they talk about how coincidences can influence our lives - what if Celine's grandmother didn't die, for instance? Many episodes of their lives since their brief encounter in Vienna are charmingly recounted by two actors who are really in character, but the film is most emotionally touching when they (and we) realise their sweet memories could become very poignant with the \\"what if\\" scenarios that might have been. <br /> <br />You don't have to see \\"Before Sunrise\\" to appreciate the charms of \\"Before Sunset,\\" but viewing experiences will surely enhance the feeling that you also have grown up like Jesse and Celine. The sequel reveals usnot only what happened to them since then; it also playfully gives us clues as to the night they spent together - in short did they make love?  <br /> <br />I can keep writing about the good things about the film, its Paris locations, beautiful but not of postcard beauty (including the bookshop Shakespeare & Company and the brief boat trip on the Seine) and its sparse but lovely music (songs by Nina Simone and Julie Delpy herself) but I was most moved by the film's outlook on life, optimistic without losing sight of sadness.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|Unquestionably this album gets better with every listen! After the first listen I wasn't sure but after a few more I'm simply blown away.  Every track minus about 4 is as good as it will get. You can feel a Springsteen and Calexico influence on a few of the songs. <br /> <br />The best tracks are Intervention, Ocean of Noise, The Well and the Lighthouse, No Cars Go, and My Body is a Cage (fantastic Organ!). <br /> <br />It is different from the first one but truly still such a grand orchestra sound.  NO SOPHMORE SLUMP HERE!
B000I5X80G|3.0|I think the songs, with the exception of Cowgirl and, possibly, Wondering, represent a very poor choice. The fact there are only 6 songs also is a big limitation, like somebody else pointed out. The only thing that saves the album and makes it a 3 stars instead than a 2 stars is the powerful version of Cowgirl in the sand, not so different from the original recording but very very good. The other songs are nothing special and not particularly well executed (as in most live albums) so this album is really more for fans. I am actually surprised by the great reviews it received not only on Amazon (which is normal) but also on specialised magazines.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Others have discussed the plot of the movie, so I won't bore you with minutia.<br /><br />The Illusionist is an exquisite love story (a genre I'm not normally fond of) and supernatural mystery. (Is it supernatural...or is it an illusion? That question is part of what makes this movie so alluring.)<br /><br />With the amazing ability to morph into any character, Ed Norton is one of America's finest actors (remember his turn as a mentally/physically challenged man in The Score--or his turn as a former Neo-nazi skin headin American History X?). Rufus Sewell is delicious as the bad guy (sans those luscious curls this time) and Jessica Biel proves to be far more than just a pretty face. Paul Giamatti--well, is there any role he HASN'T been perfect for?<br /><br />The musical score is breathtaking (Philip Glass), as is the cinematography. I was transported to the cobblestone streets of Austria, right into the heart of intrigue, illusion, deception, and passion. I was surprised at the ending, despite usually being the one who \\"saw it coming\\". The writing is fantastic, too. My husband is on a kick of saying \\"Do you claim to have supernatural powers?\\" (Sewell's line) to which he answers himself (Norton's line) \\"I've claimed no such thing.\\" (LOL) But anyway, there's an amazing undercurrent of tension to this movie that belies the brilliantly understated portrayals by the actors.<br /><br />The disappointing elment is the \\"extras\\". Boy, what a rip off! Others have already complained and said what is wrong: there ARE, in essence, no extras! I very much wanted to find about where the movie was shot, about the author of the book, about the history/mechanics used by illusionists (see The Prestige!), and so on. Shame on 20th Century Fox for shafting viewers with the absence of extras! And I would have LOVE to have seen a more indepth interview of Ed Norton, Rufus Sewell, and Paul Giamatti!<br /><br />If you appreciate fine movies that are smart, elegant, intriguing and slower paced than the norm, you'll likely enjoy The Illusionist. The Prestige is another fantastic movie, but to compare it to The Illusionist is a mistake--because the central themes are quite different.than the norm, you'll likely enjoy The Illusionist.

B0009MDPYM|5.0|I've read the comics and seen the movie many times. i don't care about their similarities nor their differences. all i care is that they were both entertaining enough to keep me coming for more. I loved the majority of this movie and even with gigantic plot holes i still found this movie to be a wonderful use of cinimatics.<br />in the theatre, this movie got hammered by the critics and aparently tons of people didn't like it either. I couldn't figure out why until i thought about the fact that i'm not religious and many people had problems with the overly-Catholic tone. Oh well, it has a Catholic background, it's still fun to watch.<br />Constantine's witty dry sense of sarcasm drew me in from the beginning because i just love that in characters and the only sarcastic character i think i like better is House, from the TV show.<br />i know this movie isn't for everyone, but if you have an open mind to all things magic, you will probably like this, unless the Catholic background throws you off. This movie only follows Catholic mythology so far, then takes it's own twists (I.E. Half-breeds). Personally, i thought it was great that someone could use the angel/devil mythology in a different way. A little originality goes a long way.<br />The hell scenes were quite possibly the best part (visually) to me in this movie. Those scenes just added a little extra flavor to a movie i would have liked anyway, but sent it to the top. I hope Keanu Reeves recieves more roles that would suit him well like this one.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|Bob Clark has directed a number of horror films, which, for whatever reason, have found themselves lost or overlooked in the dusty, cobweb filled catacombs of horror history. His excellent satires of the Vietnam conflict and the counter-culture in \\"Death Dream\\" and \\"Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things\\" respectively, often get overlooked. The same can be said for his prototype slasher film \\"Black Christmas\\". The credit tends to be given to \\"Halloween\\", although a superior film, Carpenter's effort steals wholesale a number of motifs from Clark's film which went on to define the slasher film (point of view shots from the killer's perspective, a seasonal connection, sexually precocious teenagers etc). Where Clark's film differs is in its implied nastiness. The killer, judging from his vitriolic phone manner is one of cinema's true enigmas. Never glimpsed, Clark does stretch things somewhat by having the psycho live in the sorority house. We only get tantalising hints as to the killers mixed up mental state. The reason Clark is able to leave his film so open-ended and so riddled with more questions than answers is because it was an independent production, and this probably explains its disappearance into the mists of film history. Nevertheless the film has some notable actors (Keir Dullea, John Saxon, Margot Kidder), which have helped to ensure it has something of a cult following. \\"Black Christmas\\" is an essential stepping stone in the development of 1970's horror and must be rewritten into the canon of key horror works.
B00003BDXG|4.0|i always wanted to use that word (discombobulated) for a movie and this movie is a perfect one. everything from the soundtrack to violence and the cameo appearence from the late Rodney Dangerfield all turn this bizarre movie into a success. it felt as if you really took a trip into the mind of a couple of maniacs, in a way that they saw the world.<br /><br />not for everyone is an understatement. If violence isn't a problem, go ahead and watch. There are plenty of trip scenes where i almost felt like either this movie or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was copying each other somewhat (not sure which one came out first and don't feel like looking it up)<br /><br />nevertheless, i loved this movie for a long time. it had the perfect soundtrack picked for it as well as many memorable scenes. it was one movie you can't erase from your brain so if you haven't watched it yet, the name alone should let you know what it's about if it wasn't obvious enough. I think the reason so many people didn't like it is because the movie jumps around quite a bit, feeling very disconnected. Of course, that was the effect the director was going for so you could feel what these two nutty a--holes were going through. i say in that aspect, he succeeded.
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|Bands as such are a dime a dozen. The new metal/emo/what have you, movement may have been done with some semblance of originality in the very beginning, now of course, like every other popular drift, the radio is saturated with noodle heads trying desperately to replicate something that was DOA. 30StoM is nothing more than a goulash of trifling sorry arpeggios, way melodramatic vocals, and every other emo/new metal band on the radio.     Then why do people like it? It's incredibly catchy, and absolutely easy to get into... for radio listeners who know nothing about music or it's roots. If you want to base how good a band is entirely on its appeal to people who've been brainwashed for years by the radio, then 30StoM is probably one of the best bands in the world.     Mediocre at best, totally un-creative run of the mill garbage at worst, and it hurts my soul to know that the next spawning of bands will be given impetus by such poor, predictable artists as these. I would rather listen to a polar bear devour my skeleton.    *People have said they are prog-like. Oh my god!!! Please go listen to some Yes \\"relayer\\" or do your research and you will find this is hardly even a distant cousin of prog.*     Buy this album if for some reason you want to hear more of what's already impossible to avoid hearing.
B000002LJW|4.0|If for no other reason but the debut of the classic \\"Running On Faith\\" this Clapton venture deserves a space on any music lover's shelf. At the end of the 1980's what was left to say? Many  classic artists put in two cents in 1989; Dylan, Joel, the Stones, Ronstadt, Henley, each with different views and widely different results. Clapton combined the blues with some old fashioned rock and roll to create a worthy farewell to the excess of the 80's.<br /><br />\\" Pretending\\", the first track and single from the album, is a rocker with some electric influence. Typical \\" you've done me wrong\\" song. \\" Bad Love\\" was the second single, again, nothing profound but easy on the ears. \\" Running on Faith\\" is one of Clapton's best songs. Period. The Gospel choir at the end is an affirmation of faith in action. \\" Old Love\\" is another song that lilts along with a haunting message. Everyone has one of these painful ghosts.<br /><br />\\" Journeyman\\" is a far cry from \\" Slowhand\\", but it does offer a tale of a rocker aging gracefully.
B00003CXB4|4.0|The movie is awesome.  The picture and sound quality are awesome.  The dvd menu setup is infuriating.  I have a 2 year old daughter who loves this movie.

In the meantime my daughter is crying because it's taking so long.  (Yes, my daughter already runs the household and yes we're in trouble.) <br />So,... great movie.  Really annoying menus.

0060007737|4.0|This book is a must read for anyone with responsibilities in branding because it gives some great advice and guidlines to get your mind muscles working.  My biggest problem with the book is that they take an anti-extension position, which is dead on, but they don't recognize that brand managers don't live in a perfect world and sometimes find themselves in situations where they HAVE to extend the brand or find a new job.  Don't look back, but that's Al and Laura sawing off the branch that you're standing on.  There's absolutely no guidance in this book that would give you some reasonable rules to follow in the event that you have little choice but to brand extend. <br /> <br />The most recent example that shatters their immutable law about brand extending weakening a brand is the Apple iPod.  Everybody is aware that the iPod is an Apple product.  Apple didn't have the first MP3 player in the industry.  Instead, Apple had a frame of reference built into their brand, as well as a point of difference (the strongest branding tool there is).   <br /> <br />While there are a lot of examples of failed brand extensions, there are also a lot of examples of successful ones.  There is a fundamental science behind what makes a brand extension work so that it re-inforces the parent brand, rather than acts parasitically.  The weakness of this book is that it tries to present the last word on the subject without acknowledging the successes on other side of the coin. <br /> <br />I would give this book 3 1/2 stars if I could, but since I can't, I'll round up to 4 based on the easy style of this book, as it presents some powerful concepts in an conversational and easy to grasp way that includes a lot of brain fodder to stew on.

The results are what is certainly one of Fleetwood Mac's best releases and their most creative album since \\"Tusk\\" in the late 70's.  Some will be disappointed at the absence of Christine McVie from this project, but for me, she was always my least favorite songwriter in the band, and is not missed that much.  Her departure opens the door for the creative juices of Buckingham and Nicks with Buckingham especially turning in one of his most passionate performances.  The songs are equally divided (8 a piece) between Buckingham and Nicks.  Buckingham's contributions are just about all top notch and seem to lean heavily in the direction of his more experimental solo works than previous material with Fleetwood Mac.  The opening track \\"What's The World Coming To\\" is a great way to start.  \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" is an odd, yet ultimately satisfying comment on society.  \\"Miranda\\" has a killer chorus and is instantly memorable. \\"Come\\" is a great song with great background vocals on the chorus from Stevie and an absolutely incindiary guitar solo by Buckingham.  The solo is probably the closest thing to heavy metal that Buckingham has ever recorded, drenched in distortion, Buckingham makes the guitar scream in a style akin to no one else.  \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" is a nice acoustic ballad.  \\"Bleed To Love Her\\" first appeared on the live \\"The Dance\\" album and is included here as a studio track.  \\"Say Goodbye\\" is another great acoustic track.  Stevie Nicks material is also very good, although I don't think it quite reaches the highs of Buckingham's.  \\"Illume\\" is prime Stevie about September 11.  It is both insightful and moving.  \\"Running Through The Garden\\" is a great rocker, with yet another outstanding guitar solo from Buckingham.  \\"Silver Girl\\" is great little ballad, and the album closer \\"Goodbye Baby\\" is a Stevie Nicks lamentdone as only she can.  The rest of the tracks on the album are all solid as well for the most part.  Probably two of my least favorites are the ones they choose to release as singles.  \\"Peacekeeper\\" is ok, but does not stand up to Buckingham's other material on the disc and the title track \\"Say You Will\\" is just kind of bland.  Overall though this is a very good album that sees Fleetwood Mac taking more chances with their music than ever before.  Fans of Buckingham's solo albums should really eat this one up.  For fans of more straight ahead pop Fleetwood Mac this album may be a bit of a challenge, but if you don't mind a classic band that is trying to push the envelope with new material, this is a great one.  To me this is a must own Fleetwood Mac album, and may be the best of their career.
B0000029DD|5.0|In the wee, small hours of the morning 'Lilac Wine' was played on the radio, and the announcer spoke about Jeff Buckley's short life. <br /> Pardon my ignorance but I hadn't listened to any of Jeff's songs till then. I can still vividly remember the shivers running up and down my spine while I listened, even though half asleep. <br /> The next day I went & bought Grace for that one song...but then I listened to Hallelujah, Last Goodbye,Corpus Christi... <br /> It's a very melancholic CD, but then a lot of us prefer to listen to that kind of music. <br />In listening to this CD and songs from his others, he seemed to be a person who was  searching for some spiritual comfort... <br /> Jeff Buckley's music was quite a find, even if it was at 4 o'clock in the morning...
B000286RKW|5.0|I bought the 1 disc version several years ago and as I watched the movie about half way through it stopped!?? It's one of the few DVD's made that you have to turn over to play the second half of the film! I returned it to the store that day and I waited for this new 2 disc version and the movie. Now I can watch the film without interruption.<br /><br />This a one of the greatest gangster films of all time ever! I'm from the Godfather era, so everything after the first two installments of GF is almost as good. (hehe) :-D It's a totally different style than The Godfather films, but equally as compelling with great performances by DeNiro, Pesci, Liotta , Sorvino and Bracco. The 2 disc edition is an improvement, but hardly special. ;-.
B00005JO20|4.0|Waited a while to check this film out, but I am not disappointed.  Jack Black is great and the lovely Naomi Watts is the perfect damsel in distress.  The oceanic voyage coupled with all of the fierce escape and adventure type action on Skull Island was excellent!  The theme of \\"beauty killed the beast\\" sometimes fell short with me, particularly during the last half hour of the film when it was quickly layered on and then suddenly became something of an irregularity compared to what had just happened.  Overall great performances by Black and Watts and I really must tell you, if you want some adventure, this one takes Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park to a whole new level.  The bonus features on the widescreen edition are just okay, but I think I enjoy this enough to pick up the better set that includes multiple discs.
B0007VZ9DK|1.0|I love this movie! The problem is I have a very expensive DVD player and this movie freezes about two hours into it! I play it in one of my cheapo players and it works fine. They need to fix this problem by letting everyone return it for a nice new 15th anniversay edition! I have read numerous complaints about this problem and it is inexcusable!
0307237699|4.0|People from the freedom movement wonder what the Barack Obama phenomenon is about, as do naturally curious regular citizens on all strands of the political spectrum.<br /><br />Most of us are aware of Obama's oratorical skills.  He galvanized many Americans at the 2004 Democratic Nominating Convention with phrases like:<br /><br />  People don't expect government to solve all their problems.<br />  But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight<br />  change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in<br />  America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of<br />  opportunity remain open to all.<br /><br />Anyone watching that stirring speech can appreciate how the man has the aura to capture the imagination of voters from all walks of life.  Many say American politics hasn't seen such excitement, especially on college campuses and in high schools, since Kennedy ran for president in 1960.<br /><br />The Queen of Demean, Ann Coulter now in self-destruct mode --whose every other sentence these days accuses someone of being gay--claims Obama's speeches sound like Hallmark greeting cards.  But political speeches are necessarily rife with platitudes.  How about this one:<br /><br />Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice; moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.<br />-- Barry Goldwater, 1964<br />Now that's a greeting card with a kick!<br /><br />Back to Barack.

B0006SSOHC|3.0|I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this infamous horror/gore movie. I can pretty much handle anything you can throw at me, but the title suggest I am going to see some really disturbing stuff! To my surprise, the movie has nowhere near the gore I thought it would have. This is a good thing and it is really more in the same vein as Se7en and Halloween etc. A good entry in the horror genre and much better than I expected. I liked the third installment, but I was not too impressed with the second one. If you must see a Saw then this is the Saw to see. ;-b
0743437497|4.0|Until recently the absence of a Stephen King title was the biggest gap in my collection. Wanting to correct the anomaly I bought Dreamcatcher and started reading it. Not the wisest move as it turned out. It ended up being one of the very few books I didn't manage to finish. As I result, I didnt pick up another Stephen King title for a long time. Meanwhile I discovered Graham Masterton, and ended up reading a dozen of his books. I maintain that his Mirror is the greatest and most inventive horror story ever told.<br /><br />But I digress, it is Stephen King's Shining that I am reviewing. At close to 600 pages, the book took me a couple of hours spread over 2 weekends to finish. It certainly has an eerie atmosphere what with a boy and a chef sharing the quality of telepathy, King chooses to call The Shining. Its a well told story of a guy who loves his wife and his kid and for their sake strives to get over alcoholism. Just when life seems to be looking good, he ends up in an unfortunate incident which leads to his dismissal. He has got one final chance to redeem his future, when his only remaining friend offers him the job of a caretaker at Hotel Overlook. However, things start happening once the staff of the hotel leaves for winter closure. It doesn't take long to figure out that the house is haunted.<br /><br />The story didn't scare me at all. It has its moments, and is undoubtedly an interesting read; but scary -- no way. If you are looking for a story that is well told, suspenseful and puts you on the edge this one fits the bill. If you are looking for scares, look elsewhere.
1582701709|1.0|Read this fast, becuase it is about to be drowned in a wave of five star reviews.<br /><br />Ms. Byrne actually writes that we should not look at anything that we don't want to be or become. She takes \\"see no evil\\" literally. Instead of the way it used to be: \\"don't see being fat as bad or wrong or evil,\\" now it's: \\"keep thinking there's something wrong with being fat, and just don't look at fat people because otherwise you might get or stay fat.\\"<br /><br />Imagine a culture where no one looked at fat people; where fat people can't even look at each other; of utterly lonely fat people whose thoughts of being ignored are compounded by self-loathing, self-hate, and self-guilt; where sick people aren't looked at; where even doctors can't look at sick people, lest they get sick too; where famous people can't look at people without fame lest they lose their mojo; where poor people aren't looked at...actually, this is starting to sound like America.<br /><br />This book is selling so well because it justifies the narrow self-absorbed culture we already have. It's a culture of denial. Have you ever avoided looking at a deformed person; rather not have heard or done anything about the poverty in your back yard; averted your gaze from someone you thought was fat or ugly; not wanted to face the sacrifices necessary to reverse our pollution of the planet; not decided to make a stand against a system where poor uninsured sick people can't get a doctor to look at them because hospitals don't see sick people either, they only see if there's any money in the bank account; not questioned why movie stars only seem to be married (at least temporarily) to other rich and famous people, as if no one else exists to choose from; or not questioned why we almost never see dead soliders or dead Iraqis?<br /><br />Because according to this Cosmic Secret, the secret of life is apparently that so long as you ignore the facts of life, like that you are falling off a cliff, don't worry because you'll never hit the ground with a deafening thud so long as you ignore the obvious.<br /><br />Fortunately for The Secret clan, this country has been told that The Secret is good, and we will see (and buy) anything so long as media calls it good. Everyone has to know their marching orders: fat bad, health good, broke bad, money good, intellectual bad, dumb good, anonymity bad, fame good, and above all else, independent thinking bad, shopping good.ecause you'll never hit the ground with a deafening thud so long as you ignore the obvious. <br /> <br />Fortunately for The Secret clan, this country has been told that The Secret is good, and we will see (and buy) anything so long as media calls it good.

B00005JPLU|3.0|\\"300\\" is beautiful - each scene based on a panel from Frank Miller's comic series.  I caught a special screening in San Francisco 3 days before the official release.  It much more effective than Miller's other comic translated to film, \\"Sin City\\", because this film has both a heart and a meaningful message.  You can get a description of the plot elsewhere, so I will focus on the film's strength and weaknesses.  As I said above it is frame-by-frame beautiful - including every drop of splattered blood that flies across the screen.  You also feel the love and camaraderie of the soldiers to each other and Leonidas to his wife. And most importantly, their dedication to what is right versus what is easy.  With that said, there are some flaws that kept me from rating the film higher.  (1) David Wenham's voice-over narration is lack-luster - it really needed a voice that captivated you but instead you become aware of the stilted language; (2) Rodrigo Santoro's voice, as Xerxes, is heavily processed - I couldn't tell if he was dubbed with the voice of another actor (like Clinton Spilsbury in the \\"Legend of the Lone Ranger\\"); (3) Although Gerard Butler is overall good in the role of Leonidas, he grunts much of his dialogue as if he was constipated; (4) The makeup used for the hunchback is awful.  In the previews I thought he was computer-generated but instead the actor has a large bumpy plastic lump on his face and back - with all the wonder creative and computer artistry in the film, they couldn't have come up with a better design? With all the said, I still salute director Zack Snyder's effort and plan to see \\"300\\" at least one more time on the IMAX screen.
1582701709|1.0|Positive thinking is good because it sets you into ACTION. And ACTION is what makes things happen. You don't need to spend $25 dollars in a 200 page book to know that, or do you? Oh wait! This is not the message of the book! You don't have to take action just think and wait... <br /> <br />I should change my career and became a motivational speaker, Americans believe anything these days... <br />
0521008433|5.0|Unlike some books on English language teaching, \\"Approaches and Methods\\" by Richards and Rodgers is a logically organised, relatively jargon-free and easily grasped book. It is almost certain you will not be diving for the headache tablets after this book.<br /><br />Covering a large range of the historical and current second language teaching methodologies, the book discusses methods in a logical format that is the same throughout. They discuss three broad areas: Approach, (the theories and ideas underpinning the method), Design, (roles, materials and so on), and Procedure, (what happens in the classroom). This makes each chapter exceptionally well-organised.<br /><br />The book covers a lot of different methods, including those that are less in favour these days, as well as some that are more recent. However, some very recent developments are not included, such as the controversial Dogme of Thornbury and Medding. What *is* in the book includes Suggestopaedia, TPR, NLP, Natural Way, Multiple Intelligences and more. All of them come with a brief discussion on the background that they came from.<br /><br />This is an incredibly valuable book for a run down on the methodologies that have come and gone, (some still on the way out). It is an excellent resource that serves well as a reference, or something to be read from cover-to-cover. Or both.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is the best superhero movie ever made, and I have seen them all. <br /> <br />Batman makes Spiderman look like a total loser. <br /> <br />This and Batman (1989) are the only movies of batman worth seeing. The Joel Schumacher renditions are utter CRAP! <br /> <br />As Christian Bale said when getting an award for his role in Batman Begins \\"It is great that Chris [Nolan] has finally brounght back some DIGNITY to the greatest superhero of all time...\\" That is a semi-quotation of what he said, you get the idea. <br /> <br />This movies is totally amazing, I can't wait to see \\"The dark Knight\\", whcih began filming this month (March), and will be out next year. <br /> <br />I have no doubt it will be amazing, just as this film is. <br /> <br />BUY IT!

074356619X|5.0|The movie is great to get you excited and hyped up, but the CD set is the instruction manual that helps you to understand exactly how to apply the secret. This has changed my life and my husband's life! We discovered The Secret in January and I loved the DVD, but it wasn't until I came across the CD set and listened all the way through that I truely understood how to Ask, Believe and Receive through the Law Of Attraction. I am so happy and my life has really changed into a wonderful adventure. Parking spaces are always there, the trafic lights are always green, people are so nuce everywhere, and my business is doing better than I ever thought possible when I started it 3 years ago! I am so excited about every day now that I understand that I create my life completely and that I CAN have everything I want, and I AM the accumulation of everything I have thought about so far up until now.<br /><br />When I really started thinking about the LOA, and thinking back on my entire life, picking out events and tracing my thoughts at that time, or around that time, I am realizing that I have always been using the LOA, I just never realized it. Everything from the small car accident I was in several years ago (I was brooding about wanting more attention RIGHT THEN from my then current boyfriend as he hadn't invited me to an event he was attending that evening and I turned into a parking lot just as an SUV came around the corner and I hit them. No one was hurt, but guess who had to come pick me up and spend time with ME?), to thinking about wanting to move to Vermont and buying a house (a year later and against all odds, we moved to Vermont and bought a house!). It all applies!<br /><br />Now that I understand what was happening in my life, I am so happy to realize that I can and AM directing my thoughts and actions in completely positive ways to achieve everything I want.<br /><br />Buy this, you won't regret it!

B0002DB52M|5.0|The movie shows that there's only one step between forgiveness of a Jesus and a blind judgment of an ultimate power. In that one step, the whole spectrum of human behavior is contained.  <br /> <br />The movie asks many questions about human nature and nature of our societies, but the ultimate question is the most dangerous one, as said at the closure: \\"There's a question of a more artfull nature that few would benefit from by asking and even fewer by providing an answer and nor, indeed, would it be answered here\\". Intrigued? If you like theatre, and if you like to think about human nature, don't miss this movie! <br /> <br />A caveat: <br /> <br />Americans take this film for offence because the transition between the two extremes happens much more easily in American society due to its idealism, superficiality, fascist mentality of a herd, and its violent nature - and they know it. Lars von Trier knows it too - that's why he's chosen America for his stage.
1400079179|3.0|It is nice to see Dan Brown place scholars into the action hero role and bring subjects of science and culture into his plots.  Da Vinci Code as well as Brown's other novels are very readable and interesting.  This said, Brown is quite  formulaic with his plots, there is the mystery, action, boy meets girl theme regularly repeated in all his 4 books.  But Dan  Brown weaves this pattern with good technique and lots of interesting information on the side.<br /><br />There is another pattern which Dan Brown consistently repeats.  He takes a valid, exciting question, be it the Holy Grail<br /><br />Da Vinci Code), extraterrestrial life (Deception Point), secret societies (Angels and Demons) or digital privacy (Digital Fortress) and builds a whole mystery around it, only to downplay the question in the end.  Dan Brown seems to be telling the  reader something like: \\"I know you have heard of the Grail, ET's, secret societies, government intrusion and so on and are  wondering about these admittedly captivating things.  Now let me tell you what: There's no real mystery.  These are either  deceptions by lone plotters or rogue agencies or innnocent hobbies of scholars.  Don't worry, go back to sleep, don't ask  questions.  There is no transforming esoteric knowledge behind the Grail, no ET presence, no hidden power elite, no  unbreakable code.<br /><br />As concerns the Grail, Brown's scholarship has been criticized by many.  There is more to it than Brown addresses. For example, the book From Scythia to Camelot by Scott Littleton and Linda Malcor makes a strong case for a Grail mythos that  predates Christianity by far.  In Secret History, Laura Knight Jadczyk pieces together the esoteric elements of the divine  feminine and the Grail ensemble, among many other threads of our past.<br /><br />It is on one hand good that Dan Brown brings his topics into the spotlight.  But the reader who is looking for knowledge of these matters should not stop with Brown's scholarship or Brown's conclusions.  These belitttle very complex and deep  questions.should not stop with Brown's scholarship or Brown's conclusions.

B000H1QYXY|5.0|This cd is aptly titled, George is one of the best artist of the last 25 years. This cd is delicious and made me fall in love again with what I think will be timeless and well crafted songs. I am a bit disappointed that Kissing A Fool, one of my favorites was not included, but the blow was cushioned by his duets with Mary J., Mutya and Sir Paul. Mutya what a voice, she needs her own cd. <br /> <br />Well done GM!
B000EF7W3Y|5.0|If magic lives anywhere in the world, it must live in music like this.  The original Fisherman's Blues is one of my 10 most played CDs and has been since I first heard it in 1990. The blend of Celtic, English, country, blues, and rock influences intertwine flawlessly. It is hard to categorize, but its power and brilliance are evident in every song. It is a timeless recording of vision, subtlety, and energy, on a par with Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. It touches me in a way that few CDs do and I keep coming back to it as some sort of musical touchstone. The new release has so many wonderful additional tracks, all of which add to the original. I understand that there is a lot of additional material from these recording session. If they release the 4 CD box set of Fisherman's Blues, I will grab that as well.  New Comment: They did release the 4 CD box and it is wonderful as well. This recording is every bit as special as breakthrough recordings like Astral Weeks, Born to Run, Are You Experienced, and Blonde on Blonde.

B000FFJ85I|5.0|I love it. This is probably one of my favorite CDs from AFI and all time.(My other fave AFI's are Sing the Sorrow and the Art of Drowning.) It's a great balance of music, with songs to satisfy everyone.<br /><br />Anyways, here's my rating of the songs on this CD:<br /><br />Prelude 12/21 10/10 - I love this...song. It's short, but it's an awesome into. It's one of their best intos, if not the best.<br /><br />Kill Caustic 9/10 - Great metal song. Kinda screamo, but I like it a lot.<br /><br />Miss Murder - 9/10 - Just love it. The video rocks, too.<br /><br />Summer Shudder - 8/10 - The chorus is cool. The rest of the song's decent.<br /><br />Love Like Winter 104848935874.58/10 - Combined with the video, this is one of my favorite songs ever (by AFI, and by anyone).<br /><br />Affliction - 7.5/10 - Eh, this one's okay. I like when they say \\"Lover, I am loveless.\\"<br /><br />The Missing Frame - 8/10 - This one's good. Nothing too special, but Davey's voice sounds nice in this song.<br /><br />Kiss and Control - 7.6/10 - I like the thing at the end where Davey says \\"We'll burn like stars.\\" I also like the screamo chorus.<br /><br />The Killing Lights - 8/10 - Catchy chorus. Don't really understand the lyrics.<br /><br />37mm - 10/10 - Sort of the beginning of Blaqk Audio (Davey and Jade's electronica side project). Amazing!<br /><br />Endlessly, She Said - 10/10 - The song's awesome!!!. On the ending note (when Davey says, \\"Endless...ly.) The 'ly' makes me cringe. But other than that, it's soo cool!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Well it is a sweet film that has recieved way more than its share of publicity.  I loved it for the van they drove around in, like one my family had growing up.

Big film it is not but still a bit of sunshine.

0771068719|2.0|English patient has some interesting characters and the plot does have some intrigue, but please, an astounding book? Not. Too many little-finger-in-the-air chardonnays for the book review set. The author's prose is like reading a college literature student's overdone ramblings, he tries way to hard to be artful with words, which is really an inconsideration to the reader. The author's ability to be creative should be secondary to his ability to communicate. A lot of the metaphors don't work, simply leaving you puzzled. This book is like going to dinner with people who can speak the same language as you, but decide they will talk in another, company be damned.

B000000Y2R|5.0|This concert was a reunion for Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. In spite of his name, Dizzy was actually a pretty stable guy, who was fed up with Bird's shennanigans. It was a shame, because they were two virtuosos, and Parker replaced Diz with a young Miles Davis, who was just not up to the task, not playing at a level to meet and challenge Bird.<br /><br />To give you an idea of what Dizzy had been putting up with, Parker played the gig on a white plastic saxophone, because his horn was in the pawn shop. That was a common tactic of Charlie Parker, drug addict, pawning his horn before a gig, in order to get money for heroin. In spite of the plastic horn (that actually became kind of a collector's item because Bird had used the horn on this notorious recording) he played fantastic, and the alto break on Night in Tunisia, where the band stops just after playing the head, and then the alto carries it, and the band rejoins him for the first solo chorus, is classic, and is now referred to as THE \\"alto break.\\" In addition to his pawn shop situation, Parker also had to record under the name of Charlie Chan, due to other contractual obligations. It is just amazing, that in spite of the situation, they had assembled the greatest band of all eternity, who were able to perform the Greatest Jazz Concert of All Time.<br /><br />Charles Mingus was quite a bass player, but a volatile personality as well. One time when a trumpeter announced he was quitting, Mingus punched him in the mouth, breaking several teeth. This is even more serious for a musician, especially a trumpet man, than it is for the average citizen. What a prick. But what a bass player he was.<br /><br />Bud Powell suffered from mental illness. I think there was an incident where he got beat up by bouncers at a club, much like the way Jaco Pastorius was killed. He was also a genius, and developed a stripped down left hand style, just suggesting the chords with 2 or 3 notes, while freeing up his right hand for furious bebop explosions. Titles of his original tunes, like Glass Enclosure, or Dance of the Infidels, gives you a glimpse into his mind set.<br /><br />Max Roach was like the match to this molotov cocktail. What a perfect drummer for this ensemble. Roach, Mingus, Powell, Gillespie and Parker. Not even white plastic saxophones, mental illness, or chronic bad attitude could hold them back. Added bonus is Dizzy and/or Bird anouncing the tunes, sometimes even in French.<br /><br />Check out their version of Hot House, a wonderiferous tune composed by Tadd Dameron. This tune has a lovely and beautimus head based on the changes to Cole Porter's What Is This Thing Called Love?<br /><br />In spite of any qualms you might have about the sound quality (it was recorded by Mingus with a back stage recorder and never intended to be released or anything) it is a document of 5 virtuouso geniuses, brought together by fate for this single recording that is rightly referred to as the Greatest Jazz Concert of All Time.<br /><br />I remember that I had the Double LP, and the second LP was Bud Powell playing in piano trio format. To include that would be the only possible improvement to this fantastic CD. 5 stars. 6 or 7 even if they would let me.for furious bebop explosions.

B000FIMG68|5.0|More of this please!  I don't like watching TV shows anymore on TV so the whole DVD thing is a Godsend.  Lost is also an entertainment Godsend.  I love the mystery and character histories and how each one interacts with the other characters.  The writing is superb and the execution is marvelous.
B00005ATQF|5.0|A gushing review for one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br />I am a big Kubrick fan/snob, and although Full Metal Jacket isn't my favorite of his films, it's a close second (or third, it's hard to decide).  The movie is split into two portions, nearly halves: the first shows a group of marines through the trials of boot camp on Paris Island, and the second transports a few of these characters in-country, including the battle for Hue city right after the Tet Offensive.  That's a very brief synposis of a relatively uncomplicated story; what makes FMJ worthy of multiple viewings is the richness that is revealed not in a confusing or artsy plot, but in the believable characters, setting, and dialogue.   <br /> <br />Full Metal Jacket isn't necessarily a 'thinking man's' war film (like The Thin Red Line or Apocalypse Now), but it isn't some trashy, gung-ho heroes' story, either (e.g. Black Hawk Down, Born on the 4th of July, innumerable others).  Somehow, FMJ straddles the line between high-brow pretension and low-brow shoot 'em up scenes, with a little of both elements scattered throughout.  As I said earlier, the story itself isn't the movie's biggest drawing point (marines are introduced, things go awry, marines head to war, things go awry again...roll credits), but through a wonderful combination of intense performances, realistic settings, brilliant dialogue, and breath-taking direction and cinemtaography, it works on all levels.  I've seen a lot of Vietnam movies (for a 22 year old), but Full Metal Jacket is one for the ages, because it is more than JUST a period piece.  Much more.  It isn't bogged down with time-sensitive morality plays or annoying reminders of the 60s...it is a movie for anyone who's ever contemplated what lies in the hidden side of Vietnam, and war in general. <br /> <br />Highlights include the following, for me.  The movie is beautifully and dramatically written, thanks in part to journalist Michael Herr, who spent a lot of time in Vietnam during the war (see his excellent book, Dispatches, for further reading).  R. Lee Ermey's performance is as real and frightening as you've probably heard; Matthew Modine and Adam Baldwin also provide excellent acting, too.  Private Gomer Pyle, played to full sympathetic effect by Vincent D'Onofrio, is a memorable and pitiable character.  As mentioned before, the directing and cinematography make for a graphic (but not excessively violent) look at war, both at home and abroad...it's not a beautiful sight, but alternatingly grim and awe-inspring.  I think the effectiveness of the movie's soundtrack is sometimes overlooked; Kubrick sets the mood with the likes of \\"Paint It Black\\", \\"These Boots Are Made For Walking\\", \\"Surfin' Bird\\" and \\"Chapel of Love\\" in interesting and unforgettable ways.  And, again, the dialogue is killer.  I quote this movie habitually, and always at the most inappropriate of times.  There is a reason why phrases like \\"What is your major malfunction?\\" and \\"Do you love the Virgin Mary?\\" have entered the lexicon of American pop culture.   <br /> <br />In my mind, FMJ is an 'issues' movie cleverly disguised as an action-filled war flick (it certainly has its fair share of both thought-provoking matieral and violent montages).  What issues are at hand?  First and foremost, what it was like for a marine during Vietnam, both during training and in combat.  The question of excessive force, in many forms, is prevalent throughout the film.  Other social issues ranging from pacifism, heroic actions, and mercy run aside subtler ones like conflicting political idealogies, 'the duality of man', and even feminism (notice the role of women in this film) are explored, as well.  This is why I have gone back to Full Metal Jacket many times over the years for both entertainment and to get the mental gears turning...it's the kind of movie that will spring questions you might never have considered before watching it. <br /> <br />It's hard to think of any critiques I haveof this movie, but one does come to mind.  Some viewers may be frustrated by the movie's lack of a decisive beginning, middle, and end.  As mentioned before, the movie is divided into two halfs, which are loosely connected, as themes, setting, and events are pretty distinct and seperate between both portions.  Also, this movie is certainly for mature audiences...I saw it for the first time when I was seventeen, and even that might have been a little early.  Graphic scenes, language, and acts abound.  Audiences who are not fans of war movies (or, conversely, fans of John Wayne-type war flicks) will probably not find much to enjoy here. <br /> <br />As for the DVD itself, there are no special features to be found here.  All you get is a theatrical preview and Spanish audio dubs.  Die-hard fans may be interested in tracking down the elusive Collector's Set (complete with metal tin packaging), but as for this version, you're buying it strictly for the content, not any fancy packaging or frilly extras.  Take it or leave it, and obviously, I say, TAKE IT! <br /> <br />With those prefaces behind me, I have very few movies in my collection which I consider mandatory viewing for anybody.  Nevertheless, Full Metal Jacket is certainly one of them.  Even if I wasn't the admitted Kubrick apologist that I am, I would still adore this movie for the fine, deranged work of art that it is.  Whether you've seen the movie before, or are just interested in expanding your DVD collection to include more classics of warfare, you owe it to yourself to put this one on your shelf.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Lives up to hype and pressure of being the new Bond film.  There are some sweet scenes using tensions of all kinds to show off the acting and relationships of the characters.  They have done a very good job with this film I wonder how they can follow after it.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This is a daring film. First, it's two leads are wonderfully gifted actors but neither of them play very pleasant fellows. When they play their younger, more naive, characters there's a spark, but one tragedy snuffs it out entirely. The competition becomes their focus as one refuses to forgive and the other forgets why he should. There are intriguing jumps in the timeline of events that kept me seated. Supportive characters to the drama are spot on and bear the emotional weight of the obsessive leads. Before the end neither of the men can claim any real friendship with anyone, though some smoldering sympathies for who they once were still linger in the close distance. What some people reviewing this film take issue with is, to me, the daring part of the film. It dares to have a real kind of magic. The nay sayers find this blasphemous in the age of reason. The best part is that while this magician has a clear edge it is a tragic one, one that drains his humanity the more he uses it. I like the way this film is played out. some might guess the end but guessing the implications is what makes this film stand apart from others like it. Also, I love the use of the great Nikola Tesla as a character assisting one of the magicians, warning him all the while of the danger inherent in this help. This is an imaginative, sad, cautionary and thoroughly unusual film. By the end I was in transformed from a skeptic (reviews for this film were mixed) to booster. To be sure this film is not for everyone.
0446608955|5.0|This is the sweetest love story ever. I absolutly love this book.
0451160916|5.0|I read this book recently, and I thought it was fantastic.  I read it faster than I've ever read a book before in my life.  My friend doesn't read at all, and she loves the book.  I recommended it to her, and she didn't put it down, nor did I.  I thought it was great.  Definitely one of King's best.  You can really picture the characters, especially Jack.  If you liked Jack Nicholson's performance in the movie, you will love Jack's character in the book.  It goes into more detail about Jack's ways and I really loved the character.  GREAT!!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|OK, I nominate 'Best Actor in a Supporting Role' to the '78 VW Bus! What a whacked out comedy. I appreciate that the Oscar went to Alan Arkin because of his long time work. The rest of the family is a parody of the slight American folly that reality is something that can be massaged into one's beliefs. The true horror was watching the 'beauty pageant'. What a pathetic American invention. Plays good in the bible belt, but in 'real life' what are we setting our kids up for? Well done cast & crew. Hope people pay attention.
0385334206|1.0|I feel I must be missing something as there are so many positive reviews for this book. I did not even finish it. All of the reviews say it is smart and funny. I suppose I'm not bright enough and don't have the sense of humor it takes to appreciate this book. To me, it appears to be nonsensical stream of consciousness dribble. Just writing with no real clear direction or organization. I am a fan of Vonnegut's other works. Unfortunately, this one was not for me. I'm not sure what others saw in it that I didn't. Maybe they're just very loyal to Vonnegut. I don't know. I cannot recommend this book.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|Granted the movie was tense. Dennis Hopper was in his classic weirdness mode. That in itself does not make the whole movie. The movie itself, seemed to me, just another version of the 'Bourne' series, or one of the 'Law & Order' TV episodes. It is a great rental movie, but not a 'keeper'.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|I love Will Ferrell.  I'd love to see this DVD.  Unfortunately, the publisher of this disc has either upped the ante on DRM or has authored a defective disc.  Two different copies of this DVD would not *play* on any of THREE different DVD players in my household.  It actually CRASHES my Sony multi-disc DVD player, if you can imagine that.  As much as I love Will Ferrell, I can't countenance such disrespect for the consumer.  BOYCOTT this and all titles that choose to go outside the DVD spec in the interests of anit-piracy efforts.  To be clear, I did not attempt to rip or crack this disc in any way.  I only tried to watch it.  Three different players: Sony, Aiwa and my Mac.  Would not get past the jacket on two, crashes the Sony.  Sheesh!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Enough reviews. As a hard-bitten soul I can only say that I had tears in my eyes viewing this film. The most striking scene, to me, was the scale weighing money vs life. That'll stick with me for a lifetime. Folks who deny reality will, belatedly, realize the truth when their children suffer. Others who believe that as long as their lives won't be disrupted, and they can drive their gas hogs, they could care less. To them, a hearty f*ck you.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|This albun is amazing, i love Belinda sing in French, Avec Le Temps one of the best
B000H0MKOC|4.0|This movie may have fallen in appreciation and popularity in this tone-deaf society. But there are a few sane and aware individuals that realize we are being poisoned on a wholesale level and an intimate level by not only the tobacco industry, but by runaway capitalism. We have to take stock of ourselves as a nation and as individuals. Since when do profits trump life? We declare ourselves as a nation, loud and clear, to be 'pro-life' yet we become mute when we count our stock dividends. The sociopath in this movie may make us uncomfortable, but he is who we have become.
0393061310|5.0|While on a research trip to New Guinea in 1972, evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond was asked by a local politician - Yali, who had never left the island but had much curiosity about the world - why people of Euroasian dissent had much 'cargo', but his people did not. This question struck home to the author and ultimately led to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\\", an important book in understanding the development of human societies since the last ice age. To answer this question, Diamond looked at the broad factors of environment and geography on all of the regions of the world over the last 13,000 years.<br /><br />Near the end of the last ice age, around 11,000 B.C.E., all of humanity was organized into bands of pre-literate hunter-gathers that relied on stone tools. Over the next 10,500 or so years this changed. By 1492, when European colonization of the North and South America began in earnest, there were still large regions of the planet where hunter-gathers dominated the landscape - Australia, regions of sub-Saharan Africa, much of the Americas, and the islands of the Pacific. But, most of Eurasian societies had iron technology, state governments, standing armies, and quiet often fleets of sailing ships that were exploring the world. These facts became a driving force for Diamond over the next twenty-five years as he explored the answers, an exploration that led to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\".<br /><br />What Jared Diamond found was that much of the course of human history has been decided by the fate of the geography and environment each region's inhabitants were subject to. What fate led to a Eurasian dominance of the \\"modern\\" technology that existed around the middle of the last millennia? Agriculture and animal husbandry played a significant part in this story. Eurasia was the home to an inordinately disproportionate quantity of animals that were easier to domesticate such as the cow and the pig, as well as a large variety of plants that were easier to subdue and control.<br /><br />This head start in food production had its positive and negative effects on these burgeoning civilizations; but, even the negative side effects gave these societies an advantage. This new food supply led to a more hierarchical society that afforded some a leisure time that produced advances in technology and governmental systems and the development of writing and organized religion; but also created a system that oppressed much of the society. These advances often led to more warfare, which hardened these new states. Higher population densities led to new diseases, which, though devastating at times, led to immunity on a large scale.<br /><br />All of these factors led to the inevitable: expanding populations require more land and more resources. This need led to direct contact with areas of the world where societies without these 'advantages' were still operating quite successfully in bands of hunter-gatherers; or where infant civilizations with smaller subsets of these factors were growing and expanding. The rest is, as they say, history.<br /><br />Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" presents the progress of human civilizations into the modern world within the context of the land these societies occupied at the end of the last ice age; and, it systematically dismantles any racially or ethnically based theories of human history that have prevailed in the past. Throughout this study of the last 13,000 years, you will visit every corner of the world and learn what geographic and environmental factors played a part in the fate of the human societies that developed within the context each landscape; and you will understand the importance that guns, germs, and steel played in the course of all of human history.<br /><br />>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />A Guide to my Book Rating System:<br /><br />1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.<br />2 stars = Don't bother, cleanyour bathroom instead.<br />3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.<br />4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.<br />5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way.s = Good book, but not life altering.  5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way.
0786889284|2.0|I like Pearson. He is better at character development than Michael Connelly. But with this particular novel, there is too much time spent in character development. And there are several characters, old and new. As a result, the book is big and fat, and the story moves slowly.<br /><br />It is not until towards the end that Pearson writes that it seemed like the next 24 hours flew by. That was a signal to the reader that we were finally going to get some action. And still it dragged. You might want to pass on this one.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This film has bewitched me body and soul. I have now seen it 4 times and I can not wait to see again. The music, costumes, romance, scenery and of course the amazing acting by all the cast. Highly recommended.
0743496728|3.0|I am a big Jodi Picoult fan but I have been disappointed with several of her books since Salem Falls, especially The Tenth Circle.  When I read the advance reviews for this book, I thought it would be a return to the great plotting and writing of The Pact and Plain Truth.  I was only half right.  The writing is, as always, excellent.  However, if you have read any of Ms. Picoult's recent books, you will know where this one is going almost from the beginning of the story!  I know when an author finds a winning formula they stick with it, but I guess I just was expecting more and was ultimately disappointed.
0792846443|5.0|Taken from the Stephen King novel by the same name, Misery is a very gripping and entertaining movie which holds your interest the entire time. There are moments of humor and horror. Kathy Bates is the star here, and she was royally rewarded for her performance by winning an Oscar.     I've always been intrigued by the differences between movies and the books they originate from. Misery is no exception. Since I need an angle for my review, why don't I just simply tell some of the differences between movie and novel for those interested. (SPOILERS)    Movie (M)--Paul gets in the accident because of the blizzard.  Book (B)--Paul gets in the accident because he is drunk and in a blizzard.    M-After Paul wakes up in Annie's care, he immediately asks about his loved ones and why he isn't in a hospital.  B-Paul is afraid to ask because he immediately knows something is mentally wrong with Annie Wilkes.    M--Paul is mentally and emotionally tough.  B--Paul is weak and cries constantly; but gets stronger toward the end.    M--Paul has quit smoking, but smokes one cigarette after finishing each book.  B--Paul is still an active smoker, but oddly never craves a cigarette the entire time.    M--Paul has 2 broken legs and a dislocated shoulder from the accident.  B--He has 2 broken legs and a pelvic injury.    M--Paul has written 8 Misery novels  B--Paul has written 4 Misery novels    M--Annie is allowed to read Paul's new manuscript because she saved his life.  B--Annie coerces Paul into allowing her to read the manuscript by implying she won't give him his pain medicine.    M--The manuscript doesn't have a title.  B--The name of the manuscript is Fast Cars.    M--Annie coerces Paul into burning his manuscript by pouring lighting fluid on his bed.  B--She threatens not feed him or give him his pills until he burns the manuscript.    M--A sheriff spends the entire movie trying to find Paul.  B--There is no old sheriff, but 3 cops come to the house.    M--Annie is crazy.  B--Annie is crazier.    M--Paul sneaks out of his room twice; once to find a phone, to possibly escape, and to get medicine; and the next to read her scrap book and get a knife.  B--He sneaks out of his room 3 times; once to find a phone and possibly escape; second to get food and medicine and to read her scrap book; third to get the knife.    M--Paul discovers by reading Annie's scrapbook that she has killed patients while working as a nurse.  B--Paul discovers that Annie has killed patients, as well as some of her neighbors, her college roommate, her father, and one of her boyfriends.    M--Annie leaves him for a few hours whenever she's angry.  B--Annie leaves him for days on end.    M--Annie can tell Paul's been out of his room by her ceramic penguin facing a different direction.  B--Annie notices her things rearranged and the marks in the doorway from Paul's wheelchair; then she starts leaving her hair over things to know where he's been snooping.    M--Annie breaks both of Paul's ankles to keep him from leaving.  B--Annie cuts off his left foot and his left thumb on 2 separate occasions.     M--Paul starts saving his pills and tries to drug Annie when they have dinner.  B--Paul is afraid to try this; and instead keeps the pills as a reserve in case she leaves him without any.     M--They have dinner together in her dining room.  B--They never have dinner together, but she does take him out to sit on her porch and to watch M.A.S.H.    M--Paul writes Misery's Return then burns it.  B--Paul enjoys writing Misery's Return and saves the manuscript while burning scrap paper to trick Annie.    M--In the final confrontation, Annie trips over Paul's leg and hits her head on the typewriter; then he eventually kills her with some kind of statue.  B--Annie trips over the typewriter and hits her head on the edge of the mantel. Paul locks himself in the bathroom and sleeps as Annie eventually escapes through the bedroom window and dies in the barn while getting a chainsaw.M--At the end, Paul has written a new book that is receiving a lot of critical buzz.  B--Paul has writers' block, but finally begins writing a story that begins with a boy finding a skunk.    Bottom Line: Both movie and book are good.
0743298020|5.0|Oh this book!  The story of Vida Winter, the words and mood set by the author, and the mystery and fabulous characters offered by Setterfield absolutely captured me.  It has been a long, long time since I have read a book that I devoured like this one.  As I was reading I thought of at least a dozen friends, including my mother, who I know must read this. I purchased this book based on the reviews offered on this website.  Time after time reviewers commented on the Gothic similarity with Dickens and DuMaurier.  Gothic??  I wondered about that...Wondered if I would connect to it.  Oh, what a surprise, and oh, what a book!  Take your time, my friends.  Read it and love the language, love the mood, and love the story.  It is absolutely spectacular.  I too will read this one again, and maybe a third time, and I have never done that ever!
0861714911|5.0|Anybody interested in pursuing an understanding of Buddhism and Buddhist teachings can tell you how overwhelming it can be to try to sift through the religious texts. First of all, the Pali canon is quite huge, such that it would take a lifetime to read and absorb it all, and the printed versions of it (in Pali, there is still no complete English translation) are anywhere from 35 to 58 volumes. From this vast ocean of scripture Bhikkhu Bodhi effectively organizes it into chapters based on major points of doctrine. Each chapter has a few pages of Bhikkhu Bodhi's own interpretation and explanation, but the bulk of the book is devoted to the scripture. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to better understand Buddhism (including Mahayana Buddhism). As for those who are as intensely interested in Theravada Buddhism as I am, I would say that this book, along with a good translation of the Dhammapada, is essential.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Sure Disney has tackled magic storylines before: fire-breathing dragons, talking puppets and wish granting fairy godmothers but in many ways you can say Peter Pan is probably the most \\"Disney-esque\\" film. It's got magic, tons of it in fact, far off wondrous worlds and a villain you love to hate. While it does have some un-politically correct moments and our main hero almost seems a bit too abrasive, it's also a film where you find yourself surprised at just how quickly the film pulls you in. <br /> <br />Well we all know the story but might as well tell it: Peter Pan, an elfish-looking boy from the faraway Neverland visits Wendy, Michael and John Darling and takes them on a voyage to his world. There, they find mermaids, natives and evil pirate Captain Hook who hates Peter Pan, especially since he cut off Hook's hand and fed it and an alarm clock to a crocodile who wants to taste the rest of the captain. It's up to Peter Pan and his feisty pixie friend Tinkerbell to save Neverland. <br /> <br />What makes the film so endearing is just how much you don't even care about the childishness of some of its scenes. One scene I outright laughed at was the crocodile, with Hook caught in his mouth, actually slaps Hook's hand in order to get a better position to bite him. Then of course there's the line \\"we were only trying to drown her\\", a line so murderous but sounds oddly cute since it comes from a mermaid. The songs are so catchy, the animation cleaned up and while it's not as outwardly colorful like Bambi or ambitious like Sleeping Beauty, it's certainly a worthy effort and a top notch restoration as well. Then of course there's Tinkerbell who's probably one of the more instantly likable characters Disney has (better be since she's Disney DVD's spokesgirl) even though she tends to be insanely jealous and scheme-y. <br /> <br />As for its un-political correctness parts, well, it of course involves the use of aboriginal people which the film calls either red man, red skin,indian or injun. But worse of all is the use of the word \\"squaw\\" which I will tell you now: is highly offensive to native woman and I'd recommend you don't say it at all. However I will admit that the explanation for why native people say ugh is quite funny. Also one thing that I found surprising was just how different a hero Peter Pan was. There are times where he seems kind of insensitive to things such as saying Wendy getting picked on by the mermaids as \\"a little fun\\" and being brash. But then he is in Neverland, where you don't grow old, so I guess it's just his inner childishness at play. <br /> <br />This is one of those Disney films that you don't feel embarrassed that you're watching a children's movie. You can find yourself having just as much fun as the kids are or even if you don't even have any kids, you'll still have fun.
0671578855|5.0|Imagine if Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer could have collaborated to set a comic romance in a \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" setting with a hint of \\"The West Wing\\" thrown in and you have an idea what this side-splittingly funny book is like.         The Miles Vorkosigan series of adventures is a strong contender for the description of the most amusing comedy science fiction series ever written. This is the ninth Miles Vorkosigan adventure, and in my opinion the funniest book in the series.     It is slightly different from the other nine books in the series - the first eight and the last one all have elements of action adventure, mystery and detection. This one, on the other hand, can best be understood as a \\"Regency Romance\\" style farce set several hundred years in the future on a planet which in some ways is used to high technology and in others is a quasi-feudal militaristic Empire. In other words, it mimics the style, and has a very similar plot, to the popular genre of romantic novels set in Georgian England during the \\"Regency\\" period in the early 19th century.    The Miles Vorkosigan stories, and four other books set in the the same future universe, can stand on their own. However, a number of them, of which this is one, will give you something extra if you have previously read some of Bujold's books set earlier on the same timeline.     If you have not previously met Lord Miles Vorkosigan, he is      1) a brilliant intriguer who at one stage was juggling at least three identities;   2) physically very small, having been injured in his mother's womb by poison gas;   3) a former spy for Imperial Barrayan security, former mercenary admiral and present \\"Imperial Auditor\\";   4) desperately trying to find a wife; and   5) hysterically funny to read about.     The book is set in the run-up to the wedding of Miles' cousin, the Emperor, which is shown on the front cover. The handsome, tall man on the cover with his bride is Emperor Gregor, and not the hero of the stories, Lord Miles Vorkosigan. Miles is neither tall nor handsome, but he makes up for it in other ways - some of the time, anyway.    Several other people are thinking about love and marriage, including Miles himself, as he is very much in love with Ekaterin who he met in the previous book, \\"[[ASIN:B00208FOL0 KOMARR]]\\".     Miles' friend Duv Galeni, his clone-brother Mark, and his cousin Ivan also have their own romantic plans, and their various romantic intrigues collide not only with each other, but with the ambitions of various scheming nobles who are fighting over the inheritance of two titles, the plans of Ekaterin's idiotic relatives, and the attempts to do their job of two luckless Escobarran policemen.     At one point, Miles' mother Cordelia has to sort out the angry parents of Miles' childhood friends the Koudelka sisters. If you want to understand some of the references here, you will have to read the story of how the previous generations of Vorkosigans and Koudelkas got together, which can be found in the books \\"[[ASIN:1886778205 Shards of Honor]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0743468414 Barrayar (Vorkosigan)]].\\" These two books have been published individually, and also together in one volume as \\"[[ASIN:1607519569 Cordelia's Honor (Shards of Honor & Barrayar)]]\\".     Sound complicated? It is. That's why there is a lot to be said for reading these stories in sequence. Having said that, you can read this book on its own and it is still funny.     The full sequence of books in this Universe is     \\"[[ASIN:B000ZFYJQG Falling Free]]\\" (set 200 years before Miles is born)     The story of the romance between Miles' parents:   \\"Shards of Honour\\"   \\"Barrayar\\"   (Published in one volume as \\"Cordelia's Honour\\")    The Miles Vorkosigan adventures:     \\"[[ASIN:1886778272 The Warrior's Apprentice]]\\"   \\"[[ASIN:0671720147 The Vor Game]]\\"   \\"[[ASIN:1886778590 Borders of Infinity]]\\"   \\"[[ASIN:0671877011 Cetaganda]]\\"   \\"Brothers in Arms\\"   \\"Mirror Dance\\"   \\"Memory\\"   \\"Komarr\\"   \\"A Civil Campaign\\"   \\"Diplomatic Immunity\\"     And a separate adventure for Miles' friend Elli Quinn:   \\"[[ASIN:067165604X Ethan of Athos]]\\"     All these books are excellent and strongly recommended.
B000M341QE|5.0|Martin Scorcese is the most overrated, overly hyped, highly praised director living today. And, for what? Well, I'll tell you: It's for his latest film, \\"The Departed\\"! He did once make some really great films, like \\"Mean Streets\\", \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\", \\"Taxi Driver\\", \\"The Color of Money\\", and \\"Goodfellas\\". But, that's been over 15 years ago. \\"Casino\\" was alright, but it was just an attempt at remaking \\"Goodfellas\\". And, films like \\"Gangs of New York\\", \\"Bringing Out the Dead\\", and \\"The Aviator\\" were just atrocious. His remake of \\"Cape Fear\\" was good, but nowhere near as great as he used to be.<br /><br />But, lo and behold, Marty has remade another film, \\"Infernal Affairs\\", and made himself a new classic that he deserved every accolade thrown his way for. He definetly deserved the Best Director award at the Academy Awards for this. For all of you people who praise Scorcese like he's God, well, I have to say you're right on this one. This is an extremely deep and profound and intense fast paced masterpiece of modern cinema that will leave you utterly breathless in practically every scene. And, it is rich with irony! Especially the plot of having, not one, but two moles, each one on a different side than the other. Brilliant storytelling at its best! I just didn't like that a certain character got killed in the end that should have lived, but that's not going to taint my judgement of this great film.<br /><br />Scorcese is on fire here, making quick cuts left and right, entering scenes through a circle point of view, cutting back and forth between scenes and characters, past and present, and using an extremely terrific soundtrack to boost the film along like a freight train to H*ll. This kicks people like Tarantino back into Kindergarden!! This is possibly the best crime thriller genre film that I've seen in years.<br /><br />Everybody in the film is perfect for their roles, and their performances all shine through. This isn't near as gory as a lot of people make it out to be. It is violent, but no more so than any of Coppolla's \\"Godfather\\" films, and even less so than Scorcese's own \\"Goodfellas\\". Marty really out did himself with this one. He is the King!! Here's to hoping that he will stay on this winning streak of making great films again, instead of having to wait another 15 years. Thank you.t to be. It is violent, but no more so than any of Coppolla's \\"Godfather\\" films, and even less so than Scorcese's own \\"Goodfellas\\". Marty really out did himself with this one.

B000003TA4|3.0|I'm sorry, I know Im gonna get flamed for this but it is my opinion. <br />Nirvana is by far one of the most dangerously overrated bands of all time. sorry its true. when i read in magazines readers poll top 50 guitar players of all time lists and kurt cobain is listed as number one? It is mind boggling!!! Jimmy page, Stevie ray vaghn, richie blackmoore, angus young, carlos santana? stevie vai, tonni iommi, dave murry, adrian smith, damn, even kirt hemit. i can go on for ages listing players that can play circles around kurt cobain. and one of the most brilliant songwriters of all time? its not that hard to write songs that are only 1-3 choreds people.  <br />People say that nirvana saved rock? I guess thats a matter of taste. I personally think they were the originators of the \\"hey they made millions of dollars off that sound, lets do the same thing\\" era of rock. and NO they did not start grunge. Pearl Jam was before them, and In my opinion eddie vedar was more talented than kurt. <br />I'm not trying to just bash your band cause im a hater or anything. i'm not trying to say nirvana is the worst thing since New Coke. Im just sick of hearing everyone talkin about them like they are the greatest thing around. they are not. they had some nice catchy tones that were easy to listen to on the radio. enjoyable to listen to. yeah they made it big time and had a huge following. good for them. it is too bad kurt decided to end it all like he did, cause he could have had a hell of a career. and yes dave grohl is a damn good drummer.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Albums come and go like friends who move in next door and are gone within a year's time, leaving you a 10-digit number that hibernates in your cell phone. The way fads age like raw meat in a greenhouse: At the time, in your tiny universe of one, it feels like just the thing to clutter that void, but surfacing 10 years later merely reminds you how inadequate the quality of life was when your biggest concern was not, say, whether or not George W. and gang actually hand over the reins when their time is up, but whether that new haircut in which your hairline arches over your eartops will get Suzie Hotpants to give you that wanton look you've been fantasizing about by the bucketloads. But I digress. A good sign that you've found the genuine article is when each successive song sounds better than the last, and once the disc is done, you do it all over again. Horses transcend the Iron and Wine and My Morning Jacket comparisons. Ben Bridwell could be crooning about what's on the back of a box of cereal and I wouldn't mind. He's like a rare, boisterous bird and he makes it seem easy. Horses is appealing in the same way as Coldplay: soothing, melodic, gigantic. Say Rick Davies from Supertramp came out from under a rock and fronted Superchunk; that's the best way I can describe this quirky brand of brooding magic.
0743289684|5.0|It is the bold testimonials from victims of Islamic terror such as this one by Ayaan Hirsi Ali that we must pay attention to with utmost vigilance. It is sad to see yet again that the acceptance of everything through multiculturalism is trumping the precious rights that we hold dear here in the West. Instead of sticking up for the rights of Muslim women in the Netherlands, leftist governments continue to ignore what they are accepting into their societies: the excessively violent mistreatment of Muslim women in Islamic society, and the refusal of many immigrants to accept the values and way of life in their newfound countries. <br /> <br />This book is one that you will not be able to put down; being lengthy and yet interesting at the same time. In this fascinating testimonial, Ayaan gives you a detailed description of her life in a part of the world that most of us are unfamiliar with. In Somalia, life was tough with perpetual conflicts and civil war. Growing up, she was influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood, and became quite religious herself. She experienced the Muslim Brotherhood gaining power from the secular government by indoctrinating its constituency with radical Islamic philosophy, and eventually telling them to reject evil and immoral secular governments, and accept one that is governed by Sharia (Islamic) law. <br /> <br />Ayaan began to question their ideology when she arrived in Holland and realized that what she had been taught as a child, that Westerners were completely immoral and evil, was not accurate by any means. She found that the Netherlands was quite stable. Unfortunately this changed when she decided to make a short film with filmmaker Theo van Gogh about the horrific treatment of Muslim women in Islamic societies. Theo was murdered by being shot and then stabbed several times by a Muslim immigrant from Morocco in broad daylight. Subsequently Ayaan had to be put under police supervision from the amount of death threats she was receiving fromthe Islamist community about the movie. <br /> <br />Aside from exposing the vicious treatment of Muslim women, Ayaan started to question her own Islamic beliefs. She hated the fact that when she heard Osama Bin Laden or jihadists speak of killing people, she would find their justification from exactly where they said it was from: the Qur'an. As well, Ayaan criticizes the overt tolerance of this behavior by the Dutch government through the ambiguous concept of 'multiculturalism' and how it is creating an ungovernable parallel society. Since Ayaan now resides in the United States, she warns Americans that this could very well happen in the US as well, and that they should all be proud of their values and heritage.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book is not winning praise in the Islamic community for discussing imperative issues in it. Instead of leading to open discussion, it has led to insults thrown at Ayaan such as \\"bigot,\\" \\"Muslim-basher,\\" \\"islamophobe,\\" and \\"traitor\\" just to name a few. <br /> <br />Well written, definitely out of the ordinary, and even disturbing at times, Infidel is not only a must read, but a wakeup call from a victim of outrageous intolerance. Not only a wakeup call for everyone, but also a call for Western governments to take a critical look at the multiculturalism that is allowing this to compromise Western values that are supposed to protect the rights of the individual.
B00002DE2L|3.0|It's easy to get used to listening to near-perfect recordings and performances of The Four Seasons.  With so many recordings available, you can have your pick of styles.<br /><br />I remember confidently ordering tickets for a local group's performance of The Four Seasons in Salzburg one summer.  How could I go wrong?  The performance started off in fine fashion.  The soloist was huge, confident, and energetic.  The rest of the group was solid and enthusiastic.  But after about 12 minutes, the soloist began to come apart at the seams.  He couldn't complete the difficult sections in Summer.  The group would restart and restart.  I was fascinated.<br /><br />I had almost forgotten that experience when I first listened to this recording.  Such violin soloist flubs are unknown in the mature Anne-Sophie Mutter's recordings.  But I was astonished to find that her supporting cast of Trondheim Soloists (led by Bjarne Fiskum and including soloists Byvind Gimse, and Knut Johannesen) was apparently playing a different piece, and not very well.  Ms. Mutter is also credited as conductor.  I suspect that she should have scheduled many more practices.<br /><br />The recording also has moments when another take would have been in order.<br /><br />But I learned something valuable from listening to Ms. Mutter soar about the muddled noise:  It matters who else is playing with you for The Four Seasons.<br /><br />If you are an Anne-Sophie Mutter fan (as I am), you'll undoubtedly want to listen to this CD.  But I think you'll be more pleased if you limit yourself to the first allegro from Spring from The Four Seasons for 3 minutes and 36 seconds during which the Trondheim Soloists perform okay in the Simply Anne-Sophie CD.  Good editing choice there.<br /><br />I graded Anne-Sophie's playing as a five, the recording quality as a four, and the Trondheim Soloists as a 1.
B000002VC5|5.0|Yes, still relevant after all these years and well worth adding to your CD collection to replace that dusty LP.  If you are too young to know what an LP is, then you should buy this disk to find out what good music is about.  Alan Parsons is a giant in the music industry (albeit mostly as producer), and this is unquestionably the Project's finest hour.
0141888210|3.0|Some very interesting case studies.  Some very obvious (not so interesting) case studies.  Decent writing.  Overall, worth the read (or, as in my case, the listen-to).  In the past, I have enjoyed Gladwell's writing in the New Yorker Magazine.  Blink is like several NYM pieces strung together, not fully satisfying for the stringing, but entertaining enough, and occasionally thought-provoking.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Forget sack cloth and ashes, crises of conscience, suffering, The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come or giving all your worldly goods to the poor.  These days, all any rich, cold hearted bastard needs do to reclaim his humanity is inherit a French chateau with a vinyard. <br /> <br />That is, evidently, the premise of this slight, very slight slice of French custard, well...not really French.  It dabbles in Frenchness here and there, the way the English percieve it...sort of. <br /> <br />If you can wipe your mind clear of any kind of critical thought while watching this trifle, it is just barely entertaining enough for a pleasantly numbing experience particularly if you drinking a couple of glasses of wine as well.

B000LXH0AE|3.0|I really loved this movie. Each of the actors gave a phenomenal performance and the plot was wonderful. I did however have some problems with the actual DVD itself. Like other reviewers that posted comments, I was frustrated with the fact that the DVD got hung up several times. I don't have a Sony, I actually have a fairly new Sanyo (gasp!) DVD player and this is the 1st time I've had these problems. I'm not tech-savvy so I thought that it might be my player, but once I saw the other reviews with similar experiences I realized it was the DVD.  <br />If it wasn't for the DVD troubles, I would have given this movie 4 stars. The movie itself was excellent. It was nice to see Will Ferrell get a little more serious (I still love silly Will Ferrell) and he did a fine job in this movie. Of course in my opinion, anything that Maggie Gyllenhal is in is great.
B000002J03|5.0|British blues, which began to gather steam in the early '60s with Alexis Korner, John Mayall and others, reached a pinnacle in 1969 upon the release of LED ZEPPELIN II.

B000002I2M|4.0|This sixth ELEKTRA records release by the DOORS quartet was their best since STRANGE DAYS, and as it turned out, the group's last hurrah with front man Jim Morrison.<br /><br />The set's opener, \\"The Changeling,\\" shows most clearly the self-inflicted wear and tear Morrison had endured over five years. \\"Love Her Madly,\\" \\"L.A. Woman\\" and \\"Riders On The Storm\\" were legitimate hits-- \\"Hyacinth House\\" is also excellent. Despite the gushing of diehard fans, what's left over here is somewhat ordinary. But that was always the pattern with this group-- they'd astound everyone with a classic like \\"Riders\\" and then bewilder us with the march-beat laden \\"L'America.\\" The full-sounded musicality of \\"Hyacinth House\\" would be offset by a dragging, bareboned \\"Cars Hiss By My Window.\\"<br /><br />From 1967 to '71, the DOORS had undergone many stylistic shifts. At any given moment they could be Top 40 hitmakers, psychedelic wordsmiths, political heralds, frothy pop artists, and here, a blues-grunge band. It's hard to imagine what else these guys would have created had Morrison lived. L.A. WOMAN seems as fitting an au revoir as any. One thing is certain: you didn't know what was coming next from the DOORS, and it's too bad we were never destined to find out.<br /><br />TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 48:42

1881273156|5.0|The book is designed for couples -- to bring them closer together. But I have found the information especially useful in a workplace setting.  <br /> <br />Dr. Chapman, a marriage counselor with over 30 years of experience, suggests that there are five primary ways people experience feeling loved. They are: <br /> <br />    * Physical Touch <br />    * Quality Time <br />    * Acts of Service <br />    * Gifts <br />    * Words of Affirmation <br /> <br />Physical Touch people feel loved when they are in physical contact with others -- hugs, pats on the back, sex. In a workplace setting, Physical Touch people must be very, very careful... but if you supervise someone who is \\"touchy-feely\\", you may find a literal pat on the back may do wonders for his performance. <br /> <br />Quality Time folks like spending one-on-one time with another person. They will make time for you, and like when you make time for them. People motivated by Acts of Service will do things for you. At home, these are people who fold and put away your laundry. Or do your dishes. Or get your car inspected, or your tires rotated. In the office, these folks might offer to get you lunch while they get their own. Or bring you a package from the front desk they just happened to spot. <br /> <br />Although we'd like to think that Gifts are restricted to small blue boxes from Tiffany's, Gifts can be as small as a cookie from a favorite restaurant, or a souvenir from a trip. Gifts people like knowing you were thinking of them when you were apart. Finally, people motivated by Words of Affirmation need to be told that they are valued and appreciated. <br /> <br />Dr. Chapman says that often we speak to others using our own Love Language -- which may or may not be relevant to the other person. This is how relationships get in trouble -- I tell you you're wonderful because I'm a Words of Affirmation person, and it means absolutely nothing to you because you're an Acts of Service person. \\"Sweet words are nice,but what have you done for me lately\\" might be the response. <br /> <br />Many troubled marriages, suggests Chapman, could be saved if only the partners would speak each other's Love Language. When you consider how many women report that their husbands never \\"do anything around the house\\" -- they're expressing their Acts of Service orientation -- and how many men complain that they don't get enough sex -- they're expressing their Physical Touch leanings -- the concept of speaking Love Languages to each other becomes very clear. <br /> <br />Wouldn't it be fascinating to consider that the difficult boss you struggle with could be transformed - - if you just started speaking to him in his Love Language? Do a few Acts of Service, and diffuse the tension. Give him some Words of Affirmation and get him off your back.... <br /> <br />Dr. Chapman's main point is that if you speak the other person's Love Language rather than your own, you will fill up their \\"Love Tank\\" -- increasing their attachment and regard for you -- and create a happier, healthier relationship. <br /> <br />I have to tell you that this really works. It works with partners, children, parents, siblings, friends and co-workers. Many people have a primary language as well as a secondary one -- make it your business to know the Love Language of those important to you, as well as your own, and you will greatly increase your life satisfaction.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|When I was six, I played \\"Peter Pan\\" in my living room, jumping from sofa to chair, back to sofa, pretending to be the boy who would never grow up. On the stereo, I played the Disney soundtrack, and I knew all of the songs by heart. It was a feast for my imagination, and a cherished memory I shall never forget. These memories stir deep with the new release of Peter Pan on DVD from the wonderful folks at Disney.<br /><br />Peter Pan takes the well loved tale from the ingenious mind of J. M. Barrie, and puts the usual Disney spin on events, to make a memorable movie. The boy who never grew up flies to London to visit Wendy and her brothers to retrieve a lost shadow. Mayhem ensues when the brood wakes up, and quickly follows Pan to Neverland.<br /><br />I purchased the 1999 release of this movie on DVD, and I must say this new version far surpasses the quality of the first. The colors are more vivid, the soundtrack brighter and richer. It's a beautiful new transfer, and one well worth your money. The additional features shed light on the Disney creative process it took to make this movie. One special feature touched me: a Virtual Peter Pan flight. As you fly with Peter, he narrates a quick trip over London to Neverland. It didn't last long enough, but I loved it! With some other new features, kid friendly DVD games, and videos, this new set will make for a wonderful family night!<br /><br />There is a reason why, when you go to the Disney parks, there is an hour plus wait for \\"The Peter Pan Flight\\". Why not buy this movie, and see what the fuss is all about!
1931559317|5.0|I am an active amateur astronomer with several star atlases. I bought this atlas almost a year ago, and I have ended up using it more than any of my other atlases. The format is compact and convenient, it points out the major sky features very well (even providing outlines of larger nebulae), and is a great complement to a medium- to small-sized telescope. I even find this atlas makes interesting bed-time reading, helping familiarize myself with the locations of objects that I haven't commonly observed in the past, like carbon stars (cool, deep-red stars that are particularly beautiful in a low-power star field). The atlas is quite sturdy and has held up well. My only quibble is that in the edition that I have, there are a few small areas (roughly a half-inch in diameter) on a few of the maps that are blanked out, as if a small piece of scrap paper were in the way during printing. I believe this error may affect many or most copies of the first edition, but I am not certain about that.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a great show! Never really saw this before. I guess I have been working too much. Saw the movie 'Serenity' first. Don't do that! Get the complete series, then watch the movie, trust me! That's the way to go! This is so much fun too watch. Funny, Thrilling, Cheesy, great the way the characters interact, and come from all walks of life. All the chicks are babes. Kind of a western in space. I know, I know, but it really does work. Not looking forward to the series ending, but I am looking forward to watching the movie again, after I have seen the entire series. You'll love it. It is a very cool show.
B000J4QWMC|2.0|Turn the volume down and watch it.<br /><br />The movie is a great piece of cinematography.  I'm afraid Michael Mann is starting to lose his writing and storytelling skills, however.  It seems that with each passing feature, Mann is more concerned with the choreography of the visual and not so concerned with the actual substance:<br /><br />\\"How fast does that boat go?\\"<br /><br />\\"It goes very fast.\\"<br /><br />Wow!!<br /><br />'Miami Vice' is a improbable film that has more holes in it than a practice green.  Pancho and Lefty go deep undercover to try and corral the narcotics operation that is taking over South America, Latin America and South Beach.  They somehow win the trust of this billion dollar operation in the course of four minutes and begin trafficking the nose blow for the bad guys.<br /><br />That isn't good enough, however.  It seems the DEA and FBI didn't know that the organization they were after is simply a tiny apartment in a 40 story complex.  of course, Tom and Jerry need to go after the kingpin, for some odd reason (and a reason that is never resolved by the end of the film).  Maybe it's because it gives us an additional hour and a half to hear Colin Ferrell talk like Dr. Phil with a voice box.<br /><br />There is a needless love story between one of the worst, most over dramatized performances in recent memory (Farrell) and a even worse performance (a Asian woman who sounds like Ch Chi Rodriguez).  It offers very little, aside from nausea, to the drawn out story.<br /><br />The one gift it does give us is laughter as the two of them take a speed boat from South America to Cuba, for crying out loud...all for a cocktail and some Lambada.  I didn't realize the Ocean was as smooth as Lake Okeechobee until I watched this.<br /><br />'Miami Vice' is 2 Stars (rating) worth of visual.  Michael Mann hasn't lost his eyesight and composition skills.  I'm afraid he's forgotten that dialogue and storytelling are a little more important when making a major motion picture.nt when making a major motion picture.

B000MM0L2S|1.0|Anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing the maestro in action with his orchestra will know how his music touches the soul.

These \\"cover versions\\" don't come close in my opinion and putting words to \\"Deborahs Theme\\" from Once Upon A Time in America is a crime in my opinion.

0385340540|3.0|The 1st 2 chapters are great, the last 2 chapters are great.  But the middle 30 are a monotonous tour of Italy.  Cut this book in half & you would have a fantastic short story.  Joel Backman's intriguing character keeps you turning the pages of an otherwise boring novel.

B000FA57US|3.0|With a very shocking and plot twisting HalloweeN 4 ending.  The producer of HalloweeN 4 seeing that the movie was #1 for two weeks at the box office decided to make a sequal to 4.  The Revenge Of Micheal Myers sounds good until you notice this is not the same Myers from 4.  Note the mask difference as soon as he escapes the mine explosion.  With the last Micheal Myers being small in stature (using hockey equipment to look buff up).  They hired a actor who not only taller but is a stunt man.  The mask is too long. Most of all why on earth would you kill off Rachel so easily?  I mean how many people who are smart in horror films ending up getting killed?  Her death was too early in the film to begin with.  Once again Danielle Harris does a great job renewing her role as Jamie.  Her acting is well scripted with the \\"luandry chute* scene she did it herself.  Shows how devoted she was to her role.  When HalloweeN 9 or 1 comes later this year once again Danielle will be in HalloweeN.  The mysterious guy in boots was never answered until it was confirmed the actor who played who also did Myers in this film had no idea why.  Overall the movie was good to watch until they killed Rachel and the finale with a echoing Harries yelling \\"no\\" with a disappointing HalloweeN 6 to followed.  Evil never dies is what I see from Micheal Myers no matter what people do he will be back in one way or another.

1582701709|4.0|I really liked The Secret (both the book and DVD, though I'm more of a visual person so the DVD is one I watch again and again). I agree with the Law of Attraction, but I also think that anyone reading The Secret should read something like Byron Katie's Loving What Is and inquire on it. The two can fit together well, but on its own, The Secret may disappoint those can't seem to manifest their intention ... Tony Robbins also has a good perspective on this, too. But The Secret is definitely a good place to start!
B000003TA4|4.0|If you want to call it groundbreaking, go ahead.  Nirvana came into the music industry an underdog and showed exactly what kind of flow you need to make it in the biz.  Minimal chords and catchy melodies make Nevermind a classic.  Nirvana did more with four chords than Motley Crue did with 100 leads and licks.  So why is Nevermind such a model for the industry?  Your about to find out why. <br /> <br />\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" wasn't even supposed to be the hit. \\"Come As You Are\\" was supposed to be.  Nirvana and DGC figured they would release a more aggressive song first.  When \\"Teen Spirit\\" was released, there really wasn't much of a buzz right off the bat.  It just kinda seemed overnight.  I woke up one morning and \\"Teen Spirit\\" was everywhere.  When you really listen to the song you can feel Kurt Cobain's voice in the room.  Never has any artist come out and said \\"here we are now, entertain us\\".  That same voice can also be heard on pretty much every other song on the album.  \\"Lounge Act\\", \\"Lithium\\", and \\"Drain You\\" are testaments of Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohl.  The pounding of \\"Drain You\\" and the mellow-to-hard \\"Lithium\\" show the band's real side.   <br /> <br />The other singles, \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\", paint a nice picture of that Nirvana sound.  Meanwhile, \\"Territorial Pissings\\" and \\"Breed\\" are the reason why Nirvana sold records.  \\"Stay Away\\" and \\"On A Plain\\" keep the Nirvana flow going through the album.  \\"Polly\\" is the song that every Nirvana fan has grown to love.  When played live or in studio, \\"Polly\\" always sounds great.  The album ender, \\"Something In The Way\\", is sad, yet makes you want to just drift away into nirvana.  And for those of you who haven't heard the hidden track \\"Endless Nameless\\", you better.  You can heard Cobain smash his guitar at around 19:32.  Its quite remarkable what sounds Cobain can make. <br /> <br />The reason I gave the album 4 stars is because it is not Nirvana's best work. Listen toIn Utero and you'll see why it is their best work.  You can truly have a place in your heart for this album if you appreciate good rock music. Nevermind has a place in history and for the 12 tracks that are on the album.  There is a reason why it is a masterpiece. <br />
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great sound, especially the bass. The sound insulation is very impressive, when the speakers are put together, you cannot hear any noise coming out unless you're really blasting the music. The cord is very well designed. It is thick enough that you aren't going to damage anything if you accidentally roll over it in your chair, and the coiled design makes it great for moving around. They are also extremely comfortable, and dont make my ears hurt or hot. I have a large head, and you can jack these out to fit even the largest head, yet they still fit snugly on my small-headed room mate. Fantastic headphones, I recommend them to everyone.
B00009V7T2|5.0|a breath of fresh air! a couple years ago, just when everything is sounding the same, this album enters my life. i am still listening to it weekly and would recommend it anyone looking for something different. track 6!<br /><br />*frances the mute is also something worth checking out.
0743496728|5.0|I was curious to read this book as I have enjoyed most of Picoult's other novels except her recent the 10th Circle which I was really disappointed with. <br /> <br />I am pleased to say she is well back on form with this latest novel.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down.  It brings up some very sensitive but very real issues of today's society and the struggle that both teenagers and parents can have. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend 19 minutes to anyone who enjoys Picoult's novels.
B0000062FL|5.0|...other than the two Gregg Rolie tracks, anyway. I always thought Santana was a world-class guitarist with a stellar backing band who made several good albums, but never anything excellent. Other than Abraxas, anyway. Now, I found myself begging for mercy on the two Gregg Rolie vocal tracks (Mother's Daughter, Hope You're Feeling Better) - hey buddy, shut the #!@% up and play your organ! And don't step on Santana, either. And the group lacked a quality lyricist at this point - only Rolie, who of course WROTE Mother's Daughter and Hope You're Feeling Better - brainless lyrics and all. Okay, no more dissing Rolie, because that'll take away from the main intent of this review. Abraxas is awesome-and-a-half, off the power of the subliminally beautiful Samba Pa' Ti, killer jam Oye Como Va (my favorite Santana song), fusion pieces Singing Winds Crying Beasts and Incident at Neshabur, and especially the ever-popular Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen, exquisite Latin blues thanks to Santana's leads, which sparkle. There's a lot of jamming here, but it's tight and focused - nothing runs longer than five-and-a-half minutes. And hey, these guys had the Latin/rock/funk/blues/jazz/whatever-else-came-their-way groove DOWN. So be sure to buy this if Santana does anything for you, since this is easily the best thing to bear the Santana name. The debut, III, Caravanesari and Love, Devotion, Surrender shouldn't be missed either.
B000JVT1U0|3.0|The Wicker man is a low-budget horror film set in a remote Scottish island in the 1970's.  The story begins when a Christian fundamentalist policeman (Woodward) is sent to investigate the mysterious dissapearance of a young child.<br /><br />Upon his arrival at the island, the policeman discovers a Neo-Pagan society which indulges in practices utterly repugnant to his Christian sensibilities, from worship of idols to bizarre sexual rituals and magic.<br /><br />Suspecting a dark conspiracy involving murder, witchcraft and human sacrifice, Woodward pushes his investigation to a dark conclusion and horrifying surprise twist at the end.<br /><br />The biggest weakness of the film is that it is not convincing either in its plot or premise.  It reads like a bad Jack Chick cartoon and is laughable, especially when Woodward meets the key villain, Lord 'Summerisle' who is at the heart of the conspiracy.  Even when the plot twist is revealed, it is laughable to think any community (no matter how religious) would engage in such a ridiculous practice to deal with something as commonplace as drought and crop failure, especially in a modern advanced society.<br /><br />The film does have some genuinely frightening parts but it generally fails to capitalise on the spooky premise.
B000022TSW|5.0|<br />I was a huge South Park fan when it was first unleashed onto television screens in the late 90's.  Along the way, I stopped watching, being distracted by more mundane things.  Recently, I've regained my sanity and have returned to the little town in Colorado.  My first task was to pick up the world famous theatrical treatment of the series.  I'd heard it was funny.  I'd heard it was a musical.  I'd heard that it raised the bar for South Park and Matt Stone and Trey Parker never looked back. <br /> <br />I think its safe to say those are all correct statements.  This film combined with the hilarious Team America: World Police are two of the funniest movies I've seen.  From a script point of view the film is filled with the satirical, sarcastic, foul and hilarious humor that South Park is known for.  Matt and Trey are equal opportunity offenders.  No one is spared and it makes the movie that much funnier.  Combined with the great script are the incredibly funny musical numbers; each one just as amusing as the last one.  Sure \\"Blame Canada\\" got all the attention, but what about Satan's little number \\"Up there\\" or \\"It's Easy, MMMKay\\". <br /> <br />The animation is pure South Park with a bit of a budget boost.  Most of the best animation occurs in hell.  The rest is just what you expect of South Park (and the movie even makes fun of that fact).  The voice acting is also typical of the series, but with a few guests to stir things up.  Some you may recognize and others will give you a big chuckle when you see the end credits.   <br /> <br />This movie is comedic gem.  It never lets up, it offends and inspires all at the same time.  It's like some of the best episodes they've done, only bigger, longer and uncut.  Some people may find it too much, but hey, they can always blame Canada. <br /> <br />For a great double feature, team this with Team America: World Police, or with Mike Judge's Idiocracy.  For a more ironic twist follow this film up with the intriguing documentary, This film is Not Yet Rated.
B0007P3582|1.0|If you're looking for good Aftermath-produced or G-Unit affiliated music, here's which artists to go to and which to stay far, far away from: <br /> <br /> <br />50 Cent-- Go nowhere near The Massacre. You're 5% more likely to suffer a slow, painful death just by touching the case. It is the worst CD you could possibly ever hear. Same thing goes with the movie soundtrack. <br /> <br />Get Rich or Die Tryin (the original) on the other hand, is solid... especially on those bonus tracks (Heaven, Life on the Line, U Not Like Me), Patiently Waiting, 21 Questions, and anything featuring another G-Unit member. PIMP, with its lack of Snoop Dogg (which the music video seemed to promise), High All the Time, Many Men, and Wanksta can kind of get old though. <br /> <br />The thing about 50 Cent these days is that by himself he is no longer any good at all. He needs to be held up by a crutch of some better rapper before he can make good with his own rap. The reason he succeeds so well in his collaborations with The Game in The Documentary and Eminem in The Re-Up is because he has actually GOOD rappers holding him up. He's like the Abbott of the comedians Abbott & Costello now. He has nothing worth contributing without his Costello of some kind to be there for him. <br /> <br /> <br />The Game-- As soon as I heard this guy's album and compared it to 50's Massacre, I knew that if G-Unit was going anywhere, this guy would be the one to take it there. And now it turns out he left. Can't blame him when the clique-label's leader is so dumb. Was the most progressive rapper of the crew, and his reason for leaving is probably because of how anti-progressive 50's Massacre was. Has the best, deepest subject matter within his songs, if not the best flow (Although his underground 300 Bars song would automatically crown him king if he did that well all the time on his main albums). As far as the mainstream and not underground CDs go though, I'd give him a 2nd best for flow of the G-Unit crew.<br /> <br />His Documentary album has been called the third Chronic, and has the best of Dre's beats you'll find on any G-Unit CD. Criticisms are that he name-drops Dre & NWA a bit too much, but overall, I think it's not that big of a deal. He's a big hip-hop history fan, and he's still a little starstruck over the chance of being able to work with Dre. Given a very brief profile of the rapper, he fits into an uncomfartable stereotype, (average-looking rapper from Compton who's been shot a few times), but he immediately carves a personality of his own in the Doctor's Advocate and his even better The Documentary. <br /> <br /> <br />Young Buck-- I'd say probably the best G-Unit member still in G-Unit. This guy has the best flow, as far as mainstream CDs are concerned. He also seems to be the 2nd-most concerned about the world (a.k.a. 'progressive'), with references to the Illuminati amongst other secret organizations. I like this guy the best of the remaining G-Unit. 2nd best comes sort of close to him, but still doesn't match Buck's raw skills. <br /> <br />Lloyd Banks-- This guy is second best. His flow skills somewhat tie for 2nd place with The Game's, or at least land in that area. He, Buck, and The Game are my top three for G-Unit (even though The Game's not G-Unit anymore). Anybody else you can probably pass up. I'll go over them real quick just to make sure you know who the others are beforehand.  <br /> <br /> <br />Tony Yayo-- The one male member who is worse than 50 Cent. In the G-Unit CD, they always shouted 'Free Yayo!' and now he is free. The G-Unit had done a terrible thing by campaigning for his release. His is of no benefit whatsoever to them. He might even be responsible for the gradual dumbening of 50's style & outlook on life. <br /> <br /> <br />Joe-- The kind of R&B star you'd expect to sing chorus or backup on an Outkast track, mixed with a bit of R. Kelley and a very small splash of Stevie W. He's not bad I guess. I hated him completely on 'Wanna Get to Know You' of the G-Unit CD, but would definitely still listen to his 'Ride Wit U' track off his own solo album. <br /> <br /> <br />Olivia-- Pssh, are you dumb? No. She's partially responsible for Candy Shop. That should be reason enough to hate her full-on and never turn back. She kind of can't sing either. Bad move to make an R&B CD without being able to sing, I think. <br /> <br />Lil' Scrappy-- This is the same Lil' Scrappy you heard on Lil' Jon's \\"What U Gon Do?\\" track. He's pretty good. Decent at least. Definitely not as decent as 50 Cent's original Get Rich or Die Tryin, but decent. He's got a good enough style though that places him above everyone else still in G-Unit, excluding Lloyd Banks and Young Buck, but including 50 Cent by himself.  <br /> <br />I think that's everybody. So... now you know all about G-Unit, and who's good and who's not. If you HAVE to buy G-Unit, now you know who to avoid and who to embrace. If you plan on buying the original Get Rich or Die Tryin, I suggest you don't. Burn it, or have a friend burn it for you. 50 doesn't need the money right now or ever again. If you decide not to buy G-Unit, then more power to you. The Game is actually now sort of the anti-G-Unit since he left, because, you know, the majority of their members still suck. <br /> <br />I'd suggest Mos Def's Black on Both Sides instead of any of this stuff though... even if you were planning on buying G-Unit. That's probably the best hip-hop album I've ever heard, or will hear.
B0000062FN|4.0|Okay, this album rocks, and is my second-favorite of Santana's albums, behind the mighty Abraxas. But some of it kinda sucks, which is why I only give four stars, rather than five.<br />First the good news: No One to Depend On is a masterpiece. You know, take a bit of metal, a bit of blues, a bit of Latin, even a bit of the whacky psychedelia from the first album. Add the organ groove and Santana's signature guitar soloing away. What could be better, you ask? That bit in the bridge where they switch between English and Spanish. (\\"I ain't GOT no one - tengo anadie... that I can de-PEND on - tengo anadie...\\" is that not supremely cool?) This ain't a one-song album, though. I mean, how can a Santana fan NOT love the dramatic near-instrumental Touissant L'Overture? Santana's Santana on that song (it goes without saying he can outplay pretty much everyone), and there's those nonstop riffs he trades with Neil Schon and the polyrhythmic attack... yeah. Of course, Santana hasn't abandoned salsa, so if you liked Oye Como Va, you'll probably love Guajira. That sax solo's a nice touch, too. Jungle Strut is fusion mania, but in a good way. There's also Everybody's Everything, easily the funkiest thing Santana ever did, with a huge horn section - it's fun and catchy indeed, and Schon's wah-wah is killer, but the lyrics arie the usual pseudo-spiritual mumbo-jumbo that made up most of Santana's lyrics at that point. But come on, do you listen to Santana because you want to hear him babble about how the King and Queen of Soul are gonna come around or whatever the hell it is he's going on about this time? No. You listen to him because he's an unbeatable guitarist, plain and simple. Everything's Coming Our Way was a hit too, but I could've done without it - more of those dumb lyrics, and it sounds like Santana's doing The Byrds... nothing wrong with The Byrds, but it sounds out-of-place from Santana. The instrumentals Batuka, Taboo and Para Los Rumberos only confirm this one's status as #2. But the best of this is as good as (if not better than) the Abraxas classics, so you can't go wrong with this.#2. But the best of this is as good as (if not better than) the Abraxas classics, so you can't go wrong with this.
0060594896|5.0|I have read many self help books, and opening this book, and reading the 6 pages of testimonials and quotes, many from renowned authors or business people forms the impression that this book is out of the ordinary.<br /><br />This book is a great reference and an excellent teaching manual for either a relentless self improver, or aspiring life coach.  In the first 20 pages alone is major information about discovering your life purpose.  Everything else flows from having a major definite purpose.<br /><br />Taking 100% responsibility for what happens in your life, as opposed to blaming is also a very powerful concept.<br /><br />I am also really liking the formula E + R =O.  Event + response = Outcome.  Your life is not defined by the events that happen in it, but by how you respond to them. So, if you don't like the outcome, change the response, or you will keep getting similar outcomes.<br /><br />All these concepts are in the early part of the book, so you can probably imagine how much benefit can be derived from the remainder of this amazing book.  More recently, I acquired the audio version of this book, which is narrated by Jack Canfield.  If you like the book, you'll like this too.
B000AP04L0|4.0|Evidently art does mirror life when Mike Judge tries his hand at movie making.  Office Space has become a cult classic of sorts.  I've worked in a corporate environment for seven years now and this movie is just as funny now as it was when I first saw it back in the day.  Its scary how little the work place has changed. <br /> <br />Mike Judge assembled a great crew to pull this movie off.  The sets are great, from Initech's cubicle mazes, to Chotchkie's all to familiar decor, to Peter's apartment.  He's got a great cast with Ron Livingston playing our everyman main character.  Perhaps it is Gary Cole as Bill Lumbergh that makes the best impression as the oh-so-subtle manager without a clue.  Or maybe its John C. McGinley as Bob the efficiency expert that steals the vote for best supporting actor in this comedy.  But how can you forget Stephen Root as Milton, the inspiration for this comedic adventure.  And I can't leave out David Herman or Ajay Naidu as the poor dopes that get roped into Peter's clever scheme.  Oh yeah and Jennifer Aniston is in it too. <br /> <br />The script is great, especially when it flings its barbed humor at the corporate world.  Things falter a bit when Peter scheme kicks into action, but there are plenty of good bits after as well (my favorite being the fate of the office printer).  The use of gangster rap music is appropriate, but I know some viewers won't appreciate it or the use of colorful language throughout the movie. <br /> <br />This is a great piece of entertainment, and proves that Mike Judge is as good with live action films as he is with animation.  He would go on to confirm this with his satirically stupid look at an incredibly dumb future in Idiocracy.  Get both these films and you have one heck of a double feature.
0714834491|5.0|I buy books at random, not by selection. I look at something on the shelf and decided if it's inspiring to have. The Art of Looking Sideways is just that, the perspective is left up to the reader. You can flip through its randomness and find something that will spark your imagination and creativity. The book is so big that every time I look through it, I always find something new to read, enjoy, and ponder.<br /><br />Like any art book, this ISN'T for everyone. This is for someone that can respect anything that's everything created by and made out of nothing. If you want to be intrigued, or just want something interesting to read, this is the book.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I have to say that this movie is by far one of the best movies if not the best one in the James Bond franchise. Daniel Craig has given a new lease to the film franchise, and we can only hope that future installments featuring Daniel Craig will be as good as this one or hopefully better. <br />   The bad in this movie comes from the fact that there are no high tech gadgets which are a staple item in the James Bond movies.  If you are expecting high tech you can forget about it as there is none other than the computers and cell phones. Cars and other vehicles are as plain as they come no weaponry or nothing. <br />   The good in this movie is plenty, first we have a new actor that can carry his own in interpreting the worlds greatest spy, Daniel Craig has definitely grab the meaning of being James Bond and taken it to a new level. We have a James Bond that has a mean streak to his persona, a sadistic inner self that was not seen since Sean Connery, a suave side, and even an emotional level that is interesting for a spy who has no feelings. <br />   The action scenes are by far realistic and well done, the stunts are incredible but believable (by all means do not try them at home). There are plenty of fighting sequences and action sequences to please the most discriminating fan of the James Bond movies. <br />    This movie also provides us with a James Bond that has emotions and can display them.  He falls in love only to be betrayed in the end, he has an inner fury that is boderline psychotic, he can kill without a conscience, he has no problems in chasing someone down and killing that person after they outlived their usefulness, and he surely can shoot someone to inflict enough pain as seen in the final sequence of the movie. <br />   The plot is realistic, down to earth, and modernized to reflect present day situations (terrorism, etc.), this movie does a good job in following more of the Ian Fleming novelization than some of its predecessors.  There are still some artistic licenses but they are well done and acceptable (this is not the era of the Cold War after all). <br />  Drama is a first in a James Bond movie and it's introduced in this one, the dramatic moments are few and far, but they are a welcomed addition to the franchise, we can only hope that future movies will have some more dramatic elements. <br />   Weapons in this movie are your standard guns, machine guns, knives, and common mundane weapons.  There are no super guns, or signature weapons (i.e. no Golden Gun, engraved pistols, etc.). Every weapon in the movie is just plain and ordinary but deadly in the right hands. <br />   The ugly in this movie comes from the villains, yes there are more than one, and you are kept in a constant state of  trying to figure out who is good, and who is bad all the way to the very end of the movie.  <br />   When it is all said and done just remember the name is Bond, James Bond, and we can look forward to the next installment in the series.
B000LXHK2C|2.0|File this film under \\"what the hell were they thinking?\\" Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott follow-up their successful collaboration in Gladiator with A Good Year, a warm and fuzzy mid-life crisis dramedy (?!) that plays out like a sub par male version of Under the Tuscan Sun. Both men are horribly miscast for what amounts to a multi-million dollar paid vacation in France.<br /><br />The film's clumsy attempts at comedy include Max's rental car as an emasculating little stub of an automobile and his caretaker's dog peeing on his shoe. Russell Crowe tries his hand at light, physical comedy in the form of his character falling in an old, emptied out pool, unable to get out and so we get several minutes of the actor flailing about. This film seems like an ill fit for the actor despite his dedication to making it work. However, all of his hard work doesn't transcend the clich&eacute;-ridden screenplay that desperately needs a re-write from someone like James L. Brooks or Cameron Crowe who are much more attuned and familiar with the blending of comedy, drama and romance. At times it feels like he and Scott are killing time between more substantial projects and in fact they are teaming up again on a true crime epic entitled American Gangster. Let's hope it is much better than A Good Year.<br /><br />\\"Postcards from Provence\\" is a combination of audio commentary, with director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Marc Klein, and a collection behind-the-scenes featurettes. The director talks about the editing choices he made, including how much of the flashbacks to keep. The featurettes blend rather nicely with the commentary, especially Scott's perceptive observations, making this an infinitely more interesting experience than the film itself.<br /><br />\\"Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott Promo\\" features a brief conversation between the two men with clips from the movie.<br /><br />Also included are three trailers and four T.V. spots.<br /><br />For hardcore Crowe fans only are three music videos for songs the actor recorded with his new band the Extraordinary Fear of God. Yes, we get to see the actor sing and \\"rock out\\" with his latest sampling of generic rock `n' roll music complete with his smug, self-indulgent smirk throughout that will test the resolve of anyone who watches these videos.e music videos for songs the actor recorded with his new band the Extraordinary Fear of God.

B000MGUZMU|5.0|I cried like a baby on my first listening. This band are amazing. They are more than a band-they are a force of nature. If you haven't been turned on to Arcade Fire yet you aare really missing out. Don't think. Just buy.
B000001FHV|5.0|This album did not get the proper respect it deserved. I think it is the Puppets at their coherent best and that is the main thing here, their coherent best. No, it is not too slick or polished, it is just well-crafted, which turns some of their older fans off, but not me. I liked the musicianship a lot on this album and always enjoy listening to it.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|Arcade Fire have always been able to pull off the whole over-the-top production because it flowed around amazing songs.  The songs are good here, but not quite in the same class as the first album.<br /><br />I also prefer to subject matter they wrote about in Funeral.<br /><br />They've always had an intensity and urgency to their songs, and this album is no different.  The main problem I have with this album is that the songs SOUND more important than they actually are.  Nevertheless, Arcade Fire scare me, but in a very good way.<br /><br />If the Rapture is to ever happen, Arcade Fire will provide the soundtrack.
0784011710|5.0|there is always that one performance in a actors career thats defined as there best and for the great Meryl Streep, her role as Holocaust survivor Sophie brilliantly conveys a person of heartbreak, riddled with guilt, and just so volnerable. pulling of a flawless polish accent, Streep plays Sophie, a polish immagrent who is haunted by her horrible past in WWII during the Holocaust and her stay at a concentration camp. Kevin Kline plays her temptatious lover Nathan and Peter MacNicol is Stingo, the man who Sophie and Nathan befriend. as Stingo becomes more involved in there life, he learns of Sophie's past and the horrible decision she had to make. Kline and MacNicole both provide excellent buffers as to not be outshined by Meryl Streep. the other great thing about this film is the cinamatography, it shifts very nicley from the comforts of Broklyn to the horrors of Europe. there are many great Holocaust films but Sophie's choice is definently at the top three along with Schindler's List and The Pianist. if you want to see a truley powerful film that will leave you heartbroken at the end then Sophie's Choice is the film

Rose looks for her in the isolated and lonely ghost town of Silent Hill where weird things go on! strange creatures and spirits along with evil villagers are hellbent on destroying Sharon, however Rose along with a police officer (Laurie Holden) seek out to find her daughter.<br /><br />Spectacular and riviting supernatural horror thriller faithfully adapts the cult video game series to the big screen in a successful way thanks to a screenplay by Pulp Fiction's Roger Avary and French director Christophe Gans (\\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\"). The film's plotline may confuse some viewers but this movie is a gruesome feast for the eyes with disturbing atmosphere, sharp editing and creepy-as-hell creatures that goes into the darkest corners of our nightmares in a H.P. Lovecraft, Clive Barker or Stephen King style. The film also co-stars Sean Bean (\\"Lord of the Rings\\"), this lovely yet disturbing shocker is one movie that does the games justice kudos to Christophe Gans and Roger Avery for putting effort into this movie, a must see movie! can't wait for the sequel next year.<br /><br />The DVD has superb sound and picture quality with the only extras being previews to other movies especially this movie and 6 behind the scene featurettes.
0684847248|5.0|Just finished reading this masterpiece...You should be lucky, if you can read books of this quality  once every decade.It is a heavy subject  on spiritual growth that even a voracious reader cannot hope to absorb the contents if he reads more than few pages a day.Every line, every word literally stops you, makes you think ,digest and move on.Being a heavy subject does not mean the book has to be a boring textbook.  There should be tremendous clarity of thought to get it to the reader and a natural gift to bring the right words .. Scott  excels as a writer <br />  <br />My kids, more than me are lucky that I read this book..Atleast they will certainly not fall into several pitfalls that i went thro in my spiritual growth.  Here is an example about children, probably the central theme of the book  ( dont miss the fascinating wordplay in the sentences) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />---- <br />All children have neurosis, in that they will instinctively assume responsibility for certain deprivations they experience but do not yet understand. Thus the child who is not loved by his parents will always assume himself or herself as unlovable rather than see their parents are deficient in their capacity to love. <br /> <br />there is much that parents can do to assist their children in this maturation process. Opportunities present thousands of times while children are growing up ...because they duck responsibility,character disordered parents serve as role models for irresponsibility for their children. <br /> <br />Good discipline requires time.When we have no time to give to our children, we dont even observe them closely enough to become aware of when their need for our disciplinary assistance is expressed subtly.The parents who devote time to their children even when it is not demanded will perceive in them subtle needs for discipline, to which they will respond with gentle urging or reprimand or structure or praise, administered with thoughtfulness and care. They will observe how their children eat cake, how they study, when they will tell subtle falsehoods, when they run away from problems rather than face them.They will take time to make minor corrections,tightening a little here, loosening a little there..The time and quality of the time that their parents devote to them indicate to children the degree to which they are loved by their parents.. <br /> <br />To the child, abandonment by its parents is the equivalent of death... For children either abandoned psychologically or in actuality, enter adulthood lacking any deep sense that the world is a safe and protective place. <br /> <br />To a child his or her parent is everything; they represent the world. The child does not have the perspective to see that other parents are different and frequently better. He assumes that the way his parents do things is the way things are done. Consequently the realization - the \\"reality\\" that this child came to was not \\"I can't trust my parents\\" but \\"I can't trust people\\". Not trusting people therefore became the map with which he entered adoloscence and adulthood. With this map and abundant store of resentment resulting from many of his disappointments, it was inevitable that he came into conflict with authority figures - police, teacher, employers....he had many opportunities to revise his map, but that would require him to revise his view of his parents - to realize that they did not love him, that he did not have a normal childhood...such realization would have been <br />------------- <br /> <br />Does this section below ring a bell on your childhood or a guilt that you can do a better job as a parent??? How about if you can become a better husband, wife, manager, parent, and above all a humble person all in One package......Just go and buy this book and recommend to every one of your friends.. <br />
B000K4WLXA|2.0|First of all, let me make clear where I stand/my pov. I'm a female college student who DID play FFVII not when it came out. I played it a year or two ago. I really liked FFVII. <br /> <br />I did not like this film, however. Like I wrote in my blog, this film is about 100 minutes long and approximately 70 minutes are action sequences, 20 minutes are flashbacks and 10 minutes are plot related. There was almost NO plot what-so-ever. (Lol because of this negative response, watch the \\"helpfulness\\" meter above become very low... that always seems to happen with people who don't like something.) Final Fantasy is always known for it's great character interactions and story and I think the FF team tried to make up for FF Spirits Within by doing the complete opposite. FFSW was all plot, FFVII is all action, no plot.  <br /> <br />The action, however, was very good. I loved how they translated the gameplay into action sequences. I really enjoyed how they got past the jumping high in the air by doing throws for the limit break (I forgot what it is called in FFVII). <br /> <br />*Possible Spoiler Here* <br />But the plot was terrible. I REALLY wish they could have gotten equal parts plot and action. The only thing I got out of the plot (besides Kadaj and what he was doing, etc) was that Cloud says \\"I'm weak\\" at one point and then says \\"I'm strong\\" at another, and I'm thinking \\"WHAT? When did the transition take place? During the flashbacks which were almost carbon copies of the scenes in the game?\\" He just SAYS \\"I'm weak/strong\\" and as a watcher you're supposed to believe it immediately. <br />*End Possible Spoiler* <br /> <br />There were so many action sequences, believe it or not, I GOT BORED of them. While they were really cool in themselves, it's like watching Die Hard a billion times in a row. Seeing the same thing for a LONG time makes you bored.--Lol though I must admit Seph was a sexy beast hahhaa! <br /> <br />The only thing that is really worth watching other than playing the game is Final Fantasy VII: The Last Order... Clears things up about the game. Don't think its on this US copy, I thought it might be on the Japanese one... but this new Limited Edition set might have it. If not, search around online.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This DVD is excellent!  It shows the full concert of The Confessions Tour filmed in London.  No songs are cut and none of the material is censored (like the scene on the cross during \\"Live to Tell\\", which was edited out on network television because the religious right was too offended).  This concert was a spectacle to behold and the DVD captures it all- the dancers, the costume changes, the sets, the video backgrounds, and the sheer enthusiasm of everyone onstage, from the musicians to the dancers, to Madge herself.  I only wish the accompanying CD had the entire concert, not just selected tracks.  The material is mostly from \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" with some of her old hits sprinkled in, but every song performed is captivating, from the stunning entrance (\\"Future Lovers\\" mixed with the disco classic \\"I Feel Love\\") to the powerfully moving \\"Live to Tell\\", to the scathing social-political commentary of \\"Sorry Remix\\" to the amp'd up \\"Disco Inferno/Music\\" to the beautifully choreographed, nearly unrecognizable \\"Erotica\\" (a MUCH better version than the original song!), to the over-the-top ending of \\"Hung Up\\".  My favorite moments: the poignant moves between the 2 men during \\"Forbidden Love\\" that ultimately show Madonna's acceptance of gay love, the Saturday Night Fever suit during \\"Disco Inferno/Music\\", the breath-taking choreography during \\"Erotica\\", and the duet version of \\"Paradise-Not For Me\\" (which improves on this song 100%!).  And for a little fun, try to keep track of where she puts the microphone during each number--it moves around a lot!  This one is a definite for any Madonna fan.
B000GRUS22|5.0|Being a little bored with the last few albums, I wasn't sure how this one was going to compare. <br /> <br />After listening to it I was pleasantly surprised, this album is just amazing, Beautifully writen, amazing beats, and truely creates an awesome atmosphere for any emotion. <br /> <br />Well worth the money. <br />
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Love every song. The Arcade Fire is one of the best bands out there.
B00005NTJK|5.0|The best of the bluesy Jethro Tull years and sadly the last one with the great Glenn Cornick on bass, apparently he was the partyer of the  <br />tee-totalling early to bed band at the time. These 10 songs allow Martin to really crank his Les Paul and Marshall to 11 as he does on \\"nothing to say\\", \\"cry you a song\\" and \\"son\\" and of course the hit single \\"teacher\\". according to rumor the Jeffrey in \\"For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me\\" is Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, the next bass player waiting in the wings. John Evan makes an uncredited appearance here and is great as ever on the Hammond organ and Piano. I particularly like the song \\"Inside\\", it really makes you want to grab a cup of coffee and enjoy this album with a friend on \\"the inside\\"
B000MGUZMU|5.0|Very impressed with the album...and I've only heard it a couple of times. The Arcade Fire is one of the best bands out there!
B000F4MLZ8|2.0|Its nice mellow stuff. No way should Elliot Smith, Paul Simon, James Taylor, or Cat Stevens be mentioned in comparison. It is vapidly sincere like Zack Braff's voice over in the last five minutes of a scrubs episode.  So if you are here becuase you like Scrubs, check out Colin Hay.  Have a nice day.
0385338082|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. It made me laugh, cry, and want to hit someone at different points. Fantastic love story. I loved the plot twist, it left me worrying that there weren't enough pages left for the ending to turn out the way I wanted it to. Excellent choice for any chick lit fan.
0375831002|5.0|Heartbreaking and beautiful. I really didn't want to read about a young girl in Nazi Germany but I loved I Am the Messenger so much that I decided to trust Zusak and I'm glad I did. If you've enjoyed his other books, try this. If you've never read his stuff, try this. It's a lovely portrait of goodness and sweetness in the face of horrendous ugliness. I was deeply moved by this book.
B000LC55F2|1.0|This is definitely one of the top two dueling magician movies to come out in the last year, but it is also completely unbelievable.  Because as \\"great\\" as these magicians may have been, I've never heard of either of them.  And if they were really trying to transport themselves magically, why didn't they ask Doug Henning (before he passed away), because he knew everything there is to know about illusions.  And Lance Burton knows a lot about working with birds, so why wasn't he in this movie? <br /> <br />Basically, this movie is like Herbie Fully Loaded, except there are very few whimsical cars in this one, and Herbie is awesome!!!! <br /> <br />The famous magician David Copperfield, who is based on a book by Charles Dickens (I believe it is Tale of Two Cities), once made the Great Wall of China appear in the middle of the Grand Canyon, yet I'm supposed to get excited about a trick that centers around a rubber ball?  Where's the \\"wow\\" factor, Prestige filmmakers? <br /> <br />In summation, when Wolverine fights Batman, nobody wins.  But if they were to drive around in Herbie, they could finally stop crime for good!
B000MGUZMU|2.0|Arcade Fire should have published a book of poetry rather than boring us with a cd of words set to music.  Neither the compositions, arrangements, nor production measures near in quality to, \\"Funeral,\\" but even judging it in its own right, sans comparison, it is a rather vapid album.  Most of the songs have the same aped-Springsteen vocal rhythms and a mush of instrument sounds pervades with little textural variation throughout. <br /> <br />I enjoy the songs, \\"Black Mirror,\\" (which excited my anticipation for this cd) and, \\"The Well and The Lighthouse,\\" but otherwise couldn't keep my finger off the skip-track button. <br /> <br />I'll be perusing the Dover Thrifts.
B0000691U1|5.0|This album was bought for me many years ago by a friend, and I have been listening to it ever since. The sessions were recorded in 1962 and feature Max Roach on Drums, Charlie Mingus on Bass and Duke Ellngton on the Piano.<br /><br />Most of the material was written especially for the session and there are some wonderful compositions here. Like a lot of Ellingtons material they all sound deceptively simple. However my favourite track is their version of 'Caravan'. This is a thunderous version with Ellington playing the melody lower down the Piano than you would normally expect. Perhaps he did this just wind Mingus up - who knows. Anyway its a stunning performance by all 3 of them.<br /><br />This is a must-have Jazz Trio album by Ellington, who is frequently forgotten when great Jazz Pianists are mentioned, because of his superb writing and arranging skills. This shows off his playing skills better than any other album I know.
6305511055|5.0|This film depicts the CIA headquarters being located on one of World Trade Center's twin towers. I wonder if Osama saw this film long time ago and was inspired by it to initiate his terrorist attack thinking he was hitting CIA alongside with the Pentagon on 9/11... Another Conspiracy Theory ? Maybe... <br /> <br />All in all, this is an excellent film (details were masterfully described by the other reviewers ;-). Hollywood no longer makes films like these anymore...Only propaganda films now...
B00065MDSQ|5.0|This is the peak. <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, there are many great King Crimson albums. But, this is THE one. The peak. <br /> <br />Bar none. <br /> <br />Period. <br /> <br />Discipline IS a close second. Nothing else comes close. <br /> <br />If you are new to Crimson, I can say nothing else but, start here.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Ok.  I admit it, I've been listening to Funeral on a regular basis for the last two years.  I didn't, and don't, love every song on that album, but the ones that are good, are very good.  And just as important, and the reason I kept going back, was that Funeral proved Arcade Fire weren't afraid to be earnest, and express real emotion in their music- unusual and surprising for an indie band.  There was no arch, ironic, hipster posing, no \\"look at us\\";  they let their work speak for itself. <br /> <br />So.  What to make of Neon Bible.  The opening track, \\"Black Mirror\\", doesn't quite capture the mood of this album the way \\"Tunnels\\", with it's soaring, cracked vocals, and hopeful, childlike (in a good way) tone did for Funeral, but then again, that was a high standard to set.  Still, it's a good track, and it does hint at what's to come- religion, death, family, and observations on the state of the world.  It also shows an interest in the occult, and the old, weird America(na) of the turn of the last century, evident not just in the lyrics but also in the use of church organ, hurdy gurdy, and the liberal application of acoustic stringed instruments.  In fact, in addition to David Byrne and Bruce Springsteen, who are frequently mentioned, Arcade Fire seem inspired by John Fahey and Harry Smith, whose hugely influential Anthology of American Folk Music is all over this album.   <br /> <br />So.  Neon Bible is consistently good, with some real standouts; too many to name here, in fact.  Personally, I liked Intervention, Keep the Car Running, and (Antichrist Television Blues).  I'm sure more will grow on me with time.  My only real criticisms are that the lyrics sometimes border on the inane, and don't always match the intensity of the music to which they are set.  Also, this album feels more disjointed than Funeral, and doesn't have that album's consistency and flow.  Neon Bible feels more like a collection of songs;  still, when the songs are this good, it's hard to complain.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I cannot go on enough about Hayao Miyazaki.  Anything he produces is stunning and high quality.  He clearly loves the natural world.  I highly recommend all of his animated films for every parent!  The parents will love these films as well.  Also a great gift idea for any child.  My kids are now teenagers and still watch this film and others of Miyzaki every month!  Truly fantastic!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is amazing. I have the region 2 dvd and watching it was like one of the best 11 hours of my life. The picture, the sound and most importantly the animals, places, and everything else it shows is fantastic. If you are a fan of wildlife documentaries you must own the dvd set, or if you prefer the blu ray or the hd dvd version; only that those two don't have special features, but still the series is great. And of course the final touch that also makes this series as great as it is, a narration by David Attenborough. You really need to watch this!!!
0743298020|5.0|I just love this book!  It is full of dry humor, a little creepiness, mystery, and is absolutely essential reading for lovers of books, boostores and libraries.  I felt as if I was actually there while reading it, as if I could feel the rooms the character/narrator described to me.  This is such easy reading, yet so complex in how much work obviously has gone into putting these thoughts together on paper.  It is so complex yet so simple in how it is written I consider it just wonderful writing.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This Two-Disc Platinum Edition of Peter Pan is the first really good DVD version of this classic film that has been released, and is far more superior to the earlier DVD releases of Peter Pan.  One thing that stuck out to me in this version of Peter Pan is the stunning colors.  It looked so good that I noticed things I had never noticed before, so I do recommend this movie to collectors and others who never want to grow up.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|First off, I bought this CD because Amazon had a great deal on it ($7.99), I heard some samples, and a friend in the UK really liked Corrine Bailey Rae.  I normally do not like this type of music, however, this CD has something that separates it from the other garbage you hear played over and over on the radio.  Corinne has a beautiful voice and each song sounds unique and interesting. <br /> <br />Sample \\"Like a Star\\", \\"Call me when you get this\\", and \\"'Till it happens to you\\".  People who don't listen to mainstream FM radio can really get into this recording.

B000LAZDQA|4.0|I must say that I was so curious about seeing this film for various reasons including the obvious why Sook-Yin Lee is this much talked about real-sex film by John Cameron Mitchell whose Hedwig movie was amazing. I have seen so much TV and films that are very far out there like Sex and The City, Nip/Tuck, and Queer as Folk, but it still didn't prepare me for a so suprisingly shocking film about sex, love, and relationship in New York. It's about gay, straight, bi, metro-sexual, and everything in between....<br /><br />Even the first 10 minutes of the film we are presented with scenes of real sex: the sex of various positions between Lee and her husband, the auto-fellatio(they actually show entire genital and actual ejaculation on camera...). Then it gets very wordy or conversational for a while until a ton of various sexual activities and orgies in the Shortbus club which the main setting of the film where Lee's sex therapist visits in pursuit to explore the depth of sex and relationships and ultimately she's the only woman there who is trying to experience her first orgasm. There is numerous moments the film looks very pornographic and documentary like. The main actors are very good and they all seem to be very comfortable to be part of the physical stuff. Sook-Yin is amazingly daring and vulnerable, and she was welling to really push the envelop doing this film. No wonder her boss from CBC threatened to fire her after she was cast for this film. She can act and she's much better actress than I had expected considered that she's more experinced as VJ and musician. I wonder if her family would accept her doing this film.<br /><br />Besides the shock value of the real sex appeal of this film, it very well dealt with various issues. I think Mitchell is such a daring and alternative director. Well, I didn't think that it was neccessary to have all these real sex, especially there is strong story and purpose emotionally and spiritually. It could have well been simulated sex. When I watched the credits, there is at least 30 \\"Sextras\\". I wonder how the crew handle working on those orgy scenes.ated sex. When I watched the credits, there is at least 30 \\"Sextras\\". I wonder how the crew handle working on those orgy scenes.
B000LC55F2|3.0|You're read the synopsis in the rest of the reviews.  The film's great for eye-candy, the cast is gorgeous and the illusions are good.  What bogs the story down are endless plot complications that just bog the story down.   <br /> <br />Loved the one piece of history regarding Tesla and Colorado Springs--that is semi-true and would make a film in and of itself.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Like I said with the review for the Red album, if you're just getting into the Beatles, no better place to start. Listen to it for the course of about 2-3 months and once you get the idea of what they're about and the direction of their music, then you can branch off onto the albums like \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", \\"Abbey Road\\", etc. you won't regret it for the rest of your life. <br /> <br />If there was anything a person can do in their life, getting into the Beatles could defintely be one of the best (and smartest)choices you'll ever have to make
B000M5AJQS|3.0|The Departed has some great performances and interesting twists in the story. It is also self-indulgent and overblown. <br /> <br />For most of the film the story and characters pull you along and keep you interested. There are individual scenes of absolute brilliance, but I had a nagging feeling that I had been fed this stuff before by Scorcese - ad nauseum. <br /> <br />The last 1/8 of the film is so utterly ridiculous and cartoonish that I found the whole thing to be unsatisfying. I think that Scorcese has gone as far as he can in trying to be the tough guy by making films about tough guys. <br /> <br />Goodfellas and Raging Bull will always serve as a pretty fair legacy,no?
B000002UB3|5.0|I haven't been as lucky as some of my fellow reviewers to enjoy the music of The Beatles for years and years and i was another person who viewed this as another goofy cd cover by a band but over the last 4-5 months, I've heard this album and in that short time, it grew on me so fast and left an immediate impact. From \\"Come Together\\" to \\"Her Majesty\\", just about every track commands a different pace and is beautifully crafted. <br /> <br />There's already 1006 reviews before me so there's virtually no point in me going on track for track but i sttrongly feel that this \\"swan song\\" is their best effort. The medley by itself carries the album past the rest of the catalogue and into the stratosphere. <br /> <br />It's also boggles the mind how the album ends on the highest note considering their relationship at that point but it's more evidence to why they are the GREATEST ACT in th history of music bar none.
1582701709|3.0|The secret works. if you look it up online, there are already several websites selling gratitude rocks for $9/piece.
B000002UYZ|5.0|I'm pretty sure that a lot of the under 40 Beatles fans' journey with the Fab Four stated off here. It took me a week of the album lying around the house for me to get started on it and once I did, I was so pissed off for wasting that week NOT listening to it. It goes without saying that I was hooked from the beginning and not even 6 months from listening to it, it has already changed my life and the way I view music.  <br /> <br />When I have kids, they'll be sure to grow up on The Beatles and the lagacy can live on for another 100 years through the next generation
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|The thought that haunts me at night is the fact that I almost didn't buy this CD. That would have ended up being a huge mistake. What caused me to question whether or not this would be a purchase I would regret is the fact that it is about death. Often, I find songs about death to be depressing and I didn't like the idea of buying an entire album that depressed me. However, thanks to a five-star review in Alternative Press, I bought the CD the same week it came out and came to be very thankful that I did. Although the CD's theme is death, it's not in the least bit depressing (except for the song \\"Cancer\\" which amazing nonetheless). It's ironic how an album about death can make you feel so alive.<br />The quirky lyrics of \\"The End\\" immediately grab you and transition you into the next song, \\"Dead!\\". \\"Dead!\\" is an upbeat song that's extremely catchy. With Gerard's trademark vocal flourishes, it becomes one of the many standout tracks from the album. Once I had listened to \\"This is How I Disappear\\" and \\"The Sharpest Lives\\" (both amazing by the way), I just knew that this was going to be one of the best albums I own. \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" is next. This is the song everyone knows by heart (even you don't own the album) so I won't bother going over the logistics. \\"I Don't Love You\\" takes the album to a more melancholy place. Fortunately, it never leaves you counting the seconds to the next fast song. \\"House of Wolves\\" is perhaps my favorite track on the album, although I love them all. It has great bass and I love the way Gerard uses his voice to make the song more theatrical. \\"Cancer\\" is a touching song told from the point of view of a man dying from cancer. \\"Mama\\" seems as if it is a song from a musical that has been misplaced, although it still fits with the rest of the CD. It's originality is heightened even more by the cameo by Liza Minnelli. The spoken intro to \\"Sleep,\\" a slower song, is made from actual recordings of Gerard talking about his dreams into a tape recorder throughout the making of the album. \\"Teenagers\\" is an upbeat tongue in cheek song, while \\"Disenchanted\\" could be catagorized as more of a ballad (if you can consider anything done my MCR as a ballad). \\"Famous Last Words,\\" the second single, is a very powerful song. It didn't hook me right away, but then, randomly one day, it grabbed hold and I was almost moved to tears just listening to it. Finally, the bonus track, \\"Blood\\" (which is quite an original, entertaining closer) ends the album.<br />The more I listen to this album, the more I love it, and, after seeing them live, it became my favorite album of all time. If you buy one CD this year, make it \\"The Black Parade\\". So, to sum up, this album rocks and you need to go see MCR live.<br />My favorite songs:<br />\\"Dead!\\"<br />\\"The Sharpest Lives\\"<br />\\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\"<br />\\"House of Wolves\\"<br />\\"Mama\\"<br />\\"Famous Last Words\\"<br />\\"Blood\\"<br />...and all the other songs I didn't list.recorder throughout the making of the album. \\"Teenagers\\" is an upbeat tongue in cheek song, while \\"Disenchanted\\" could be catagorized as more of a ballad (if you can consider anything done my MCR as a ballad). \\"Famous Last Words,\\" the second single, is a very powerful song.

B000G759LW|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this album.  In fact, I heard of the name of Christina Aguilera via news and her nemesis Britney Spears.  I would never thought that I would buy an album featuring Christina or Britney.  But I saw Christina performance at the last Grammy, give me reason to change my mind to buy this album.  Christina has a great voice and sang like music to the ears.  Oh, it's music to the ears.  I'm completely love this CD. <br />
0670034711|5.0|I LOVED this book.  i borrowed it from the library, but will buy it.  it spoke to me on sooo many different levels.  she entrances the reader with the food and views in Italy, takes you on a self-realization journey of God, prayer and your spiritual needs and then to learn to love all over again.  she teaches the reader to love yourself, indulge, share, enjoy and HAVE FUN!  she is quirky, passionate, inteligent, fun, social, yet private and deep.  someone i would be honored to know.  i can't say enough about this book.  if you are at ALL considering reading it...PLEASE DO.  it will change your life for the better.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Just so you know, I've never played any of the FF games.   <br /> <br />Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children was quite enjoyable.  I've, of course, heard of many of the characters, so it was good to get some idea of what they're about. <br /> <br />The plot of the movie revolves around an attempt to recover the Jenova 'virus' and to bring back Sephiroth.  I found the plot to be covered quite well. <br /> <br />Cloud's an interesting character, and he is presented as a 'lone wolf' who is trying to deal with becoming part of the society as a whole. <br /> <br />The action sequences are stunning.  OK...all of the animation is stunning.  While being aware that the movie was CGI, it felt as fluid as a live action flick.  I was very happy with what I saw. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the extras disk, because I find it interesting to hear the Japanese mindset as far as film making, and gaming, etc., goes. <br /> <br />All-in-all, this was a surprising and enjoyable find. <br /> <br />5 stars
B000GUJF4G|5.0|I thought I wasn't going to like it, because my daughter went to go see it, and she said it was corny, NOT! I saw it and I absolutely loved it, although it didn't have Ernest, Shelly and the other cast from the first one, but it was definitely a winner.. Hats off to the remake
1593080255|5.0|What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?<br /><br />  Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of `relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.<br /><br />~And the moral of the story is don't live for self
B00005JP97|4.0|So, let me get this straight. The Deep South. A young, white woman (Christina Ricci) who is also a nymphomaniac, ends up on the doorstep of an aging, black blues singer (Samuel L. Jackson) and he decides to chain her to his radiator. Have I returned to another era of filmmaking? When I first heard about this story, I did a double take. \\"Black Snake Moan\\" could be very bad; there are a lot of inherent problems with this story. Or it could be very good; the synopsis has so many weird, uncommon elements that it almost guarantees it will be something wonderful. I am happy to report the latter is true.<br /><br />I didn't love \\"Hustle and Flow\\", writer - director Craig Brewer's last film, but I liked it. I just wasn't won over by the story of a pimp who wants to become a rapper. If there's anything we learned from the film its \\"Don't you know it's hard out there for a pimp\\".<br /><br />So when I first heard about \\"Black Snake Moan\\", Brewer's follow-up, I was not excited. Then I started to really pay attention to the previews and the images. Okay, this is going to be one strange movie and sometimes strange movies are beautiful because they have a license to go places we don't expect. \\"Black Snake Moan\\" is all of these things; strange, beautiful and also contains great performances from Jackson (one of his best) and Ricci (certainly her best).<br /><br />The first thing \\"Black Snake\\" does is set up the two main characters, establishing their lives, before they meet. This may sound like a given, but Brewer spends a significant amount of time showing the despair each person has in their lives, for different reasons, giving us a chance to get to know each of them.<br /><br />Rae (Ricci) begs her boyfriend Ronnie, (Justin Timberlake) to not go to Basic Training. But he has to go, this is the only way they are ever going to escape the trailer park they live in and have a chance to escape their white trash roots. She runs after the truck in her daisy dukes and oversize flannel shirt and then drops to the ground, crying. As soon as he is gone, she gets the `itch', something she is only occasionally able to control. This time, she won't be able to control it. She calls up the local small time drug dealer, a black man, and they are soon going at it in a seedy motel room. Later, she attends a large party, wearing the same daisy dukes and a cut off t-shirt bearing the Confederate flag (really just a strip of cloth making a valiant effort to cover her breasts, frequently giving up the fight) and tries to hook up. With anyone and everyone. Unable to find someone, she takes some pills and before you can whistle Dixie, she is running around in her panties and a football guard playing a game of football with some friends. Before you know it, she is having sex on the lawn, amid hundreds of used plastic cups. Later, she ends up with a bloody nose on the dirt road outside of Lazarus' small farm.<br /><br />Lazarus (Jackson) has troubles of his own. A former Blues musician, he learns his wife has been cheating on him with his brother. She wants to leave, but his brother won't leave without his blessing. Lazarus shows great restraint in a confrontation between them. The local preacher, a childhood friend, tries to offer him guidance, but Lazarus won't have any of it. Returning home drunk, he throws all of his wife's possessions into a garbage bag before passing out. The next morning, he takes the garbage bags out to the trash and spots the young girl. He soon realizes she is hurt and tries to figure out what to do. If he calls for help, he will be immediately blamed and may end up in jail. He decides to take her in and help her. He visits the local pharmacist, Angela (S. Epatha Merkerson, TV's \\"Law and Order\\") and she gives him some cough medicine for `his niece's' cough.<br /><br />Fading in and out of consciousness, Lazarus helps her get rid of her cough and tries to help with the black eye and the cuts and bruises. In a moment of lucidity, she attacksLazarus, trying to tame her `itch' and have sex with him, leading him to find out about her  nymphomania. In order to control her, he chains her to the radiator.<br /><br />When she comes to, wearing her panties and t-shirt, she assumes something happened, but he assures her it didn't. Well, if he wants to, he can, as long as he lets her go. He won't have any of it. He has to help her.<br /><br />This only begins to scratch he surface of \\"Black Snake Moan\\". Because the film is basically about these two characters, and we spend a significant amount of time with them, we learn a lot about each. But it is a testament to each actor that these moments of knowledge come through their performances, one of Jackon's best and certainly Ricci's best to date.<br /><br />Christina Ricci deserves a lot of credit for the simple rawness of the performance. There aren't many actresses that would take on this type of role, let alone abandon themselves to the character. Rae is half nude throughout most of the film. Naturally, this character, a woman so loose with her sexuality, so promiscuous, would find nudity a natural thing. And the character does bare her breasts a few times. She also has sex with more than one person. But all of these images are presented in a very matter-of-fact way and illustrate the character's soullessness. When she meets Lazarus and he starts to care for her, this behavior stops, because he won't allow it. Gradually, as she realizes he cares for her, she starts to listen to him. She doesn't change completely, or quickly, making the character seem all the more natural.<br /><br />This performance is very raw and fitting for the character. Ricci seems to give everything she has to the role, making it a memorable, vibrant performance. When she starts to change, we have lived part of the journey with her and we feel as though we have changed with her.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson also seems to lose in the role of Lazarus. Every time we go to a movie, we may recognize the actors playing the role. Not surprisingly, the less famous an actor, the more easily they `become' the character they are playing because we are more likely to forget they are an actor playing a role. Samuel L. Jackson has made many films, many of those very popular, so he is very recognizable. An established actor always has more difficulty disappearing into the character. But Jackson seems to disappear into this character for large stretches of time, allowing me to forget I was watching the famous actor who has also appeared in \\"Pulp Fiction \\", \\"Snakes on a Plane\\" and many others. The fact that he can fully immerse himself into the character at all speaks to his ability to make this character seem real.<br /><br />From the moment we first meet him, we experience some of the troubles Lazarus has with his community, with his wife, with his life. When he finds Ricci on the dirt road, he has to help her. But he has to be cautious. It wouldn't look good for an aging black man to be seen with a half naked white woman, let alone one who has been beaten up. So he looks both ways, to make sure no one is watching and takes her inside.<br /><br />The more involved he gets in her recovery, the more we realize he needed such a `project' to give meaning to his life. This also brings him into contact with the pharmacist, a woman who clearly has a little `itch' of her own for the aging Blues singer. Throughout the course of the story, Lazarus heals through his interactions with the young lady and may be able to get his life back on track after all.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake is also good as, Ricci's boyfriend. Going beyond stunt casting, he actually shows he has some acting chops as he makes the character's difficulties real and substantive.<br /><br />\\"Black Snake Moan\\" is a simply made film. The action centers at Lazarus' small farm in the middle of nowhere. Occasionally, he goes into town or other characters come out to the farm and interact with him, but I can'timagine this film cost a lot of money to make. Which makes sense because I am pretty sure if the budget for this film were too high, it never would have been made.<br /><br />I'm glad \\"Black Snake Moan\\" was made, because it contains two great performances, introducing us to characters we have never seen before, and likely are not to see often again. It is also a believable, well-made tale of redemption for two people who need to have some meaning in their lives.<br /><br />This strange film is, at times, quite a beautiful film.to a movie, we may recognize the actors playing the role.

B000ION23A|1.0|I'm sorry but the few funy scenes aren't woth he grossness and the stupidity of thsi film. I don't know what about it hit me the wrong way But jst like the movie 'Antz' I feel sick at the thought of it. Maybe it's the scene where the bug pulls up the ant's head or the need to make every thing as ew as possible or maybe the ant religion. Please if you want a good, CLEAN bug movie rent or buy 'Bugs Life' and skip this gross film.
0767812166|3.0|I recently bought this DVD based on the synopsis, and when it was first released in 1984 it was likely good for it's day, but can't hold it's own with today's sci-fi videos.  Both Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen give good performances all things considered, but the script writers and the director--for me--miss the boat by not fleshing out some of the scenes that could have benefited by more imaginative expansion.  Almost deadly dull in the first half, it's a good yarn if you stick with it, but NOT RECOMMENDED in light of what's available today.
B000MGUZMU|4.0|Simply put, The Arcade Fire is steadily growing as one of the more important bands of the decade. Already it's short nation wide tour is selling out with scalped tickets going for over one hundred bills and the reviews for its performances have been blistering with applause. Art guru David Bowie personally attends their concerts and jams every so often.<br /><br /> Nevertheless, following up 2004's uber brilliant Funeral is another thing.<br /><br /> Neon Bible, the Fire's second album, is filled with self referential material that echoes on the railings of orchestrated sounds creating a twisted and sick bridge between modern music and classical music that's been left in the dust for centuries.<br /><br /> Right off the bat Neon Bible starts in a dark place that just seems to intensify in despair and agony. Win Butler starts his eerie prose nearly whispering, \\"I will walk down to the ocean/ After waking from the nightmare/ No moon, no pale reflection/ Black Mirror, Black Mirror.\\" From this point on, Butler leaves it to the listener to decide either to empathize or situate oneself in the entirety of the album.<br /><br /> Lucky for those who stayed, \\"Keep The Car Running\\" picks up the albums pace albeit with lyrics that inspire a bored landscape filled with existential paranoia. Butler's voice lends an homage to early David Byrne yet the orchestration of the band's seven other members carves a wall of sound that even Phil Spector wouldn't kill someone over.<br /><br /> Slowing down, the monotonous slur of \\"Neon Bible\\" might put some to sleep but its musical Novocain and by now the album takes on this Dante-esque roll of furthering a descent into guilty madness by leaving the listeners to drown in the \\"Ocean of Noise.\\"  Drummer Jeremy Gara's simple and melodic percussion dances with what one can only imagine is Richard Reed Parry's beautiful piano work.<br /><br /> When most of the songs take off in Neon Bible, they usually end in a bed of flowers.<br /><br /> \\"Black Waves/ Bad Vibrations\\" starts off like a warped Kraftwerk tune if only Deborah Harry fronted the whole schlemiel yet builds and builds on a momentum that starts branching the album out and into the anthemic tracks like the sing-a-long, cover of their own song, \\"No Cars Go\\" or their single but not a single, \\"Intervention.\\"<br /><br /> Ironically, the black velvet toting Canadians happened upon an album filled with a morbid self curiosity that takes a look on religion and broken family life. Neon Bible hits Americana in areas Bruce Springsteen only graced upon which is a mistake Brandon Flowers might pine over.<br /><br /> Neon Bible is a trip and the problem with it might be that it takes time to grow into. It doesn't have a \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" that immediately hooks you in and holds you and it isn't as accessible as Funeral; however, it brilliantly pans out into a spectacular follow up that modern bands today should take note of.<br /><br /> The hype might be right here, The Arcade Fire carries the torch.owers.  <br /> <br /> \\"Black Waves/ Bad Vibrations\\" starts off like a warped Kraftwerk tune if only Deborah Harry fronted the whole schlemiel yet builds and builds on a momentum that starts branching the album out and into the anthemic tracks like the sing-a-long, cover of their own song, \\"No Cars Go\\" or their single but not a single, \\"Intervention.\\"  <br /> <br /> Ironically, the black velvet toting Canadians happened upon an album filled with a morbid self curiosity that takes a look on religion and broken family life.

B000006TRV|4.0|Some of my all-time favorite guitar solos (Comfortably Numb, Another Brick II, and Mother) are to be found here, as well as one of my favorite songs, the aforementioned Comfortably Numb. But the percentage of good, 'listenable', music on this large collection is quite low in my opinion. In other words, this isn't an album that you can put on and listen to all the way through if you're in the mood for pure music. Whereas previous albums would feature long, somewhat ethereal musical interludes between, and within, songs, here we have a few good songs tied together by relatively short, strange snippets of lyrics masquerading as songs, mostly sung by Roger Waters, who is simply not in the same league as David Gilmour as a vocalist. In fact, all the best songs here are predominantly sung by Gilmour. <br /> <br />The story being told here is OK, but Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Animals, all accomplished similar goals with much more subletly and far fewer words. The music did most of the talking and that's what made them great albums. <br /> <br />Any fan of Pink Floyd should have this album in their collection. There are some classic songs here, but it is certainly not one of their best works taken as a whole.
0743289412|4.0|Let me start of my saying I've been a Stephen King reader since I was 9 years old and my aunt snuck me a copy of Pet Cemetary.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers, in that this is definitely not typical King writing, but like the majority of his other books, it is a real page turner.  This is the softer side of King, replacing the gore found in other stories with tenderness. Don't get me wrong, the suspense is still there, and you will be holding your breath and biting your nails at times, but you will also feel this peculiar sensation in your chest, a sort of delicate ache.<br /><br />That's what I felt throughout the story.  It's been a while since an author has been able to get me to care so much about a character, but Lisey is such a remarkable woman going through an incredible journey, that you can't help but feel with her and for her.<br /><br />Kings writing is superb, though I will agree with another reviewer, that his constant use of made-up words can be grating.  Still, it doesn't detract from the overall story and his abililty to really draw you in and make you part of it.<br /><br />I have to say, I was sad to say goodbye to Lisey when I finished the last page.  Pick up a copy and I bet you'll feel the same.
B000E5N684|4.0|Sharon Stone in one of her better roles! Her underlying coldness as Catherine Trammel surfaces between scenes where she makes you empathetic, particularly when she wants you to think she's vulnerable.<br /><br />But underneath that calm and calculating mind is a suspected pathological killer and writer, plus bisexual to boot!<br /><br />I enjoyed the scenes of what was suggestive of San Francisco, but have a hard time figuring how Michael Douglas' character as Nick always seems to find a convenient parking spot in front of his building! If you've ever been to the foggy city, you know that's a rare. Adding to the confusion is the scene at the dance club, which is a replica of New York's Limelight Club set in a church...what the heck is that doing is SF?<br /><br />I did find the sets of Trammel's homes to be quite accurate. The Divisadero mansion is something you'd expect to find in that area. The seaside home though was actually filmed on location in Carmel, even though it was suppose to suggest Marin. Aside from that, if you didn't realize that fact, you would have never thought otherwise (except some areas of Marin are not close to water).<br /><br />The ending fades that happened several times was annoying, but it did keep you guessing...was she really the murderess or not?<br /><br />The Ultimate Edition that is unrated shows a tad more nudity, particularly in Michael Douglas' case, but overall adds nothing too significant to the storyline.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be better to see more of Stone and the infamous interview process? That in itself is the gem of the movie.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|This is positively one of the most delightful movies ever produced anywhere!  I have enjoyed this film so many times (countless) since it first premiered in the summer of 1955 (I was 14 at the time) that's it's almost unimaginable.  It's like a piece of artwork, there always to be appreciated and enjoyed. It's like visiting an old friend or even better, <br />a trip back in time to a great period in American Culture and movie making.
0783231202|5.0|Having just seen the new release AMAZING GRACE twice,I revisited AMISTAD for the first time in nine years.Not only has AMISTAD stood the test of time,but it has aged like a wonderful wine does.AMAZING GRACE points out that the slave trade in England was abolished in 1807,and European countries followed suit,as well as the U.S. in following years.What AMISTAD brings to the table is that it's story occured historically in 1839!!!!Just because laws and treaties were enacted did not mean that the slave trade was not still being done.The other point that the miniseries ROOTS also pointed out that,like in AMISTAD,Africa itself had civil war brewing within and that Africans sold other Africans in order to gain support,amunition and power.A most valuable film to be watched and heeded by all.I am so sorry I waited nine years to revisit it. <br />How sad that the film,though acknowledged with four Academy Award nominations,was not rewarded,for what ever reason, with a single win! How Anthony Hopkins and composer John Williams and director Steven Spielberg were not honoured is still an amazement.Another excellent companion film about the slave trade would be A RESPECTABLE TRADE and the 70 minute documentary also entitled AMISTAD.Still,no film has ever conveyed so graphically what slaves aboard the ships endured;thank Steven Spielberg,who also brought us SCHINDLER'S LIST, for keeping us always alerted to the injustices in this world,HOLLYWOODIZED OR NOT!!!!!!!
0380789019|5.0|A must read. Do not listen to the negative reviews. <br />This is still my favorite book of Gaiman's (maybe thats just because I read it first). Honestly it cant be compared with his other books, not because its better or worse but because its very different. <br /> <br />The main character is delightfully human with all the foibles and traits we can find in ourselves and the cast is versatile and entertaining.  <br />People read American Gods and are disappointed with neverwhere, what people don't realize is they are different genres. <br /> <br />Neverwhere is written like an adventure, the plot is fast-paced, intriguing and full of surprises.  <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a well written page turner.
B000066744|4.0|I can't say that I loved the ending, but I was captivated by this film.  The music is, of course, lovely, but it was the cinematography that I thought stunning.  I found myself searching through each scene for something that was a bright, apple-green.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|Feel free to include me with those who probably would not have ever heard of this movie let alone seen it had Ryan Gosling not received the Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. So that is why I saw it and that comes with the expectation that the movie will be bad but the performance will be good. As the movie started I felt the exact opposite. The scenes were short and his character was yet undeveloped, but the plot pulled me in; I was very interested in where it would lead. As the movie progressed, the movie did a great job adding depth to Gosling though the plot went in a strange direction. <br /> <br />The adult language intensifies towards the end of the film, but the real reason to be wary of Half Nelson is the vivid drug-use scenes. Mr. Dunne's extracuricular chemical dependency is very important to his character and the movie and the creators did not shy away from it. This is not a child-friendly movie and while even I was uncomfortable a few times, I really liked it. <br /> <br />I think Ryan Gosling has really put himself on the acting map. This performance and obviously the nomination should really give him the opportunity to establish himself as one of the best young talents in the business. I would love to see him sustain this level of performance. <br /> <br />Half Nelson is not for everyone. There is drug abuse and abusive language. Ryan Gosling was deserving of his nomination, and you may become familiar with the name Shareeka Epps after her performance as well. I was hooked early by the story though I had to sort my thoughts out at the end before I realized how much I liked the movie. It had some impressive artistic merit and many good things to take away from it.

B0002TX4QQ|2.0|Our book Club just finished this book and the overall concensus was that it was a negative book about motherhood, family, kids and the United States.  We felt that there may be people like Eva, Kevin, Franklin but it is unrealistic that they might be in the same family.  It is our guess that the author never has had children.  We tried to find a likeable character or one that could be admired and we came up with zero.  Many people in our book club didn't finish the book, as they felt they could spend the time reading a more inspiring and interesting book.
0375713751|2.0|Any working mother--or, to be more precise, any mother who has a job outside the home--can identify with Kate Reddy, a woman who seems to have it all (a great job, a good marriage, and two beautiful, healthy children) and constantly hears the sound of balls crashing while she attempts to balance the demands of her seemingly-perfect life. <br /> <br />Allison Pearson's portrayal of Kate is realistic and, for the most part, engaging. But I hated the end of the novel. Millions of women around the world manage--albeit with difficulty and great sacrifices--to balance marriage, children and career. Allison Pearson does. I do. So do many of my girlfriends. Why can't Kate Reddy do it too? <br />
0143034901|5.0|When I read this novel, I couldn't believe it.  It was, quite possibly, the best thing I had ever read.

B000EGFVQS|2.0|The Lovely Bones is really a series of character studies. The story kind of meanders along and there's not much resolution. Don't pick up this book thinking it's a mystery that will be solved. The focus of the story is how the protagonist's death changes her family.

You can't put into words the kind of writing that Setterfield attains. <br /> <br />Vida Winter wants to tell one final story, her story, before she dies.

But the writer taking down her story, has a story of her own, to be figured out along the way....which is all part of Ms. Winter's plan.   <br /> <br />The story alone is enough to make me want to buy several copies to give out to friends and family, then the writing and emotions on top of that!  That only thing I can say is read this book....you won't be disappointed at all!
0374105235|5.0|A tragic tale of human redemption, all the more powerful for being true. Ishmael's story is a testament to our common humanity and to how a young man dragged down into the depths of madness by those around him claws his way back to sanity by means of the love of those around him and in his own heart.  <br /> <br />It is a profoundly hopeful message, especially in these cynical times. But the book left me with two questions. Where did the money come from that fueled the destruction that engulfed Ishmael's life and all of Sierra Leone? Only with western dollars and with western weapons was this possible, and to that extent we are all guilty and responsible for these events. And the second question, of course, is where did the madness come from that rose up and annihilated the wise and gentle culture that Ishmael depicts?  <br /> <br />This work is destined to become a perennial favorite, and Ishmael a paragon of courage, strength and indomitable human spirit. Everyone should read this book. <br /> <br />

B00005JMJG|5.0|The New Yorker reviewer (above) might be better suited for hard news; he obviously doesn't have much understanding of imaginative art.  He should at least remember the cliche that artists use lies to reveal truth.  He criticizes \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" for being \\"implausible\\" -- hmm, doesn't seem to have hurt the reputation of \\"The Tempest\\" or \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\"  I think maybe that reviewer should watch the bloody thing eight more times, if that's what it takes to get it.  I was blown away (and admittedly a bit confused, making me want to watch it again) the first time I saw it.  <br /> <br />Charlie Kaufman has borrowed a little from the best sci-fi by altering a bit of reality to help him examine the human condition.  This isn't a linear story, it's a meditation on love, fate, regrets, choice, and second chances - if you knew how it turns out, would you do it again?  And he may have answered the old question about whether we can choose who to fall in love with. And I may have to watch the movie again to really get under the surface of what happens in the lengthy sequence as Carey's & Winslett's character travel through his memories as he tries to hang on to her memory.  <br /> <br />I think Carey and Winslett both give incredible performances, along with Kirstin Dunst.  If nothing else, Kaufman, Gondry, and the cast do a remarkable job of revealing how fragile we all are - even the guy who's raiding Clementine's memories of Joel to woo her for himself comes across more sad then creepy.  This is, ultimately, a very tender film. When I read Dickens or Shakespeare, I sometimes get a sense of the author's genuine affection for the characters he's created, and I get that same feeling from this film.
B000M4RG42|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone except countries that hate America.  It is a complete insult to the Marine Corps and and insult to<br /><br />Ira Hayes and any Indian.

0393327655|4.0|\\"The End of Faith\\" is a book about the dangers of unfounded belief. Beliefs are kinds of representations of the world that serve as \\"levers\\" for action. To use one of Harris' examples, imagine for a moment, that you have the belief that the life of someone whom you love is endangered. This belief represents a certain highly negative potential state of the world and if this belief has any credence it will have instant and powerful consequences for your physiology and behavior. Thus, beliefs serve as guides or principles of action - they have a potent causal connection with behavior.  <br /> <br />Normally, our beliefs have built-in constraints. One of these constraints is that our beliefs need to logically cohere as best as possible in any given situation and the other is that our beliefs have to stand in a certain relation to events in the external world. These constraints prevent us from engaging in excessive wishful thinking.  <br /> <br />These constraints are in effect in all the areas of our rational discourse. However, in our culture a partition separates religion from the rest of our discourse. Religious faith represents a breakdown in the constraints that we normally impose on our beliefs. The faithful are taught to accept the truth of certain propositions (propositions of the utmost importance, such as what happens to us after we die) without direct evidence. To have faith is considered a `virtue' and those who are the most faithful (i.e., the most accepting of the truth of these propositions in the absence of evidence) are the most virtuous. As Sam Harris puts it: \\"Faith is what credulity becomes when it has achieved escape velocity from the constraints of terrestrial discourse--constraints like reasonableness, internal coherence, civility and candor.\\" [Not that religious people feel indifferent toward potential evidence; they simply discredit the evidence that does not agree with what they wish to believe and latch onto a variety of other purported `proofs']. It should be pointed out that secular faith is equally as dangerous as religious faith, but religion just happens to offer a particularly bountiful trove of unfounded beliefs. <br /> <br />As Sam Harris so capably argues, the time has come to openly criticize religious dogma. In fact, we have an ethical obligation to do so, because it is impossible (in the long run) that a progressive, civil society can co-exist with the tenets of religious dogma. Sam Harris focuses his critique largely on the main Western religious dominations - Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Each of these religions possesses its own set of scriptures and these scriptures are mutually exclusive. Some portions of these scriptures no doubt address genuine spiritual and moral dilemmas of mankind but it must also be admitted that large portions of the scriptures are relics of our ancestors' ignorance and that they foster xenophobia, murderous intolerance and dubious moral precepts (one need only browse some of the passages from the books of Deuteronomy and Leviticus). Those people who follow these scriptures to the letter are religious fundamentalists and we are rightly worried about their access to 21st century weapons and technology. <br /> <br />A popular compromise stance is to say that there is no one right religion, that they are all equally valid and deserve to be granted the same respect. This stance is called religious moderation. The stance of religious moderates is untenable however and Sam Harris does a commendable job of showing just how bankrupt and problematic religious moderation can be. The problem with religious moderation is that it is an intellectually disingenuous enterprise. Only a calculated cherry-picking of scripture can justify the myth of religious `modernity': \\"The moderation we see among nonfundamentalists is not some sign that faith itself has evolved; it is, rather, the product of many hammer blows of modernity that have exposed certain tenets of faith to doubt.\\" <br /> <br />Religious moderation is also problematic to the extent that it draws the partition that separates religion from the rest of our rational discourse and forestalls criticism of it. According to religious moderates it is deeply impolitic to criticize other people's religious faith. Some of the arguments that religious moderates marshal out in support of their position include the idea that people should have the freedom of belief and that beliefs are private matters.   <br /> <br />Freedom of belief is a deeply misguided idea. Beliefs need to be conditioned by evidence. You wouldn't want your physician to have any freedom of belief in terms of what causes a disease - beliefs need to map onto the world in potentially demonstrable ways. If a person wants to believe something wildly improbable he has only exercised his freedom to be a fool. Similarly, beliefs are not necessarily private matters. Beliefs, acting as principles of action, enter the public sphere all the time. When a suicide bomber destroys himself and others on the basis of certain intrinsically dangerous religious beliefs, then those beliefs have by definition entered the public sphere and deserve to be severely criticized.  <br /> <br />Another popular argument among religious moderates is to defend religion by maintaining that religious faith motivates people to do good things. There are instances in which this is true and in which religious texts do enunciate sound ethical principles, but our moral sense does not spring from those religious texts. As Sam Harris points out, it is not necessary to believe extraordinary claims about the nature of our Universe in order to do good things.  <br /> <br />\\"The End of Faith\\" is a bit of a mixed-bag. Sam Harris often jumps from one topic to another and his arguments sometimes take seemingly unnecessary digressions. Some of his musings, such as those on potential `pre-emptive' nuclear strikes, seem a bit bizarre and sensationalist. He also has a tendency to over-simplify complicated socio-political issues at times. However, despite some of these drawbacks, \\"The End of Faith\\" is undoubtedly an important book that deserves to be read by people. Read it and make up your own mind about it.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who goes about his daily life surrounded with structure and numbers until one day he begins to hear a woman's voice narrating the mundane details of his existence. When the narrator in question reveals that Harold will die soon, he begins a frantic search to find the woman in question and get her to change her story before he meets his end.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Emma Thompson as Kay Eiffel, the writer and narrator whose voice provides the backdrop for Harold's story. Queen Latifah as the assistant sent by Eiffel's publisher to help her find a way to kill Harold Crick. Dustin Hoffman as a literary theorist who attempts to help Harold figure out just who is the woman behind the voice. And Maggie Gyllenhaal as the neurotic baker who Harold begins auditing just as his life starts to fall apart. And<br /><br />Stranger Than Fiction was equal parts comedy and drama, but it managed to balance between the two rather seamlessly. At no point was the film overwhelmingly funny, but it wasn't ever outright depressing either. As a whole, it was just entertaining and fun to watch. It was nice to see Will Ferrell play a different character from the outrageously funny comedian I've come to associate with him. The way he and Maggie Gyllenhaal's characters play off one another was one of the funniest parts of the film, and their relationship was a joy to watch. At one point in his attempts to woo her he forgoes the traditional flower route and instead brings her flours, (eg, barley flour, pastry flour) since she's a baker. In this way, and many others, this movie was cute and romantic while at the same time being insightful and amusing. I'd recommend Stranger than Fiction for a relaxing night in when you're in the mood to be thoroughly entertained but can't decide between a drama or a comedy.
0571179924|5.0|It has been a long time since I fell on such a good book. Interesting characters intertwine in a decisive decade for Vegas. The story is based on the real life of Frank (Lefty) Rosenthal who left his mark in the gambling industry.<br /><br />Money, power, greed, lust, and crime with flair intertwine in seventies' Sin City. Pileggi is a natural born story-teller who knows how to make it all work and keep you glued to the book with every turn of the page. The writing is style is spot on. It's so hard to find contemporary literature written with such a simple language, yet capable of conveying an intriguing story.<br /><br />The fact that I had only seen bits and pieces of the movie, also helped. I could place the faces of De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone behind the characters while still enjoying the novelty of getting acquainted with the story for the real time.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anybody who is interested in recent history, the mob, and the gambling industry overall.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|Why are my disks skipping?????!!!!! Some of them skip a lot, then start to play normal as if to tease you, then start skipping and freezing again. And I stand confirmed, Season 3 Episode 3 (Attack of the 5'10\\" Women) WILL NOT PLAY AT ALL!!!!!!!! I do have to go through EVERY SINGLE episode (that is an all day event) to see which disks I am having a problem with before I contact HBO, Amazon, the Better Business Bureau and who ever else needs to be notified.  <br /> <br />If you love the show, spend the dough, it's worth it.

Without a doubt, this was the most compelling book I've come across and I cannot recommend it enough. Had it been on the shelf sooner, we would've cited from it hundreds of times in Skinny Bitch. <br /> <br />Astounding, life-changing information is perfectly conveyed in the most readable, accessible language. <br /> <br />If you eat, The China Study is a must read.

B000KQGP2G|2.0|I looked forward to hearing this album for a long time. I love all prior albums, but I was so depressed after playing this one. The band has always had a lot to say and has always done it creatively, but this is just anger and hate - with no solutions and no hope. Maybe this is a reason why Daniel is no longer with The Flower Kings - his worldview and theirs completely clash. If you are new to PoS, start with The Perfect Element and buy this one last, if ever.  If you are looking for upbeat progressive rock, buy Paradox Hotel by The Flower Kings. <br /> <br />Musically, and I stress only musically, the first half has grown on me somewhat.  The second half sounds like a bunch of B-sides - they are just not up to PoS standard. Enter Rain, the \\"epic\\", is just plain boring.  If you are used to putting in a PoS CD and loving it start-to-finish, well, you might not with this one.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|The Arcade Fire are the most important band of our era. This album only confirms this in my mind. I had faith (excuse the pun) in Neon Bible from the moment it was announced, but its a seemingly impossible task to follow an album like Funeral. Any doubts that this band is for real should now be put to rest. <br /> <br />Neon Bible is perhaps an even more cohesive album than Funeral was, but it will probably stand as being an extremely solid followup album that continues their legacy but doesn't necessarily eclipse their debut. Not half bad though, right? <br /> <br />Its an obsession-worthy album from an obsession-worthy band. Thats all you really have to know.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|The CD is awesome, however the DVD did nothing less than blow me away.  It had me grinning like a schoolboy, and I loved every minute of it.  Some may complain that it didn't have enough uninterrupted songs on the DVD, but that is what made it great.  The treat of listening to the wisdom and insight of men (and woman) that have been through so much in their lives, is a true pleasure.  This album and DVD are historical in their content, and you will simply feel \\"good\\" when you have come to the end of it.  While I truly liked KWS's \\"The Place I'm In\\", I am extremely grateful that he has found his way back home.
B00005JPG1|5.0|Brilliantly shot, strong character development, tight direction, and a tense whodunit plot--what more could you ask for? <br /> <br />\\"Zodiac\\" is definely not a teenager in-peril slasher pic, thank God. It is talky, non-gory, and quite lengthy. But, the length is necessary to set up great character development. By the end of the film, you know exactly almost everything about every character. KUDOS to the screenwriter and director for this. <br /> <br />As I have stated, except for the first murder, there is very little gore. The lakeside murders are extremely gruesome and a little hard to watch.  <br /> <br />If you like to THINK during a film, then \\"Zodiac\\" is your movie. The interaction between law enforcement and the press is amazing to behold. You see the flaws the police make and the frustrating attempts to find and bring the killer to justice.  <br /> <br />All in all, a great \\"grown-up\\" mystery thriller---one that demands repeat viewings to take it all in. And believe me, it WILL be worth it.
B0001N9ZKW|5.0|Even for an album released in 1974, on the surface \\"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight\\" seems deeply unhip. In the year when glam rock was at its peak and punk godmother Patti Smith released her first angry single, Richard and Linda Thompspon put out this album of English folk music. Some of the songs, such as \\"Down Where the Drunkards Roll\\" or \\"Little Beggar Girl\\" are so deeply rooted in the Anglo-Celtic folk tradition that it would easy to imagine they date from the eighteenth century. And yet this is part of the strength of this remarkable album. Largely unswayed by the fashions of the moment, the Thompsons produced an album of beautifully crafted and performed folk and folk-rock songs which have stood the test of time.<br />This is not the kind of album that has one knock-out punch. Yes, \\"The Calvary Cross\\" and \\"End of the Rainbow\\" are especially strong tracks but really this album's greatest strength is its consistency. There is not a single weak track here. Another strength is its variety of approaches and styles. \\"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight\\" is a comparitively upbeat track. It is almost a rocker compared to some of the folkier arrangements. But then there are moody, haunting ballads like \\"The Great Valerio\\", which showcase Linda's exceptional voice. And some of the tracks showcase Richard's virtuosity on the electric guitar but, unlike so many mainstream seventies rock acts, never to excess.<br />This album will appeal to anyone who likes intelligently written and heartfelt music. It will no doubt still be around when a lot more faddish albums have dropped by the wayside.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Having seen the film several times, the essential point is that Pitt's performance is brilliant. As described better in a spotlight review, his fight choreography is executed with grace and raw power. He doesn't need dialog to convey his intention in a scene. Few mention the inspired casting of Brian Cox. Who would have thought of it? The role is pure Brian Blessed, and yet Cox transforms himself into a thundering mound of menace. I like the film, and certainly recommend it. It's not east to read the Iliad, but the rage of Achilles is the point of both the poem and the film. Bana is surprising in holding up against Pitt. Bloom as usual is a wimp. But the film's the thing, and it's a good one.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|Not a terrible \\"documentary\\" really... <br /> <br />But I was blown away that Gore spent an hour and a half talking about the dangers of increased CO2 in the atmosphere, but barely talks about the main SOURCES of CO2 and other greenhouse gases around the world. <br /> <br />He mentions burning coal in passing, but doesn't even touch on the fact that cattle farms around the world are ENORMOUS contributors of CO2 and methane (in fact, they are the source of 18% of all greenhouse gases). Cattle farms also have a huge impact on water quality world-wide.  <br /> <br />(Read the recent United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report, if you want to learn more.) <br /> <br />If Gore truly believed his own theories, he would be a militant vegan. And he certainly wouldn't fly in private planes or own 5 enormous homes.  <br /> <br />But Gore's not a vegan. He wants to be president. That means winning votes in cattle country. The evironmental movement is just a stepping stone for him.  <br /> <br />Hypocrite!
B000GRUMPU|4.0|Disaster flicks were in their heyday during the 1970s.  Before the days of computerized visual effects, the big disaster films at times dazzled with what seemed to be impossible visuals and generated guffaws with some very cheesy effects.  Their fans loved all of it because they never took themselves seriously and it was more like a ride at an amusement park than anything like real life.  Even being scared was about having fun.<br /><br />This remake of the original \\"Poseidon Adventure\\" is much more serious in its intent.  Of course, the computer graphics make the images seem incredibly real and that does draw us in.  We think we feel the heat from the fires, the chill of the water, the panic of being trapped in the vents, our lungs burn for air as we swim underwater with the characters in the movie.<br /><br />We don't get the same characters that were in the first movie.  I won't discuss how the roles map or don't map onto each other, but I will say that in making all this more real, the director and writers made the people less distinguishable from each other.  Sometimes it is hard to tell who it is that is crying or screaming or whatever.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is terrific as Robert Ramsey, former fireman, former mayor of New York.  I think he is a widower, because he has no wife, but I don't remember that being explained amid all the noise.  He is on a cruise with his daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), and her boyfriend / fianc&eacute;e, Christian (Mike Vogel).  As always, there is tension between the father and daughter and the potential son-in-law (at the beginning of the film, the dad doesn't know how far along their intentions to get married are).<br /><br />Josh Lucas plays the mysterious Dylan Johns.  Since learning about this guys is a very interesting part of the movie, I don't want to discuss the character or what he does.  However, I do want to say that I loved seeing Andre Braugher on screen as Captain Bradford.  He plays the role with just the right amount of authority that an officer needs to lead people, especially in an incredible disaster.  Braugher also plays Bradford with enough humanity to endear him to us.<br /><br />The rest of the cast I will leave you to discover.  While they aren't as vividly drawn as they are in the first film, they are more compatible with the apparent desire to make such an impossible system seem more \\"real\\".<br /><br />While the comments I heard when the movie came out indicated to me that the film wasn't worth seeing, I think it more worthwhile than I had thought.  However, you have to take it for what it is.  It isn't \\"serious\\" (and who needs that all the time), and it isn't \\"real\\", but it is a good couple of hours of adventure.right amount of authority that an officer needs to lead people, especially in an incredible disaster.

B00005NI5Y|3.0|It's a testament to Dylan's sheer talent and to his sidemen that this album manages to succeed despite the near-total destruction of his voice (which wasn't strong to begin with).  At times, it's grating and painful to listen to; occasionally, it's world-weary and oddly endearing. <br /> <br />While I like the majority of tracks on Love and Theft, I can't say any stand out in my mind as being particularly remarkable, especially in light of Dylan's long and storied career.  This one might sit closer to 2 1/2 stars.

B00008DDHZ|5.0|This is a superb movie and one that I will use in future training for my soldiers and officers.  Having done riot control on several occasions I can tell you that the military scenes are absolutely realistic.  The movie does very well portraying the chos and uncertainty of this type of operation. <br /> <br />The massacre scenes went on for too long. The actual shooting that day didn't last more than a few minutes.  The number of soldiers that were present could have inflicted 26 casualties on a crowd like that in a matter of seconds. <br /> <br />Its so easy to lose control in chaos like that.  Leaders really have to keep an eye on their people to keep them from getting trigger happy. <br /> <br />Having said that - the marchers don't get much sympathy from me.  \\"Let's go throw rocks at the Army.... that'l show em.\\" or \\"There's a riot 200 meters away from us but we'll just stand here and listen to our less than bright parade leader because we know that riot can't effect us....\\"  Real Darwin award stuff. <br /> <br />When you do something like that you place your life in the hands of the guy with the gun you're throwing rocks at.  Your only hope is that his discipline holds. <br /> <br />This movie is a great tutorial on what happens when that doesnt occur <br /> <br />
B000JRYNXE|4.0|Gwen is showing us that she may not win the Grammys but she is a superstar with staying power.  Though a tad below Hariku Lovers, it shows that Gwen doesn't need No Doubt to be great (her single style is more \\"pop\\" than the more \\"metal\\" No Doubt sound).  She announced that her next project is with No Doubt.  I hope that she continues to do both solo and group stuff.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This is an excellent film made and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.  In \\"Crash\\"-like fashion, the movie interweaves the lives of 4 different families which are affected/involved in an incident involving the shooting of an American tourist Susan (played by Cate Blanchett) who is accompanied by her husband Richard (Brad Pitt) while on vacation in Morocco.  The other 3 families involve the boys in Morocco who did the shooting involving a Winchester rifle that was given as a gift to their father, the nanny (an outstanding Oscar nominated performance by Adriana Barraza) of Susan & Richard's two children who makes a fateful decision to bring the children to her son's wedding in Mexico, and the Japanese girl Chieko (played by Rinko Kikuchi in another outstanding performance) and her father, who was the one who gave the rifle away as a gift.      Other reviewers have done an excellent job of describing the story, so I won't repeat that here.  I want to comment on the subtle social commentary that is inherent in this film which I found very intriguing.      1) The discrepancy on the value of human life of the American tourist Susan versus the way the lives of the Moroccan family are viewed.  So much attention was paid to the treatment of the American tourist even by the onlooking Moroccan villagers while the local authorities harshly treat the parents of the two boys involved in the shooting. So, if Moroccan villagers happen to get killed, would it be a big deal at all or would it be a bigger deal that an American tourist was being shot at?  Was the director trying to comment on the disparity of how human value and worth are viewed across different cultures?  This disparity of the view of human value and worth is definitely a consequence of the \\"Babel\\" story in Genesis 11.     2) The snow-balling effects of a bad decision    The Japanese businessman decides to give the Winchester rifle to his local guide, who happens to be the father of the two Moroccan boys who didthe shooting;  Richard (Brad Pitt) decides to take his wife Susan (Cate Blanchett) to a vacation(!) in Morocco; the Moroccan boys decide to shoot at the American tourist bus instead of jackals;  the nanny does not know what to do with taking care of the two children so she brings them with her to her son's wedding in Mexico.  Each of these decisions have very dramatic and significant consequences, as you'll see.     Another effect of \\"Babel\\" in Gen. 11 is confusion.  There is a lot of confused thinking which leads to dramatic consequences.     3) The effect of trauma upon children    Each of the families involved will face a traumatic event which involves the children.      The confusion of Gen. 11 affects future generations, hence the effect of trauma upon children : we see the distorted thinking of the Moroccan boy who is responsible for the shooting (he might actually grow up to be a terrorist for all we know), and the confused sense of reality exhibited by the Japanese girl Chieko.      4) The unifying factor of love      This movie speaks of the way all the confusion and division of Babel can be healed and reversed.  The confusion & division in the biblical story is due to the selfish, self-glorifying actions of the participants involved, which leads to the confusion of languages and scattering of families.  Sure, there are communication breakdowns in this movie which happen across cultures.  However, the one unifying factor that we see in this movie is genuine love and understanding.  Genuine love and understanding care speaks a common language that is understood beyond all cultures and ethnicities.  (SPOILER ALERT: the following statements may reveal significant story/plot points in the film:)    a) The caring hospitality of the Moroccan tour guide in the bus (and his relatives) helps to heal the situation involving the American tourists.      b) The caring understanding of one of the Japanese detectives makes a very big difference upon the Japanese girl Chieko    The love and care of these individuals are the bright spots in this movie, which otherwise is filled with sadness and tragedy.     I believe the director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is trying to emphasize that the hope of redeeming and healing racism, social inequality, and family trauma is the outpouring of genuine love and understanding.      I give a big thumbs up to the great acting in this movie:  Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Adriana Barraza, and Rinko Kikuchi all give outstanding performances.  Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has made a very substantial drama with biting social commentary.     The only big drawback of this DVD is the total lack of special features.  Why isn't there any featurettes which interview the cast/director/crew and give a behind-the-scenes look at the film?      I deleted one star due to the poor DVD features.  Otherwise, I enjoyed this movie a lot.      (Also, a cautionary note to viewers who might be sensitive to this:  there is a lot of nudity in this film, esp. involving scenes with the Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi)

B000ICM5VW|4.0|I won't go into the story, other reviewers have done that to death. But what I will do is echo what others have said about the image, sound and clarity of the HD-DVD version. If you have just purchased a HD-DVD player and HDTV, this is the movie to get. The jungle scenes alone are breathtaking in their clarity, color and sharpness. You can nearly count the raindrops as they are falling from the sky! Where HD-DVD becomes too good is in some of the special effects shots, especially during the stampede. In the conventional DVD, the scene is flat and everything blends well. In the HD-DVD version, the sharpness brings the actors forward from the background, almost 3D-like, and you can distinctly tell they are working with green screen. While this seems to be a complaint, it is really kuddos for HD-DVD, but the reason for the 4 stars. As more directors, editors and SFX houses go to full digital film making, they will also have to invent better ways to create these types of effects.<br /><br />I have also compaired Blu-Ray v HD-DVD and have found that HD-DVD, when created from a true digital master (such as Kong), is far and away the better of the two formats.

More gore included.<br />SAW II (2005) was a huge success!  When we last left the intense dilemma, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) had beaten Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and through the maze of walls and doors in the warehouse, it was a race against time to find his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) and the other victims. Amanda was the culprit and Eric found himself in the bathroom from SAW (2004). He was trapped, shackled, shut-in and yelling for his life.<br /><br />  The movie begins at the exact frame where SAW II ended.<br />  Officer Kerry (Dina Meyer) can not find Eric (Donnie Wahlberg), but her and Forensic Hoffman (Costas Mandylor)  find the remains of Troy (J. Larose). We are treated with scenes of him shackled with chains embedded into his skin.  Since Kerry is so clever in solving the crime, she too becomes a prisoner of Jigsaw.<br />  We are introduced to two new characters: Lynn and Jeff.<br />  Lynn (Bahar Soomekh),who is a doctor, is captured in the hospital locker room by someone wearing a pig head. By Amanda (Shawnee Smith) she is brought to Jigsaw John, who is gravely ill lying in a hospital bed in a new secret place, the Gideon warehouse.  He wants Lynn to help him live. A collar device is put over her. There are 5 cocked gun barrels on this collar. If Jigsaw John's heart rate flat lines or she moves out of range, she will die at the same time as him.<br />  A man, Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), is trapped in a crate box. Jeff escapes and as he wonders through the warehouse, finds other people in deadly traps, Danica (Debra McCabe), Judge Halden (Barry Flatman) and Timothy (Mpho Koaho). He has his own series of tests to go through. That's part of the game.<br /><br />  For SAW fans, new footage: Amanda will reflect upon how she became involved with Jigsaw John and then preparing for the first game we saw in SAW (2004).<br /><br />Also in the cast: Alan Van Sprang, Niamh Wilson, Betsy Russell, Mark Poyser, Bill Vibert, Kim Roberts, Zoe Heath.<br /><br />Contains female frontal nudity.<br /><br />  Costas Mandylor appears as &#34;Forensic Hoffman&#34; in SAW 3.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|This movie is a comedy and a subtly satirical piece at the same time. The main thread is the journey of a child, Olive, and her family to a girls' beauty pageant several hundred miles away in California. <br />The main comic elements at first are Olive's family members and their neurotic interactions with one another. Indeed, not a single one of them seems to not have some kind of serious problem. However, as the journey progresses and challenges of all kinds arise, it becomes clear that no matter how hilarious the characters remain, their environment and the pageant Olive will compete at are by far more abstruse, not to say perverted. Olive's family members realize that the love that ties them together proves to be stronger than their worries and problems. <br /> <br />In this light, it seems absolutely ridiculous that this movie should be rated 'R'. The movie simply makes no compromise when it comes to depicting characters that may as well exist outside of fiction. It also makes a viewer realize (again?) that their family is not the only one with perks.
B00003CX9S|5.0|David Lynch is quite possibly the most underappreciated director in cinematic history.  Time and time again he has crafted baffling, fascinatingly intricate works of art that time and time again have been shunned by critics too small-minded to appreciate the beauty of Lynch's films.  Still, there is one that was universally acknowledged as the masterwork it is: THE ELEPHANT MAN, Lynch's finest work.  In 1979, impressed by Lynch's horrifying debut ERASERHEAD, Mel Brooks hired Lynch to direct a cinematic telling of the tale of Joseph Merrick, frequently mistakenly referred to as \\"John\\", a mistake repeated in this film.  With only one prior film under his belt, David Lynch crafted a masterpiece that ranks among the very finest films ever made, as well as the single most moving thing I have ever seen. <br /> <br />Anthony Hopkins portrays Dr. Frederick Treves, a young and ambitious surgeon at the London Hospital who hears talk of a hideously deformed man being showcased at a local freakshow as \\"The Elephant Man\\".  Recognizing a potential subject for fascinating research, Treves takes the man from his horridly-abusive \\"business partner\\" (Freddie Jones) and places him the London Hospital.  Though the hospital staff is, naturally, initially opposed to the idea (do we not fear what we do not understand?), they gradually warm to the \\"Elephant Man\\" when Treves discovers, to everyone's immense shock, that the man is in fact a very intelligent and polite 21-year-old Englishman named John Merrick (John Hurt).  Treves and Merrick become close friends while Treves studies Merrick's terrible disease, but though the public comes to see Merrick as a sort of hero, there are still those all too willing to treat him as a freak. <br /> <br />THE ELEPHANT MAN is one of the few cinematic masterpieces with a story as captivating as the film itself.  The story is very historially accurate, as is the makeup for John Merrick.  No doubt this is a major reason of why THE ELEPHANT MAN is so profoundly tragic a film - it all happened.  It's all real.  Angry mobs did chase that poor, kind soul, and sleazy, utterly despicable rats of men did exploit his misfortune for their own profit.  He was abused, and ridiculed, and yet through it all he remained upbeat, and a heartbreakingly intelligent and polite young man.  Though his face is hidden beneath layer upon layer of makeup, John Hurt's performance as Merrick is excellent, and though \\"wonderful\\" would be a fitting adjective, it just doesn't seem right for this circumstance. <br /> <br />Anthony Hopkins delivers what may the finest performance of his career, possibly surpassed only by his legendary performance as Hannibal Lecter in Demme's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  His character is admirably set on doing what's right and touchingly and sincerely caring for Mr. Merrick.  In the scene in which Hopkins first encounters Merrick in a basement, he looks absolutely heartbroken and sheds one single, streaming tear; this may very well be one of the greatest scenes in movie history. <br /> <br />Heading up the supporting cast is Anne Bancroft, playing a beautiful actress who immediately befriends Merrick.  A testament to the movie's power is that we feel like we know these characters, particularly Bancroft.  We do not root for her character; we appreciate and are grateful for her kind attitude toward Mr. Merrick. <br /> <br />As wonderful as the actors are, this film could simply not exist without the masterful directing of David Lynch.  Though this is one of his more linear works, it is still distinctly Lynchian, from the surreal opening sequence to the marvelously poetic finish.  Those who were bold enough to endure ERASERHEAD may notice that THE ELEPHANT MAN feels like a sort of companion piece to that film.  Both films were shot in a sort of nightmarish black-and-white, both films feature an enhanced soundtrack highlighting the sound of the wind whisping and mechanical clunks in the background, and both films highlight industrial settings and workers.  Lynch's attention to every single detail, no matter how seemingly unimportant or simple, his appreciation for every little thing in life, is a perfect fit for this film.  Though he may have made films more fascinating or deep, David Lynch never made one finer than THE ELEPHANT MAN, his own gothic, romantic tragedy. <br /> <br />Another aspect that will remain in viewers' minds well after the film's end is Samuel Barber's \\"Adagio for Strings\\", one of the most provoking and sorrowfully beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard, which was similarly used six years later in Oliver Stone's PLATOON.  \\"Adagio\\" is the song that plays through the film's final moments, and it is the ultimate opus for John Merrick.  I guarantee that after seeing this film, your eyes will tear whenever \\"Adagio for Strings\\" is played. <br /> <br />Though it will always be one of film's great tragedies that David Lynch never receives the praise he so rightly deserves, it is fitting that at least one of his films, Lynch's own handmade tragedy, received the attention it deserved.  Although the film was (unsurprisingly) unrecognized in the 1981 Academy Awards, THE ELEPHANT MAN has come to be regarded as one of the finest films ever made.  It is indeed one of the all-time great cinematic masterpieces, and Lynch's masterwork.  I doubt that I will ever encounter anything that will move me so profoundly as Joseph Merrick and David Lynch's tale of THE ELEPHANT MAN.

0142000671|5.0|It took me a measly three hours but yesterday afternoon I read for the first time John Steinbeck's classic tragedy `Of Mice and Men', a novel that, while written in 1937, still holds so true today.  Steinbeck's accounting of sheer loneliness and desperation is so brilliantly captured that the reader is brought to tears (for me in a literal sense) to realize that this is all these people had to live for, a pipe dream that refused to die.  The story focuses mainly on George Milton and Lennie Small, but as you read you'll notice that a few supporting characters play a big role in the heartbreak that this novel conveys.<br /><br />George is a small framed man, lean and dwarfed in comparison to his companion Lennie, the tall large strong man, but what Lennie has in strength and size he lacks in smarts.  He is, for lack of another word, mentally retarded.  But Lennie does possess a simple soul and a heart of gold, which alone makes this tale all the more tragic.  George, in fulfillment of a promise he made to Lennie's Aunt Clare, takes care of Lennie, taking him with him to work in the fields bucking wheat and the like.  When they make it to their next job they find that they aren't the only ones trying to find a better lot in life.<br /><br />First they meet Candy, an older man who's been injured on the job and thus kept around for sympathy's sake.  He sweeps the living areas and lives his life one miserable day at a time.  He's slipping into uselessness and the very thought of amounting to nothing digs deeper and deeper into his soul.  Crooks is the negro stable hand, an outcast from the others not only because of his skin color but also because of his disability, being crippled due to a horse accident (he was kicked in the back) and thus he spends most of his time alone in his room.  They also meet the boss's son Curly, a jerk of a man who is so insecure about his size and his marriage that he's willing to throw it down with anyone he sees, and he sets the blunt of his rage on poor Lennie because of his size and his demeanor.<br /><br />To me the most interesting and even heartbreaking character is that of Curly's wife.  Ostracized by the working men because of her husbands temper and disregarded by her own husband because of his carelessness and blatant jealousy she's left all alone with no one to talk to and no real place to call home.  She's regarded by the men as a tart, a floozy who wants all the wrong kinds of attention but in all actuality she just wants any kind of attention she can get for any kind is better than no kind.  After the tragic circumstances involving Lennie and Curly's wife the author makes a statement that to me sums up this poor woman when he says that \\"all the meanness and the planning's and the discontent and the ache for attention were all gone from her face.\\"  She was alone and desperate just like everyone else.<br /><br />The one thing that kept these stock of characters going, Lennie in particular, was the prospect of getting out, of getting their own place where they could plant and cultivate and \\"tend rabbits\\" and be their own men.  When this idea is shared between Candy and Crooks they too jump at the idea of getting away from it all and feeling whole again, feeling complete and being far away from the loneliness of it all.  The worst kind of loneliness is the kind you feel even when you're around other people for its then that you know you're truly alone in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Most people are aware of the horrific ending, but in case you are not then I will say nothing further on the subject.  Just know that this novel is one of the finest pieces of American Literature and is sure to bring tears to your eyes.  While this is just barely over 100 pages it still magnificently captures every emotion and feeling that can possibly be provided here.  The characters are brilliantly crafted and their innermost demons are bared all for us to see and to relate.  I will never forget this masterpiece and will recommend this to anyone who enjoys good reading.  It's a quick read, but it's not one to soon be forgotten.forget this masterpiece and will recommend this to anyone who enjoys good reading.  It's a quick read, but it's not one to soon be forgotten.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|we all know it's a great movie, but all the special features is what makes the masterpiece edition the one to get.  sing-a-longs, games, all kinds of stuff...I'm an adult and I love it!

B000KRNCYY|1.0|This CD is a disappointment. The artists are wonderful, but this recording does nothing to showcase their skills. The mix is low-end heavy, vocals are buried and the over-use of reverb is almost laughable. This may have been the result of mixing on overly-bright monitors, but the result is a messy, in-articulate smear of sound that masks the beauty of the performances. The audio on the DVD or the PBS broadcast is far superior.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is the best show. Having the set makes finding and watching your favorite episode so easy. Plus, the box set was much cheaper than buying the seasons individually.
B000002L9Y|4.0|I first had this album on cassette, this is first class from Fleetwood Mac <br />the vocals of Lindsay, Stevie are excellent, the guitar work is superb, I rate this album one of there best & not given the attention it should of, <br />enjoy.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|I watched Saw III in the theaters when it was released on Halloween night with low expectations. Having watched and loved the two previous installments, it was hard for me to think that they could top the outstanding plot-twists in this conclusion. Saw III had me at the edge of my seat the entire time! I liked the fact that the movie was very character driven instead of just relying on the intense amounts of gore the franchize is famous for. The only real problem I noticed in the movie was the less-than-believable acting by some of the characters. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has seen the previous 'Saws'.
B000066C1N|5.0|My three year old girl loves horses.  Spirit is her favorite movie and the cd is her number one choice to listen to.  She knows the words to all the songs and it really is fun to just listen to her sing or hum, even when the music isn't playing.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This movie is hillarious and heart-wrenching at once.  Eugene Hutz is brilliant as \\"Alex\\".  He and Elijah Wood have an awkward chemestry that fits right into their roles.  It's quite different from the book in some ways but  alot of the brilliant monologues were saved.  Also, kudos to the dog who played Sammy Davis Junior Junior.  She made a great seeing[...]
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I think it just sucks because they now have to to prequels to the series.  I guess it's just a product of greed.  They had to do a third one, because the first two were popular.  But they have problems getting all the actors to sign in on it, so it ends up being a blood sport where they kill off more than half the mutants.  I thought it was pretty good, save the fact that now they're only doing movies that will feature single mutants.  I guess it's easier to do those types of movies, with less \\"big name\\" actors, so they wont have to go through the trouble of trying to replace certain people.  Even though there are a lot of actors out there that could do just as good of a job, if not better.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp are the perfect acting one-two punch.  If you have not seen this movie, see it!
B00005NWLO|4.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"One More From the Road\\" captures the bands innovative sound live during the group's ascendancy.  Their following during this time became more than a \\"cult\\" following and after having played on the road for years, their sound became tight and smooth.  They could replicate the studio sound quite easily with some improvisation to boot.
1400079179|5.0|This book is great!  I got it and the movie for Christmas.  I finished the book and then watched the movie.  Hands down the book is far better than the movie.  Actually, I wouldn't recommend watching the movie after reading the book--too much is left out.  As for the book, it was hard to put down.  Unlocking all the codes with Langdon was quite and adventure.  I also found myself looking up some of the clues online to get a more visual effect.

B000E1MTWM|4.0|I have HDTV version recorded. I can tell the film used to shoot this movie is same style the director used for his other movies, namely Saving Private Ryan. It is very noisy. Of course, 1080i/p version gives much more details on a good TV/projector.

B00005JO9J|5.0|This is a wonderful drama, about real life struggles and the trial-and-errors we all face. There is a lot of sexual tension and suspenseful story lines. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's better than ER. Get involved with these great medical practitioners. You won't regret it.
0783231032|5.0|This collector's edition movie has added scenes that had been cut, which was really enjoyable to see what had been missing.  Good movie to watch with the whole family and have a lot of laughs!  Would highly recommend.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This is the best work I've seen Keanu Reeves do. This is his most versitile role. Sandra Bullock is great as usual. This love story is unique and absolutely believable. The music is soothing and very romantic. This is another must see movie for your list.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|One of the best films of all time!  Fans of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant are in for a treat with this one.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|No clever review is necessary here.  Let me just tell you that this movie is hilarious if for no reason other than being totally odd.  5 minutes into the film I was laughing, 15 minutes more I was cracking up and by the 'Jamiroquai' ending (I don't want to give it away) I was hooked.  Napoleon Dynamite is a good what I like to call 'Bug Out' film.  It makes me chuckle just to think of the movie.  Buy the DVD, enjoy and then 'Vote For Pedro.'
B000059TEQ|5.0|Great Movie...the quality of the disc was great ! It was very quick getting to me. I bought two copies of it..one for My Parents since I was named after the movies main character. Thank You I will buy again from the seller.
0618680004|2.0|I have read and enjoyed most of Dawkins' books and fully expected to enjoy this one.  I did not.  <br /> <br />The first six chapters were classic Dawkins - mildly pedantic but carefully and tightly written. <br /> <br />In the seventh and subsuquent chapters it degenerated into confrontation and speculation. <br /> <br />It is overly pedantic
B0002J4ZWS|4.0|This movie is wonderful. If you have never seen this movie you have no idea what you are missing. Mogan Freeman and Tim Robbins at thier best. It is a really GOOD movie. This one is for your favorites list ! Prison Life Drama..but also a life lesson you will never forget !
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Any show with that awesome car and Blue Oyster Cult on the soundtrack is the show for me.  Do yourself a favor and watch several episodes in a row: the show is definitely better in order even when you're watching monster of the week episodes.
B00005V9IJ|1.0|I was definately NOT impressed with this movie whatsoever. I think it could have been done a different way and been an ok movie but it wasn't Over half of the movie is him alone on an island doing absolutely nothing and looking horrific.I could actually smell him stinch when watching. HOWEVER...if you are into watching a man lose his mind on an island for 2 hours and do nothing but talk to a ball then buy it. I thought this movie was one of the worst produced movies available today for purchase.  Tom Hanks at his worst.
B000EMH94Y|5.0|Love her style and voice. Great CD with a message believe it or not. She's a brilliant and talented artist. I support her 100% would recommend to anyone.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Jenny and Forrest.......what can I say ... excellent movie. Great entertainment. Tom Hanks like you have never seen him before. Sally Field as his Mother ... as you have never imagined her before. It is about determination and doing the RIGHT thing because it is RIGHT. It is a very good movie..well produced and Tom was fantastic in it. If you are the one in a Million who has NOT seen this movie ... It will be a CLASSIC in twenty years...it already is. GREAT MOVIE, full of comedy with some Drama through his life experiences. Just an all time favorite movie of mine.<br /><br />Life is Like a Box of Chocolates, You never know what your gonna get ! I couldn't have summed life up any better than Forrest ! Good thing about this movie IS...you KNOW you will get some wonderful entertainment .. it is definate ! OH and Bubba's Shrinp ...did YOU know there are over 500 ways to cook shrimp...Bubba names about 100 .... hehe !
B000KQGP2G|3.0|I would have given this four stars for the music alone, which is, for the most part, interesting.  It is definitely finding its way into my CD player.  The lyrics are, however, irritating.  Gildenlow's anti-consumerist, anti-capitalist, anti-wealthy rants get a little bit tired after awhile.  Every once in awhile, he makes a fair point.  However, there are just too many rants about those evil, greedy rich people who exploit the poor, absolutely guiltless poor people to ignore.  At times, I feel like I'm listening to the recitation of a 19-year-old college freshman essay on Marxism.
0375758992|5.0|If you like Danielle Steele, forget this book. This is a real novel written by a real writer.
B00005ASGG|5.0|This is a CLASSIC John Wayne movie!  I strongly encourage any Duke fans to own this movie.  He has often been criticized for his lack of acting ability, but this performance holds up very well next to James Stewart.  This is truly a multi-faceted character.  Red River and The Searchers are often acknowledged as his best.  This one needs to be included in that discussion.

1401302378|5.0|Chris Anderson is a physicist, but he certainly has capsulized the the modern market place as influenced by the Web. You will already know a lot of the things he talks about, but you probably have never thought about them in the way Anderson presents them. He reveals the real earth-moving upheaval that is going on in marketing, all brought about by the WWW. I highly recommend this book for those interested in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of what has been going on in the market place world-wide, and what will be coming down in the future. Mom and Pop may have been gobbled by the Big Box merchants, but Mom and Pop will live to gobble the big boxes in many product areas. They will do this through internet marketing. Anderson makes a great case for his thesis.
0553804677|5.0|You know, I actually put this one aside the first time I started it.  But the raves it was given by my fellow bookie lovers and the fact that it kept staring at me in the book store convinced me to give it another try.  Oh my.  I am certainly glad I did.  This is so different from the standard sword/sorcery/dragon/elves fantasy: it reminds me very much of Scar Night (another gorgeous piece) and The Blade Itself (another absolute keeper).  Even though they are all quite different from each other they are similar in that they introduce us to an entirely new genre in fantasy literature.  All three of these books are NOT TO BE MISSED.  I can't recommend more highly.  I am a confessed bookie lover addict-- read these and savor the habit.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Nice!  This is an excellent movie of the type where you start at the end and relive the story (Pulp Fiction style). I often think about this movie but have trouble remembering the name - maybe they should have called it something else. Everyone remembers that Halle Berry \\"came out\\" in this movie (her breasts did), and she hasn't looked back since.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is absolutely fabulous.  A great band that will always be remembered.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Filmed in the early 70s just past the easy rider woodstock epilogg of the 60s generation this film has a gloomy mood, kind of a after christmas depression being one of the first of the 2nd half of the hippy era of the early 70s it looks dated but i think it is intended that way and in a good way. Barry Newman is a car delivery driver after a recent depressing life of vietnam veteran, corrupt law enforcement and possible suicide of his girlfriend. The film defines the mental statis and mind racing of many vietnam veterans of the turbulant 60s and early 70s who can side with him. He is spent and he knows it so he just dont give a damm anymore hes out for his last dash. The 70 dodge chalenger he drives simblizes its last hurrahh as well as the fast car from the factory was winding down with 1970 being the last year for cars to get faster. After that year they started cutting back in the energy crisis to follow. The dodge speaks of its mopar domination being the best of the speedy cars with the hemi supercharger and pistal grip 4 speed shifter. Although some may argue the car is the star thats ok as well. It looks good, sounds good, and owns the road, well for a little while. He is driving from denver to san francisco and meets some more depressed people along the way including cops, want a be [...] robbers, a desert burned out old man, hippi cult jesus freaks, a hippi biker, blind disjocky, and the best for the guys a naked blond riding a bike who ask him for sex but in his chronic depression turns her down. He is popping pills to stay awake and does not appear to have any water in the desert as his life is unquenched and very unsatisfied. Best is the europian vergion when he picks up a girl who desires and wants him but its only a temporary feel good, its only a dream then back to his nightmare his falling apart life. They block the road with 2 bulldozers but he could have went around them. Its like they gave him a choice and the car and him are in a flash like his life and the 60s history. This movie defines the period best and is like no other and never will be like another.

1401200605|5.0|Well this is the best Batman Story ine i had read in years.  It is very hard hitting.  Batman goes off the hip, and its hard not to give away any spoilers, but vol. 1 leaves you wanting more.  So if you order Vol. 1 be ready and order volume 2, because seriously, you'll wanna read vol. 2 right away with out waiting, i know i did.  Hush is the best since The Long Halloween.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Well given performances by Don Cheadle, John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, and Halle Berry, breasts notwithstanding (the woman does have undeniable sex appeal, and it's in full swing in this flick). The story does have a flaw when Travolta's character interacts with a certain governmental agent - it just doesn't work for me as a motive. Travolta's greed would have been a much better plot line. Jackman gives a fun performance as a dancing (!) hacker who wants to get his daughter back from, for all you Soprano fans, a very drunken and drugged out Drea. I love the music - Paul Oakenfold, who perfectly catches the action and the drama as it unfolds into the magic of misdirection.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|After seeing the swivel sweeper infomercial on TV I thought I would give it a whirl.  I have a fairly large home with many pets and a wonderful central vacuum to clean it with on a 2 to 3 times a week basis.  What I needed was something small to use for quick clean ups in between serious vacuuming.  I charged the sweeper the full 8 hours and gave it a whirl.  What I noticed at first was that the sweeper seems to operate with no suction whatsoever.  Yet it \\"swept\\" all surface dirt up with ease. It is in no way, however, to be considered a vacuum cleaner.  It will NOT deep clean your carpets.  It does do a wonderful job of cleaning even fairly large items off the surface of the carpets and floors though.  If you are looking for a sweeper for light but thorough \\"quick\\" cleaning the swivel sweeper delivers.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I bought this as a valentine's day gift for my girlfriend.  So of course, when she got it she wanted to watch it with me.  At first, I watched, didn't particularly care for it, but for some reason wanted to keep watching.  Then towards the end of the first season, I became addicted.  We finished every season in about a month.  I know everyone calls this show a \\"chick show\\" and a \\"girl thing.\\"  It is.  But there is a lot for a guy to like, and something really fun to share with my special someone.  I highly recomend this purchase.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|the movie is great by itself, but there are a ton of extras that are really interesting - I hate commentaries, so I do not consider someone talking over a movie a 'special feature'.  costume design, interviews with frank miller and more are really great extras!

If you like her other stuff then you will love this; it has a bit more personality and edge than her others; glad to see she is moving along so well in her career. If you've never heard her before I would recommend previewing it, since she is certainly different from anything mainstream. Can't wait for the next one!!!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|we all know the story and the details of this marvellous movie, I have as <br />others do the earlier dvd release of FORBIDDEN PLANET,which was a total <br />revelation compared to the old film print that had been doing the rounds in AUSTRALIA for over thirty years, a faded almost to black and white <br />pink tinted travesty, projected in various art cinemas from time to time, <br />then the original dvd came out with a fair restoration, one in which there <br />was again good color in the image, now this release, a restoration that  <br />has to be seen to be believed, not only is the image as new in appearance <br />but the sound is deeper more expansive, if you are still holding on to your earlier dvd release or VHS version, do yourself a favour and purchase <br />this new restoration, you will not regret it, <br /> <br /> <br />

B000001GQB|5.0|I was listening to these again last night and I have to say, Bohm knows his Mozart. Then again, so does the Berlin Philharmonic. Bohm always seems to pick the right tempo, never too fast but not too slow either. The perfect example is the opening of the 39th, where Bohm revels in creating a big engulfing sound during the slow introduction; however as soon as the allegro kicks in, tempi and tones have a spring in their step. For me, this is one of the great versions of the 39th, even in spite of a few sloppy moments in the latter movements. He submits an excellent 35th and 36th, again with moderate tempi but wonderfully Mozartean phrasing, somewhat surprising since when Bohm recorded these, \\"Period Instruments\\" weren't even a twinkle in Harnoncourt's eye, and \\"Romantic\\" readings were all the rage for Mozart. Bohm's steadiness with these interpretations is only matched by his ear for detail; better, say, than Marriner, who is unquestionably steady, but whose readings lack spontenaity, and more consistent than Szell, whose 40th is one of the great readings, but whose 39th falls flat and whose brass/woodwinds can't handle their increased role in the Jupiter symphony. <br />Considering the age of these recordings (early- to mid-60s), they also sound remarkably clean and clear, and all of the parts can easily be heard; although I would credit Bohm with some of this as he was always excellent at creating space and keeping all of Mozart's many layers exposed to the listener. I have a number of different accounts of Mozart's last six symphonies (Marriner, Bernstein, Karajan, Szell 35, 39-41, Mackerras), but pound for pound, this one is the best. If you still aren't happy with the versions you own, this set may be your stopping point.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This is one of those concerts that you will never get sick of watching and listening to. She did an excellent job remixing old and new songs and the stage effects are as always orgasmic!
B000AP04MO|3.0|This a good vehicle for Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney in their younger days.  A bitter sweet comedy of the different stages of marriages. <br />A classic that gets little play on current TV. <br />It holds up well.  It has universal appeal for married couples.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|As a romance writer, I have always watched and enjoyed any and all productions of JANE EYRE since it is truly one of the most beautiful love stories of all time!  This production has proven itself to be my new personal favorite. I would imagine it can be quite difficult to breathe new life into an already successful franchise, but the actors proved to be more than up to the task. The beauty of any Masterpiece Theatre production is their gift of time, so that we as viewers are able to go the full distance with the characters. To everyone involved - job well done!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|My 3 year old daughter received this DVD as a gift and when she finally watched  it, she was totally mesmerized!  She didn't divert her eyes from the TV until it was over.  She absolutely loved it and she's not one to be mesmerized by anything on tv.  I can't recommend it enough from the music to the creativity with the story.  It's nice to have something that's apart from the other \\"in your face\\" kids videos out there.  What a great gift!
0307237699|5.0|A great book by a freshing up and coming politician.  I am a conservative Rebublican, but I can see myself supporting Obama. Read the book and then make your choices.
B00004NJJQ|5.0|A MUST for any UFO fan ... if you're new or never heard of them :(  then you need to get this.  They are timeless rock recordings that I have never got tired of hearing, since the late 70's.  The three best, in order are: Obsession, Lights Out, Phenomenon ... the other are good (some great) but they (UFO) would never top these three. <br />
B00005JKEZ|4.0|Anyone who is a fan of Errol Flynn and this movie.It is a must buy
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|If you can get past the first part of the book, where a child is rpaed and murdered, you'll discover a very unique story. The characters are relatively forgettable and you don't really latch on to anyone other than Susie (the raped and dead girl) and her killer. But, the fact that the story is being told by Susie, from a heaven-like place, is an unique approach. She watches her family and friends and she attempts to guide them to her killer. She, unknowingly, also works towards a place where she can find peace within herself and allow her family to find peace. <br /> <br />The beginning rape scene of The Lovely Bones was actually written prior to Sebold's first book, a memoir called Lucky. Lucky is a book about Sebold's own rape, back in 1981, when she was eighteen. This is interesting to know because it tells me where she found the courage to write about such a creepy topic - not just rape, but the rape and death of a child. It is also interesting to note that her family, as described in the memoir,is very much like the family in The Lovely Bones. They are detached from one another and the parents are more screwed up than the kids. Even the home in which the characters lived in Bones is very much like Sebold's own country home.  <br /> <br />I guess my point is this: I've read both books and appreciated them. I appreciate the fact that Sebold has taken a very personal experience and turned it in her favor. I would also recommend them to, more or less, any reader. However, after two books about the rape of young women, I'm hoping for something different from Sebold. Otherwise, it's just an indicator that she hasn't let go of this experience and cannot grow as a writer. She's very creative and I look forward to her next offering. <br /> <br />I have also written a review of Lucky, if you're interested.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you are any sort of Led Zeppelin or classic rock fan, you have to have this DVD.  It is one of the best purchases I have ever made.
B000EGF0NW|4.0|I have to say, I had issues with the book when I first started it. The opening, a rape scene, was disturbing and hard to read (as it should have been, given that it was the author's memoir about being raped), but if felt to me like bad writing and not a recounting of acutal events. It was what came after that I had trouble with. Within the first 50-70 pages, Sebold tangents a lot. She goes back and forth from her past to her present story. I'm cool with a flashback, but every page to two pages just got highly annoying. Having said that, once she moved on to dicussing her life at Syracuse after the rape, the book got much better. It was clearer, more organized, and less scattered in general. That is the point you really get hooked to her story - where you truly feel for Sebold's situation and you really want to know what happened to her. Overall, it was a touching memoir and well worth the read, but don't excited quality writing.   <br /> <br />I've also written a review about her second book, The Lovely Bones, if you're interested...
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|Lagrimas Negras is a beautiful collection of Latin American beats combined with traditional Flamenco sounds.  It is a perfect blend of music.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|First, I'll review the negatives: <br />1) As a singer, I was quite disappointed with the way the girls are directed to perform - their chests are puffed out and their arms are held painfully bent behind their backs. It's just poor technique and visually unappealing.  <br />2) The costume designer has serious fashion issues. While some of the dresses are very fitting and attractive, the ones that weren't lovely were beyond terrible. For example, what's worse than a giant gold ball gown, a big purple bow at the bust and a white lace shawl on the heaviest of the girls (Chloe)? She's a beautiful girl, has a sweet voice, and she actually has a fine figure - but the costumes make her look quite large. They also put extensions in her hair that looked quite fake.   <br />3)The choreography was very \\"stagey\\". It was too rehearsed, not only in the group numbers, but in the girls' solos. They all have such beautiful and distinct voices, I would have liked to have seen their individual performing styles as well. <br /> <br />But, before you think I'm a total Nazi...If you're Celtic Woman fan, this DVD is a must have. It's filmed at the lovely Slane Castle in Ireland - the perfect place for a concert. It is visually just stunning. The music is absolutely gorgeous, made even better by their very talented fiddle player (whose very Irish name I won't even attempt to spell!) She's like a little wood nymph! The ladies are bright and beautiful and are in top vocal form. I am so pleased with the addition of Hayley Westenra to the Celtic Woman clan. She was a treasure in this show.  <br /> <br />Despite it's few flaws, it's a stunning show and I highly recommend it.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I enjoyed the album, as I have all Norah Jones' works. May she issue many more albums.
0689859414|5.0|My 5th grade son came home from school and insisted we buy this book.  The reading teacher at his school had brought the book in to his classroom and they all went wild for it.  It is very imaginative with wonderful illustrations of mythical creatures and is categorized in six different areas of fantastical creatures (\\"Around the house and yard\\" i.e. brownies, boggarts, changelings, pixies, etc. \\"In Fields and Forests\\" - cockatrices, elves leprechauns, manticores, sprites, treefolk, etc. \\"In Lakes and Streams\\" - kelpies, merfolk, nixies, sea serpents, trolls etc. \\"In The Hills and Mountains\\" - dwarves, giants, goblins, knockers, ogres, etc. \\"In The Sky\\"  - dragons, griffins and phoenixes and \\"Outside At Night\\" - banshees, gargoyles, phookas, and will-o-the wisps among many many others.  It is beautifully illustrated and has lots of information on the fictional (or is he?) Arthur Spiderwick's adventurous travels. My 2nd grade daughter really enjoys looking at the pictures although the text is too hard for her.  This is a great book for older children, especially children like my son that are reluctant readers.  Its the kind of book they pick up over and over.  Because my children enjoyed this so much, we recently bought Spiderwick's The Care and Feeding of Sprites which is great but doesn't compare with the Fantastical World Around You (which covers many different species of mythical creatures with detailed descriptions and information on each).  Happy reading and imagining!
B0001CNRBG|5.0|The age-old story of the long standing affair between otherwise engaged people, but with a twist or two...or three! No matter the year in which this movie is set or was made, it is timeless, sweet, and shows you a different side of illicit love affairs. Alda and Burstyn are excellent, very funny and have an incomparable chemistry. I adore this film and would watch it over and over again. In fact, I already had the VHS when the DVD came out, and I bought it immediately!
B00000J7SS|3.0|I read the reviews before buying this and now see why some people were so harsh in thier reviews.  Sounds better after a few glasses of wine.  Too different for my taste. If you are a jazz purist this may not be to your liking.  Davis tries something different and I am not sure it worked.
B000GBEWHA|3.0|When I received this item there was no leather jacket. I complained and was shipped another DVD. This one also had no jacket!! the DVD itself was great.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Heard about this movie from my friends and people i know. This movie is the best story and picture i have seen from scorsecesedcee. A must own, especially if you like great acting. All the actors in the movie seem like they were free to really play their characters how they wanted to play them and develop this story. The ending is a trip. Get it fool!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Madonna once again out-does herself in this spectacular live show.  AMAZING!!!  And at 48, she looks better than ever, wow, what energy and spunk.  Madonna is truly a legend.
0743496728|5.0|Anyone who has enjoyed the previous work of Jodi Picoult is in for a treat.  This is a fantastic novel that touches the heart while delving into several issues, centered on a tragic school shooting that twists and alters the lives of the characters.   <br /> <br />Set in a small New Hampshire town, a town with only one detective on the police force, a run-of-the-mill Northeastern U.S. town.  On a day that seemed like every other, the book opens with a number of vignettes that establish a sense of the ordinary.  People are going to work, a student studies for a science test, a mother worries about her daughter, a policeman readies himself for work, and one student finishes his plans to unleash a blitzkrieg at school.  This initial context sets the pace for the entire book that narrates the interrelated lives of these people living in a small-town world dealing with a national crisis.   <br /> <br />Like most of Picoult's previous books, this novel's real gift to the reader is the development of character.  While the horizon of the story is relatively clear from the start, the plot is enhanced one hundred fold by the intricacies of the people about whom the story is written.  Perhaps what I find most engaging about Picoult's work, and likewise this book, is that there is always at least one character with whom I can easily identify - making the reading of the text much more interesting.   <br /> <br />While this is not a Pulitzer-prize winner (and I doubt Picoult has the slightest belief that it will be), this is really a nice book and one that is not afraid to tackle a tough issue while also showing the human response to tragedy that most of the world doesn't witness once the television media tires of a story, packs up its equipment and leaves town. <br /> <br />Pick this book up today. <br />
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|Although I really love the music from the movie, it is annoying that on some of these tracks, the music just stops without an ending.  Its also not set up so that one track picks up where the other left off, so it can be choppy in spots.  That being said, I do love the music and there are enough complete pieces to keep me happy.  I especially like the dance music and Georgiana's piece.
B000784WMW|3.0|I love this production and have awaited the DVD version for decades!!!!  Unfortunately, this one kept changing formatting size throughout the entire DVD.  It would glitch up and black out, then shift size back and forth throughout the display, which is particularly annoying. <br /> <br />The production itself is stellar, independent of the POOR DVD quality.
0142000655|5.0|I read this book about 25 years ago, and remembered loving it.  So I reread it and fell in love with it again.  What an epic, and probably the best Steinbeck of them all.  This book has many layers to it, so I think it is readable at all ages.  I gleaned more from it now that I am 50, but I still enjoyed it at 25!
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This is very scarey  but could be possible. Jason Robards was really great in his part & everything was so believable. COULD ALL HAPPEN.
B00005JKES|1.0|I totally agree with the poster below. Why release Season 2 of ANYTHING when Season 1 is unavailable? Why is anything \\"unavailable\\" unless there's no market for it? Which clearly isn't the case if they are releasing a Season 2 set. Here's the thing: I'm absolutely CERTAIN that, in six months--just in time for the holidays--we're all going to see a Twin Peaks Special Edition Box Set, containing the FULL Season 1 (yes, WITH pilot) + Season 2. What can we do? Simple: Refuse to buy this product. Until consumers stand up for themselves and say \\"I'm mad as hell (at this marketing rip-off) and I'm not going to take it anymore!\\" we'll keep getting slammed. Why is this STILL available in the UK (INCLUDING the pilot)? It's not a rights issue, people. They only tell you that. Rights means money. Yes, two different production companies own the rights to the pilot and the rest of Season 1. But if it can be worked out in the UK, they can do the same here. It's that simple.  <br /> <br />Home video distributors have been playing this game for years. Disney is the worst offender: They even advertise that such-and-such film is going \\"back in the Disney vault\\"! Which means, if you don't buy this now--whether you want it or not--when your kid screams for it, it won't be there. It's the equivalent of holding a gun to the consumer's head, and it should be illegal. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: Exert your right of refusal and force them to play fair. If not, the only way you'll be able to purchase the complete Season 1 is by buying this set all over again.
074356619X|5.0|This information is presented very well! <br />It is done with testimonies that establish credibility, along with instructions that anyone can follow for using the law of attraction! <br />It is OUTSTANDING!
0763617105|5.0|This little story is so beuatifully draw and the owls are especially expressive! It is a cute little story about three baby owls who awake to find that mother is not in the nest. Each scene has the owl babies dialoging in birth order. I particularly enjoyed the littlest owl who's only dialog is a woeful, \\"I want my mommy.\\" However, he gets the last line in the book! <br /> <br />I made a CD recording of myself reading this book outloud, attached it to the inside cover, and gifted the set to my six year old Neice who lives four states away. She LOVES it!
B00000K3CR|5.0|This was a request by my wife.  She loves Tom Hanks.
1593553307|5.0|Dean Koontz is a great author and this is one of his finest books. If you want to hear a book in audio format this is one of the best! The narrator/reader does the best job I've ever heard. His vocal inflections and dynamics get you hooked right away. You won't regret buying this book, and if you've never \\"heard\\" a book, this is the one to get you started.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|She asked for the perfect Madonna video...this is it!
B00005JNS0|5.0|My 3,5 years old son got it for Christmas. He loves it and plays it over and over again. I like it too, but I had to spend about $150 so far to buy all the die cast cars and other stuff from this movie since this was all my son was asking for and talking about ever since. Die cast cars are out of stock everywhere and I had to buy it on e-bay paying $7-10 each, so be aware that this CD is just the beginning of your \\"shopping spree\\" and make sure you can afford it before you buy this movie...
B000BJS4BM|5.0|My wife loves Madonna and loves this DVD
0735619670|5.0|Quite an odd book. I can understand why it's so highly rated BUT  reading it cover-to-cover is tedious. However, what sticks in the mind *does* make a difference when coding. If you can't remember the actual advice it's enough of a prompt to dip back into the book.   If the point of the book is to enable a more experienced programmer to create more then it delivers hence the 5 stars I have given it.  However, it's format might put some people off and the first read through for, perhaps, beginners, might be hard going.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I can sit in front of my big screen tv, in my recliner smoking my cuban cigar and NEVER get tired of this DVD.  I wish more were like this!
1402720602|5.0|Very well written and presented, although I agree that there's nothing truly 'modern' here; a formal presentation of lattice bracing or composite tops (10 year old technology) would be needed to earn the 'modern' moniker. But for traditional style building (with interesting personalized wrinkles) it's an excellent text. Highly recommended, and the first true competition for the Cumpaino.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I love this DVD, can't get enough of Pink Floyd.
0226264211|5.0|It is easy to see Mr. Friedman's influence on today's economy and politics (Democrates and Republicans).  In recent interviews, he makes the point that most Americans were not ready to accept his ideas when this book was written over forty years ago, since most needed to have the experience of living with defective economic principles to actually realize their full negative impact on their lives.  What is more amazing is the fact that many of Mr. Friedman's other recommendations have not been realized.  Mr. Friedman makes the best case I've seen so far for school vouchers.  A great book to read for those with open minds, a healthy fear of big government/business and a desire to see our economy fully prosper and meet the needs of its people.
B000FA57RG|5.0|She asked me for all the Madonna videos, and I got her 3 and she loves them ALL!

B0002F6AH0|5.0|Made by English tv producers Thames Television in the mid 1970's, The World At War remains, thirty years on, the definitive documentary series on the Second World War. Breathtaking in scope, magnificent in execution, it is as much a work of art in itself as it is a piece of television. The sheer artistry of its composition, from Carl Davis' opening score, to the superb writing and strong direction by producer Jeremy Isaacs; brilliant selection of archival footage, all set to the powerful, understated meter of Laurence Olivier's narration, this program has never even come close to being surpassed. The tragedy of the Second World War is here laid bare for all to see, and for future generations to watch and learn. It is simply a must, and powerful reminder of what television, at its best, can achieve.
B000002KBD|4.0|In this album I like the song I'll be you r love too, poetic, great vocal and guitar performance. Is an example of what you can do with a guitar and voice alone. Raw style - great music <br />The song appears in a movie with Russel Crow and Meg Ryan, about terrorism in the Andes 'Proof of life'
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never seen the show when it originally was televised... not even once.  However, I bought an HD-DVD player and purchased the movie \\"Serenity\\" which was based off of this series.  After seeing the characters in the feature film, I couldn't wait to see the show that spawned it.  I have to say this series is absolutly wonderful.  The characters and stories are refreshing, yet familiar.  The storytelling and development are top notch.  I wish I could have been a fan earlier and tried to help keep it on the air.  Only downside... it was cancelled and you are left wanting so much more at the end of the final DVD disk...
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This story was one of the first Miyazaki Films i had seen and from there i was hooked. There are times where one might feel a little confused but the beauty of Hayao Miyazaki is that there really are stories within stories.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|The Departed is a great movie.  I definitely recommend buying this.  I bought my fiance the two disc series for Valentine's Day and he loved it.
0743454529|2.0|Okay let me say this was an easy and emotional read. How awful for these poor people... But the little sister was genetically engineered to save the older sister and we never hear anything more about it? That seemed weird to me. And the surprise ending didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was how Picoult tied everything up so neatly and unrealistically at the very end. I felt insulted by that ending and it turned me off to Jodi Picoult. I'm not sure I'll read another one of her books. I did like the little side story with the lawyer. I found that story line to be more enjoyable than the rest of the book.
B00001OH7Y|4.0|It still amazes me how Bowie thinks up some of the sounds and riffs used in this album. The second half of it I can't get into much but the first half is awesome! \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" rode the charts at number 1 for ages as did the album. <br />The mastering is great too. <br /> <br />It features obscure lead guitar by Robert Fripp and Pete Townsend played and contributed to one of the tracks. It's harsh in sound compared to Bowie's more recent work.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This is Michael Jackson at his best! From start to finish every song on this album is outstanding.  Truly the peak of his career
B000001FS3|5.0|This album is a piece of musical history and some say is U2's defining album. You'd have to be living under a rock not to have heard a track from it. <br />Recorded in an English mansion that Adam Clayton (Bass player) eventually bought and lives in.
1596912367|5.0|Boyd runs two stories in parallel, like the literary spymaster that he is: the first is set in 1939, the story of Eva Delectorskaya, a beautiful and resourceful British agent who is in danger of uncovering a Philby-like mole.  The second is set in 1976 and focusses on Ruth, who suddenly discovers her mother is not Sally Gilmartin (nee Fairchild) but the formidable Eva.  Sally/Eva, although now in her sixties, runs Ruth as a spy, feeding her the story of her life in the hope that she can use her to help her find the man that betrayed her more than thirty years before.   <br /> <br />Quiet, focussed and fluid, Boyd's style in 'Restless' is very different to that of his faux-autobigraphical masterpieces such as 'Any Human Heart' or 'The New Confessions'.  I detected a more filmic note, as though the screenwriter inside was yearning to break out onto the page.   <br /> <br />For anyone remotely interested in spy stories, this book is a must-read. The only other book I have read recently that compares to this is 'Julius' by Brian Allen Levine.

B000K7UBTI|3.0|The whole Iron Man storyline had to be explained within a short time frame.  Even so, the movie was better then average.  The background artwork was great but the character artwork was less then average.  It has bonus features that were a plus.
B000M4RG42|4.0|This was a great war film. Not traditional in the classic sense, it shows the homefront and the battlefield at the same time. Eastwood pulls off showing the true sense of honor and fighting for your buddies, and how the public perceives a hero in time of need. The only problem I had was the narrative structure. It jumped back and fourth in the beginning, than evolved into a narrator piece suddenly with James Bradley writing his book and making piece with his dying father. All in all though, a must see.
B000JVT092|1.0|This movie sucked from start to finish. The plot had major holes. Do not buy.

B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I enjoyed the DVD almost as much as I enjoyed the book. I thought it was done very well, and as faithful to the book as most movies can be done. I found it very spiritual and yet, a fast-paced action movie too. Great entertainment with a message. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0765315246|5.0|Forget the occasional negative review. Old Man's War is a fine introduction to a new Science Fiction setting, and contains well-drawn, believeable adult characters. Despite the similarities to earlier space-war novels (most importantly Starship Troopers), which the author freely acknowledges, this novel also deals with ethical and meta-ethical issues while never losing its sense of wonder and discovery. It should resonate with anyone who finds themselves moving into early middle age, and make the reader wonder what choices they would make in the protagonist's position. One could possibly call it \\"Starship Troopers for grown-ups\\" (the reader should recall that Heinlein's work was intended for a juvenille or young adult audience), but this would be a disservice to both novels. Old Man's War is a fine work in its own right, and no knowledge of any other science fiction story is necessary to read and enjoy it.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|For those who are fans already of the very musical Celtic Women, this is a great addition to their collection. For those who are not familiar with these talented ladies, this CD is a good introduction.
B000J103YI|5.0|I am not a fan of musicals but this one simply amazes me. The film is awesome but it all rests on the rock-solid foundation of a suberb musical recording, one that you actually find on this CD. You have all the prerequisites of a great album here: Great compositions, outstanding musical and vocal performances, impeccable production. The sequence of tracks follows the storyline, so if you have seen the movie it will be easy to relate the two. If you haven't seen the movie, you'll still enjoy the soundtrack. Most songs are pretty solid to start out with, they would probably sound OK on a single piano. But what you get here, musically speaking, is a full meal: brilliant arrangements played by top-notch musicians on real instruments, all mixed and produced to the contemporary ear. The singers are the icing on the cake. E.g. Eddie Murphy sings so well that I can't help thinking his acting career was actually a day job for him, deep inside he must be a singer! In short: Each musical element on this recording supports the other one and definitely radiate talent and quality. If you like good music and inspiration, get this album!

B000KCHZK6|4.0|It can be said that Norah Jones' sound can be found in any New York City coffeehouse. It is that reason why I buy her albums. The music on this album is soothing and easy on the ears. The newborn baby does not seem to mind her songs either. I enjoy listening to this album when driving or going on long road trips.

0316236535|4.0|My 3 year old started having nighmares & was waking several times a night. This book really helped him, as he thought the monster in the book was funny, and loved the ending where he could yell at the monsters to go away. The only part I didn't like was the reference to \\"big scary teeth\\", I just omit the \\"scary\\" when reading it to him.
B0000033IR|5.0|At a 1968 concert in Chicago, Aretha Franklin was publicly and officially crowned the Queen of Soul in front of her fans by a DJ named Purvis Spann.  This body of work shows why Aretha continues to reign supreme. <br /> <br />The Queen takes on the Kings of Soul/Rhythm & Blues and pulls no punches as she  covers Ray Charles's \\"Come Back Baby\\" and \\"Be as Good to Me as I Am to You,\\"  James Brown's \\"Money Won't Change You,\\" and Curtis Mayfield's \\"People Get Ready\\".   She's classical, bluesy, funky, and right-down soulful on every cut. <br /> <br />The poet Nikki Giovanni once wrote--\\"Aretha can sing Money Won't Change You, but can James Brown sing Respect?\\"  In other words, when the Queen covers a song, it becomes hers and one can easily forget about the original artist.  For example, Carol King wrote and recorded \\"Natural Woman\\" but that song is and probably will always be associated with Aretha Franklin. <br /> <br />Aretha wails and gets right-down funky on cuts like \\"Chain of Fools\\" and \\"Nikki Hokey.\\"   She's operatically soulful on \\"Ain't No Way\\"--which to this day no female artist, including Whitney Houston, has been able to successfully cover.   <br /> <br />Add this CD to your collection and continue to be soulfully captivated by the one and only true Queen of Soul - Ms. Aretha Franklin. <br /> <br />
B0000033IS|5.0|If you don't have this CD in your collection, you are truly missing a treasure.  With this CD, we see \\"Aretha\\" bringing the \\"fervor\\" of gospel music to the world of circular music in a way that no other African-American musical artist has done with the exception of Ray Charles and James Brown.  She is unapologetic as she lets her voice soar to a spiritual place that can only be reached by someone who's church upbringing is as much a part of her being as the water she drinks and the air she breaths.  You will \\"go to church\\" when you hear her sing Sam Cooke's \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" and the song that has become every woman's anthem, \\"Respect\\". <br /> <br />On this CD, Aretha not only defines Rhythmn and Blues; she also defines her version of the Blues. Her Blues is not the Blues of Big Mama Thorton, KoKo Taylor, or Etta James.  Aretha's Blues doesn't try to compete or \\"rock\\" like a man's Blues.  Aretha's Blues is a woman's Blues--smart, sassy, pleading, proud, and defiant all at the same time.  One gets to feel it all when she belts out \\"I Never Loved A Man the Way I Love You,\\" \\"Soul Serenade,\\" and \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\". <br /> <br />And the piano playing--yes, that's Aretha--that pure syncopated gospel style that many church going African Americans take for granted on any given Sunday morning.  <br /> <br />Add this body of work to your Aretha collection.  You won't have the blues for long and you will come to understand what it means to \\"go to church.\\" <br /> <br />

B000A6T1JU|5.0|I first saw this when it was released, and was happy it was out on dvd..I liked the new editing with the graphics between acts. Its a golden oldie
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I've enjoyed Norah's previous two albums; but this one not only features that marvelous voice, the songs come from the heart.  The album is more folk than pop, which contributes to my loving it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really love this show. It is a real shame it was taken off tv there is plenty more story to tell. <br />
0375413405|5.0|Everyone should have this book! There is nothing like learning French cooking from the Goddess herself, Julia Child! <br />After reading this book and cooking with Julia you will become French!!! <br />Oh la la!!! <br /> <br />

0060887966|5.0|I have read The Alchemist for the 5th time and every time I learn a new and powerful life lesson.  This book is for you if you are young, old, or in between.  The new edition is absolutely beautiful too, as an added bonus.  Paulo Coelho is an amazing person and author.  Let his timeless classic change your life!
B00005OMTT|5.0|If you are an Enigma fan and have any of their CD's, this one is an absolute must!  It's a compilation of all their best.  If you are not aware yet of the music of Enigma, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  Their music is not at all sleepy or meditative.  It's a little bit of Gregorian with a lot of sexy!  There have been a few copy cats, but only one Enigma!
B00005JKGO|5.0|Few films reach the realm of this Fellini masterpiece.  I encourage anyone who considers himself a \\"film buff\\" or even just particular fond of the good stuff to see this film before long.  It will probably blow you away.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Great CD - only problem is track 10 has a huge space in the middle of the recording.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Madonna always does it. She's the Godess, only she can make great covers of her old songs, and she made better versions. Get this CD, great for dancing.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I first bought this disc when it came out on the recommendation of a music store clerk.  It was playing at the time and I asked him who the band was and he told me \\"Radiohead\\" and that he whole disc was just as listenable.  I bought it and I have loved it over and over and over... <br />I used to buy discs several times a year since mine were always getting scratched, lost, stolen, etc.; now, thanks to my ipod, I hope this disc will be the last one I have to buy for a loooong time!  I listen to most of the disc daily.  Only two songs (Electioneer and Fitter, Happier) suck, in my opinion, and the remainder are top notch--almost as good as my all time favorite, Pink Floyd!  If you like smooth, mellow tunes with lyrics that are a bit off-beat, deep and somewhat dark and moody, then you should enjoy \\"OK Computer\\" as much as I do.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|ROCKY BALBOA is a bit of an endearing film. It was good to see Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, Burt Young as Paulie and Tony Burton as Duke (Rocky and Apollo Creed's trainer). Rocky had to give it one last shot and get it out of his system. It was well worth the elegiac journey.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|This CD is a great effort by Norah. There's enough \\"signature\\" tracks to make it Norah Jones, but there's a lot more as well...
B00008976Y|3.0|Kieslowsky's films are not the most exciting thing one can spend his time watching. Of all directors I would compare him only to Russian artist Tarkovsky; in his style, not in his quality. One wishes his film would work; would grab our attention. Unfortunately, they just aren't as good as they look: they only pretend.<br /><br />In one of his interviews he leaves no doubt that he doesn't like pretentiousness at all. That is the last thing he wants so seem. But watching his films (Blue, especially) one understands why he took so much trouble to avoid this: his subjects, and his style, actually are pretentious, despite his (I believe) honest efforts to the contrary.<br /><br />Now let's see this 'Blue' story. The script plays a very secondary role here. Thes story is told by the facts that happen, simply. Then the viewer is supposed to get into the skin of the protagonist and see everything from her point of view: that is, identify with her. The viewer has to pretend being the woman in the story, like those things happened to you. In this case words become obstacles because people don't tell themselves how they feel, or what they do, they just feel and do. However, this is a film. The viewer is in his right to be a little more receptive, more passive, without being told how to feel or think either. If one just doesn't care enough about this woman... what are we to do? She has an accident? Well, I'm sorry. That's all the identification the film will get from me. After that, the particular reactions of this character don't have anything to do with me: that's her. And I can't pretend that it's me because I wouldn't be acting like her. If the director wants me to pretend to be her he is going to have to help me, and not assume that I can play 'pretending'. That's why this is a pretentious film; with honest intentions, but pretentious, and therefore boring.<br /><br />The fact that this film intends to represent 'liberty', the freedom that the woman unexpectedly finds after the terrible accident, sounds good enough; but it doesn't make the film good. Kieslowsky might as well have said it represented anything else, still it doesn't make it any better. This kind of cinema is a bit risky, because you can pick almost any simple plot, make it look mysterious or weird, not say actually anything and let the pseudo-intellectuals interpret it once you already stated its meaning: liberty, or whatever. Sounds much like post-modernist so-called art: They show you horse-dung and say it's art (and you believe it because otherwise it wouldn't be in a museum, right?)<br /><br />Still, this film is viewable and not too bad.dly finds after the terrible accident, sounds good enough; but it doesn't make the film good.

B000KCHZK6|3.0|I really loved her first, liked the second and was disappointed in the third and newest. It's cute, her voice is wonderful and the orchestration still tops, but I don't listen to it much anymore.
0634049011|4.0|I would recommend this book for any serious guitarist interested in better understanding chord triads up and down the neck.  There is also explanation of major, minor and pentatonic scales.  Those with advanced understanding of music theory may find this book too elementary, while beginners may find it overwhelming.  For the intermediate or accomplished guitarist looking to better understand music theory, however, this book is an excellent resource manual.
0671015206|5.0|After reading this book I asked my wife to read it. She and I found it to be one of the most insightful books we have ever read, backed by lots of compelling data, to suggest a provident lifestyle. We bought extra copies for our children.  After reading the author's follow-on book, \\"The Millionaire Mind\\", I've offered our older grandchildren $100 each if they would read the book and write me a book report on it.  Several are in process.
0679746323|1.0|This book is utter drivel from the first line of the first page to the very end!
B000M4RG4C|4.0|Having read the book 2 times I was able to keep track of the names better than someone who had not read it.  I had no expectations, consequently everything was great.  Showed more war going on than expected, but I suppose that has to be considered.
B000LE1GVW|4.0|I bought this CD for a friend and my husband ranging in age from 20 years to 50 years and we all loved it. A great mellow rock'n'roll sound! Innovative! Fresh! I will buy more for more gifts!
B0002YCVXI|4.0|Morricone's music is the perfect companion to cello strings beautifully played by Yo-yo Ma. Personally, I missed some of the Spaghetti Western melodies (such as 'A fistful of dollars', 'A fistful of dynamite'), but there're others that won't deceive to Morricone's fans. <br />Definitively, a good buy. Recommended
B000CNDIZE|5.0|This has to be one of my top 5 favorite CD's of all time. I'm addicted.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I watched the DVD of the concert and as usual with Madonna was blown away by the level of professionalism, energy, crowd-pleasing, crowd-abusing (which everyone also loves), art and hard work that she puts into her work. With all the hype about Madonna and her life, it is easy to overlook the fact that this woman works like a horse and should be congratulated for it. Top notch show and please don't tell her to stop.

B000002UA9|5.0|I was so happy when I found this album.  In the past when I looked for certain songs, they couldn't even be found on \\"The best of The Beatles...\\" or whatever the compilations are called. I'm happy I found an album for under $30 with such great songs.  I just wish it had more.  Perhaps, they didn't produce big albums in the '60s like they do today.
B00005QIPH|5.0|One of the best album's to come out in the last 10 years
B00005OMTT|5.0|Just perfect. Music is very, very nice. I love ENIGMA. You think that all songs are the same but you are wrong. It is some of energy that you can be given after horrible day at work, for example. I recommend to all of You.
0307346609|5.0|A little wary at first about a Zombie book but couldnt put it down.
B000002O1Q|4.0|This CD is still a classic even after 23 years. I love the remakes of Stevie Nick's \\"Sorcerer\\" and the 50's feel of \\"I can dream about you \\". <br />Can't get these songs on ITunes !!!!!
B000002LAC|5.0|This is one of the best country ladies harmony record I have heard in a long time.  The solo's are very good and from two ladie's one doesn't hear to much from. <br />It is to bad the songs in this cd are sad and kinda depressing but the music is great.
B000M06KFC|5.0|This is a great compilation of terrific songs.  Hooker might have the blues, but his lyrics and signature guitar riffs will make you smile.
B000NA28IE|1.0|I took my spouse and three teenagers (all of us being fans of quality speculative fiction) to see this movie, after three of us had read the book. We were all disappointed, to varying degrees. Granted, the movie had some tough hurdles to overcome, such as: 1) portraying the private psychological connection between Eragon and Saphira (which was prominent in the book) on the screen, and, more importantly, 2) the problem most speculative fiction movies share--attempting to condense not only a sweeping story but also an understanding of a whole new world into a film that can be shown later on TV in under two hours with commercials. Beyond these expected obstacles (and only partly excused by the latter), the Eragon movie suffered from a nearly total lack of character development paired with choppy, breakneck pacing that rendered viewers disengaged and confused. The one star I'm giving the movie is for the special effects and visual appeal. In contrast, I'd give the book at least two stars for adult fantasy readers and three stars for child fantasy fans, which is respectable considering Christopher Paolini's youth and inexperience when he wrote it.
1550379151|5.0|For those of us who love the Paper Bag Princess, the extras included in this book are amazing!!  What a way to celebrate an Anniversary!  Thank you, Robert Munsch, for the special edition!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|One of my favorite books of all times, Persuasion has been beautifully adapted in this version. Amanda Root was wonderful as the would-be spinster who still pines for the dashing Frederick Wenworth, whom Ciaran Hinds portrayed well. It is a lovely story for those hopeless romantics out there.
1559275561|5.0|This tape set was in pristine condtion and has provided me with many enjoyable car rides since.  The product was specifically what I requested and was sent to me within 6 days of ordering.
B00003CXDD|4.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine since college!  It almost has a cult following, ranking right up there with The Princess Bride and Dirty Dancing.  I have always been a Kilmer fan, but really enjoy the versatility of his acting in this film.  The fantasy and humor is a perfect combination.  I would recommend anyone who loves The Lord of the Rings or The Princess Bride watch this!
0694003611|5.0|It's a classic; my two-year-old loves it.  There must be some magic incantation hidden in the off-rhymes and oddly shifting pictures!
B000HWXS2S|4.0|The song \\"Runes to my Memory\\" is the hook that made me buy the CD.<br /><br />They are great contributors to the Scandiavian Black Metal scene. They remind me of Borknagar with their inspirational and dashing use of synthesizers.
B000MR1V22|3.0|This is a great movie, but the 24-hour playback restriction for Unbox-to-Tivo videos is severe. Especially for families with young kids, it helps if the movie can be watched over the course of two evenings. Why not just let us keep the movie for the full 30 days? The DRM scheme still protects it.
B00003CXUM|5.0|I can't believe how this director can make simple and ordinary things seen so beautiful. <br />Despite the fact that I didn't like the end, the story is good, but to be honest, I didn't buy this movie for the story. <br />The blend of the music with the scenes is just astonishing, is like watching a master piece.    <br />

B000IONJH4|4.0|The Picture Quality of this HD DVD is fantastic. A big improvement on previous releases. <br />The Rafaella De Laurentis interview in the extras puts to bed the idea that there is a 4 hour directors cut waiting to be released. The scenes that were 'cut' were never shot. <br />Overall a very nice package
1582701709|5.0|The Secret does an excellent job focusing the events in our lives as a direct reflection of our attitude and energy.  It is a powerful example of our ability to control our destiny thru our actions and reactions.  In the end, it's our choice how we transmit our lives. <br />Great book!
1582701709|5.0|I bot this book 1 1/2 months ago. The Secret is abolutely powerful.  I have used the secret to get my car radio to work without static, to shorten a long customer line of people in the Post Office and to console a man working for Out Of The Closet who had lost his doggie. All this happened in an afternoon during the space of just 2 hours.  She Secret and all the books of Norman Vincent Peale (The Power of Positive Thinking, etc...) are my favorite books. The Secret is so simple to use and the results have astounded me.  I am a retired medical doctor.  I also have given copies of the book to friends of mine.  This book is No. 1 on the bookseller list. The DVD extended version of The Secret is also very highly recommended by me. This is one purchase that will change your life, guaranteed.   <br />Armand Auger, M.D., retired
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|For all you Final Fantasy fanatics, this is the ultimate fanboy/girls' dream!  Although I've only played 2 Final Fantasy games, this movie was somewhat exhilirating, but for most of the movie, I was bored to tears.  (Most likely because I've never played FF7; not knowing what the background story is).  The CG is amazing, and fight scenes are spectacular.  However, what I really loved about this movie was the theme of friendship and standing up to those who threaten your happiness.  But otherwise, everything else about it was quite boring.

What's better than driving in the car, listeing to a CD and feeling wonderful, confident in ones future and hopeful. <br />For those of you who are busy or perfer to hear  your books, this is the thing for you. GReat!!!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Obviously, everyone knows this is a great movie.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the second (bonus)disc.  The mini-documentary about Whitey Bulger was a little short (around 20 minutes), but was very informative.  The Scorcese on Scorcese segment was outstanding.  It comes from (I beleive) an A&E documentary where the director talks about many of his major works.  It was very interesting to hear what his thought processes were while making some of his (many) legendary movies.  There are also the obligatory bonus scenes which were mildly entertaining, but really, felt like they were there because they always are on bonus discs.  Nevertheless, on balance, the bonus disc is great, and a worthy companion to what I feel is the best movie of 2006. <br /> <br />
B000089J0R|3.0|I own all three of Dragonforce's albums, and this was the last one that I purchased.  It definitely has a different sound to it than Sonic Firestorm and Inhuman Ramapge.  VOtD isn't quite as filled with guitar shreddage and the overall recording sounds kind of echoey and hollow.  I really like the sound of their last two albums better than this one.  If you are new to Dragonforce I would suggest Sonic Firestorm and Inhuman Rampage, in that order, before you purchase this album.  They have better recording quality and I think also better songs and overall a better sound.
B00005JKTF|4.0|Cate Blanchett is terrific in this film about espionage in France during World War II.  Story is well crafted and most of it is believable.  One or two of the actors disappoint. <br />Subtle aspects of this film include betrayal by the French collaborators, and British fear of French resistance fighters with Communist leanings. <br />Photography of the scenery is splendid, and costumes appear very appropriate for that period. <br />No matter the color of her hair, Cate Blanchett is a beauty and a marvelous actress.   <br />
B000H305U0|4.0|but what makes cds not as perfect as they can be, is the way the whole cd flows together. Don't get me wrong this cd is a really good cd, but it's more like a tug-of-war game of being a Pop-R&B cd or wanting to be consider a Disco disc. These songs can appeal to the general audience, but there be a few just ok songs to most people.
0736063684|5.0|I started lifting weights about 2 years ago, focusing on different muscle groups.  Even within specific groups like chest and arms, I found I could lift 100 lbs and other I struggled with only 50 lbs.  This book shows you each specific muscle in a Gray's Anatomy manner and what movement and muscle to use to strengthen.   <br /> <br />One of the most helpful books for someone who wants to be their own trainer.  I found out about this book from a fellow in the locker room who was reading it right before a workout.  I might not end up Mr. Universe, but in the fight against gravity, this book and illustrations and information are perfect.   <br /> <br />After reading this I can say, the only dumbbell in my workouts are the ones I lift.  I highly recommend this to everyone, beginner, immediate, men and women.  <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This film effectively communicates the facts of global warming and pollution problems, and the urgency to abate and reverse the trend.  This should be required viewing for American youth. Those who are skeptical about the existence of global warming and climate change should view this and take heed. This is a very well-made film.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Well, to start with I am not a big fan of horror. So I have avoided horror shows because I think they are really really bad. And then I just happen to end up on a channel showing Supernatural and I was \\"hooked\\". It was the episode about \\"Hook man\\".<br /><br />It was a long week till next episode. After a few episodes I decided to buy the DVD and I love it. It is still the first season that is on air in Sweden.<br /><br />The mix between supernatural ghosts, demons, old tales, myths from all over the world and a great sense of humor makes the show one of the best I have seen. And it is a show that no one can say \\"that is not true worthy\\" about. Because you never know what is out there, some believe in ghosts, some believe in good and evil, some have a great imagination (like me). I don't believe in ghosts or demons... but I do tend to check under my bed every now and then.... :-)
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Has to be the best tour dvd I have ever seen.  The show was amazing and the visual effects applied to the dvd are great.

Las graficas de Pixar son excelentes, el sonido 5.1 en Espanol esta muy bien grabado y traducido, y la historia de la pelicula esta muy bien escrita. Una muy buena pelicula para verla con toda la familia. Esta es una de las mejores peliculas que Disney ha sacado ultimamente.
1582701709|1.0|There is no Secret in this book. Watch the Musical \\"Music Man\\" and follow Harold Hill's method of \\"thinkology\\". That's all this book is about. It's funny in the musical, it's sad in this book.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I paid to see this movie three times, full price, for the priviledge of taking other adults to see it. And so far, universally, all the adults loved it too.  <br /> <br />Mumble's dancing 'ain't penguin', says his father Memphis, but its his method of self expression. This delightful animated feature, I'm sure deeply influenced by \\"March of the Penguins\\" tells us the animated version of the story of the Emperor penguin and its lifestyle. Its the life of a penguin, from the perils of being different as a child, to the difficulties finding acceptance and love as an adolescent/young adult, all the way to trying to communicate with other species and feeling helpless and lost.  <br /> <br />The animation is divine, and I do love this way of bringing the musical into the modern age. Yes, on the one hand I miss the days of original songs in musicals. But kids of all ages can enjoy this one, recognize the music, and enjoy being sung to without having to feel uncool or archaic.  <br /> <br />Its funny that some people say they wish there had been no message in the movie about the greater global environment we all live in. But it was an important plot issue from the beginning, the lack of fish. And the lack of fish in real life has very human causes, as well as environmental. By letting the penguins interact with humans from their point of view, I think it helped people find themselves in the story playing a part. Not the intentional villian, not at all! But just an example of how we can all unconsciously harm others if we don't look at how we interact with the world. <br /> <br />And Hugh Jackman does the best ever Elvis impersonation!
6305897786|2.0|If you believe in the Devil, and I mean *really* believe in the devil, I can't think of one good reason why you'd want to summon the Devil into this world. At worst, he's purported to be the father of lies, and one of the fallen angels. This means that anything he tells you is suspect, anything he gives you is suspect, and he probably has the power to make you believe in him. Yikes. Not a safe trip. Not a terribly sane trip, for that matter.    Yet that is precisely what Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) desired. He had one copy of \\"The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow\\", and there were three extant. One or all of these books is a forgery, and one or all holds the secret to summoning Satan. He hires Corso (played a bit too understated by Johnny Depp) to research the other texts.    The movie is based on the novel \\"The Club Dumas\\" by Arturo Perez Reverte, which I favorably reviewed.    I can't give a similar review to The Ninth Gate for a number of reasons. First, Depp's portrayal of Corso was one dimensional, and Corso was a multi-dimensional character. Whether that's the filmmaker's fault or Depp's I don't know, but Depp's Corso was a dreadful bore.    A mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his, demonstrating supernatural abilities. We are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping Corso, or in what her abilities might have been (never mind her identity). Yet since this is a character from the book, I know why she was there, I have a pretty good idea who she was (and good job to the author on how he handled that!) and her character's interests and abilities could have been better communicated, with very little difficulty.    Also, in a rather silly departure from the book (departures are fine...I'm not being a book snob), they substitute an average sized platinum-blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall, white, and physically imposing. There's nothing that irritates me more than a \\"quota substitute\\". I don't think this particular sub had any speaking lines, which makes it that much more of an insult.    I love intelligent thrillers. (I didn't care for The Da Vinci Code.) This was a thriller that spent time in libraries, that examined woodcuttings drawn, perhaps, by Lucifer himself - yet I wasn't engaged.    In 1999, when the film was released, I couldn't sit through it. After reading The Club Dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two, I approached the film again, hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help. It did not. In fact, it raised more questions.    I would give this movie 2.5 stars and round it up to 3; however, I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD gets a big spanking for not having subtitles. There's no excuse, in this day and age, for a mainstream DVD not to offer subtitles.

B000002UA5|3.0|This was Floyd's last album of the 60s, and consisted of two LPs.  The first was a sort of live retrospective, consisting of extended versions of four classic Floyd tunes from this period.  The second was combination of studio experiments by the individual Floyd members, each doing his own thing. <br /> <br />The live album is great.  The original versions of each tune were pretty good, but during the '69-'71 Floyd was at their best in concert and this is the only official release (besides the film Live at Pompeii) to document that fact.  There isn't any of the slick, studio-reproduction aspect that you hear on Delicate Sound of Thunder or Pulse.  Instead the band expands and explores the material.  For example, \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene\\" is much more intense than the studio version, and \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" has a very spacy organ solo in the middle.  People who expect tunes with catchy melodies will probably be disappointed, but those that like the more adventurous and instrumental side of Pink Floyd will be very pleased.  If you like this stuff, look for other (\\"unofficial\\") recordings from the '69-'71 period -- some of those are even better than this one. <br /> <br />The studio album is one of the worst things they ever did.  Each member of Floyd gets half an LP, and they mostly use it for avant-garde experiments.  I've got nothing against avant-garde experimentation, but Pink Floyd had much better experiments elsewhere.  Wright offers a quasi-classical multi-layered keyboard composition (\\"Sysyphus\\"), Mason a drums & percussion piece with electronic effects (\\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" -- definitely the worst thing on this album), and Gilmour a guitar-oriented composition (\\"The Narrow Way\\").  Waters's section consists of a lovely acoustic/pastoral ballad (\\"Grantchester Meadows\\") and a strange vocal-effects collage (\\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals...\\").  I'd say that \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" is the only good thing on the studio album, though Part 3 of \\"The Narrow Way\\" (the song part) is OK. <br /> <br />This is still one of the first \\"early Floyd\\" albums you should pick up (after Piper), but I am guessing that in the long run you will probably only listen to the live half.
B0000214F0|5.0|Not for youth of any kind. Very well done adult movie classic. Adults only content. Great acting, with great actors.
B000002U9Y|4.0|With Syd Barrett's departure, Pink Floyd experienced a creative crisis.  They had a new guitarist/vocalist in David Gilmour, but needed someone to step up in the composition department.  Neither Rick Wright nor Roger Waters were skilled songwriters like Barrett.  That said, this album is pretty good and has the first hints of the classic sound Pink Floyd would develop in the early 70s.    Of the 3 Waters compositions, \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" is by far the best -- a vaguely Middle-Eastern melody, whispered vocals by Waters, and very spacy playing by Wright and Gilmour.  Live versions of this tune, as you can hear on Ummagumma or Live in Pompeii, would be much more adventurous.  \\"Let There Be More Light\\" is a pretty good tune (with silly lyrics), while \\"Corporal Clegg\\" (Waters's first anti-war lyric) is annoying.  Of the two Wright compositions, the nostalgic psych-pop \\"Remember a Day\\" is better; \\"See Saw\\" isn't as good, though it's not nearly as bad as some Floyd fans would have you believe.  The only collaborative composition on this album, the title track, is arguably the best thing on the album.  Lots of out-there collective improvisation by the band, leading to some pretty wild playing, and finally concluding with a very churchy chord progression and some choral voices.  A classic -- one of their best achievements, though like \\"Set the Controls\\", live versions would be stretched much further out.  Finally, the album concludes with Syd Barrett's final contribution to Floyd, \\"Jugband Blues\\".  It's a much darker tune than most of his contributions to Piper and makes for an enigmatic farewell.    Saucerful of Secrets isn't as good as Piper or Floyd's early 70s albums.  That said, it contains two of their most important tunes (\\"Saucerful\\", \\"Set the Controls\\") and some other enjoyable stuff.  If you're exploring early Floyd, you will need to pick it up.  Three and a half stars.
0143036556|5.0|Fascinating! I just received this book last week and have already finished it. It was a very well written book, easy to follow, and quite enjoyable. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />It reminded me of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States in that I gained so much information (that I didn't know before), in a unique and intriguing format.
B000002UA0|4.0|This is the album that put Pink Floyd on the map.  It sounds quite different from their later albums -- at this point, the sound is dominated by guitarist/vocalist Syd Barrett and his whimsical psychedelic pop compositions.  Also, when we think of Pink Floyd today, we think of long guitar solos; but here, the key instrumental sound is Rick Wright's farfisa organ. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are very catchy, with eccentric and often child-like lyrics.  The closing trilogy of songs (\\"Chapter 24\\", \\"The Scarecrow\\", and my personal favorite \\"Bike\\") is perhaps the best part of the album.  \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is different than the other Barrett-penned tunes, with its space-rock lyrics, and it would survive Barrett's departure from the band.  Roger Waters makes his vocal/composer debut on \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope\\", which is awful and easily the worst thing on this CD.  The two instrumental compositions, \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and \\"Pow R. Toc. H\\" (both composed the group) are the most obvious links to Pink Floyd's later cosmic excursions.  There are better versions of \\"Overdrive\\" on bootlegs, but this one is pretty good. <br /> <br />Overall, this is so different from later Floyd that fans coming from The Wall or even Dark Side of the Moon won't believe it's the same band (and might not like the results).  That said, Syd Barrett was a gifted songwriter and the music the band produced under his leadership was great.  Definitely recommended!
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I've really enjoyed this CD from John Mayer. His musicality is excellent and solid, but not showy. It's like falling into the softest blanket ever and resting with pleasant thoughts for a while. What I like the most, I think, is how the writing is completely his own. By that, I mean he doesn't tailor his song to what he thinks we would like to hear. He writes what he feels and knows. And in today's pop market, that makes him an original.

B000MTDRKE|1.0|While I love Mike and Randy on Neal's solo discs, the unfortunate subject matter is very negative and could certainly be construed as offensive, especially to Catholics with descriptions like \\"whore\\" and \\"the beast\\".

In fact after playing this, I wanted to listen to Transatlantic to cleanse my palate. Let's hope Neal takes time out for a real rethink after this one.

B000MCH5P4|2.0|Blog, Slog and Chug.  I don't know how else to describe this film!  At times it seemed gripping but for the life of me I cannot figure out why anyone would deem it Oscar worthy.  Brad Pitt's performance is okay, but nothing to write home about.  The film at first seems to show a domino effect of happenings but soon they just all sink down into slow, depressing ooze.  I was so looking forward to watching it only to be disappointed.  Kate Blanchett is rather stunning in acting like a distant, removed woman who tries to forge ahead in life while still carrying an extreme load of emotional baggage.  The happenings after the rifle shot are not even realistic as every person in this desert land owns some kind of firearm to begin with.  Some very sick happenings with a child, or at least what appear to be, was enough to make me sick but not enough to make me feel like it contributed any relevance to the storyline.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is an actor I can never take seriously in roles like this.  Maybe it is the whole Brangelina thing, who knows.  He is a second rate actor at best and I think that the likes of Adrien Brody would have done a much better job.<br /><br />If you like it great, give it a chance.  I did, I just did not care for it and felt it went so overboard in the \\"look everything is bad bad bad\\" department that I was ready to watch snow on channel 3 just to get back to...reality.

B000JBWWRY|3.0|In this third DVD edition of the Disney classic, the colours have been drastically altered, the contrast is subdued and the bitrate is not very high. The colours are slanted, not so much towards yellow as towards gold. Everything is imbued with a golden glow which makes Tinker Bell the real heroine of the story and brings out the golden highlights on everything from Mr. Darling's cuff links to the golden ornaments on Hook's ship. Peter Pan's tunic is at times almost goldenrod instead of Lincoln green. There is no true blue sky, just a variant of Egyptian Blue. Neverland sometimes looks like your lazy neighbour's parched garden. The skies are often milky white or beige. The red and blue wallpaper in the Darling children's bedroom is now brownish. Mermaid Lagoon has lost its greenery and turned a repulsive labia pink... The funny thing is, once you accept that the action takes place in Neverland in the fall, with lots of brown, yellow and orange leaves everywhere, you sort of learn to like it. It's a wild, one might say \\"experimental\\", concept that must have been arrived at after much joint-smoking at DTS Digital Images (the restorers). It's not so much a restoration as a revision. And then, not so much a Technicolor restoration as an Eastmancolor restoration (little joke here). It's very strange.<br /><br />On the down side, the Redskins have turned a politically correct pink. On the plus side, every brown and yellow surface is made to shine unnaturally, even at night, and lots of things are visible in the dark that weren't before. The reverse is true in the daytime.<br /><br />More revisionism: I noticed a slight shimmy in the London cityscape at night just before the camera pans up to Neverland has been eliminated in this version. Can they do that?<br /><br />In the indoor scenes, this slant towards yellow makes sense as it replicates the warm, nostalgic, homey glow of lamplight. Otherwise... The best thing I can say is that it gives the viewer a brand new (though some might say old-fashioned) perspective on a film he's seen maybe too often and the total effect is dream-like and reminiscent of a yellowed full-colour illustration in an old picture book. A quick look at the numerous art galleries in the extras will remind you that there should have been a whole lot more green and blue everywhere according to the original artwork.<br /><br />As the picture is slightly zoomed out compared to previous versions, this too adds to the majesty and delicacy of the action. It's less \\"in your face\\".<br /><br />Where the PE really shines, though, is in the sound department which might persuade me to buy this edition (I only rented). The whole soundtrack (dialog, singing voices, orchestra, sound effects) has been completely rethought, refurbished and rechannelled creatively for 5.1 (in French and Spanish too). There is a lot of work evident also in the original mono track. But in the Enhanced home theatre mix (the word \\"enhanced\\" appears three times on the cover), very interesting things happen. The dialog is mostly in the center speaker but the music comes regularly through the other four speakers. At some points, individual instruments are made to come through all the surround speakers (like the harp, when Peter appears on the rooftop, instead of the flute, like you might guess). The sound of instruments and voices has been given more resonance. It is less harsh, dry or abrupt. The children voices are almost bearable in this version. There is nothing grating in the brass or in any other part of the orchestra. Everything sounds modern, natural and free-flowing. Of course, the sound effects have been amplified with bass and the mix makes good use of directional effects (Tinker Bell's glockenspiel and c&eacute;leste, the crocodile's ticking clock, Peter's ghostly voice in Skull Rock). The whole film becomes a symphony where the music takes center stage without overshadowing the character voices, which are now disentangled from the surrounding music. This is another element that adds to the dream-like quality of the whole and one that I like very much. By comparison, the 5.1 mix of the Special Edition (2002) and the 4.0 mix of the Limited Edition (1999) was only fat, untreated mono with lots of harshness in the loud passages and instability in the soft ones.<br /><br />Well... considering the radical changes made to the colour palette, maybe they could have called this the \\"Golden Slumbers Edition\\" or \\"Pixy Dust Edition\\" or, better still \\"Global Warming Edition\\"... And it's not something you can correct with the Tint button (which adds red or green) or with the Cold setting (which adds a little blue). But it's perfect if you are sound-oriented and an improved sound is very important to you, if you have no memories of what \\"Peter Pan\\" used to look like or if you really pictured Hook's harpsichord as being made of solid gold.to the dream-like quality of the whole and one that I like very much.

0670813028|5.0|I first read this book about 20 years ago, and over the years it has come back to haunt me again and again. How many books do you read in which there are 7 main characters, and you know every one of them inside out? I havn't read IT for about 5 years, because my copy fell to bits, but could tell you the names and stories of each of those characters. Stephen King excels himself, his brilliant writing style is even better than usual, and this gripping book, though large and complex, is never confusing.  <br />I rate this book as a modern masterpiece, and the best of King's work.
1400082773|5.0|This autobiographical work by Barak Obama is a well-written glimpse into his childhood and early adulthood.  It was written before he became a fixture on the political stage, but after he bacame editor of the Harvard Law Review.  He gives the book a wonderful combination of self-depricating humor, honesty, and insight.  He does not portray himself as the perfect anything, but instead takes an introspective look at his family and early years.  The backdrop of his early life is also fascinating.  He was born in, and mostly raised in, Hawaii, but you also get to hear about his years in Indonesia, California, New York, Chicago, and his trip to Kenya to meet his father's very different family.  He grew up seeing his father only a very few times and was heavily influenced by this lack, hence the title of the book and one of the main themes that runs through it.  I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to get to know this man a little bit.  I think that it is much more interesting than The Audacity of Hope, which while good, and seemingly mostly honest, was clearly written with politics not only in mind, but at the center of the book.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The \\"Firefly\\" series is a TRUE GEM. With great characters, excellent writing, and stunning visuals, life on the frontier of space is presented as both exciting and ordinary making that life seem real and truly accessible. The story revolves around the captain and crew of Serentity, a small cargo vessel, that works on the fringes of civilization occassionally smuggling and theiving to make ends meet. The only downside is that just as I was starting to love the characters and better understand each person's story the series seems cut short. Watch the DVD version to get the backstory on how the series was canceled and fans revolted creating momentum for a follow up feature movie \\"Serentiy\\". <br /> <br />Be prepared to ache that more were made, although you won't want to miss it. This Movie \\"Serenity\\" is an excellent complement to the series, \\"Firefly\\" and explains more of the backstory. Director, Joss Whedon cracked a home run with this work.

B000J4QWMC|3.0|Watching this film I came to the conclusion that the only reason this movie was titled \\"Miami Vice\\" , and the main characters called Crockett and Tubbs, was an intent by producer-creator Anthony Yerkovich and producer-writer-director Michael Mann to capitalise on the \\"name\\" power and fan base of the original television series. <br /> <br />    <br />This film and its characters were so utterly different from what the tv series was about in terms of personality and style that they have next to nothing in common. Mann could have called this \\"Smugglers' Blues\\" and named his characters Boone and Staggs (or whatever) for all the similarity there was between the two presentations. <br /> <br />There is none of the easy comraderie here of the tv show, none of the amusing elements like Crockett living on a boat in the marina with Elvis the alligator, and none of that engaging likability of Don Johnson himself..part of what \\"made\\" the show. Gone, too, is that driving Jan Hammer theme music, and, very significantly, gone is that mysterious, charismatic backstop of Edward James Olmos's \\"Lt. Castillo\\". <br /> <br />This, in essence,is a well written, well acted, well directed, sumptuously photographed undercover-cops-and-smugglers actionfest that is long on realistic looks at the nature of the drug business and the methodologies and psychological-emotional stresses and temptations that \\"go with the territory\\" of fighting it. Colin Farrell is  <br />excellent in his role, as is Jamie Foxx in his. I just can't make the \\"connect\\" here between THIS Crockett & Tubbs and the much more <br />iconic team of Johnson and Thomas (and Olmos). The Hollywood answer to my <br />disconnect would be that \\"Hey, it's just like switching James Bonds on you\\", but the effect is more sweeping than that. <br /> <br />Don't misunderstand me. This is a solid, enjoyable movie. Quite entertaining. There just seems to be a recognition gap between this product and what the public at large visualizes, image-wise, when it thinks \\"Miami Vice\\".
B000K7UBTI|4.0|Overall I have to say that this movie was very well done.  It is certainly better than the two Ultimate Avengers cartoon movies.  The animation was great, I do like how they used 3-D graphics for the armors.  The redesign of the grey armor made it look threatening, definitely much cooler than the original grey armor.   <br />I have a few critiques.  I'm not sure I liked all the changes to Mandarin's storyline, and the very final battle with Mandarin was a little bit disappointing.  All the fights leading up to it were great though.  The movie had a good mix between action and plot, which I always appreciate.  It's annoying to watch super hero movies that don't have enough action.  Definitely a worthy buy for any Iron Man fan, and even people who aren't fans.

B00004TX5F|5.0|Lavish, lusty, imaginative, free-wheeling bio-pic about the life of opera singer Farinelli, one of the great superstars of the 18th century.  The sets and costumes are appropriately extravagant.  The Baroque aesthetic is flamboyantly genuine.  As Carlo and Riccardo Broschi, Stefano Dionisi and Enrico Lo Verso are both darkly beautiful and splendidly sexy.<br /><br />The Church prohibited women from singing in Rome and, in its infinite wisdom, condoned the castration of talented boys to provide treble voices for the Sistine Chapel. Families would send a musical son to a conservatory for this purpose just as they might send another to a seminary for the priesthood.  The great castrati, far from being greeted with the aversion of a modern sensibility, were venerated. Women wept, swooned, fainted at their performances, and they lived lives of great comfort.<br /><br />Born Carlo Broschi, Farinelli was a musical genius with a voice of extraordinary facility, power, and beauty;  his older brother Riccardo is portrayed here as a second-rate composer whose notoriety is entirely dependent upon the genius of his younger brother.  This is just one of the historical facts that have been altered or exaggerated for the sake of dramatic effect.<br /><br />Riccardo was a successful, if minor, composer.  Their brotherly disputes were the subject of much gossip, but not for the reason promulgated in the film.  Carlo took his stage name to honor a benefactor named Farina.  He was reportedly not much interested in sex, but many castrati were highly sensual as Farinelli is depicted in the film.  He never sang for Handel but the composer was a jovial man and treated musicians with respect.  The decision to portray him as an ogre is the film's greatest, and most unnecessary, distortion.<br /><br />The star of the film, ultimately, is the resplendent music.  The voice of Farinelli (miraculously synthesized from a soprano and a counter-tenor) is glorious.  The performances are joyously Baroque.  And, considering the extraordinary beauty of Stefano Dionisi and Enrico Lo Verso, it is a luxurious feast for eyes as well as the ears.ously Baroque.

0307237699|5.0|Extremely informative, above average writing,pleasure to read. A \\"must read\\" whether one favors Obama or not.
032147404X|5.0|The day this book arrived, I read it from cover to cover and was extremely pleased with the ease of use and the recommendations that the author made. This book is great for amateur or vacation photographers like me. I was very happy with my Canon AE1 program for over 25 years but finally bit the digital bullet last year. Although this book is a bit more for the digital SLR user, the recommendations are easily useable on my Sony DSC-H5. I don't think that I will need to purchase other books of this nature, since, this one has all of the info that I will ever need. A good investment.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I loved the edginess of this movie, it's not for middle america for sure, but if you are somewhat off of center you'll get it and really enjoy it.  Gyllenhall was awesome, her performance makes me want to see everything she's ever done.  The movie has a big heart and a nicely perverse sense of humor.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|An excellent movie, well paced, well acted, that really held one's interest throughout. We will watch it again!
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Love this show!!!! Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowen are this witches that will get you traped with their magic! Filled with entertainment!!!! RECOMENDED!!!!!
0618680004|5.0|I have been an atheist for most of my adult life.  I have come to the point that I no longer try to even discuss religion with the religious.  It just seemed to be something no one was willing to discuss with anyone that disagreed with them. In the rare cases that they did, my standpoint would be on trial but it was completely unnacceptable for theirs to be.  The \\"burden of disproof\\" seemed to be on me.  (One of the reasons I now have the Flying Spaghetti Monster on my car). <br />   This book would be great for any religious person with the slightest tick of rationality.  Then again most of those that tell me to read the Bible (which I have), believing that it might convince me that I'm wrong (...) probably won't touch anything that could potentially convince them that they're wrong... <br />   Many have said that this book goes too far, but I think this just illustrates one of Dawkin's points quite well.  Religions have been off the table for far too long.  It's time we started testing them rationally just like we would any other hypotheses.  How else can we claim to call this an age of reason?
B0009X7664|5.0|This movie proved to be a turning stone in our history.  A very true to life experience of what life was like in the south during that period of time and how biased people were back then.

B000KCHZK6|3.0|I preordered this CD a month before it was released. I anticipated it to be as smooth and perfect as her first two albums but I can honestly say the style is different than what I expected. I know it's good to change styles every now and then to show versatility. However, what drew me to her music was the sweet sound of her voice in a soft jazzy tones. This album was not as good as the first two in my opinion.
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|I was excited when I rented this film as I enjoy this futuristic type of thriller.  But it is preachy, slooooow, and one huge anti-Christian mess.
B0002ZMITY|2.0|I had the opportunity to watch the series, as shown on HBO after the movie.  Had I watched that first I would not have purchased the movie.  I definitely felt that it could have been better.  So my recommendation is skip the movie and purchase season 1 & 2 from HBO.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I had listen to the audio book a few years ago and loved it.  Infact, I passed it on to several like mined friends.  Then I heard it was coming out on DVD.

0743496728|2.0|This book takes a serious issue (the cause of school shootings) and trivializes the suffering of the families involved by battering the emotions of the reader, then doing a \\"bait and switch\\" ending that concludes nothing. <br />At first, the book appears to be a worthy fictionalized study of the possible causes of these shootings. But the ending yanks all meaning from the book by devising an ending that is neither believable nor on target with the emotions that have been pulled from the reader. ( I am 58 years old.)
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Wow, I just finished the \\"LOVE\\" CD. <br />It is an amazing piece of work and I for one hope the the Martins get a Grammy,if they didn't,or won't,then pity the music business. <br />I have been listening to the Fabs for 40 years now and I heard instruments,vocalizing that I never heard before; and I am not refering to the many outtakes that were utilised. <br />Fantastic sound and a fitting salute to the world's greatest rock'n'roll band-I plan on seeing show in Vegas or wherever i can. <br />Thank You Sir George and Giles Martin-you're geniuses. <br />And thank you Cirque Du Soliel for this great gift. <br />By all means,get this CD...if you love the Beatles,you will love this CD. <br />GET IT NOW!!!! <br />Dennis <br />PS...and THANK YOU, John,Paul,George and Ringo. <br />Your music is a Blessing to us all. <br />

B000FGGE68|5.0|I have to admit that when I rented this movie the first time, I just wanted to watch Milla Jovovich kick peoples butts. However, as I watched it I realized that it had an interesting plot, and a real flow to it. The visual effect and film making were also very well done. Oh yeah, you also get to see the beautiful Milla fight hordes of enemies using many different fighting styles, and in many different outfits. Ultraviolet was one of the few surprises that I have come across lately. It has found its way into my permanent collection.

B000LXHK2C|4.0|I am a huge Russell Crowe fan so I am not sure he can make a bad flim, just and underrated one. If you like travel, Russell and wine it is an entertaining movie. Is it great? No. Probably was a great excuse to go to the south of France for Crowe and Scott. Hey, I wish I had been part of the team. Get it, watch it and enjoy it for what it is, entertainment.
B00066VUPM|5.0|Travis is one of my favourite Brit bands - always a pleasure to sing along to Fran's superb lyrics and I enjoy the hints of the Scottsman's accent. This is real and polished. True musicians and I wish more Americans knew about them!! Buy this now!!!! If you like Coldplay you'll love Travis.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|We came to the West Wing late and from a country outside the USA. We have found it compelling viewing with some episodes that used all aspects of cinema so well they went far beyond the usual TV fare. <br />Watching them all back to back from this box set you can have some quibbles such as unueven character development at times (people do things very much 'out of character' occasionally) and everyone has the same sense of humour (which I've never found in a workplace). But I think these things were more noticeable watching them all at once. In a long series such as this the writers could be forgiven for drifting and forgetting from time to time. The acting is almost uniformly excellent. <br />I'd like to particularly applaud the packaging of this box set. Its a compact way of presenting 45 disks and is very appropriate to the series -a blue leather folio with files for each season inside.It also has several lavish accompanying booklets. Clever and appropriate marketing. <br />The price was fine too - reasonable 'per season' cost as sold by Amazon.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Will she ever stop giving us amazing new music?? <br />I am so into this music it pains my other half as it always seems to be playing!! Good job Madge!!! Buy this if you like dance music, if you just like Madaonna, or if you just want to hear something fresh and uplifting.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is honestly one of my very favorite movies of all time. I could just sit and watch it over and over again.  The script is phenomenal, the performances outstanding, the direction impeccable, and hey--it's got Jack Nicholson.  It's not a comfortable film to watch--but it's fun, brilliant, and one of those movies that leaves you so unsatisfied at the end that you're perfectly okay with it.  I'd totally recommend it to everyone.
0143037757|3.0|This work is not up to Judt's usual standard of keen analysis. His personal background may be responsible for his unhelpful analysis of the origins and development of the Cold War. He treats the Soviet presence in European affairs as being somehow an evil threat, whereas the meddling of the US in the politics especially of France and Italy is either not mentioned or glossed over.  <br /> <br />Although at the end of World War II, the US held half the world's capital and produced half the world's goods while the Soviet Union, invaded from the East three times in half a century, was prostrate, Judt treats the two adversaries as equal and as if the Soviet Union, a European power, had less legitimacy than the US, a cross-Atlantic power, in  Eastern Europe affairs. <br /> <br />Judt's tendentious treatment of events in Post-War: A History of Europe Since 1945, makes the work not even particularly helpful as a reference work, for key events in post-war political affairs are treated more like morality plays than real-life events entailing the sort of conflicted choices real people make and which Judt normally is so good at analysing.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|As a 67 year old woman, I thought I would be turned off by the rest of the songs on this CD, but only the first one got on my last nerve.  The rest I really enjoyed.  But Crazy really got me going..... <br />

0618680004|4.0|This was an interesting read that I found hard to put down.  Richard Dawkins made some excellent points that would be difficult to refute.  He also filled in some blanks, and cleared some things up, when it comes to what an evolutionist actually beieves about the origin of mankind, the earth etc..  I found it wasnt what I had been taught by my elders, and through the religious literature I had been raised on.  Will it cause some to set religion and God aside? Maybe, but I doubt that it will sway the blind faith the most religious zealots have inside them.  I especially like the chapters that dealt with the bible and certain beliefs and scriptures that modern day christians believe.  When you look at what most christians believe as fact from the Richard Dawkins point of view, its almost laughable that educated mankind has actually believed such things for so many years, and also been willing to die for those insane beliefs.   <br />How many have died in the name of God?  Millions over the years!  How many have died in the name of atheism?  NONE!   <br />Am I an atheist now?  Not Hardly, but I have a better understanding of what an atheist is, and why they believe what they believe.  As I continue my search for truth I may very well end up one, who knows!  But a good judge considers both sides before making a decision.

I have several versions of each concerto, but this is the 'go to' CD when I want to hear them.  The Emperor Concerto is, in my mind, the greatest piano concerto ever written.
B000KQF6X0|5.0|Was Great Then, Now Better Than Ever on Blu-Ray.
B00005MP58|4.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice, because it was originally a mini-series, doesn't leave out all the detail that the Hollywood version had to(which made the storyline very hard to follow-almost unbelieveable).  Colin Firth plays his character well and keeps the mystery alive even if you've seen it over and over!  Jennifer Firth is the perfect combination of beauty and spunk-her character is wonderfully outspoken for her time!  Although long, this version is worth the watching if you want to truly see the book come to life!  The only thing missing with this new DVD set would have been optional subtitles, because even when you get used to the accents I still feel like I miss some of the words and that would have been helpful.  Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|The live concert DVD included with this box set is reason enough to buy the box set.  Classic Bruce from the 70's.  This really is a must have for any true Bruce fan.  The second DVD is a narrated by Bruce and is retrospective on the Born to Run recording sessions and his early days in Asbury Park.

Every few minutes I hear stuff that's been recycled from the other, better, albums. There are less songs than soundscapes, streeeeeetched to fill the cd. I once read a review on the internet that claimed this album was a brilliant hoax, to confuse the internet-pirates. The REAL new Tool album would be coming soon. I wish it was true.

B000002ULO|5.0|When the George Martin-produced album \\"Tug of War\\" came out in the early 1980's, Rolling Stone Magazine gushed that it was the album Paul McCartney had been waiting 12 or 13 years to make.  Loads of people, including me, bought it and found it much better than the deliberately shallow, insouciant schlock of the 1970's which he recorded with, may she rest in peace, the Mrs. Miller-esquely atrocious vocals of his wife, Linda.  And I agree \\"Tug of War\\" looms over its post-breakup McCartney predecessors, with the powerful title cut, the stillingly moving Lennon tribute \\"Here Today,\\" and the silly-but-fun, Beatlesque \\"The Pound Is Sinking.\\"  All three songs were plainly the result of heavy collaboration between McCartney and Martin... as were virtually all of McCartney's greatest Beatles songs from \\"Rubber Soul\\" on. <br /> <br />But this review is not about the very good \\"Tug of War\\" album, whose quality level it took McCartney over a decade and an overdue reunion with Martin to achieve.  No, this review is about the NEXT high-quality album it took McCartney over a decade to come up with--\\"Flaming Pie,\\" which has supplanted the George Harrison/Phil Spector extravaganza, \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" as my favorite post-breakup album by any of the Beatles.   <br /> <br />Like \\"Tug of War,\\" this album serves as a reminder of how desperately my favorite Beatle needs a second genius's helping hand to make his best stuff, whether the genius be:  <br /> <br />(1)  \\"Producer of the Century\\" George Martin, who worked with McCartney on the fun track \\"Beautiful Night,\\" two sweet-but-substantial tracks in \\"Calico Skies\\" and \\"Great Day,\\" and the powerful \\"Somedays,\\" which for my money could have been one of Paul's better post-Pepper's Beatles songs, and which certainly displays Martin's genius;  <br /> <br />(2)  An uncharacteristically restrained Jeff Lynne, who worked with Paul to produce rockers like the title cut, opening cut \\"The Song We Were Singing\\" and \\"Souvenirs,\\" as well as thepoignantly beautiful \\"Little Willow\\" and several other cuts;  <br /> <br />(3)  Steve Miller, whose collaborations with Paul (\\"If You Wanna,\\" \\"Young Boy\\" and \\"Used to Be Bad\\") are my least favorite bloc of songs on the album, but are still well above the schlock McCartney had accustomed us to in the previous 1/4 century; and <br /> <br />(4)  Geoff Emerick, the boy genius who engineered the albums \\"Revolver,\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper's,\\" \\"The Beatles\\" (a.k.a. \\"The White Album\\") and \\"Abbey Road\\"--as fine a quartet of albums as anyone ever made.  Emerick engineered or co-engineered all but one song on this album (\\"Calico Skies,\\" which was co-produced by Martin).   <br /> <br />The figurative helping hands of these other geniuses are all over this album.  A classically-trained young neighbor of mine came to my house at my request to listen to the beautiful \\"Somedays,\\" with its Martin-scored chamber ensemble for a string octet, three flutes, a harp, an oboe and a cor anglais.  At about the 2:30 or 3:00 mark of the song, she looked at me with obvious excitement and asked, in a wide-eyed whisper, \\"Is the whole album like this?\\" <br /> <br />No, it's not, but Beatles' albums were never filled with semi-classical Martin productions from cover to cover, either, and that's probably why I love those numbers so much.  I wouldn't dare suggest that \\"Somedays\\" stands with \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" \\"Yesterday\\" or the predominantly Lennon masterpiece, \\"A Day in the Life.\\"  But it's a terrific song which makes you simultaneously bask in the knowledge Martin and McCartney never lost their chemistry, and tear your hair out for what COULD have been, during the 1/4-century between the breakup and this album. <br /> <br />\\"Somedays\\" gets my vote for the best song on the album, but it's by no means the only very good or great track.  The other heavily Martin-scored track, \\"Beautiful Night,\\" is the closest thing to a Beatles reunion you will get, with a Martin-scored orchestral arrangement, McCartney playing all sorts of instruments and singing lead most of the way, and Ringo not only playing the drums, but singing lead (!) during part of the 1.5-minute singalong refrain at the end.  No, it's not within a mile of \\"Hey Jude,\\" but it's a fine, fun song.   <br /> <br />The title track, \\"Flaming Pie,\\" has lyrics almost as silly as the dreadful \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\" from the \\"Ram\\" album, but a solid rocking melody almost as good as \\"Too Many People,\\" one of the few redeeming features on \\"Ram.\\"  \\"Souvenirs\\" is a great ballad-turned-rocker which reminds us how terrific Paul's sui generis voice is, and shows us he can still scream in key on notes many \\"tenors\\" could only hit in a weak falsetto.  My sister thinks the beautiful \\"Little Willow\\" is as good as any post-Beatles McCartney song... a point of view I don't share, but it's a very pretty, touching song. <br /> <br />If you're a Beatlemaniac who loved McCartney's best Beatles songs, it's impossible to listen to this cd without having two conflicting reactions: (1) Given the right incentive and supporting cast, it's great to know he can still do it; and (2) why the hell hasn't he chosen to do it all of these years? <br /> <br />Whatever the answer to Question (2), McCartney and company did do it here.  If you're only going to buy one non-compilation McCartney album, make it this one.    <br /> <br />Jim F.
B00005JPG1|5.0|<br />The exquisite Bay Area newspaper publicity ad for David Fincher's ZODIAC is in full color and shows the Golden Gate Bridge enshrouded in fog late at night and a figure standing where the \\"I\\" should be.  It is taken from an unusual angle, the northeast corner of Marin County from a low angle, not the northwest headlands.  And there is an existential caption:  \\"There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.\\"  The movie is an intelligent and suspenseful--and surprisingly bloodless, given the material and the director of \\"SE7EN\\"--crime drama about the hunt for the serial killer known as \\"The Zodiac\\".  He terrorized the Bay Area from the late 1960's to the early 1980's, my college years, so this is a subject I know and feel passionate about. <br /> <br />Instead of a routine police investigation without a satisfying ending, our three protagonists--brilliantly played by Robert Downey, Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, and Mark Ruffalo--are an ace SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE reporter named Paul Avery (Downey), CHRONICLE political cartoonist and cryptogram expert Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal), and homicide inspector Dave Toschi (Ruffalo).  The movie has been magnificently adapted by James Vanderbilt from two non-fiction books by Graysmith.  They play off each other perfectly.  Avery is an alcoholic chain-smoker, ideal for Downey.  Graysmith is literary, a non-smoker, and insistent on following up every last lead in the still-unsolved case.  And Toschi fights with his police superiors on crime county jurisdiction matters.  Like Graysmith, he is determined to find the killer.  Vanderbilt even finds a way to turn a minus into a plus with the still-unsolved crimes, by creating a movie about obsessed characters who are finally unable to wrap up their obsession neatly; the movie is spellbinding and haunting. <br /> <br />I was afraid to see ZODIAC until I saw the beautiful publicity ad--I've seen movies for much worse reasons!--and the rave reviews from East Coast reviewers andnational magazine critics.  But I still feared a bloodbath.  Fincher (FIGHT GAME, PANIC ROOM) surprised me as the director.  He shows a couple in a 1969 lover's lane being shot to death repeatedly (the guy in the car survived somehow) and a savage knife attack with another couple by a lake (Berryessa?).  And a cab driver in nighttime San Francisco is killed with just gun shots heard on the sound track.  Those are still the only five crimes actually pinned on the Zodiac Killer and the only ones depicted in the movie.  Everything else is talked and argued about in the CHRONICLE newsroom and police stations all over the Bay Area.  The last scene of BONNIE AND CLYDE (1967) has more blood than all of ZODIAC. <br /> <br />Everyone really did their homework here.  There must be one hundred technical consultants and advisors on the end credits, representing seemingly every single county in the Bay Area, plus a few in Southern California as leads are followed up there.  Avery is now dead from his endless cigarettes and alcohol, but Graysmark was a technical advisor who, I believe, still lives in San Francisco.  (The final credit narrative crawl went by way too quickly for me.)  The editing is so tight and suspenseful, even at a long 158 minutes, that I could not find a single place to go out to the bathroom in the middle; so do that and get refreshments before you go into the theatre.  The production design captures my college years in both the Bay Area and Southern California to perfection, and David Shire's music score is appropriately brooding and mysterious. <br /> <br />But more than anything else, ZODIAC is a powerful and flawless crime drama because of director David Fincher's artistry.  I have only seen his serial killer drama, SE7EN, which was a dark and powerful bloodbath; I should rent his PANIC ROOM and FIGHT CLUB.  ZODIAC seems like his crowning achievement, a work of art with a lingering impact long after you leave the theater.  It is in CinemaScope--my blastedCineMark  projection was wide enough for 2.35, but repeatedly cropped out  the extensive date and place captions at the bottom of the screen on a $7.00 matinee. The movie should play unnervingly well in a night bedroom on home video.  Perhaps even better.  Maybe you should wait--and get informative Zodiac Killer bonuses on DVD?--unless you have a theatre complex you know to be professional.   Century Plaza 10 in South San Francisco is a disgrace.  For the price of a couple going at night for $10 each, you could buy the movie on DVD in six months, a most sobering thought. <br /> <br />

B00006LI4S|5.0|I just listened to this DVD last night. This DVD provides great new twists on the original compositions of these songs. If you liked the origianl songs, you'll love these versions with slightly different approaches using a much different combination of instruments. Great to watch as a performance, or play in the background like a CD. But only get it if you've got a good sound system hooked to your DVD to fully appreciate the music on this disk. It's the music more than the performance that makes this a great buy -- as is usually the case with Pink Floyd.

032147404X|5.0|I have read some of Scott Kelby's other books and I have always been impressed. His sense of humor is terrible in a way I can appreciate, but the advice is ultimately useful. I think its written in a way that makes it easy to read even if the jokes make you groan. More importantly the advice is genuinely good help. Granted is equipment is nicer than anything I can afford at the moment, but he tries to offer the best advice he can both for the equipment he recommends and the techniques he uses.

My dad requests a an older and hard to find film on DVD every year for his birthday and Christmas, and I was surprised that this wasn't more difficult to locate.  A troubled young man, an eccentric old woman, and a strange but wonderful love story share the screen.  However, take caution; I wouldn't necessarily think that this would be an appropriate film for anyone under the age of 13.

B00003CXAA|5.0|Dvd set was in excellent, like new condition. <br /> Shipping was fast.
B0006J28BO|5.0|The vocal representation in this film is HUGE! many big name star's voice's are used and they work exceedingly well. The cats are all very cute and the whole story is light-hearted and funny. There are points of intensity that children are sitting on the edge of thier seats for, and parents are laughing at the things the kids don't quite understand, but even if they do understand them, it's still appropriate for them to enjoy. <br />Great movie for all ages, even my mother who hates cartoons, liked this one.
B00006RG9K|5.0|Video is outstanding in quality. Song selection is diverse & satifying. A must get for any Genesis fan!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I thought this was a very informative documentary. There are alot of things I did not know. A must see for everyone, no matter what age you are.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd at its best!!! 5.1 sound is phenomenal! Excellent selection of material. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAN !!!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The rock scene has been pretty boring over the past couple years with nothing really exciting or worthwhile to listen to in the mainstream. This to some is not really a problem but it just sucks to not see great bands having wide recognition. The Chili Peppers are huge, no doubt about it, and they've managed to release a pretty solid and diverse ROCK album. Almost every song is a great song and could be a hit. The production work on the album is also really amazing and it shows to those who know its there. Just listen to all the sounds your hearing. It will amaze you how much work went into this album. If you haven't at least heard it yet.....you definitely should.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The most important film this century. Another way luckily found a message needing to be heard by several billion people.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah has really returned to the singer we all fell in love with.  Her vocal talents really shine with the many different flavors she provides on her latest album.  A must buy if you loved Norah's first album!!
074356619X|5.0|I bought this audio book after 3 people within a two week period had asked me whether I'd heard of it and today, I can't believe it took me two weeks to get it! <br /> <br />While I was already familiar with the main principle of the Law of Attraction -- that like attracts like -- it is the presentation of the information the makes The Secret so, well, attractive. It's genius. <br /> <br />The author, Rhonda Byrne, and a panel of Law of Attraction advocates/teachers (among them doctors, scientists, philosophers and authors) take you through the history of this law (whose practitioners include Socrates, Plato, Mozart, Hugo, Shakespeare and Lincoln to name just a few) and its principles. They also offer specfic steps (actions) that each of us can take to make the law work in our favor -- because it's always working whether we know it or not. <br /> <br />The passion and honesty with which the book is read, the music and quotes by people like Emerson, Edison, MLK, Churchill, Buddha, make the Secret an inspirational, sensory experience. And it works too. <br /> <br />I listen to this book every chance I get and since I started putting this knowledge to use, I have attracted unexpected checks in the mail, people, job opportunities and a new found belief in the abundance that exists in the universe -- for us all. This last benefit alone is worth every penny I paid. <br /> <br />Don't wait two weeks. Don't wait another minute!
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Just due to high demand (the album had just come out), it took a little longer than I had experienced in the past to receive the album, but not very long. . .all in all, GREAT experience!  I enjoy amazon and haven't been let down yet.  The cd was a gift and my sister loves it!  Says it's a great album.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I don't know much about giving a review of any of the films but this one compelled me to. When I first saw this movie what caught my attention was the sweeping landscape they used in the movie which gave this film an authentic backdrop---just the way it was pictured in my mind when I was first introduced to the original literature during my middle school years. Although the plot is somewhat \\"not faithful\\" to the old English/Norse saga, it is in itself a cinematic accomplishment. The writer/s did a good job in reinterpreting a very mythic subject to make it more accessible to the modern audience. It is very difficult how to depict Grendel & mom if we stick to the original desription of them which would just make the movie silly and absurd. Giving them a Neanderthal-like quality is no problem with me. At least the film followed the general essence of the original literature. Mr. Butler and his band of merry men are just fun to watch with their thick, mesmerizing Scottish accent. You could have even mistaken Geatland IS Scotland. If I am a purist I will give this movie a half star which, fortunately, I'm not.
034544678X|4.0|There's a lot in this book that's very worthwhile. Parts of it remind me of another favorite, \\"Adam's Task: Calling Animals by Name,\\" by Vicki Hearne, which combines animal training with philosophy and literary criticism. If you are an animal trainer-- or even just an animal lover-- it's definitely worth checking out.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|This is the best movie ever made, and this collector's edition is wonderful. However, I'd still like to see another disc with outtakes, deleted scenes, etc., as I for one can not get enough of the BBM experience.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I'm not a huge Kenny Wayne Shepherd fan but the collection of talent on this cd/dvd is well worth the price.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Even if this wasn't the most important film in a generation, it would stand out as a fine documentary. Excellent photography, and good pacing make this required viewing in every school around the world.
B00069FLC2|5.0|This DVD of their concert allows Shadows fans the world over, who have never seen them live, to really appreciate the mastery of the original 3 guys, Hank, Tony and Brian. The music of today should be so pure and unprenentious. Truly wonderful. Well produced and the sound is great. The interviews at the end give the background to this great group who have influenced so many aspiring musicians. <br /> <br />R. Foster <br />Barbados <br />West Indies
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I have both the original 12C and the Platinum. The Platinum calculates much quicker than the original and is more user friendly (including a simple back space feature so you don't have to clear the entire field and retype if you accidently press a number twice). I find the keys and the display are easier to read, as well.<br /><br />Depending on your financial situation, you may not want to buy it if you have a functional 12C, but if you are choosing between the two, definitely spend the few extra dollars and get the Platinum.
B000095K7A|4.0|I really liked this album. The LP version came with the album and a second platter of remixes and covers. There is a fantastic cover of the Flaming Lips \\"Everything Has Changed.\\" The core record though is a fantastic smattering of ironically dark poetry blended with catchy pop riffs. I also enjoyed the art work which, in full LP size, was eye-popping to say the least.
006109594X|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book.  It was hard to put down, you were constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next.  The book makes you want to go out and buy the next one in the series.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I guess you could say that \\"Waking Life\\" is a trip.  When I first saw it I hadn't seen anything visually like it before (computer animation and live action digital video) though I've since seen the process used in TV commercials (Charles Schwab, for one).  Some reviewers have said that the constant movement onscreen is distracting or irritating, but I thought it worked very well considering the situation being portrayed - a young man is caught in a lucid dream state, is unable to wake up, is confused and agitated in constantly changing surroundings.  There is much philosophy and much yak-yak-yak.  It's an interesting mix.  With its focus on conversation, the film brought to mind another classic, \\"My Dinner with Andre,\\" and some of the philosophy it contains brought to mind \\"The Matrix,\\" but beyond that, \\"Waking Life\\" stands completely on its own.<br /><br />It's an original, a mind bender, a thought provoker.  Kudos to Richard Linklater and everyone involved.  The soundtrack fits perfectly, too, by the way...
B000KCHZK6|4.0|She likes it very well, but I'm not a fan.
B000E41MRC|5.0|If anyone doubts the reality of what went on in Germany at the time of Hitler's rise to power, they need to see this propaganda movie, superbly produced by Leni Riefenstahl.  These people are really creepy, but the obvious popularity of Hitler and his minions is very clear.  Look at the happy, adoring faces in the crowd.  From the opening scene where the shadow of Hitler's plane skims over the approaches to Munich, to the final rendering of the Horst Wessel Lied, this film grips the viewer.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Having almost all of her albums, I rate this up there as one of the greats.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|This is by far the best movie of 2006, much better than \\"The Departed\\" which won the Oscar.  The movie requires the viewer to focus on the story and use one's gray matter.  The story is intelligently written done and quite thought provoking with a minimum of violence.  I was surprised at Brad Pitt's acting ability and wonder why he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award.  The Japanese actress and the Mexican actress were excellent in their supporting roles.  This is a movie about the characters and not about violence with the characters in supporting roles as in The Departed.
B00009XITP|5.0|It is an oldy but a goody. All the characters are well acted, it has bits of all your very favourite romance movies. Colin Firth is terrific as the Dad. You will see bits of Princess Diaries, bits of Four Weddings and a Funeral and boys like it too! Great Sunday afternoon curl up movie.
B00005ASOI|3.0|Yes, the lighting and photography are different from other films though I kept imagining the colored lights off camera.  The acting and script are pretty good as is the general production design but as a classic horror film, Suspiria rates rather low in my opinion because the blood just doesn't look at all real and if the blood in a horror movie doesn't look real, the film has failed.  That's a shame too since I loved the surround soundtrack.
0790749858|4.0|Your little sports fan will love this. My 3-year old son watches this movie while he shoots baskets in his room. The other day he informed me, \\"Mommy, Michael Jordan retired.\\"  Priceless!
B00000K3CR|5.0|A fun movie for all ages!  Tom Hanks is a thirteen year old boy that is small for his age and can't wait to grow up.  At a carnival Tom makes that wish to be big and wakes up the next morning a grown up.  This hilarious movie is about how he lives as a grown up and see if it is better being BIG
0307120007|5.0|I enjoyed this book as a child, and now enjoy sharing it with my own children.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|For Johnny Depp Fans, cry baby is not the usual movie that you would picture Johnny Depp playing.  This movie takes place in the 1950s, a time when you were either a square or a drape.  Johnny Depp is a drape that falls in love with a square, watch and see the fun musical about what happens when they make a square a drape.  This movie also includes Ricki Lake. <br /> <br />
B000MGUZM0|5.0|^^wonders if members of the band have been swapping books by Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris^^ <br /> <br />Neon Bible satires the ridiculous and absurd nature of American society since 9/11, especially the upswing of religion in the U.S. and how it has influenced political decisions (and the paradox that the influence of irrational faith on the 19 hijackers caused 9/11, yet religious affiliation in this country increases???). <br /> <br />This band's got balls (and talent). Hats off to them.
B000I0QK74|4.0|Come sempre JT riesce a produrre qualche cosa di interessante . <br />Ho comprato nello stesso periodo sia quelo pubblicato dalla COLUMBIA che quello della HALLMARK (fuori catalogo) - contengono alcuni pezzi uguali. <br />Comunque, ottime performances.
1400082773|5.0|Paperback, good condition,the work held my interest.
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|Kind of disappointing as the movie is so good and the music just seems to rock in the movie.  There are a couple of songs on the soundtrack that I don't remember hearing in the movies and you're kind of like \\"what the heck is this?\\".  And there are a couple of songs that I do remember from the movie that aren't in the soundtrack like that song Bye, Bye Baby by the Bay City Rollers (I think that's the name). <br /> <br />It's definately more of a chick type of CD.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This program, which I first saw by accident on PBS, is absolutely magnificent, moving, and beautiful. I have never heard anything like it. I had to own the program and I play it often, I also have the CD. What more can I say, mind blowing!!!!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This is a classic for any family.  There are one or two \\"no-no\\" words, but such a great story!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie shares the same fast-action feel as Lock Stock, but tells a different story.  It's all about the capers and blunders and the good guys getting out on top.  All of the extra budget is noticed with sharper video and A-List actors, but still has the heart of Lock Stock.  This movie is within my top 5.
0316236535|5.0|Since my son is now 3 his imagination is growing.  The cut out pages make the book.  It was recommended by a preschool teacher at his school.  He is even \\"reading\\" it to his baby sister.
074356619X|5.0|I have the DVD and the audio CDs. Listening to and internalizing this information can truly change your life. This sounds profound but when you listen to this then start to think back on certain occurences in your life you will see how the Law of Attraction worked for or against the situation.
1593979827|5.0|ZMM is probably my most favourite book, but it is far from being an easy read. The last time I read it was years ago, so when I saw the unabridged version available I jumped at it. Michael kramer's relaxed voice brings the text to life, and allows you to focus on the themes and deeper meaning of what Robert Pirsig has to say. The narrative weaves effortlessly between travelog, personal history and zen philosophy, providing insights and posing questions that challenge and stimulate. Everybody I have persuaded to read this book has been really glad they did, but this version takes much of the effort out of enjoying this important and reflective work.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I love it!! She is terrific as usual. I only wish she had more CD's. Every song is as good as the next. She has a unique sound.
B000MGUZM0|1.0|I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. This is the band that's supposed to be the hottest commodity within the indie community? I'm sorry, was that a joke? I must have missed the punchline.<br /><br />This is bar none, some of the most uninspired, boring, tedious, pretentious, and self-important drivel that I have been exposed to in quite some time (including Amy Winehouse' excrutiatingly painful debut).<br /><br />I am actually embarrased that they are Canadian considering the fact that we have bands like Metric, Stars, The Dears, Tokyo Police Club, Mobile, Pilot Speed, The Trews, The Deadly Snakes, etc. who each in their own respect, blow the hell out of Arcade Fire. There is no fire here, nor any soul to speak of, just a bunch of easily forgotten soundscapes that don't even scratch the surface of a band like The Flaming Lips. What I'd like to know about is the actual criteria from which these \\"Stellar Reviews\\" are extracted. Maybe I'm missing something, I'll admit that. But somehow, I don't think so. Judge for yourself I guess. Maybe if they spent more time working on \\"actual songs\\" instead of dressing like freaks from an Amish community, they'd have a little more to offer, but then again, probably not!
B000002KOO|5.0|My next door friend and Bassist in my High School Band and beyond, Mike, and I first enjoyed this when it came out in 1969-70....we had picked up on \\"English Rose\\" and really liked the Blues and Tunes, but \\"Then Play On\\" was something new to our ears.....at the time we knew little about the players except that the original 3 were from Mayall's Bluesbreakers...at the time of our discovery and enjoyment listening to the LP many hours and hours, we were unaware of the influence of the very young Danny Kirwan and the prescence of Christine Perfect on Keys...I recently purchased the CD, having given up the original LP back in the 70's and having listened to it on a cassette copy  over the years....The guitar interplay between Green and Kirwan is worth the purchase alone...nothing else quite sounds like this recording....the Plaintive, melancholy tunes that Kirwan and both Green wrote and the Rockin \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" as well as Green's \\" Oh Well\\"  are true classics for all time....the one thing that pervades through many of these tunes is a loose soulful Jamming that was created as they wrote and recorded....I only wish that I could have seen this Band play live...of course, Jeremy Spencer contributed almost nothing to this recording ,though his slide guitar and on stage persona were integral to the sound of Mac......I never tire of listening to this one of a kind recording...I recommend buying all of the early Mac recordings up through the Bob Welch era with Kirwan still playing and writing on \\"Bare Trees and \\"Future Games\\"....then you can get a sense of how unique these players are.....and let's not forget how great and innovative McVie and Fleetwood are as the bottom of this sound...they will always be one of the best anchor teams in Rock.
B000002UAU|5.0|Without this, there would be NOTHING!!! There is nothing else to say. Over, end of story, have a nice day.
B000E41MS6|5.0|This is DVD not only allows you to watch the whole first series of the New Doctor Who (and swoon who Christopher Eccleston) but also gives you the Doctor Who Confidentals that we in the US don't get after each episode. Plus some more good behind the scenes stuff...this is definitely, in the words of the 9th doctor, FANTASTIC!
0142437611|4.0|The book was pretty goo, never would have read it if i didn't need it for my English class
1932907009|5.0|This is the first book on screenwriting I've ever finished.  All the others -- and there have been many, by both big-name authors and small -- somehow quickly bore me, or wander off into areas that simply aren't very helpful to writing a script.  As someone who has completed a few scripts but has yet to sell one, Save the Cat serves as both a re-enforcer of what I have been doing, as well as a breath of fresh air for improving my writing.  Snyder obviously loves movies and writing, and his book overflows with information.  It's also to-the-point:  a quick read.  You can't help feeling you're getting a big load of inside, professional information, for a handful of dollars.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|This CD has all the greatest hits of Eurythmics. You will not be disappointed.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I am keeping this sealed as a collectors item. It arrived in perfect condition
B000FS9FCG|1.0|Ah yes, the classic story that Hollywood butchered for political gain.  Well I was just disappointed with what they did here.  Why they had to change so many things from the original story is beyond me.  I mean, was it going to hurt that many feelings to show the oppresive left wing government that the original story was about?  Of course, so lets make it PC, show anything not far left as fanatical with untrue labels, and make it right wing bad!  That way we please all the liberals who are running Hollywood!  And then they can have Brokeback Mountain AND V for Vendetta for under 30 dollars!  So sad that so many of the sheeple just wander around eating it up hook, line and sinker.   <br />Natalie Portman is great but I just felt so sorry for so many of them in this film because the story was bastardized for political purposes.

B00008NRL8|4.0|This is definitely worth the purchase.  A combination of Parisian electronica and Argentinian dance music.  Perfect blend of two styles.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|I enjoyed this film very much!  I think that it is a deep, moving story that takes it's time to set up but still kept me on my toes.  Great cast including Matt Damon and George Clooney.  Although fictional, it has some good points about it that carry through.  The scope here is much broader than just \\"big oil\\" and even though it is a film that obviously tries through and through to paint the United States as the big bad wolf, it was worth seeing George Clooney get blown to smithereens in the end.  It is okay though, because it is fictional.  If you don't believe me just look up the book it is based on, because that guy has been proven to be nothing more than a lying schmuck who made stuff up in order for his books to sell as \\"thrillers\\".  Hollywood ate it up though, and kept the lie machine rolling, question is, will you eat it also?
0937381888|5.0|I have been brewing for about a year now and although I had both \\"The Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\" and \\"Homebrewer's Companion\\", I still felt like I couldn't easily access relevant information.  I looked at John's book as published on the internet and decided to get the current edition.  I couldn't be happier.  He unfolds the brewing process from the simplest details to some very complex science.  I can delve just as deeply as I want and review just the details I need.  I have already refined my brewing process and look forward to the results.  I would consider this a core book for any brewing library.
B000BYA5G4|1.0|Hate to break it to you all, but the film is not even close to the true story.  The real man this film is based on was an ITALIAN from ITALY.  His story had absolutely nothing to do with the United States.  Oh, and our troops did not leave piles of working M-16 Rifles abandoned in Grenada or anywhere else for that matter.  Absolutely unreal how Hollywood will do anything to turn the facts into fiction in order to trance the masses.  Michael Moore would have been proud, but at least Moore does try to apply some balance and facts.  This thing was nothing more than a fictional story.  It also left out the fact that the three countries who are thick in arms deal ings seem to not have \\"USA\\" applied on them anywhere.  I could go on and on about it, but hey, at least now you know so you are not like so many who are saying \\"yeah, this is TRUTH!!\\"  So be sure to do your research, and don't believe everything you hear even though you really, really want to.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is a group of ladies that I wouldn't have normally seen.  I caught it on PBS in December, and I was entranced with the beautiful harmony all these young ladies were singing in.  It truly is a pleasure to see this performance.  We have tickets to see them perform live at the end of the month.  Definately worth the money spent on the CDs, DVDs, and tickets to the show.  They bring such energy to the stage.  Good luck, girls!
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This CD is another great preformance by Celtic Woman. This is a must if  <br />you are a fan of Celtic music. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AP04NI|5.0|Excellent quality.  Would work with Amazon again.  Fast service.  Very pleased.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I got what I EXPECTED. THE VIDEO DOES A VERY GOOD JOB OF PRESENTING  THE TRUTH. IT IS SCARY. I DON'T SEE HOW ANY ONE CAN SEE THIS AND NOT BE CONVINCED WE HAVE A SERIOUS SITUATION OR PROBLEM. I RECOMMEND ALL TO SEE IT IF THEY CAN. <br /> <br />THE SELLER DID VERY GOOD IN PROCESSING MY ORDER AND DELIVERY WAS GOOD.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I ordered this on pre-order and got it even before it was released in store.  The condition of the dvds are spectacular and as I just love this show, it is a case of complete customer satisfaction!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|OK, I admit it, I looked up this album because the poster was all over my neighborhood. Sounded good and ordered it. Pleasantly surprised, a very enjoyable CD that I liked even more on the 2nd and 3rd listen. At first it sounds very much like Alicia Keyes, but then CBR presents more of her own vibe. <br />Mellow R&B, good make out music!
B000069KGM|5.0|I bought this CD for my brother's birthday, upon his request.  He told me he absolutely loves it, and has listened to it non stop in his car to and from work. <br /> <br />Very satisfied customer in Ohio.

074356619X|5.0|I have the Secret Dvd and I had watched it a couple of times before I got the cd's.  The cd's seem to have more information than the dvd, and I think without the visual distractions the material seems more personal to the listener.  I am really glad I have both the cd's and the dvd. <br /> <br />florene darr
0312323867|5.0|I love the shopaholic series and this has the same feel. I can't wait to read baby proof too!
B000EULJLU|4.0|There are some truly amazing tracks on 10,000 Days.  That being said, there are just not enough of them.    The album opens extremely strong with Vicarious.  In the tradition of Sober, Stinkfist et al., Vicarious is what you would call a \\"catchy\\" Tool song.  You hear it once and it sticks to your brain like an old half-eaten Jolly Rancher.  An old Jolly Rancher with ants and some unappetizing brown stuff on it.  You get the point.  Like most catchy Tool songs, it's an instant classic and worthy of a lot of replay.  A truly stunning track.    Unfortunately, much of the rest of the album is not as strong as it could be.  The \\"ambient\\" tracks are too plentiful.  They take the chill-out mood to such an extent that I honestly found myself humming the tune to Vicarious during some of them.  There is a secret track if you digitally combine 3 of the other ambient tracks on your computer, but that doesn't exactly up the value of the CD any.  I would have prefered more hard tracks and fewer droning notes and sitars.    Don't get me wrong, I am a dyed in the wool Tool fan and this album does nothing to shake my love of such an awesome and unique band.  When the songs are strong, they are VERY strong and either hit like a hammer or soothe like an audio tranquilizer.  When they are weak and ambient, though, they are just sort of \\"there\\" without any real presence.  They leave you hungry for the crunchy guitar melodies that you know for a fact Tool is capable of producing.    Aside from Vicarious, my personal second favorite track has to be Rosetta Stoned (which is properly listened to along with its intro track, Lost Keys/Blame Hoffman).  The song is all over the place, at once disturbing and hilarious, rough as sandpaper and sweet as honey.  It's a new kind of song for Tool and stands out above the rest.  The lyrics are absolutely stupid, are intended to be that way, but are sung with an emotional intensity as if Maynard were channeling the Lord almighty himself.  Rosetta Stonedis a trip.  Literally.    After multiple journeys through the whole album, I have to give 10,000 Days a 4, where Undertow, Aenema, and Lateralis were all 5's.  It's almost like a divine meal at an exquisite restaurant, yet the portions are too small to fully satisfy.  And all the ambient tracks?  Pure parsley.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I was so surprised when at first I couldn't get it to work on my stereo system,  dah - never realized that I had purchased the DVD!  After several attempts at trying different machines I finally put it in my computer and wala up comes the whole program!  I was so thrilled to realize that I had purchased the DVD and not just a CD!!   <br /> <br />I am totally thrilled with it and the service I received from Amazon!!
B00005M91K|5.0|full of powerful images of the world we live in, and what a blessing it is. a good look at the world and the people who call it home. the best film of its kind by far
1591391105|5.0|This book offers excellent advise for someone moving into a leadership role.  It explains the importance of a strategy and plan in ensuring success as you transition from an individual contributor to a leader.  Some of the skills and traits that made us successful previously may not be beneficial in our new role.  We need to know what to keep and what to let go.  This book offers a practical plan on what to focus on during the \\"first 90 days\\" in your new job.  I recommend reading this book PRIOR to moving into a leadership position.
B00003CXBH|3.0|When you say the cinematography and music are the best things about a movie, that doesn't say much for the script.  I thought the acting was good, but that was eclipsed by the music and setting.  Worth renting and watching.  Probably not worth buying.
B000002MK8|5.0|Like the new Rod Stewart, but love the old Stewart.  The more I listen to Unplugged, the more I appreciate his talent and place in R&R pantheon.
B000002B2T|5.0|I had this in the early 90's, lost it, and was happy to find it again; it's every bit as good as I remembered it.  So, wake up young man . . .
B00005BL2A|4.0|A lot of DM fans seem not to like this album too much.  I have followed DM since their inception and to me, this album sounds like a return of sorts.  Clearly  they've matured at this point in their career and god forbid, sobered up a bit and it shows.   <br /> <br />DM lyrics will always have a thread of sadness but here on this album, one gets the sense that the boys needed to believe in hope.  If they didn't, they might as well quit as a band which thankfully they didn't. <br /> <br />Obviously much of the music here is about proverbial drugs and rock 'n roll however much of what Martin Gore has written can be applied to almost any facet of life. <br /> <br />I like this album quite a bit because it's mostly a low key affair.  Quite a departure for them.  Mindful grooves and sensous melodies permeate this album.  Of all the albums by DM, this is the one album that I put on and let play through.  I don't do that too much with DM or with any band for that matter.  This is the type of album that you listen through from beginning to end and sit back, look out at the twilight landscape and take it all in. <br /> <br />Highly underrated!
B00005JPKC|5.0|Letters from Iwo Jima is well scripted and acted. Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya were fantastic.<br /><br />While perhaps not popular with people of the WWII generation, the strength of thi film is that it shows the battle for the island from the Japanese point of view. The film humanizes the Japanese without engaging in revisionism or political correctness. In it we see the \\"enemy\\" as men with wives, children, many of whom would rather not be fighting, but who love their country and cherish their \\"honor.\\" Letters doesn't attempt to justify the Japanese position during the war.  Rather, it reminds us that, on an individual level, the Japanese were probably not much different than their American enemies (at least in terms of their hopes, dreams, aspirations, etc.)<br /><br />The cast seemed sparse, giving it something of a low budget feel.  It was filmed through very dark lenses, or so it would appear. It's a color film that has so little color that it looks as if it were shot in B&W. Contrast that with Flags of Our Fathers, which was very colorful and bright.<br /><br />There are several shots of American airplanes and what appears to be the entire Pacific fleet approaching the island. The panoramic shots of the approaching US fire power, is almost breathtaking, certainly awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Comparisons to its brother film, Flags of our Fathers, are unavoidable.  In virtually all categories or measures, Letters is the better of the two films.  If you liked Flags, you'll really like Letters.
B000MTOKZK|1.0|I decided it was time to replace both my original vinyl and 1990 editions, so I pre-ordered this March 6, 2007 release of the \\"Deluxe, Mini-LP\\" edition with the hope of improved audio and the assurance of the extra tracks included with the previous deluxe edition.  Much to my dismay, what I received is the original 7-track album, its only claim to uniqueness being that it's \\"the authentic original LP Packaging Lovingly Reproduced in a CD-Sized Jacket.\\"<br /><br />Nice sentiment, but not good enough for me.  Not only are the micro-sized liner notes illegible but the manufacturer has saved the expense of an enclosed booklet and jewel case in addition to shorting the consumer the five tracks on the deluxe edition.<br /><br />In defense of Amazon, I see that another site is also advertising this 3/6/07 release as \\"deluxe\\" and comprising \\"12 tracks.\\"  Atlantic/Rhino apparently misinformed their marketers.  The next test: I've never returned an opened CD to Amazon, though if any site is good for a refund, it's likely to be this one.<br /><br />[Since writing this I see that Amazon has made available as downloads alternative takes of not merely 5 but 8 alternative takes.  Consequently, purchasers of this release may perhaps be less wary of receiving an edition with the original 7 tracks.  On the other hand, collectors who already have the original vinyl release and (in my case) the 1990 CD version as well, may wish to pass this one up in favor of \\"Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane, Carnegie Hall, 1957\\" (the most thrilling and, imo, important new release of the present millennium).  Or, another essential session, \\"John Coltrane Live at Birdland\\" (primarily because of John's jaw-dropping cadenza on \\"I Want to Talk about You\\" (a tune he had recorded with Red Garland in the '50s, but not like this version with McCoy, Elvin and Jimmy).]
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I bought my GF all seasons of the Gilmore Girls and it keeps her quite happy.  Very addicting series and a fair price from Amazon.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I love movies and normally every film will have some redeeming quality, so I always try to be positive and never critical. For example, Hostel was awfully, gratuitously, leave-the-theater gory, but it was also a great suspense story. <br /> <br />But then there are dogs like Love Actually. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. More than that: this film is embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br />There are parts that I truly could not believe I was seeing. Makes you wonder about the moviemaking process, how a clunker like this makes it through the pipeline, but then again if people actually like it maybe the joke's on us... must be those consumers from Mars that Dave Barry talks about... <br /> <br />I am not the genre's biggest fan but there are many fine romantic comedies. Four Weddings. High Fidelity.  <br /> <br />And this movie has many fine actors which to me makes the whole deal worse. It's just seriously unfunny, the situations are maudlin, repetitive, unoriginal, contrived and totally implausible, plus it tries to preach, sorry \\"teach\\" us something, and to top it off it has gratuitous \\"grown-up\\" scenes that add nothing at all (makes you think of a little kid when he learns his first swear words, look what I said!). <br /> <br />Talking about little kids, to give you an idea of how silly this movie is, one running plot line has a 9 year old talking seriously (and continuously) about love with his father. This is so forced, silly and transparently viewer-manipulative as to be despicable.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it has to be seen to be believed. In my defense, my wife rented this and after a few minutes of jaw-dropping I was able to turn to a good book and watch this worthless waste of time unfold out of the corner of eye and ear. <br /> <br />I am saddened by the positive reviews this movie has received on this site. I can't believe anyone wouldn't see right through this clunker.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I bought my GF all seasons of the Gilmore Girls and it keeps her quite happy.  Very addicting series and a fair price from Amazon.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This is a great performance with tremendous storyline. Nicole Kidman is at her best. Rene Zelweger is every bit a good if not even better. This movie is a must for your collection. I have seen it 3 times and look forward to watching it again.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I bought my GF all seasons of the Gilmore Girls and it keeps her quite happy.  Very addicting series and a fair price from Amazon.
B0000DBJ2B|5.0|This movie is a wonderful blend of a good hopeful story with humor and understated special effects.  The animation does not overwhelm the story as in many new movies.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I bought my GF all seasons of the Gilmore Girls and it keeps her quite happy.  Very addicting series and a fair price from Amazon.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Great to hear this Scot sing such fun songs as, New Shoes.  Paolo hits a very common feeling for many people.
B000669GAI|4.0|My review is short and simple. This CD is worth the money. So pay up and enjoy.
0887307280|5.0|This book is a \\"must read\\" for all small business owners.  I wish I had known about it 10 years ago when I first started my business.  It's not a \\"step by step\\" guide, but it helps you to identify where you should focus on your business.  Their website provides excellent tools to do the \\"step by step\\" process.
B00080EU58|4.0|I liked it and you probably will too if you are a Slipknot fan. My only advice is wait till the price drops to about 18 dollars. I paid roughly 22 bucks which is 4 dollars too much in my opinion. My logic for this? Lets just say there are only about 18 good tracks and at a dollar a track...well you do the math.
0446615625|4.0|I ordered these titles for my wife. She absolutely thinks David Baldacci is the best author going.She's read several of his books and has never been disappointed.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|I love Iron Man and have been an avid comic buyer since the mid 80's and Marval has put out some good stuff; however, who ever is writing for there movie/animation dept should be fired....  The orignal story line is butchered, almost as bad as my spelling, and the new story is wipafied....  The Animation is very good and sharp.. Don't get me wrong it was ok and I did not pay too much for it, but if you are a purist you will not enjoy it as much as you could.  Please try again and get it done RIGHT...
B000GBEWHA|3.0|Same problem as a previous customer. The DVD came without any \\"T-Birds\\" leather jacket sleeve the 1st time... and the 2nd time. I and the customer service I talked to assumed that the whole batch was without these cool jackets. I wish there would be a way to check the DVD in the warehouse, and then correct the problem with the initial supplier. <br />Besides this problem, the DVD itself was awesome!
0920668364|5.0|I think every mother should read this to their child or children.  Excellent
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This DVD is great and the concert was even better on DVD than on TV.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|The Arcade Fire are the most exciting band out there, bar none (sorry Cheetah Girls)!  They have the energy, emotion, joy, and HOOKS you can only find in the indie/alternative music scene.  Funeral stands as one of the best CDs of this decade.  By comparison, Neon Bible might only be the best CD this year.  And they even break into French occasionally  - but that's okay!  If Talking Heads were born two decades later, they'd be making Neon Bible (or at least really digging it) <br /> <br />Must listens  -  Intervention, No Cars Go, Black Mirror, Keep the Car Running, Antichrist Television Blues
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This CD was a great followup to their first CD.  I can't wait for another one.
B0007PAMEM|5.0|This by far is the best collection of Tina's work.  If your a Tina Turner fan this DVD is a must..It's simply the best.  If you have a home theater sound system, crank it up, sit back and enjoy.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Its small and works well, slightly better than the built in. Nothing amazing but seems to integrate nicely with the exposure/flash function
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Babel is a film that asks us to rise above our cultural preconceptions because the director is not an American. He has not created a movie on the customary template of an action film (like Crash) that has a generous measure of high-five humor to deflect the tension. Many reviewers were absolutely scandalized by a couple of brief scenes involving teenage sexuality. They couldn't go beyond this, even though the rating of the film should have warned them. I find that more a reflection of the reviewers' own emotional landscapes than a flaw in the film. If we are going to wave around the word \\"gratuitous,\\" there are 1,000 films that come to mind well before Babel in terms of gratuitous sex, violence, or \\"inappropriate\\" content. Welcome to the world of foreign film, folks! American films are sanitized in some areas while going overboard in others (notably horror, and blood 'n gore). There may be a blue state/red state schism reflected in these reviews, as there were some not-so-subtle slams against American foreign policy and the American (and wealthy White) temperament and sense of entitlement. Once again, this film was not made from a strictly American-centered viewpoint, but given that we are not the center of the universe, I personally found that refreshing and challenging in a healthy way. <br /> <br />I think what we are seeing in some responses to this film is the supercedence of the bloated, overweight, diabetic McMovie mentality of an increasing number of Americans. They have no knowledge of or interest in the great literature or cinema (or music or art) of the past that is outside their narrow (and at times intolerant) sensibilities. They're fine with movies which have oceans of blood flowing from a universe of severed body parts, but throw in a little psychological twist, or a scene propelled by supressed lust/existential loneliness, or \\"stupid\\" desperation (like Garcia's charcter driving off and leaving the nanny/kids) and they completely implode. If they everfind themselves at King Lear, The Seventh Seal, The 400 Blows, The Mahabarata or Einstein on the Beach they might develop a greater tolerance for ambiguity, emotional texture, and the co-existence of meaningfulness/meaninglessness as reflected in the great (albeit often demanding) art that keeps human intelligence moving in a forward and cumulative direction. <br /> <br />I am not going to repeat previous eloquent reviewers, but will just say that this film is wide-reaching, compelling, brilliantly conceived and masterfully portrayed. All the main actors were fantastic (and minor roles as well); the casting was superb. In defense of Brad Pitt, I thought he was solid, very moving and emotionally authentic in this dramatic role, if not the most sympathetic character. The cinematography was stunning. The scenes in Mexico were so remarkably true to life that I assume the sections shot in Toyko and Morocco were equally realistic. <br /> <br />The events that are broadcast over the radio or seen on CNN every day are infinitely more brutal, gruesome, unseemly and perverse (Abu Ghraib?) than anything portrayed in this film. It is art reflecting life, but choreographed and illuminated in such a way that we can bear the pain and see the beauty. I really find it difficult to see why many people are so offended and morally affronted by this film; does it cut too close to the bone in some way for them? What were they expecting? This review has already been censored once (I originally included ordinary words descriptive of the aforementioned scenes of sexuality that had also been used by reviewers complaining about them) and then completely deleted from the website twice. No one at amazon.com can tell me why. Someone is so threatened by my opinions that they are compelled to keep you from reading this.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|Turn down your intelligence and enjoy the slapstick sophmoric humor. Hot babes and suggestive jokes. Mini-me makes it. Great deal.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Finally, a presentation about Global Warming that is both accurate  <br />technically and such that laypeople can understand the problems  <br />and see some solutions of which they can be a part. Should be shown  <br />to all High School students. After renting the CD, I bought 3 copies, <br />one for each of our children with families, and one for us to show  <br />all our friends.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|I've seen KISS live a dozen times. This is as good as it gets without being there. It's great to see them as I rememeber from my youth. The extras are good. The video and sound quality are excellent. This is meant for a big screen and home theater turned up as loud as it goes. If it's too loud you're to old.
B000J103YI|4.0|When I recieved the CD I couldn't wait to give it a play. Soon my baissed ears told me that I liked the old soundtrack much better. Eventually I give it a few more spins and then went to see the film.  <br />How glad am I, I did that, it made me enjoy the film much more and now I love the soundtrack. A good addition to my collection of sountracks and musicals. I'm sure it will also appeal to a younger audience.  <br />Give it a listen.
B000LC3ICY|3.0|not suitable for under age pleople... <br />eighteen years and a bove...
B000J103YI|1.0|I was really very disappointed in this CD it wasn't what I though it was. I would not reccommend this CD to anyone.
B000IU3XTW|4.0|Foo Fighters is definetly one of my favorite bands. Nothing Left To Lose is in my TOP 5 favorite albums of all time. SO, when I heard that they were putting out a LIVE Acoustic album, I was stoked!  <br /> <br />I like this album alot. I listen to it all the time.
B000I5X81K|4.0|This CD is great!  Normal Josh Groban of course, he's awesome!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|So, I've been a fan of Incubus since Fungus Amongus, and I was so thrilled when the new album came out. It's been awhile since my ears have enjoyed the presence of Brandon Boyd's vocals. This is one of the few albums that I can put on and listen from beginning to end. My favorite track is Dig. I liked it from the very first time I heard it. The lyrics are awesome. <br /> <br />However, the best part of this album, is the artwork on the cover.
B000002V07|4.0|CD is in horrible condition adn not advertised that way.  Otherwise delivery was just fine.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I put this album on my iPod, and I can listen to it all day long at work. I zone out and get my work done.  <br /> <br />From the first time I heard it, I was hooked. However, I'm kinda tired of Dani California, but that's only because they play it on the radio ALL the time. My favorite tracks include: Slow Cheetah, She's only 18, and Desecration Smile.  <br /> <br />I'm glad that they won a grammy for it, because they absolutely deserved it.
B000M341QE|5.0|wasnt a huge fan of aviator, but this is on par with goodfellas.......great movie!
B00005JPLU|5.0|Just watched the movie today, I loved it. Although some people will not be able to get past the \\"fantasy\\" portions... I looked at it as a mixture of history with Greek mythology. Great story line, good special effects. I HIGHLY suggest you watch this movie if given the chance.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|I received this product on time, and was very pleased with my purchase. This is a very good concert for those that really enjoy Coldplay and have not been fortunate enough to go to a real concert.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|The latitude used for ample CGI and special effects in this movie makes it more fantasy that historical, but it is a fun ride. The love story is naive and touching.  A bit of a fairy tale with wicked princes' and damsels in distress. Though the accents were a bit forced the performances in this movie were strong.  I loved Edward Norton's intensity; Jessica Biels' tantalizing beauty; and Paul Giamatti's candor while mimicking James Mason.  One sex scene  - implied nudity -  no kids under 14.
B00004T9VY|4.0|If you're rebuilding your Album collection, don't leave Tea for the Tillerman out just because you have Cat Steven's greatest hits.   Here are some gems that don't get bundled with anything else.   <br /> <br />Tea for the Tillerman was Cat Stevens at a point where he was most creative. <br /> <br />
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is an intense and graphic mini-series. It is brilliantly made and the stories are engaging and challenging.  The truth and historical accuracy is apparent in the detail locations, dialogue to dress. The best parts, to me, were the comments by the real participants in this saga that saved our world as we know it.  I know we can never truly understand the sacrifices made by these men with their courage, their lives and their psyches but watching this will keep the history alive for generations to come. No kids under 16 without interpretation and discussion with adults.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Its merely a travelogue of two people in Japan for different reasons. The dialogue is sparse. Scarlett is a bit on the simple side. Bill is supremely dead-pan. The music choice is superb. If Sofia has inherited something from her father, Frances, then she's scaled it down a million times like a homeopathic tincture that can cure an evening's boredom instantly. It can also be taken regularly. I watch this like I watch a home movie I am fond of, delighting in the far-gone experience. Except they aren't my memories?
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this movie several times.  It is a bit off-beat but hilarious.  Ben Stiller & Owen Wilson are 2 of my favorite actors. The humor is \\"ridiculously\\" funny. It does have about 2 scenes that are a bit \\"risque\\" so you might want to be aware of that with kids but overall a comedy worth seeing.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|After listening to the record three times, I found it quite glamourous and chic. The voice of Debbie Harry is quite unique, symbol of an era.
B00001QEE5|5.0|I grew up...well okay...some folks say I never will...watching this movie.  It is a fun treatment and done back when animation was hand drawn.  Classic story and still entertaining all these years later.
B000066C1N|5.0|My kids (4) have loved this CD for years. We are now having to buy a new one. They know every note to every song.  They adore this CD! As for the movie, we have bought several because they have loved it so much (they played it so much & have scratched it).  Enjoy as a Family!
B000K7UBTI|5.0|I loved this selection.  I was looking all over for it and I could not locate because it was all sold out.  I got it from Amazon at such a great price and it was delivered fast.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes any comic book heros. <br />
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Got this cd for my wife for her birthday. She played this cd for the whole night and can't wait for their next one. These men are the best tenors next to the Irish Tenors or the Three Tenors. If you get one cd for these men, this would be the Best Selection.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Christina's light comes shining through right from the first few bars. If you're thinking about getting this, you KNOW you LOVE her and you know she LOVES you and you also know she's an angel from heaven in a little human body so who better to liven up your Christmastime? She's not gonna bore you with flat old arrangements off the shelf. No! The songs and charts are well-chosen and, as always, the ultimate style-perfectionist with the dynamic pipes that is Christina hits the center of the target on every cut. What else would you expect from our girl? It will last you a lifetime of very cool Decembers! Get it.
0312995423|2.0|I guess I do things backwards.  I've read the other Dan Brown books and loved them.  I'm glad I didn't read this one first.  I thought it was too technical for the average person.  I deal with computers on a daily basis but some of this stuff was way over my head.  The characters were not as exciting as in his later books.  It's a good read if there's nothing else available.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This DVD and CD is extremely 5 stars product. Madonna is still the best
0586091718|4.0|My motivation of reading this book arose only recently after reading the author's back cover praise for Jane Roberts' book \\"Dream, \\"Evolution,\\" and Value Fulfillment, Vol.2.\\" There is \\"one obvious effect\\" if any person of intelligent knowledge approves what Seth, an energy personality essence (i.e., non-physical consciousness, many times lived on our earth), is telling us through the late Jane Roberts and her husband Robert F. Butts. And the obvious is (a) the person will be very much satisfied to recognize what he/she really is, or (b) the person will panic and get lost what to do next in his/her intelligent activity; in this author's case what to do to make his \\"Holographic Universe\\" idea realistic to appeal to the scientific world. This is because, from my point of view, all basic questions have been given answers already at sethcenter.com. <br />Now, let me make some comments on the conclusions of the author in this book: <br />(1) The author's first concluding remark is to the effect that our science based on the idea of \\"Objective\\" universe should be restructured based on the idea of \\"observer-participatory\\" universe, which was also suggested by physicist John Wheeler in his one of the four questions: \\"How come the `one world' out of many observer-participants?\\" This Wheeler's question naturally comes from the measurement theory in quantum mechanics. <br />Now, my comment is that our scientists have been already in the position of \\"observer-participatory\\" universe, and our current science is the natural outcome of the position. That is, as the author seeming to take the Seth's statement, Scientists are creating their reality based on their beliefs/thoughts/expectations/emotions, with most of us supporting the scientists' idea. Maybe this is expressed in the following Seth quotation: \\"He (meaning human) is indeed as blessed as the animals, however, and his failures are the results of his lack of understanding. He is directly faced with a far more complex conscious world than the other animals are, dealing particularly with symbols and ideas that are then projected outward into reality, where they are to be tested. If they could be tested mentally in your context, there would be no need for physical human existence.\\" (From Roberts' \\"The Nature of the Psyche,\\" p.210). <br />From my point of view, what scientists should not do is \\"making a scientific theory excluding facts which cannot fit in their theory.\\" Otherwise, they are creating their own truth, not seeking for the truth. <br />(2) The author's second remark is \\"we are in the process of evolution to higher consciousness.\\" Yes, Seth is telling us so. To accelerate the process, we all have to open our \\"conscious ego mind (which belongs to physical dimension during our physical life)\\" to the non-physical dimensions. Seth modestly implied that we, the consciousness manifested as human beings, are at one of the lowest stages of its development. <br />(3) The author takes seriously the idea of \\"Reincarnation.\\" But he did not explicitly mention the scientific idea of Darwin's theory of evolution. If we take the idea of reincarnation, then all the scientific theories for the origin of life, evolution to human beings as well as the materialistic theory of \\"Consciousness,\\" will collapse to ashes. <br /> <br />Sir Oliver Lodge suggested about 100 years ago (in 1909) that for us to get wiser we could cooperate with intelligent minds on the other side, and I believe that we already had such cooperation in the case of Jane Roberts with Seth & Seth's big brother. What they are telling us is too intelligent to simply dismiss. Even Carl Jung could not understand \\"the enigmatic self\\" in his whole life, but Seth is telling what it is, also the meaning of \\"the Collective Unconscious.\\" Scientists as well as philosophers are now seeking for the origin of our \\"Consciousness,\\" but if the \\"Consciousness\\" per se is the origin as Seth is telling us, they will never reach the answer.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Madonna has taken many of her classics and reinvented them for the super high energy concert along with her latest hits.  The DVD is amazing.
0440539811|4.0|<br />This book has it all... intrigue, humor, sex, drugs, dolphins, age old plots of world domination! Although the narrative is presented with total disregard for plot continuity and without any discernable timeframe the reader is nontheless drawn into the outrageous sprawling story. Some parts of the book are confusing and somewhat dull but there are more than enough good bits to keep one turning the pages into the night.  <br /> <br />If one has a penchant for a good conspiracy story he or she will definately get a kick out of The Illuminatus!
055358202X|1.0|This book was like slow death.  Piles of names, very little plot and character development, 1000 pages.  I took it on a 2-week trip to Europe and realized that well-written history, which is what Martin is attempting to imitate, is far more entertaining.  After all, Martin is just stealing plots from actual events (with the normal human elements), so why bother to read it.  I've switched my reading back to the great new book on Agincourt (writing is ten times better and the people are REAL!!!) and the original dark ages viking literature that inspires a lot of this junk. <br /> <br />To summarize, I left the book, purposely, in my hotel room.  I'm not going to bother to find out how things end up for Jon Stark and the Others, or any of the other characters b/c it just isn't worth it.  This is more like a writing exercise by someone who gets paid by the word. <br /> <br />To summarize, hopelessly unengaging.  Go read a Harry Potter or Fowler book instead, you'll have fun and see the end in a few days.  Better yet, read Tokein...again. <br />:)
B000KQGX1Y|4.0|This CD has some beautiful songs on it.  I especially love the songs that the violinist is featured in.  My kids love it just as much as I do.  Such a variety of songs, but the traditional Celtic songs are my favorites.  I never get tired of listening to them.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have viewed this series three times over the years, and will certainly watch it again.  It is simply the best of the WW II documentaries.  I purchased the DVD 30th Anniversary Edition even though I have the VHS series, as I wanted this treasure on DVD.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina Aquilera. Two words: the voice. This c.d. is amazing. Christina has totally re-invented herself, and in the process taken us on a crazed trip into the past with all the glitz and that Hollywood vibe. If you are thinking about buying this c.d.-DO! It is Christina Aquilera. You know that you are getting something that everyone wants to get. Christina Aquilera took her time with making this c.d., so of course it sounds extremely good and well done. So I say purchase it. See Christina Aquilera live in her Back To Basics Tour 2007...it is nothing but pure awesomeness!
1400064287|4.0|A surprisingly edible little book.  It pretty much lives out its own meaning. It's stickyish. You do remember more of its nostrums than other books of this type. And you do sometimes find yourself pursuading others in new ways that could have been shaped by some of its exhortations. It is a good gloss on one of the more delicious aspects of the full confection: The Tipping Point. It's worth 4 jelly stars.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aquilera has gone from being a genie in a bottle telling us what a girl wants to being a sexed-up dirrty vixen in this c.d. Christina is amazing. Stripped has heart, and is very powerful. Stripped has to be my favorite c.d. that Christina Aquilera has ever done, and I think that it is because everything that someone could possibly go though is on this one c.d. If you are thinking about purchasing this c.d.-DO! See Christina Aquilera live in her Back To Basics Tour 2007...amazing live show! SHE IS THE BEST!

0060531053|5.0|As a new brewer, I found Charles Papazian's attitude concerning the entire process to be extremely helpful.  His step by step lead through the process is general enough to apply to all types of brewing. Each chapter stands alone, if need be, and can be re-read as one would a reference book. I have found myself going back to certain parts concerning formulas and what things mean.  There are a great many tables in the book that I know that I will be refering to once I gain more experience with hydrometers, gravity, bitterness, etc. <br /> <br />An excellent first book!!
068485743X|4.0|I found this book extremely easy to read and to learn from.  The book also covers points that you may not think are important, but when these are explained it provides you with an enlightened viewpoint and you will take care not to fall into the trap(s) many new writer's are prone to do. <br />The exercises at the end of each chapter help to reinforce the message and ensure that you have grasped the concepts described.   <br />It's best to do the exercises before moving on to the following chapter and not to do as I did, just complete those that seemed easy.  I will go back and finish the exercises even if it means reading that chapter again (promise!).
B000A6T262|5.0|A must have for anyone who even slightly appreciates Science Fiction or Star Trek! Of the original films, II - IV are definitely the strongest, while \\"Generations\\" and \\"First Contact\\" deserve multiple viewings. When I sat down to watch \\"Insurrection\\" this was the first time I had done so since it hit theatres in Fall of 1998 (pre-Episode I). This one, in particular, works better in the comfort of your own home like a TV movie special as opposed to a big screen extraveganza. Apart from the cool special effects and space battles, Star Trek is watchable because of its compelling stories of morality and humanity -- each of these films explores a different human issue such as life and death, the devastation of relocation in the name of progress, humanity's need to respect the natural world, the lengths at which one will go to serve revenge, and individuality. My only wish is that they would continue on with \\"DS9\\" and make at least two films off of that franchise!

After about 4 months of trying to run even 2 miles without flaring up my original pulled muscle, I began practicing chi running after someone told me about it.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore does a masterful, objective job of explaining global warming.  Now is the time for the U.S. to wake up and join the Kyoto Protocol before it's too late.  All of us consumers need to make the effort if we are going to win the war on global warming.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Been waiting for another CD by Norah Jones - this one is great - very mellow an relaxing - makes you want to sit back with a margarita, put your feet up and enjoy the summer breeze. <br />Didn't like the case - mine sort of fell apart.
0684865130|5.0|When a piece of literature gets stuck into a culture, you know there's really something to it. Having read CATCH-22 when in high school, I decided to revisit it in this crazy George Bush-world we now live in. The parallels are frighteningly surreal. But let's not get political.<br /><br />This is the story of one man's fight to exit WW II in one piece. His name is Captain Yossarian and he finds the war-torn world to be a place of contradictions and ignorant men of power. Flying missions over Europe, Yossarian's commanders continually up the number of missions that must be flown before the men can be circulated back to the States. Yossarian realizes he'll never stop flying these terribly dangerous missions because whenever he gets close to his final one, his CO's up them (a Catch-22 in itself). The ridiculous qualities of war are thrown at Yossarian as we witness his conflicting tragedies through comedic/ironic eyes.<br /><br />In his do-anything-to-stay-alive fashion, Yossarian enters the hospital as often as possible with stomach ailments, or by trying to be deemed mentally unstable. Neither works, of course.<br /><br />Pinning medals on naked men, rowing to Sweden with a tiny spoon, and living with a dead guy who never made it past his first mission, Yossarian's gambits know no bounds.<br /><br />Heller's writing style is something of a marvel, too. His own prose is done in Catch-22 fashion, making the reader laugh and cringe (Example: \\"Don't interrupt.\\" \\"Yes, sir.\\" \\"And say `sir' when you do.\\" \\"Yes, sir.\\" \\"Weren't you just ordered not to interrupt?\\")<br /><br />It's amazing that even today the term Catch-22 can be heard muttered by people who don't know the reference from which it originated. Try asking someone what a Catch-22 is and they'll likely be able to tell you, but many probably won't know where the term came from. I think we owe it to Joseph Heller to keep this pun alive, especially with what's going on in the Whitehouse right now.<br /><br />Oh, darn! There I go again. Sorry.../>Oh, darn! There I go again. Sorry...
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The World at War series captures the true essence of World War II from Hitler's rise to power to the aftermath of the war. An amazing wealth of video footage, some in colour. Narrated clearly and succinctly by Laurence Olivier. Without a doubt the finest documentary series on the Second World War.
B00003A9QI|5.0|When I viewed this movie, I remember liking the soundtrack a lot, but didn't really listen that closely.  I then heard an interview with Rachel Portman, the composer,  on NPR, and I remembered the music and was so enthralled by how beautifu it is.  I then purchased the soundtrack from Amazon.  If you just like beautiful, orchestral music that has some melancholy themes (but not really classical,) you will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this soundtrack.  It tugs and your heart.

B00005JPGO|5.0|What a rebirth indeed. Di Caprio is finally finding his way to some adult roles. He learned the trade from Scorsese and The Departed. Now he pushes it into some thickening and intensity in this film. He knows how to use his facial expressivity to mean cynicism, hatred, violence, meanness, viciousness, cruelty, etc... though not yet the rising physical desire that may accept to condescend to turn into something more intense, even passionate. That's his face, and close-ups are numerous. Yet his body language does not remain that coherent and he still keeps some of his adolescent even pubescent lascivity in some attitudes and movements. He will learn, they say, provided they do not lock him up in roles of villains just the way they had locked him up in roles of smooth-skinned and practically hairless desirable adolescents, in spite of Basketball Diaries where he had quite another potential. So Leonardo Di Caprio is coming of age and may have found a completely new field of artistic expression. Yet the film was expected for a completely different reason. The mythic scandal of our modern world: the wars both for and fed by diamonds in Africa but waged by children soldiers who enrich some weapon dealers and diamond speculators with not only their blood, but also the blood of their parents shed by and with their own hands. The film is poignant because of the presence of several artists, the main black actor of course but also Emmanuel Jal and his music, who were children soldiers themselves. This film is ruthless, systematic, unavoidable in the obvious conclusion that the rich of this world need these wars to become richer. This commitment of an actor like Leonardo Di Caprio to this necessary struggle to make our world more humane, can only help millions of people to understand those wars have to stop, not be stopped by tyrannical foreign military interventions, but by negotiations, economic sanctions and sentences against those who are responsible for these unacceptable feudal if not even more primitive ambitions that can only be fulfilled by the enslavement of millions and the victimization of all those who are not members of the closed clan of power they are part of. It is good Hollywood gets aboard the train to humanistic globalization.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonneeudal if not even more primitive ambitions that can only be fulfilled by the enslavement of millions and the victimization of all those who are not members of the closed clan of power they are part of.

0307237699|5.0|If half of what Barack says in this book is how he feels then he should be president of the US!  This is a great eye opening book...a bit idealistic but full of enthusiasm, amazing compassion for fellow man, and an amazing understanding of the constitution and the law.  Very smart man!  Must read!

B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Fans of Star Wars (and I include myself here-in the fanATICAL category), there's a new kid in town. <br /> <br />Yes, Battlestar Galactica (or BSG as we \\"in the know\\" call it) is HOT. This is not the Battlestar we grew up on in the early eighties...this show takes it to a whole new level that leaves its predecessor (and inspiration) in the cosmic dust. <br /> <br />The score is quite different from the traditional sweeping orchestral themes and bombastic marches that we're all used to (and love dearly). Opting instead for a soundscape more akin to tribal/eastern-styled earthy music, Bear McCreary and Richard Gibbs composed a score chock-full of dramatic tones and gentle strains that draw out the emotions of the listener. Listening to this soundtrack, one can imagine total war, and romantic ecstasy...sometimes on the same track. <br /> <br />I found the score (as well as the show) as creative as anything out there and much more so than most of the hailed and praised fare that the networks push on the TV audience. BSG deserves the accolades and awards that too many unworthy shows receive every year. <br /> <br />Drama, Action, Love, Death, Social Challenges, Politics and Religion. Art does imitate life, and the score to the greatest TV show to come around in a long time delivers the soundtrack to accompany it all.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|The interviews and extra stuff is worth it alone. Great stuff. Just get it!
B000002G8J|4.0|I think this is one of his better earlier CDs.  Although there are no rock 'em sock 'em tunes, songs such as \\"Roll It\\", If I Don't Be There By Morning\\", \\"I'll Make Love To You Anytime\\" and others still allow you to have a rockin' good time.  It's an excellent CD to listen to when exercising or working outside.  The only problem is you like it so much it makes you stop to listen.  To me, that's the quality every good music CD has.  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|When I saw Shortbus I laughed, I cried, and I left the theater feeling profoundly grateful to John Cameron Mitchell and everyone who worked on this film. <br /> <br />There are many ways in which our freedom and dignity are taken away from us, every day.  JCM and company are trying to restore some of that.  Feel like something's missing?  Maybe you should get on the bus.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Planning to see the stage performance of \\"Wicked\\" on stage in a few months, I always like to get the cd ahead of time so I am familiar with the words and music.  The lyrics are easy to hear and understand (plus the booklet has the words written out) and they really capture the feeling of each scene of the play.  The music is fantastic.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|One of the BEST shows on TV!  I will be sad to see it go when they cancel it!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my father, who considers The West Wing to be the best tv series ever made, couldn't always catch it when it was on the air, and gets frustrated with all the commercials during the reruns. He LOVES these dvd's. He started at the very beginning and every couple of nights looks forward to sitting down and soaking in the next episode. Many hours of enjoyment, no commericals, no interruptions! He says it is the most thoughtful gift he has ever received.  It's an especially great gift for someone who liked the series but who already has \\"everything.\\"
1400064287|5.0|I read this book three times in the first week I had it.  It is an amazingly comprehensive and practical look at the power of persuasion.  This is not just theory - it's about practical application that can be used by a company, a salesperson, or anyone who needs a competitive edge via persuasion.  I will refer to this book again and again.
B00005LC1H|5.0|John Cleese as the lovably rude and intolerant Basil Fawlty is at the top of his craft. He excels beyond even his best sketches of Monty Python fame.  I have seen every Fawlty Towers episode at least 10 times and each time I find myself laughing until I can't see through the tears.  And I continue to go back to them time and time again.  Check out the episodes \\"Communications Problems\\" and \\"The Corpse and the Kippers\\" for some of the most brilliant comedic acting and writing that you are likely to ever come across.   <br /> <br />John Cleese portrays the cheap and incompetent hotel owner Basil Fawlty, Andrew Sachs is the perpetually hounded and bumbling waiter Manuel (\\"He's from Barcelona\\"), Prunella Scales plays Basil's bossy wife Sybil (Basil's  \\"little nest of vipers\\") , and Connie Booth plays the most competent character of the bunch but who is forever getting swept up into Basil's tangled schemes. The cast is outstanding and the writing is pure genius.  <br /> <br />It is said that laughter is the best medicine, and a dose of Fawlty Towers will have you feeling better faster than you can say, \\"It would be easier to train a monkey.\\"

0743496728|1.0|How can the judge also be the Mother of one of the victims/star witnesses of the trial.  Wouldn't this be a major conflict of interest?  Can someone please explain this to me?<br /><br />I understand that many of you feel that I should read the book first before posting this comment, but my point (to the publisher and author) is that I personally would not purchase this book because of the book jacket blurb which brought up my point above.  I can't suspend my disbelief when something fictionally portraying reality as this book is trying to do brings up such a basic question.  Sorry to all of you who disagree with me, but this is MY OPINION and only mine.
B00000I14Z|5.0|you get a breath of fresh air. its like opening the windows for the first time after a long winter. you've experienced the same thing maybe before but it just feels new. <br />thats what this disc is to me. i'm not gonna get into technical stuff because i cant. i'll say this tho. in my long ago past i was a horn player. this disc makes me remember exactly what that means. i hear things in here i long ago had forgotten existed in music theory. listening to this after thinking of modern day pop is like comparing picasso to a childs chalk drawing on the sidewalk. <br />
074356619X|5.0|Initially I watched the DVD and was hooked, but wanted something that I could listen to in the car and this was perfect. I now have it in the car, and really recommend it to anyone, as it allows for the messages from the movie to be repeated to your unconscious. It has been put together really well as well. <br />The best thing is that I put it on when the kids are in the car, and they have picked up on things too, which is fantastic.  <br />I love the DVD and am so glad that I have these CD's now! Honestly, good! <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I loved this recording of \\"Wicked\\".  I bought it just before I was able to see the play.  It really helped to understand the story when I saw it performed on stage.  Now I've played it so often, I have the words memorized.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|An incredible concert, a wonderful gift for friends with a love for Celtic music or anyone who appreciates great music. Not one bad note from any of the numerous performers...they sound like Heavenly voices to me. Fun, moving, colorful. 5+ stars, actually.

B000MGUZM0|1.0|man, i can NOT believe people are slobbering all over themselves for this ratty, third-rate Echo and the Bunnymen RIPOFF.  i would rather listen to ian mc cullogh pass gas than listen to these clowns \\"sing.\\"  i accidentally saw them live a few years ago, sadly touring with the once-fantastic David Byrne, and they were even worse live.  totally lacking in originality.  bunch of theater geeks doing \\"Bunnymen:  The Lousy Outtakes Musical!\\"  ugh.  they are probably all very nice kids, but no, not even occasional geniuses bono, bowie, and byrne can trick people who actually know about music into buying this sad, boring nothing.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|I was actually hesitant to listen to Neon Bible because I was scared it wouldn't live up to expectations. It's hard to follow such an awesome album like Funeral. I mean you can only go down from starting so high.  <br /> <br />But I was so wrong. Neon Bible is amazing! It just really touches you. It is so bold and so powerful. Lines like \\"I don't want to be an American anymore\\" really give you a taste of just how meaningful this entire album is.  <br /> <br />The sound is dark and intense and it never gets boring. From Black Mirror to My Body is Cage, you want to hear more. My personal favorites are Keep the Car Running, Intervention, Black Wave/Bad Vibration, Ocean of Noise, and My Body is a Cage.  <br /> <br />I really can't say enough about how great this album is!

B000IB0E8O|4.0|The second batch of EMI remasters for Steve's work included this frequently overlooked gem from the Hackett catalog. While somewhat \\"dated\\" in its sound, which was heavily influenced by early '80s style rock (period music of the day), it did offer up classics like \\"Cell 151\\" and \\"Camino Royale\\" which are true Steve Hackett staples from his early catalog.<br /><br />As with the previous batch of EMI Hackett remasters, the remastering on the album is first rate (where did all the tape hiss go?). The added bonus tracks including the extended version of \\"Walking Through Walls\\" was a real treat as well (and something that I never thought would see its way to compact disc). Overall, Steve Hackett fans will relish in this new pressing of a classic Hackett album.
B00000JXVK|5.0|Dont miss this one! Hard to not feel enthusiastic and nostalgic about motorcycling watching this film. Great great great!
B000I0QK74|4.0|This CD was a gift I ordered for myself!  And I was not disappointed.  I enjoyed Taylor's \\"spin\\" on some of the Christmas classics but my favorite was the duet he did with Natale Cole.  I liked that some other tunes made his line up that aren't over played during the holidays so it was refreshing to play and keep me in the spirit of the season. Who could get tired of his voice anyway?
B0002EXH4A|2.0|So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling.  The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head.  If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version.
B00005JNEI|3.0|HE REALLY DOES HATE BUSH. SOME VERY GOOD POINTS ARE MADE IN THIS MOVIE.
B000B8QF00|3.0|The last time I saw Alanis in concert, she was on stage at Hyde Park London, opening for the Who performing Quadrophenia for the first time, followed by Eric Clapton playing perhaps his finest ever guitar in 30 years. Not a good place to be, then, with two major acts at the peak of their form. Who wants to be opener for Pete Townsend in any circumstances? <br /> <br />In fairness, she did well. The songs, mostly from \\"Pill\\", were played competently and agressively. She sort-of gallumphed around the stage, yodelling away with the best of them, occasionally bending almost double to give it some on the harmonica, of which more later. She was endearing and brave, and I rather liked her show, as did the crowd. <br /> <br />What of this CD, then? Well, it's a very mixed bag. At her best, she writes sensible and thoughtful words, sometimes somewhat feminist, like a less angst-ridden P J Harvey. At her worst, that yodelling and seventh/octave vocal tic can become incredibly irritating. The Columbian lass Shakira also has that irritating sub-yodel in her voice, and Dido does that tiresome actave/senth yodel too. Alanis has a strong voice that could cut tin so I wish she would not do this. <br /> <br />This is an odd collection and contains a few crackers and a few rather odd choices. The lowest point is when she is allowed to play harmonica on \\"Head over Feet\\", a nice song with sweet words. The harmonica break is unspeakably and irredeemably awful, and does the near-imposible in making Bob Dylan look accomplished in this field. \\"Let's do it, let's fall in love\\" is a very odd choice, but she carries it off well. \\"Simple together\\" is just lovely, softly sung and very moving indeed. \\"Hands Clean\\" and \\"ironic\\" are both absolutely smashing, but the rest is a powerful potion to take in one go.  <br /> <br />The trouble with Alanis is that when she emotes she yodels, and when she sings it straight she is just fantastic. If you buy this, I suggest that you listen to it in bits. Alanis is chock-full of talent and there are moments of excellence: but, oh, that awful harmonica - took me back to Hyde Park. <br /> <br />Generally very good, but a few odd moments prevent this getting 4 stars. She has done better than this.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|This is an example of why some albums need to be listened to as the artists assembled them.  A classic that needs to be heard from beginning to end, not just favorites.
B00005JPCF|1.0|I know there's a lot of fans of this film, and I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised as I love animated features.  But I absolutely loathed this film.  If you are buying this for your kids expecting a fun baby sitter, be warned.  This movie is far from the movie they're trying to advertise. <br /> <br />\\"Happy Feet\\" is just a title to confuse.  The film is dark, unfunny, character designs are ugly, story and plot are even worse.  This is a film that should have been a pleasant short subject but overstays its welcome and falls apart in the third act. <br /> <br />Our lead character can't sing and can only tap dance.  By the end of the movie, ALL penguins can sing AND tap dance.  GUH??  Our lead at least is loved by his fellow penguins finally, but he's one step behind the rest as he still can't sing. <br /> <br />Moral of the story: Tap dancing at Sea World = free trip home and more fish in the ocean.  Horrible.  Yes, most of you will be entertained but it lacks focus, depth, charm, beauty, and most importantly: a good story. <br /> <br />I recommend getting any of the Pixar films or better yet, get a classic Disney 2D film.  Or if you have all Disney already, get Warner Bros' brilliant film THE IRON GIANT.  Don't settle for a DVD because it's NEW and hip.  Go for something you can cherish for years and years.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah has her own style. After a busy day at work it is nice to just sit back and listen to her relaxing voice. Can't wait for the next CD to come out.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This has got to be one of the best romantic comedies that has come out in decades.  So sweet, so funny, so touching.  It's a smart movie.  My mom loves it, my husband loves it, my conservative and liberal friends love it, my theatre friends and yoga friends love it.  I've yet to find anyone who doesn't.  It is a great film and a great purchase.  One of those movies that I enjoy watching every year (esp around Christmas).
B000002U82|2.0|Is it just me, or is this not the most boring album ever made? I have not heard too much by Pink Floyd (Another Brick in the Wall was kind of cool) so I can't judge the band themselves, but I have heard this album and I must say it really wasn't all that enjoyable. However, I do get fond memories when I think back to when I first heard it. There was a girl I met who was into Pink Floyd. She talked about this album and wore the T-shirt. I was in the library one day and decided to give it a try. I went home. The lights in my room were off while light form my window shinned and I just lied in bed listening to it. It was some what soothing, but ultimately the album was a snore fest. No, I did not fall asleep while listening to it, but it was immediately fallowed by a quick nap. This nap is sadly the most pleasure I ever got from listening to it. I tried listening to it again the next day, when I was more awake, but I still found it unbelievable boring.   Why I didn't like it? Other than that it was boring was that it just seemed to lack emotion. Don't get me wrong. I happen to like some slow music. My attention span isn't that small. I happened to love some slow songs like \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" by the Who, for example, but this was like listening to one of those nature CDs with the sounds of the trees and crickets in the background. Only this album would have to be titled \\"The Nature Sounds of Outer Space\\". Now I'm not saying that Pink Floyd is a joke like the previous analogy, but I wouldn't exactly say I like either. I'm guessing this is more of an acquired taste, which is fine. I happen to have plenty of acquired tastes of my own. But for me to learn to enjoy this would be a bit of a stretch. Recent comments have gotten me to consider maybe listening to it again, but for the time being, this remains my opinion.    So in conclusion, I really don't think like this album. Who knows? Maybe if I gave it another try today I would love it, but it certainly was boring two yearsago. I do however like a few other things by Pink Floyd. Not much but a few.        P.S. I hate it when I see kids wearing T-shirts for this album, who I don't even think like it.
B000002UUX|5.0|Marty Friedman makes this album what it is. I'm so glad they let him loose on it, otherwise it wouldn't be the classic it is today. Definitely check out Marty's album Dragon's Kiss and his Cacophony work with Jason Becker. <br />Rust in Peace has brought tears to my eyes at times...it's THAT awesome.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|If you've liked what you've heard from Norah so far, you won't be disappointed with this album.  Her soulful voice is preserved clearly, and her beautiful, simplistic voicing of the piano or plucked strings continues to lull her listeners.  However, if you're looking for a more adventurous sound this time around, you'll have fallen asleep by the end of the first song.  The mellow nature of her album captures the melancholy sound she does best, but leaves one wondering if she will ever try something with a little more spice.<br /><br />Using more syncopated, folk rhythms like she experimented with in \\"Feels Like Home\\", her songs on this album are definitely easy-listening--sometimes seriously-minded (\\"Wish I Could\\"), and at other times, just fun (\\"Little Room\\").  Occasionally, her jazz-influenced sounds and rhythms are more prominent--more like the sound of \\"Come Away With Me\\"--and are arguably the better songs on the album.  \\"Thinking About You\\" and \\"Not Too Late\\" are perhaps some of her most brilliant, pithy works.<br /><br />With an artist like Norah, it's hard not to set expectations too high.  She almost can't go wrong with that voice of hers.  The album is a good investment, and definitely enjoyable for what it is.  When you sit down with Norah, it will almost be mandatory to grab a cup of coffee and stare out a raindrop-streaked window.
B000CNESU8|5.0|Another great one from the pen of the inimitable Paddy. Comparable to \\"The Hospital\\" in its dialogue. A true master of the spoken word. Chayefsky actually demands something from his audience. Duval is particulary good - \\"intractable and adamantine.\\" Man oh man, the guy can deliver a line. Uniformly superb with brilliant performances all round. Check out the rightfully aggrieved wife of Holden, Beatrice Straight: I defy anyone to find a performance in the last thirty years that's comparable to her small bit. This is dialogue with the power of a .300 H&H Magnum. A classic pure and simple; in fact, Ruthian.
B000E6UWE4|5.0|This is not even the best book in the series thus far, but it is still better than anything else ever written.  That is not hyperbole, I am a fantasy snob and took some convincing as I do not have the time to check out new authors (to me) that I once did.<br /><br />It is fantastic and immersive.... it only makes you want to grab everything you can in this series... as it only gets better and better.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|WITH VOICES LIKE ANGELS, BEAUTY THAT CAN ONLY BE DECRIBED AS \\"EYE CANDY\\", A GREAT ORCHESTRA BACKING THEM UP, INDIVIDUAL TALENT IN FIDDLE AND HARP, GORGEOUS GOWNS, SO FEMININE AND OLD FASHIONED PURE IN APPEARANCE - WOW.  I HOPE THEY DO FIVE MORE. <br />
B000002UAU|4.0|Believe me,I'm by no meens a diehard Beatles fan(in fact I'm more into the Stones), but everyone should hear this album. If anyone is at all into or at least interested in the Beatles then they have heard this album. Is it important? YES! Is it good? LISTEN TO IT!
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Better than the last two. With every song you get a different taste of Norah and her band at their best.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Here is a DVD that everyone can understand.......and should watch.  Our planet needs your help.  Thank you, Al Gore.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Some other reviewer has said here that CHILDREN OF MEN should have run for Best Picture at the Oscars Academy Awards this year, and that's not quite right: this film SHOULD have won the Best Picture award this year. (Scorsese may well be the best director alive -closely seconded by Steven Spielberg-, but THE DEPARTED is far from his best contributions - rather give me TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOOD FELLAS over that any time) <br /> <br />As it is often the case with most good movies, it is not just the dark, intelligent plot, or the spot-on acting, or the virtuoso directing and cinematography, it's some kind of organic synergy that make the whole much, much greater than just the sum of its parts. <br /> <br />This film has so many layers, works at so many levels and does it with such excellence in craftsmanship but, at the same time, with a kind of direct, naked simplicity so far from showing-off, so far from a mere form-over-substance exercise... (not that I have anything against good, pure, flashy escapism, but you know what I mean) <br /> <br />I just hope the DVD edition does it justice in the extra stuff department, but even if that's not the case, as long as the audiovideo presentation hits it right, never you doubt it: this is a movie that you should own and replay time and time and again.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I saw Cabaret many years ago and loved it.  After watching it again on DVD the other evening, I realized it's just as entertaining now as it was then because it hasn't lost its freshness.  Another realization was that the anti-intolerance message is just as pertinent today as it was then.  In fact, it may be even more important today to realize the danger in mob psychology.  A message with great music and a love story!!!  What a deal.
B00026WU82|5.0|A hundred years from now, this album - in all its ragged glory - will be held up along with the Dead's American Beauty as an example of what American rock music was all about.  Pure poetry, pure Dylan.
0553579908|5.0|What can be said about A Clash of Kings? It starts right where a Game of Thrones ended and by no means loses any pace. I bought all 4 books about a month ago and I'm already on the third book. These books are amazing, HIGHLY recommended read. Make sure you don't have to many plans because you will cancel them to read this series. Good job George R.R. Martin and thanks for a wonderful book.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|One of the wittiest films of the year, a funny flick that pokes fun at lobbyists and walks a fine line between displaying ethical behavior and exploiting logical fallacies to convince people of nearly everything.  As enlightening as it is entertaining, anyone who enjoys a good character driven comedy should love this.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|The sequel to Celtic Woman - This DVD and the prior one are those that listen to about 4 times a week. I'm not an art or music critic. I favor the first one over this one, but I like to listen to them both.  <br /> <br />The artists' blend of traditional and other works are done par excellance. I would recommend acquiring the DVDs as a package.
B000MVQ9P2|2.0|This movie was a means of producing an anti-American military propaganda.  They made a mountain out of a mole hill from a minor incident that happened in 2000.  I personally know about the incident and the people involved.  It is no where close to being accurate.  The results that they are trying to indicate would never be caused by the chemical shown.  The only positive note about this movie is that it shows a vast improvement of Korean film making techniques in the area of special effects.  They truly have advanced in that direction and the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one.  Now, if only they could perfect their factual research before going off the wall into the deep end of improbablity.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Gosford Park is entertaining, though a bit slow in the plot at times.  It does require a dose of knowledge of the British society before WWII.  However, it is good as a murder mystery drama.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This is an excellent movie. It has a terrific plot and excellent effects for it's time and money.<br /><br />I can't see anybody else playing Terminator than Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />Terminator's mission is to go back in time and kill Sarah Connor, thereby preventing John Connor from being the leader of the resistance forces that would destroy Skynet. However, had the Terminator not attacked the police station in its attempt to fulfill its programming, Kyle Reese would have been kept separate from Sarah Connor and John Connor (Skynet's real objective) would not have been born. But the machines had to send The Terminator back in time regardless to ensure their own existence as Cyberdyne Systems uses the scrap from the destroyed Terminator in 1984 to create Skynet. John Connor cannot exist without Skynet and Skynet cannot exist without John Connor.<br /><br />One of the best sci-fi/action movies all times.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|My husband and I both thoroughly enjoy watching this DVD.  It is very relaxing.  Also the livelier songs make you happy and want to get up and dance!
0723257639|5.0|I want to commend to other people to read this book. It is really interested.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I was rapt when I played the first CD Il Divo; then Ancora, which I loved; Siempre is AWESOME!  We should be grateful to Simon Cowell for bringing this brillian foursome to us.  Ear candy at its best.  Pop Opera....how cool!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This is a great concert. The dvd is exactly like the concert I attended. Sometimes it's hard to hear her singing over the band, but all in all, it's a must have for your collection.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is a truly classic tale.  This movie has something for people of all ages.  And, if you are a dog lover, you can't beat it!
1580086810|5.0|Photos, background story and typical receipe from a family living in one of 30  countries around the world. The idea is very original: ask people to buy the ingredients for their meals for a week and take a picture of them together with the food. The differences are very revealing: all the packed and processed food in the USA in contrast with the basic ingredients most African families use. It is not only about rich or poor; it gives you many good ideas and examples for a new way of life. And the photos with so many details and colors are impressive.
0262731541|4.0|Definitely a good book for bike nerds like myself. Really technical and thick reading. If you like stuff like that, then get this book.
1594200106|5.0|I loved this novel.  It ranks in the top ten books I've enjoyed most.  My husband is glad I finished it b/c he wanted his wife back.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|If you have not gone to any of her concerts, this is the next best thing to being there. The cd does capture the real feeling of being there in the concert it self.  I personally went to this concert and bought the cd...and they are both great...if you are a true Madonna fan you won't be dissappointed.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this CD. She is apparently trying to branch out and do some different types of songs. I like good, old  Norah and think she should stick to what her listeners expect.
B000FWHVKA|5.0|I love this album. It is completely refined as compared to The Knife's somewhat disjointed previous album, Deep Cuts, and it's hard to only listen to (or dance to) one track. Karin Andersson's voice is truly individual and delicately intense. Silent Shout is a beautifully constructed, atmospheric sequence of tracks that remind me of the aurora borealis reflected off shimmering snow. After months I still can't stop listening.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|I was very worried before this came out. Would this be So This is Goodbye and Room On Fire, a sophomore slump like those, or A Rush of Blood to the Head and Antics? Fortunately, Neon Bible is the latter. It's an expansion, an evolution of the band's sound, yet still an effective showcase of what made them great from the beginning. The passion of Funeral, the sincerity of that classic is all here, but with different sounds and more politicized lyrics and more maturity. <br /> <br />It isn't better than Funeral, it's merely just as good; Arcade Fire have kept up their quality to their same high standards, while tinkering with their sound. The destination ultimately is the same, but their path has changed. And i'm entirely satisfied. <br /> <br />Like their debut, this album is astonishingly cohesive, best to take in as a whole. With cohesion like this, i never delve deeply into individual songs, i just consider the album as a whole. In other words, each song is there to complete the work, each song is essential to the album. So i won't choose a favorite track or list standouts. I will only say that the record is excellent from beginning to end with no discernible slumps. Every song here is worth it. The skip button will not be needed.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|I bought this album originally when first released, but sadly lost it along the way. Thankfully I recalled it when replacing my ageing collection of records. This is probably the best album George did after All this must pass. He had some teriffic help in making it, Geoff Lynne, Ringo, Elton and Eric Clapton. It was made around the time of the Travelling Wilburys ablbums, which are equally as good as this one, but sadly only available from Russia? <br />The tracks are very catchy, with I've got my mind set on you, being bar far the best. You can sense that the musicians playing on these numbers are masters of there craft and are truly enjoying making great music.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002I57|5.0|This classic album opens with a wonderfully moody ballad, aptly titled, for this disc is a stairway leading into the musical genius of some of the brightest stars in jazz history, John Coltrane and Milt Jackson. There is not a bad track on this album, and the supporting cast, including Paul Chambers and Connie Kay, could not be better. Perhaps my favorite tune is \\"The Late Late Blues\\" which has a very catchy bass line/melody. This recording dates from 1960, a transitional period for Trane, after his fruitful period in the Miles Davis quintet, but before the final years leading his own group. He has that soul-searching, searing sound. Overall, one of the most satisfying jazz discs you'll ever hear!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|been watching them on PBS.... love this CD... listen to it frequently!!!
0887081770|5.0|i love this book, would recommend it to anyone with small children. it is comforting and sweet.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|This is a wonderful album. It has a very intense feeling to it. If  Funeral sounds as if it came out of a small warm place, then Neon Bible   sounds like it came out of a storm. Powerful.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|After seeing this concert I was skeptical about what the CD might be like, but it is great. Would highly recommend.
B000002KIK|4.0|The last few Ozzy-era Sabbath albums are generally treated with derision by many. Those who are in perpetual thrall to the heaviness and darkness that characterized their first albums undoubtedly see a retrogression in the power of the music. In many ways, this is true: the shifting dynamics and exploratory adventures undertaken by the band did reduce the heaviness. But no band could possibly stick to the one-tone crunch that embodied albums like \\"Master of Reality.\\" <br /> <br />By the time \\"Never Say Die!\\" came out, Sabbath appeared to be a spent force. The travesty that was \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" showed a band that was out of touch and churning out dross that hardly resembled the halcyon days of old. Ozzy left, was briefly replaced, but then he came back. The band moved to Toronto and hastily assembled this album. The recklessly quick approach gives the music a sense of urgency, but at the same time, its as if every idea that popped-up was tossed into the blender. As such, this album is a kinetic hodgepodge that, remarkably, ends up sounding quite well. <br /> <br />Never Say Die is a track that is, essentially, a punk song. Simple riff, repetitive, relatively short (compared to the rest of the material!). Great and memorable; good chorus and fun finale. <br /> <br />Johnny Blade is a good example of hodgepodge assembly. There's a weird riff in here, odd changes that occur at unexpected times, a mischievous theme (society breeds a killer) and synths. Old 70s proggy synths. Odd. <br /> <br />Junior's Eyes starts with drums and bass, and then gets a wash of psychedelic wah-wah'ed guitar. The song drags on for longer than it should, though. The structure and the delivery of the track just aren't convincing. <br /> <br />Hard Road drags on too, but its not bad at all. It's got a repetitive guitar thing going, a hummable chorus and fun backing vocals. Hip stuff. <br /> <br />Air Dance is the track you'd never expect Sabbath to make. It starts out rocking, but then settles into a slow troubled piano. Ozzy then goes on to tell us about a dancer who's lost her ability to dance. Sad, eh? The tracks moves on,  and somehow or another, takes the piano into jazzy and atmospheric areas. But then it rocks again! Then it a jazz rhythm overpowers the track and loopy guitar/synth work takes over. It ends up sounding like a mad prog horror movie in  the end. Surprisingly, though, its pretty cool. <br /> <br />Over To You repeats the jazzy bit by sprinkling twinkly pianos during the chorus.  The rest of the track isn't is plodding but still manages to rock on forwards without getting too dull. <br /> <br />Breakout is a slow drum beat boosted by a guitar riff that's then overtaken by non-aggressive horns. Odd. But that then leads us to... <br /> <br />Swinging the Chains. Its ironic that the last Ozzy era track is sung by Bill Ward. This track rules! Killer riff, mean lyrics and very rowdy ending.  It's a finely executed track, and it's one of the highlights of the album. <br /> <br />Overall, this album isn't \\"Paranoid\\" or \\"Master of Reality.\\" But it is what it is: A complex mish-mash of hastily assembled and instantly banged-out material. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but overall, it's a surprisingly adventurous effort from a band that was on its last throes. <br />
B000M4RG42|5.0|Magnificently done. Matched with his \\"Letter from Iwo Jima\\" Eastwood has created both an historical masterpiece and a true depiction of the futility of war!
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie offers the best in animation. If you are a car buff, race fan or kid, you will love everything about this story and it's characters, not to mention, the cast of talented voices behind the cars. Take the whole family and  you will not be disapointed.  It's just a very good movie for the whole family and grandparents to!
B00003CXCD|5.0|This Special Collector's Edition of 'Roman Holiday' does justice to one of the classic black and white movies of the golden age of the cinema.
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew, who's getting a baby brother this spring.  I liked the gentle tone of the book, the fact that it shows Dad doing parenting chores, the fact that it doesn't establish the gender of the new baby, allowing you as the reader to use that as a discussion point (or not), etc.  The book would best be used as a jumping-off point for talks about what a new baby in the house means: i.e., \\"this page shows the baby sleeping in a crib.  You slept in a crib when you were a baby.  Now you have a big-boy bed, right?\\" or however you want to handle it.  Each page could be used like that, if you wanted to, a few weeks apart, to give the child more time for processing and asking questions. (Caveat: If you're in a single-parent, two-mommy, or two-daddy household, you might get questions about who the second parent is in the picture.)
B000002J29|5.0|My best friend talked me into going to the Genesis concert in 1977 in Seattle. Before the concert I only listen to A Trick of the Tail but I was blow away with the concert. Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, Tony Banks, Steve Hackett and Chester Thompson click as a group. Before this concert I was able to see YES, Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull and other big groups from that era but Genesis 1977 tour was the very best concert I have every attended. When the Seconds Out album debuted I was reluctant to purchase it because of my bias from seeing the concert, but I was very wrong. This album captures the essence of the concert. I can put my headphones on and close my eyes and I will be transported back to the concert. I was able to see Genesis during there 1984 tour and it was not nearly as good as the 1977 tour. Of all the albums to own from Genesis this a must album. You will not be disappointed with the quality or the sound that is delivered.
B00005JNX0|5.0|GRAND DAUGHTER IS 3 BUT SHE WILL WATCH THIS SHOW OVER AND OVER !
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig really suprised me when I frist saw the film. I thought that he would be really bad at playing 007 because of his looks. But he fit the job really well. No one can beat out the original Sean Connery, but Craig is the closets to Connery as any of the six actors so far. Buy this film. It is amazing!!!
1400049628|4.0|While this book is stated as a humorous guide to zombie survival I actually found it to not to contain any humor in the slightest which perhaps is the best aspect of this book. It takes itself so seriously that one can not help buy chuckle at the absurdity of it all while at the same time wondering if, just perhaps... Zombies are real. <br />Simply put this is for anyone that has ever enjoyed the old zombie movies of yester-year this book is simply amazing in its details of zombies and straight forward look at what a real zombie outbreak might be like. From compelling scientific analysis of zombies to accounts of real attacks, this book covers all the bases for a perfect cover to cover read. <br /> <br />A must read for anyone remotely interested in the horror genre and especially in classic zombie flicks. <br />
0060578793|5.0|A great tool for anyone. provides much needed survival information. Don't leave home without it!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|This recording of Yanni's concert in Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas just blew me away! Although the previous concert recordings were great (Acropolis, Taj Mahal, Forbidden City), this most recent version of his already famous pieces sounds the best! <br /> <br />..and this is not just due to the better technology used. Yanni seems to have slightly edited his renowned compositions to expose the incredible talent of his new recruits, taking the musical pieces to a breathtaking level! This is particularly noticed in 'Until the last moment', where one of his new Armenian violinists takes you on a deep emotional journey with what seem to be Arabian hymns! That alone was worth the entire DVD for me! <br /> <br />If you're a Yanni fan, you're in a for an unsurpassed treat with this DVD!
B0000026J6|5.0|I first heard Leonard Cohen's song in movie \\" Love at Large \\". Loved it. <br />Went on line to find out about him and listen to a few clips of his songs. <br />Bought \\" I'm your man \\" and have introduced it to friends and Family.
0385751060|5.0|The book jacket and preface to the book won't tell you anything about the subject matter, and neither will I.  I will tell you that it's extremely well-written and it's a book that you will be thinking about long after your read it.
1401302378|5.0|Excellent book for understanding the dynamics of digital goods ... great for web entrepreneurs, analysts and anyone interested in knowing more about the information economy.  A very entertaining read!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST OR 1 OF THE BEST THAT WAS EVER SENT
0688156819|5.0|Tim Burton is a master at what he does.  This is a cute book of short stories and poems, which are slightly creepy and incredibly clever. I loved it.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater but wanted to see it at home in my home system setup, got this item thru here because i could not find it anywhere else...it came rather quickly too!!  <br /> <br />5 stars out of 5 for special effects, but the acting at the end was a little off...and some situations seemed stupid and easly to figure out. <br /> <br />was kinda stupid that the only thing written in english on the soviet ship was the penecill vial , just happened to be what they needed..!! but hey, its a movie!!!
B000AP04OM|5.0|I've waited every Christmas for this movie, this Christmas my daughter saw it for the first time and loved it. It was time to own it, she watches it so much it might not be my favorite movie in a litle while. Great movie.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|An Inconvenient Truth is an amazing documentary that stresses the importance of reducing greenhouse gases and spreading the word about global warming.  Once you see this film, you will have a different view on global warming and its devastating effects.  A must see for all people!
0439813786|4.0|This is a revolutionary book, mixing beautiful hand drawings and classic photos as part of the story line.  Also an intriguing plot, but could have been developed a little better in my opinion.
074322454X|5.0|Great book! We need to remember what these men went through for us!
6305511055|5.0|One of Robert Redford better flicks. I can watch it over and over
B00005RG6B|5.0|Just what you would expect!  Almost as good as seeing it in person.
B0000542D2|5.0|What can I say about one of the top 100 films of all time. It's the kind of film that shames the big blockbusters. It was made in a documentary style, low budget, with four really unknown boys, playing the music that made me a fan forever. It's sharp, funny, and don't forget the people that make this film memorable. <br /> <br />Beatles Forever! <br /> <br />Mario <br />
B0000TLA9G|4.0|What can you say?  It's awesome if you are a G&R big hair fan.  I don't like a lot of their filler music so this one just has the good songs for the most part.
