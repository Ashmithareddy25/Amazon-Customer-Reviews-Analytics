I expected an intelligent self-help type book; what I read was the most life changing, inspiring work (besides the Bible) I have ever set eyes on. I recommend it to anyone, especially those who feel something is missing in their life.

B0001XAPX8|4.0|I haven't read the Phillip Roth novel upon which this is based, but I imagine a tremendous amount of nuance has necessarily been deleted. Still, the cast can't be faulted, even if the chemistry between 70-something Anthony Hopkins and 40ish Nicole Kidman seems a bit forced at times. The title reminds me of some '50s sci-fi flick, not a literary spellbinder. Ed Harris as the psycho ex-Nam nutcase is fully grizzled and effective, but I don't understand why he is allowed to be free when he is seen repeatedly confessing his crazedness to some VA counselor. One could do much worse than this for an hour and 45 minutes of entertainment.

B001I8BN7C|3.0|I am a huge Stephen King fan, and have loved every book of his that I have read. And i was very excited to read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, as I have heard that it was one of his best works, but I has hugely disappointed. As I was reading I kept on waiting for the book to get better or the scary part to happen, and it never did. Don't get me wrong the book is very well written and it has it moments, but they a far and few in between. Please read this book because I am sure that a lot of people will disagree with my opinion, and you may to, and I do not want to ruin a book for anybody. I cannot wait though to read another Stephen King book, as I know the next one will be better and more suited for me.
B00364K6YW|3.0|Before you read any further, please understand that it's this particular version (2010 Restored) and not the production that I give 3 stars - the production rates 5, I've loved it since it debuted on A&E.  I also own the \\"Special Edition,\\" released on DVD in 2001.     So, the 2010 DVD restored version of P&P is lovely visually - compared to the special edition, the colors in this version are much warmer and you can see much more detail, particularly in respect to the clothing and backgrounds.  Much to my displeasure, however, they returned it to the 6 separate episodes for the 2010 edition, meaning you have to fast forward through the credits at the beginning and end of each hour.  You CAN NOT play it all the way through without the credits interrupting.  The special edition, in comparison, allows you to play the each disk (episodes 1-3 and 4-6) straight through, with the credits playing only at the beginning and end of each disk.    You can't jump over the beginning credits, either - you have to fast forward them by hand, because you'll miss the first sixth of that episode if you try to jump to the next scene.    Also with the 2010 version, they also put 1-4 on one disk and 5-6 on another, meaning that they broke up my favorite scenes - the visit to Pemberley.  (This is really only a personal preference - but I'm not in the least bit happy about having to get up and change the DVD in the middle of my favorite scenes.)  This to save space on the second disk for a 60 minute extra that involves cast members revisiting memories - the actors playing Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, Mary Bennett, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham (no Darcy or Elizabeth, natch). This was interesting but one I'm unlikely to watch again.  Other extras include information on the technical changes - boring, but does allow you to easily see the difference between versions - as well as bits that I think have been included on other editions - a walk w/ Adrian Lukis and Lucy Briers (Wickham and Mary Bennett) andanother piece I haven't watched yet discussing the impact this production had on period productions in general.    In general, if you already own P&P and are satisfied with the version you have - and can deal with the color - then I recommend that you stick with it.  I'll probably continue watching the 2001 special edition to avoid the hassle of fast forwarding credits throughout.
B00005MKA3|4.0|I've been a fan of Marley's work for nearly 20 years. This album is a bit hit and miss for me. There are about three really solid tracks for me, and a couple so so tracks... then there a re a few that I just skip.    solid tracks:  so much trouble in the world  one drop  wake up and live    the first two are classic marley tracks, and they're found on compilations often. Wake up and live is a masterwork of the mixing board- I think the sound engineers spent a little more time on this one than the rest. It really sounds nice.    So-so tracks:  top rankin  ambush in the night    It's really the horn work that keeps me listening to these tracks... he had a great horn section here.    I could really live without the other tracks.
B002ZG98J6|1.0|I am a teacher. I recomend these books to all my students, family, and friends. All who have read them, loved them. I loved the entire book series. I was very excited when they announced they would be making a movie. If the movie had been made to the caliber of Harry Potter or LOTR, with a close following of the story and characters, then this would have been the awesome first installment of a great set of movies. Instead, we're left with some decent action and special effects, with poor acting, casting, script, and reworked plot. I wish I had waited to watch it at home, what a waste of money. The books are great, please read and enjoy them, don't waste time watching this film.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Very good amplifier for this price. I used it with the HD555 headphone and a Sony EJ-915 discman. The power from the earphone output of EJ-915 is not enough to drive HD555 and the volume is not loud enough even it is turned to maximum. After I connected the Fiio E5 to the lineout of EJ-915, the sound quality improved a lot. The sound was more clear and could be thundering loud. The battery can last a long time after one charge, over 20hrs from my first experience, the charging time is only 2hrs from a laptop usb. The one improvement I want of it is to add a LCD display of the volume and battery info like my EJ-915 remote control, but that may increase the cost and I do not see any headphone amplifier with that. Overall, this is a very good product from China and I give it five stars.

B00275EGX8|1.0|To put it mildly, this movie is an insult to servicemen everywhere.  Basically, it takes the view that our serious, proud, and dedicated soldiers are just careless, self absorbed, dickish adrenaline junkies.  That is 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.  The fact it won an Oscar is also a testament to Hollywood's inability to detect stink.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|I think these triggers are a decent add-on to my controller. It seems to add some sensitivity to pressing the triggers during FPS games.  I play MW2 alot and it seems to help, but I would actually prefer if they didn't curve so far forward.  They do not come off the controller easy either. I saw someone say that they do, but only if you are the type to throw your controller or slam it down hard.  So I would recommend them if you use the L2 and R2 buttons as firing buttons or accelerators in driving games.

B002ZG97RY|4.0|GREEN ZONE<br /><br />STARRING: Matt Damon, Greg Kinnear, Brendan Gleeson, Khalid Abdalla, Jason Isaacs, Amy Ryan, Yigal Naor, Said Faraj, Nicoye Banks and Jerry Della Salla<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Brian Helgeland; based on the book Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone by Rajiv Chandrasekaran<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Paul Greengrass<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 12 March 2010<br />Review Date: 15 March 2010<br /><br />When Chief Warrant Officer Miller stumbles across a stench infested pile of pigeon droppings, rather than the nuclear warheads he was told he'd find, he's pretty pissed off. Matt Damon stars as Miller in Green Zone; the latest action thriller from the director of the last two Jason Bourne films, Paul Greengrass.<br /><br />The timeline has us back in 2003. We are in Iraq and we're on the hunt for WMDs (Weapons of Mass Destruction) with Chief Miller, of the U.S. Army.<br /><br />Miller gets bold when some of his men are killed at the pigeon-scat sighting, and squares off with his superiors to include a two star General. Miller suspects that there is a glitch in our Intel source, as this is the third wild `pigeon' chase, he's been sent on. He's told otherwise, and advised to not ask questions and to do as he's told. This is about - oh say, 12 minutes into the film, and up to and including this point, it's been believable.<br /><br />It's not the fact that Miller decides to take matters into his own hands that I had a problem with, so much as the way he does it; which was extremely over the top. I've never been to Iraq, but I did serve in Afghanistan, and I'm sure the specifics of how the Military handles things in general, are probably pretty similar. So for me, seeing Miller tell his troops to abandon their post, and to follow a tip from a local Iraqi citizen named Freddy, by driving in his private vehicle, as well as another one that they steal for God's sakes - is just ridiculous!<br /><br />It makes for a fun jolt forward in the film, even I can admit, but come on! A soldier actually bashes in the window of an Iraqi citizen's pick-up truck, with the butt of his rife in broad day-light, in front of everyone, and steals it! As if this wasn't Looney Tunes enough on its own, Miller actually yells at one of his troops for questioning his order by saying, \\"Put your f**king game face on!\\" A great movie line for sure, but absolutely absurd! In the Military there is a little thing called `a lawful order.' Meaning, any order that is lawful, must be carried out by the lower ranking person. If that order is unlawful, as clearly was the case here, then you don't have to follow it! All of Miller's guys see no harm in this whatsoever, and go along with it.<br /><br />The superb actor that played Freddy (Khalid Abdalla), was more than convincing with the info he gives to Miller; so I get why he believed him. Freddy says he has just seen an important meeting taking place between several really bad men. The reason for the privately owned vehicles rather than the up-armored Humvees they abandon is to not blow their cover; makes sense.<br /><br />But then we see them kick the doors down and bust into the place, like it's an episode of Cops, or something! I guess no-one in the film is worried about video footage, or having to explain what the hell they were doing there to begin with, to their own chain of command. And conveniently, the film never requires them to. No-one ever finds out about this, even after a firefight ensues, resulting in casualties. Right.<br /><br />I'm totally onboard with Miller's character, I really am. There is nothing more frustrating than having to bite your tongue in the Military, and being treated like a child in regards to lack of an explanation to things that you are more than capable of understanding. But the movie goes way too Hollywood here. Miller reports to no-one, and no Military personnel ever interfere with him. He's simply allowed togo out and do whatever he wants with whatever equipment he wants, and with whatever soldiers he wants to put in harms way. The film sets up Iraq to be like a playground that Miller can frolic around in whenever he wishes.<br /><br />The guy is a Chief Warrant Officer, but he's not a God. I worked with a Chief Warrant Officer, who was also in the Army, and whose name ironically was also Miller. I drank with the man, played cards with the man, and went outside the wire with him, so I knew him pretty well. And being a writer, I paid close attention to what his rank and position allotted him to do. Our mission was to protect four star Generals, we were their personal protection team, and my Chief never had the freedom Miller has here. You can't just exit the green zone whenever you like. It's just bananas how ridiculous this is! The guy is let loose like he's Rambo or something! It simply would not happen.<br /><br />Aside from this, and the film's unrelenting theme (that our government lied about WMDs to have their war); the film is fantastic; tons of action driven suspense. Being written by one of the best screenwriter's Hollywood has ever seen, (Brian Helgeland), it's no wonder. Payback, Assassins, Conspiracy Theory, The Postman, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Mystic River, Man on Fire and L.A. Confidential are only but a few of his legacies.<br /><br />I have ragged on Damon's character Miller, but truly only for believability purposes. Cinematically, he's awesome, and Damon is perfect for the role. I like that we never really understand why Miller is so caught up in finding out the truth to these supposed weapons. By that I mean, there is no Hollywood back-story that fuels his rage to find answers. Not that this is bad in movies, but it's been done. Miller is simply pissed because his guys are dying and he doesn't like being lied to or taken advantage of; something we all can concur with.<br /><br />The enjoyable dynamic of Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear that we loved in Stuck on You, is back. Kinnear plays the one entity posing a threat to Miller's Easter-egg hunt for clues as his vicious `suit' of a character Poundstone. Poundstone is an agent with more power than he knows what to do with. He even has his own squad of soldiers at his fingertips. The kind of soldiers that don't live in government housing, and aren't required to shave, and have various takes on how to wear their uniforms; the Washington DC kind.<br /><br />Miller also earns an ally in the CIA, played by Brendan Gleeson, early on in the film. I enjoyed these elements in the film, but again only as fictional plot-points. It's highly unbelievable that a Warrant Officer would be this closely involved with the CIA. That's why they have the CIA; so that they can send in their very own specialists and keep things quiet.<br /><br />But of course the film needs Damon's character to do it all, to make it more fun, so we go with it. Even when Miller is given a million dollars in cash to offer to a potential source, with going through less than a third grader would need to check out a library book.soldiers he wants to put in harms way.

B0035V35P8|5.0|Ninja Assassin is a great movie,If your into Ninjas,Ninja Movies and Martial Arts Would Recommend. I was surprised at how good it was. Seeing as many people didn't like it,rotten tomatoes,etc. But I rented it and Really like it.  Since there is No Ninja Movie that can compare in my memory, It's one of if not the Best Modern one.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie. I watch it once a month and the copy I received is perfect.
B0000067L3|4.0|Looking at disc one (\\"In the Studio\\"), you'll see that the most successful songs are by the team of Jack Bruce and Pete Brown. Bruce was conservatory trained and played the cello as well as bass; Pete Brown was a London-based poet whose lyrics made \\"White Room,\\" for example, such a great song, set to the classical and rock music of Bruce. Then, we have Eric Clapton's excellent electric versions of two blues classics, placed second and next-to-last in sequence. The three weakest songs, those by Ginger Baker and Mike Taylor, are placed third, fifth, and seventh, in the middle of the album. So, two strong Jack Bruce/Pete Brown songs frame the disc, with Eric Clampton's two (traditional) contributions just within those frames, and Ginger Baker's songs (the weakest material) are in the middle, more or less, which shows that the group was going in three different directions in their last and perhaps greatest album, and that prevents the studio disc from being a totally convincing unit, mirroring the band itself at that time.  If we didn't have the magnificient, driving vocals of Jack Bruce, such minor songs as \\"Those Were the Days\\" (Ginger Baker/Mike Taylor) would have fallen flat. In fact, Bruce was really the voice of Cream, since neither Eric Clapton nor Ginger Baker were stong vocally. Their contributions are mainly instrumental (but what fabulous musicians they are!!!). As much as one would like to believe otherwise, disc one is somewhat of a miscellany.      On the live disc two, in contrast, both Clapton, in his blazing electric blues take on Robert Johnson's \\"Crossroads\\" and his astonishing cover of Willie Dixon's \\"Spoonful,\\" along with Ginger Baker's still amazing 15 minute solo on \\"Toad\\" make up for the weaknesses of disc one. Jack Bruce's athletic performance of his \\"Traintime\\" comes in a very close second.  Overall, the greatest numbers in the entire album are the rock classic \\"White Room\\" on disc one, and Eric Clapton's simply astonding performance of \\"Spoonful,\\" on disc two, with his take on \\"Crossroads\\" and \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" coming in a close second. Jack Bruce's \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\" is also notable.  So, it's uneven but it's great and essential. These two discs are \\"Wheels of Fire,\\" indeed.    PS. Credit should go to producer Felix Pappalardi for doing what he could with disc one and for the link between \\"Traintime\\" and \\"Toad,\\" even though they were recorded on different dates.

B003MOHX8S|5.0|I've waited a while for this album, and it's totally worth buying. Two Steps from hell has been around for a long time, and now they've finally released their first public album.  Epic trailer music is probably the coolest music out there, and Two Steps From Hell makes the best of that genre.  Totally worth $9.  You'll hear this stuff in movie and video game commercials.  It's just too awesome the pass.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Irrespective of format, this is one of the greatest nature documentaries ever created. It's a stunning collection that captures the world that we live in and so rarely have access to or see. You may not turn into an environmentalist after watching Planet Earth, but you cannot help but walk away with a greater respect and appreciation for the diversity that exists beyond the confines of our cities and suburbs.  Attenborough, as usual, adds a gravitas that is captivating without being stuffy.  The man could, and does, make watching grass grow exciting.    So that covers why *everyone* should see it.    Now if you have BluRay and an HDTV, it is truly required material. For all of the CGI, for all of the football and hockey I've seen... THIS is the material that shows off why BluRay and HDTV exist.  The capture is amazing and the ability to see life in minute detail is an immersive experience that is unparalleled.    Rewatchability of the series is surprisingly high, and this is a piece that will capture as well as any the state of our natural world for generations to come.

No on thought it would happen, but founding member Dino Cazares has returned for guitar duty - with an 8-string guitar! Also Long time drummer Ray Herrera has been replaced with Gene Hoglan. 2010's \\"Mechanize\\" is classic FF as their best. It is reminiscent of \\"Demanufacture\\". This is a must have for any metal fans! The Machine has returned!!
B001FSDOZO|1.0|Nickelback are by far the most transcendent band of the 21st century. They managed to make music that is beyond generic, simplistic and offensive. Normally, your typical post-grunge flavor of the month will fade away and be forgotten by many, but Nickelback are fortunate that their career still manages to carry on. With \\"Dark Horse\\", they have managed to be successful in crafting the nadir of rock music.<br /><br />Nickelback did one thing different here: change up the lyrical content, and it still doesn't matter because the formula has long been sucked dry by now. The songs have managed to eliminate all subtlety with track titles like \\"Something in Your Mouth\\" and \\"S.E.X.\\". I don't find this to be a problem because the lyrics are dirty. In fact, you can sing about the most disgusting fetishes and have it on one of the greatest albums ever. That's not what bothers me. Instead, Nickelback present it in poor form, resulting in a seriously contrived and laughable delivery. We get it, Chad Kroeger. You have no class whatsoever.<br /><br />As for the band, wouldn't we have expected some growth by now? Absolutely not, because Nickelback are incapable of doing such a thing. It seems that they're not a band for music, and instead manage to write the same washed-up, four chord nonsense that's been milked dry from the cash cow for many years. We have rehashed ballads for radio (that you've heard years ago), songs that sound like amateurs covering Corrosion of Conformity's [[ASIN:B000002AOJ Deliverance]], pop country songs with a flimsy rock masquerade, and other predictable garbage. It's obvious that they're trying to recapture the 80's arena rock sound, and they succeed in that by overproducing this to death. Looking for hooks? You won't find any here.<br /><br />I now feel dumber for actually having the misfortune of sampling this atrocity. Cliche ridden generic radio rock at its all-time worst, and that's an accomplishment.
B000002J1L|5.0|All of the four studio albums of the \\"classic\\" lineup of Genesis from 1971 to 1974 are wonderful and definitely worth owning.  It's hard to pick one as my favorite.  None of them are perfect, and this one is no exception, but there are a couple of things that make it stand out.  This is the first album which featured Phil Collins and Steve Hackett, who both brought a higher level of musical skills to the band, and help them polish and define their sound.  In addition to being a great drummer, Collins' voice also harmonized in a great way with Peter Gabriel's.  While with [[ASIN:B000002NZO Trespass]] Genesis began to define their musical direction, with this album there is a significant improvement and refinement on all levels.<br /><br />One thing that is immediately apparent is the wonderful cover artwork - easily the best of the four.  The image of the girl playing croquet with human heads illustrates  the story line of the opening song \\"The Musical Box\\", which if I had to pick a favorite Genesis song, would be in a tie with \\"Supper's ready on 1972's [[ASIN:B000002J1M Foxtrot]].  This song is a masterpiece which has a dreamlike surrealist vibe to it that really transports you elsewhere.<br /><br />\\"Musical Box\\" was apparently a work in progress during the \\"Trespass\\" days, and shows the influence of Anthony Phillips, the original guitarist (who left because of stage fright), on the quieter acoustic passages.  If you listen to \\"Trespass\\" or Phillips' solo album [[ASIN:B001441VJA The Geese & the Ghost]], you will hear what I mean.  Another such W.I.P. was \\"Twilight Alehouse\\" a rarity recorded during the \\"Nursery Cryme\\" sessions.<br /><br />\\"Musical Box\\" is one of 4 longer, more complex \\"epic\\" songs separated by shorter and lighter songs.  \\"For Absent Friends\\" is actually Phil Collins' lead vocal debut, although it is uncredited.  \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" is a wonderful sci-fi parody, which touches on the recurring theme of the folly of man's arrogance. The dissonant bombast at the end is a highlight  \\"Seven Stones\\" is dismissed in many reviews as being weak or inconsequential, but I am actually quite fond of it.  It think Gabriel gives a great vocal performance on it, I really like the flute and keyboard interplay in the middle, and anyway I think Melotrons are way-cool!  \\"Harold the Barrel\\" is a lightweight but amusing absurdist parable, in which Gabriel assumes the role of various characters (which would be become a trademark of his work. The central theme of the fragility of middle class \\"normalcy\\" is one that Genesis and Gabriel on his own would revisit several times. \\"Fountain of Salmacis\\" is one of the longer \\"epics\\" based on Greek mythology, which features some of Steve Hackett's best guitar work with Genesis.<br /><br />Genesis's sound would get tighter and more polished on subsequent albums, but this album stands out on a creative level.  Plus, hey, it's got \\"Musical Box\\" - say no more!end is a highlight  \\"Seven Stones\\" is dismissed in many reviews as being weak or inconsequential, but I am actually quite fond of it.

Bhikku Bodhi shows your clearly what the buddha taught by extracting from pali canon. If u want to be a real buddhist u have to understand the buddhism as it is.

B001NXBRJG|3.0|This is one of the types of movies that would look best in Blu-ray.  This transfer to Blu-ray was poor, and it looks no better than a DVD.  I got the 10th Anniversary Edition.  The case is basically a Blu-ray sized book with a slot in the back for the blu-ray disk.  It has about 40 pages of text and pictures of/about the movie, the actors, directors, etc.  I never pay extra for special editions, but I really liked this one.   It was a landmark movie, and I enjoy having this memento of it.  There is only one disk, but as it is blu-ray, it has the extras on it.  I do recommend this version of the movie, but don't expect Blu-ray picture quality.
0688156819|5.0|I love this book, but I will say this book is not for everyone.  If you like Dr. Seuss and you love things that other people would find really dark and weird then this book is for you!  It is a lot of fun to read, but be forewarned that it is a little out there and takes a special kind of person to fully appreciate this book.
B0039SFKSW|3.0|Ok ..Ive been a big asia fan ever since they first came out ..and have seen them several times here in Cleveland , at the house of blues ..Their always great in such a small hall . I was also very into Yes ..when they first came out ..as well as King Crimson ..the only band of these groups I never did seen back in the 70`s . Ive been listing to their debut Cd all week in my car . and . am playing the new one as I type . Glad to see the guys back together again on their \\" Reunion \\" Cd , but it just lacks the power .. energy and intensity of their older stuff . Everyones talking about how great Johns voice sounds and what energy he has on this Cd . Im missing it . It seems like Buggles rock ..lacking in pure rock , in your face power . But . then again ..I may be trying to compare it to the intensity of their live shows . The keyborad work also sounds a little bubblegummish ..guitars work is lacking a little too . Im a little disappointed in this CD . \\" Finger on the Trigger \\" ..is ok ..as is \\" Through My Veins \\" word wise . Holy War is ok ..but , then again ..who can beat out John Butchers all time rocking version of that song ..its one of my all time favorites . \\"Ever Yours \\"..doesnt work at all for me ..too mellow . \\"Listen Children \\" sounds like it was done by Rick Springfield . \\" End Of The World \\" is the only song on the Cd that actually has Carl Palmer playing his drums and Chris working this axe for a few minutes . \\" Light The Way \\" sounds a little more the Asia I knew back then , but is still lacking their usual power . They could of left \\" Emily \\" off and Id of been ok with that . \\" Im still The Same \\" again ..has that Ruggles sound to it . I didnt care for \\" There was A Time \\" much , other then the lyrics . \\" I Believe \\" was ok ..they picked up the tempo again and carried it good , and is one of the best songs on the cd . What the hell was \\" Dont Want To Lose You \\" ..they sounded like the beechboys on that one . wheres all that power that the band has on \\"Heat Of The Moment \\" ?  All the great keyboard , drum work and out standing vocals of \\" OnlY Time Will Tell \\" and \\" Soul Survivor \\" now thats some kickass , rocking ..in your face songs ..When I run the hounds of hell ..twist my foot I nearly fell ..hell yeah !  The great drum and keyboard work on \\" One Step Closer \\" . and lets not forget that great intro ..keyboards and drums smoking ..rockig vocals on \\" Time And Time Again \\" even their more mellow \\" Without You \\" still rocks better then anything on this new Cds  ..now thats ASIA kicking ass and taking names ..Johns vocals rock..Downes is working the K boards ..Steve is cooking too ..wow ..its one of my all time favorite Cds ..and this new Cd just doesnt even come close !  Like I said ..Im very disappointed and hope they get back to their rocking , powerhouse sounds like on their debut CD again very soon . Im glad I got it cheap ..thats all I can say . Thats my story and Im sticking to it . now if we can get The original King Crimson to do a reunion ..Ill be there !
B0036EBARO|5.0|This is an excellent album.  The first few tracks (side of the album if it were an album) is different than the \\"B\\" side.    Rocket, the first song is a pop song that is really catchy and even my very picky 10 year old likes it.    Some of the songs on the B side don't really have lyrics as much as vocals. If you like Goldfrapp, you will like this.     You should check it out!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|Hachi: A Dog's Tale is based on a beloved true story from Japan.  Director Lasse Hallstrom has done a nice job bringing the tale to America and bringing it to life.  Richard Gere plays a professor who finds a lost Akita puppy (actually an adorable Shiba Inu, a smaller breed that the filmmakers could work with easier) at the train station and brings him home. This doesn't sit well with his wife (the always fantastic Joan Allen), for some reason, but of course she soon relents. Hachi is very devoted to his master, so much so that he meets him every evening at the station.  *Spoiler Alert* When a tragedy changes everything, the townspeople are amazed to see that Hachi continues to return every night for his master who will never return.  The film has lots of heart-breaking moments, mostly due to Hachi's lonely loyalty.  Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a warm story that will appeal to lovers of Marley & Me. Overall, thought, the film suffers from plot points that are necessary to advance the story and to follow the true events as closely as possible, but which don't ring true. In the actual tale, Hachi's owner had no family, so it was logical that no one adopted the dog after his master's death. In Hachi, however, it just feels wrong that Allen and Gere's married daughter would let Hachi run away and live on the street, so that he can keep returning to the station to look for Gere. Hallstrom works hard to justify this harsh plot development, but it doesn't make sense that Gere's daughter and wife wouldn't make sure Hachi was well taken care of.  The ending is reliably sob-inducing, though.  If you can dull your sensitivity to the story's unintentional cruelty, you'll find Hachi your new best friend.
044651652X|1.0|I read this when it first came out and everyone was talking about it.  I feel compelled to write a review now because I just came upon a list on the internet of The Worst Books Ever; in my memory, this by far is the worst book I've ever read -- a true time-waster, based on character development and likeability of main characters, writing style (horrendous), story development, emotions generated.  This book was so bad, when I got about 3/4 of the way through, I hurled the book across the room and yelled, \\"Pap!\\", then I quickly ran to see if I'd damaged the library's book I had just thrown -- and to think I had been on a waiting list to read this book.  This guy cannot write.  And as a romantic story, it's cheesey and shallow.  Other 1-star reviewers have pegged this for what makes it awful.  As for me, this is the only book I've ever had such a strongly negative reaction that I literally tossed it.  I'm pleased to see more people here voted this as a 1-star book than any other rating.  Who says modern readers can't spot pap when they read it?
0385737947|2.0|This book just didn't grab me.  Admittedly, as an adult, I'm not the target audience, but I just didn't find the main character appealing or the story engaging.  It will probably appeal to the age group and to many adults as well but I couldn't even finish it.
0486275590|4.0|This classic went to a 7-year old boy.  It is sadly not taught in many schools these days.  He loved the book, of course, and I was delighted to see this classic live another generation.
B003BZXHX8|1.0|No indication of song selection. No indication of what's on the DVD. Not much information period. Guess just supposed to buy on faith. I will probably buy but not because of Amazon's work here.
0446563048|4.0|It is very hard to decide on what star rating to give this book. The nuggets of personal stories that Tony shares along with the very power life and business lessons make it a solid 5 star story. The problem is that the above fills only about half the book. The other half is a sometimes slow detailed walk with Tony through his years from college to early Zappos. There wasn't as much content in the later years regarding Zappos and there was far too many items repeated in places. A story told once is interesting, but the second time it is included in the same book, it makes you tune out. There was also the Zappos core values that were repeated at least 5 times in the same chapter. The book is as another reviewer coined correctly, a kin to having lunch with Tony and getting him to spend it talking about his life. It jumps around without a clear time scale to follow so it won't impress common biographical readers, but I don't think that was his goal anyway.<br /><br />It is a business book with a lot of personal journey detail. Now as a business book it was a great read as it was short, full of random stories and pretty interesting to read. That being said, it is a book more about company culture than his running the company as a whole, and while I loved that aspect of it, some might not.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed the highs and so I am able to overlook the lows. I personally will get more out of this book then any other book I have read in years, but many could fail to grasp the powerful meanings that underlie the personal journey.<br /><br />My own rating: 5 Stars<br />My rating for most other folks: 3 Stars<br />so I compromised and went with 4 Stars. Had it been better edited it could have been a 5 star book for everyone.
B0033PSH4U|5.0|Fantastic!! I can't believe this movie has been around this long and I never saw it. I'm so glad I own it so I can watch it many more times over the years. Oh yeah, and the ONLY place I found it was at Amazon.com. Thank you Amazon.com I know not to look any place else when I want to purchase a DVD, especially an oldie but goodie.
B003AO1SVS|4.0|The Black Keys are often compared to The White Stripes in that they are both duos with a raw, edgy sound that is typically incredibly rhythmic yet still heavily guitar driven. However, where The White Stripes often obscure their roots and influences, The Black Keys have always remained intertwined with the blues.<br /><br />Consisting of guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney, The Black Keys released their debut album, The Big Come Up, in 2002 and quickly gained a reputation as a talented and powerful rock duo with tight mixes that evolve effortlessly.<br /><br />Producing their first four albums almost entirely on their own, The Black Keys turned to Danger Mouse for their fifth album, Attack & Release, which hit the shelves in 2008. The result was a bit of the departure from the deep rooted blues tracks of their past, but still featured the band's phenomenal songwriting talent.<br /><br />Danger Mouse didn't so much change their sound, but sanded the edges down until perfectly smooth. Attack & Release was much less in your face than their previous works and while Danger Mouse's touch gave them a much larger mainstream audience, their preexisting fans received the record with mixed reviews.<br /><br />Now, two years later, Auerbach and Carney have rediscovered the gritty punch their fifth album lacked. Although \\"Tighten Up\\" is still produced by Danger Mouse, the remainder of the release once again finds The Black Keys in complete control. Brothers opens with \\"Everlasting Light\\" which finds Auerbach singing falsetto over a heavily fuzzed guitar and a repetitive, but forceful drum beat. Simplicity once again reigns supreme and with the exception of an occasional keys part, Auerbach's guitar plays off of Carney's drumming in a sea of classic blues for fifty-five minutes.<br /><br />With the help of mixing engineer Tchad Blake, Brothers features a perfect balance between the two performers. Tracks like \\"Howlin' For You,\\" which features a very \\"Rock and Roll (Part 2)\\" drum part, are thrown out of the speakers with a clarity Gary Glitter most likely never even dreamed of [insert your best Gary Glitter dream joke here]. Even the lone cover track \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" is executed and mixed with such precision that it'd be easy to forget it isn't a Black Keys original. It's hard to put Brothers ahead of some of their earliest work, but The Black Keys have clearly taken the guess work out of their sound and fans can be thankful The Black Keys have entered a new beginning. Brothers is the best album by The Black Keys since Rubber Factory so buy with confidence and get lost in the blues.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Rose Hill Drive, The White Stripes<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Next Girl\\"e speakers with a clarity Gary Glitter most likely never even dreamed of [insert your best Gary Glitter dream joke here].

B003BKF696|5.0|So, I bought this from Target, main reason being I had forgotten the release date. So, I dropped the coin to get it expecting something that was marginally as good as boxer. I've gone through the same motions as I did with boxer on this one as well. I havent listened to anything else the past couple of days. Its in my car, on my itunes, on my iphone, ipod, and even my work computer. After all that being said, it is a more than worth follow to boxer. It does have those few songs that stick out like the pre-released blodd buzz, but the album must be digested as awhole to get the story they are telling. It's a beautifully crafted masterpiece that I have gladly added to my collection.
B002N5N5M0|4.0|I must say that Season 4 kept me riveted from beginning to end.  Michael Hall was phenomenal as usual and John Lithgow made the perfect adversary, as I had confidence that he would.  The side-stories were a little weak, but it didn't diminish the greatness of this season's series.  There were considerable twists and the viewer was often required to make several psychological sommersaults, which was a treat.  The saddest part was that the season came to a close and will be hard-pressed for a worthy encore performance.  Alas, all good things come to an end.    **** Spoiler information and Critique *****      The writers of Dexter may have painted themselves into a corner impossible to escape from.  The murder of Rita was an awful decision by the writing staff.  How could you destroy the greatest shining light in Dexter's often dark existence ?  What will you now do for a dramatic contrast to Dexter's underlying 'dark passenger' ?  I'm sure my sentiments are shared my hundreds, if not thousands of fans.
0971407614|5.0|Mark Lauren's book was insightful and introduced me to a ton of great new exercises that I can do right in my hotel room.  I travel upwards of 200 days per year, and when I'm not traveling, I am an avid stand-up paddleboard surfer, so maintaining my strength and core stability are critical.  Mark's book has plenty of exercises to do both, plus lots of great tips on nutrition and how to stay motivated.  Highly recommend!
1400052173|5.0|This is a fabulous book!  It is a blend of science, bioethics, history, human interest, and love, told through Rebecca Skloot's sharp, caring, non-judgmental voice,  and in a way I can only describe as gracious.  The story is fascinating.  The descriptions of the early years of cell research and the growth of that industry are fun to read wonderfully told.  Henrietta's life is poignantly and beautifully written.  Rebecca also lets us see the amazing and difficult journey she herself travels to write this book.  And as she becomes more and more drawn in to the Lacks family and grows to love them, we are drawn in and grow to love them as well.  This book is written combining history, current interviews and situations, Rebecca's own experiences, the experiences of the Lacks family, and the evolution of the book, in an amazingly cohesive and utterly readable format.  I found the book impossible to put down.  I think Rebecca Skloot has accomplished something truly wonderful and unique in this book, and lives will be the richer for it!
0439023491|4.0|I didn't really plan on reading Catching Fire. But my sister-in-law borrowed it from the library a while ago and asked if I wanted to borrow it. What I was currently reading wasn't really catching my interest so I thought why not? That being said, I actually really liked Catching Fire! I got a little frustrated for a while cause I couldn't figure out where this was supposed to go or be about. She's going to run away with everyone, she's going to start a rebellion, surprise! There's another game involved! I liked seeing the plot develop with the relationship that is supposed to be between Katniss and Peeta and the one that really is there. I can't help but feel a little sorry for Peeta though, he's such a great guy but Katniss is just so unsure.<br /><br />I was surprised at the speed in which the ending was wrapped up. I got to the final 40 pages or so and thought \\"how is she going to wrap this up this fast?\\" The end did feel a little rushed but overall it did work. It's setting up well for the next book in the series. And honestly, I can't wait to read it! I guess I've been converted!<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|first and FOREMOST, these are 2 SEPARATE suites & should not be listened to all at once, in order to truly experience as they were intended...why bad boy is so cheap as to not release as a 2-disc set or even as 2 separate albums is beyond me but, on to my critique:    suite II is an EFFing masterpiece...period. WORDS can't really express what i feel from the \\"overture\\" all the way to \\"mushrooms & roses.\\" i laugh, i cry, i dance, sing & SHOUT! in suite II of metropolis, janelle monáe has THE album of THE year. & if she hadn't already been nominated last year for suite I, she may have swept the grammys this year & definitely would have nabbed 'best new artist.'    suite III i treat like i treat \\"the fame monster EP...\\" something very cute & listenable but intended for re-release & deluxe edition re-packaging, ya know?    all in all, this is my favorite music purchase this year...& i am OFFICIALLY, team Monáe!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|\\"Avatar\\" is now one of my all-time favorite movies.  Yea, I know the story line has been done before...but the setting, the visual effects, and the acting make it a modern-day classic.    You won't go wrong ordering \\"Avatar\\".  The two-disc combo makes it nice to watch no matter where you are.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|Outstanding performances by all actors and an homage to Nelson Mandela who brought South Africa together through his inspirational motivation of South Africa's Springbok rugby team.  The team, once cheered on primarily by Apartheid supporters, becomes the symbol of a unified South Africa and goes on the win a championship. Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon & director/producer Clint Eastwood and a wonderful cadre of supporting actors deserve the highest accolades.  While I still don't understand rugby, I couldn't help but feeling the thrill of the game & victory. The portrayal of Mandela's wisdom is remarkable. After watching this film, one comes away understanding that the world needs leadership of Mandela's character and calibre.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I'd never thought I'd be writing a review for a Two Steps from Hell public album. I entered the trailer music scene in '08 and at that time the prospect for a possible public album was dim. How times have changed! The album itself is a collection of their most prominent tracks (at least from a public perspective). It was definitely refreshing to notice the audio quality was upped a notch due to their remastering of the tracks. \\"To Glory\\" was an unexpected and powerful surprise. I hope this project works out in the way they foresaw. Unfortunately our passion outweighs our numbers in terms of committed trailer music fans, but undoubtedly, with every Youtube user asking \\"What's that music?\\" I can finally point in them in the right direction rather than a wiki page. It would be nice to have more contributions from Pheonix for a more balanced album, but in all the album is worth its weight, and if anything the cost of the album isn't truly representative of its rather high quality.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Ok, where to start? Being an old fart, I can remember the very first Star Trek show on TV. I have always been a science fiction fan. But when I saw this first TV show. I was hooked. I have seen every TV show and Movie that has to do with Star Trek. I must admit, I was really looking forward to see, just what they were going to do with this one. I will say, I was not disappointed in any way. First let me talk about the actors. I do not know if it was left up to the actors to interpret how to act out each charter, but I must say, I think they all did a great job. I was amazed at how well bones came across. I thought I was watching a young Defrost Kelly. This actor had him pegged. Of all the actors, the only one I was a bit surprised with was Scotty. I thought he was a wee bit to light hearted in this version.  But I think these new actors were also trying to make each person, their own.  I will say, I was a bit surprised at who Spock was evolved with. Now about the story line. There are so many good things to say about it, I guess the only one I was surprised with is how Kirk ended up with the starship. Sure he got a battle field commission as second in command, as he was the best suited person, from what the captain had to pick from, but once back home, at Star fleet. He should have been relieved of his command. I mean, look at Custer. He got a battle field promotion to General, but once the war was over, he was busted back to Lt Col .The same would normally have happen to Kirk. Others have pointed this out, and I must agree with them. I mean in this version, Kirk did not even finish the academy. But like I said, there are so many good points to the story line, that this is a small problem.  And who knows that the next installment might bring, maybe they will address this problem. One thing I will say, I have a friend, who does not watch any Science Fiction at all. Has never watched any Star Trek at all. He knows the names of the charters, but never watched a whole story. He happen to come over while I was watching this, I had stopped at the point when Kirk is with the green Orion girl. That did get his interest. I started the movie up, and he sat and watched the whole thing. At the end, he asks, ARE ALL OF THE STAR TREK SHOWS LIKE THAT? I said why do you ask? He said if they are, I think I need to start watching them. I think no better praise can be given to this movie than that. I for one cannot wait for the next installment. I feel like a whole new world of Star Trek is open for exploration. I feel young again.<br />Dantory.

B0039TD7RC|4.0|Exile is a five star release, but the four stars are for the remix and the bonus tracks....<br /><br />I don't think I've awaited a Stones' release with as much enthusiasm as I did the re-release of Exile on Main Street. This is beyond my favorite Stones' album, it's my favorite recording period. The critics/fans/et al will chime in that this recording is not necessarily their best but I disagree. Everything up to this sprawling document that seamlessly blends the myriad influences with the cementing of their unique identity is the measuring stick for all that came before and after. All Rolling Stones roads lead to Main Street. Predictably, the media onslaught created from this release has brought to light all of the mythology that goes along with Exile. As has been explained countless times by all the people who were actually there (opposed to myth-making journalists and a few sycophantic Amazon reviewers stealing their most breathless clich&eacute;s), this was still a working band and all of the decadence and what-not could never have taken place to the degree of hype that surrounds the recording and still yielded any record, let alone their finest hour. There were hangers-on, dealers, and lots of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, but this is not unique to the Stones. What is unique is the method in which it was recorded; in the dank and dusty bunker-like basement. It's this decidedly unusual laboratory that made this recording so inimitable. For all the talk about why groups don't make records like this anymore, the answer lies in understanding the circumstances that begot Exile on Main Street. It isn't about junkie desperation, Nazi voodoo, or all the rest of the tabloid theories. It's about a group at the peak of their creative power, exiled to an ad hoc recording studio in the south of France during a hot and humid summer. It's about a band literally living and breathing music in the very place where they could hit \\"record\\" the precise moment their muse called.<br /><br />But enough about the past, let's focus on the present. For starters, the original has been tweaked some and the reactions are mixed. I like it and don't feel that there has been any wrongdoing. The sound is vibrant and literally screams out of your speakers. I am able to hear so much more than I was before and there is a clarity that never reduces the grungy nuance of the beloved original. If you are really happy with your version, skip straight to the reason for the buzz surrounding this re-issue, that being the newly \\"discovered\\" material. There is a degree of disingenuousness, however, as most of these songs have been updated, including new session work (supposedly with Mick Taylor, depending on who you believe; Mick or Keith) and vocals from a Jagger thirty plus years older. New stuff from the band is always welcome and indeed, some of the songs are well done, but I wonder why they didn't pull a Tattoo You and simply re-work the songs and release a separate album of new material that didn't have to be tied to Exile on Main Street? A good song is a good song no matter when it was created and since A Bigger Bang was several years ago, why not? Furthermore, no matter how much stuff is pulled from the vaults, it's still essentially \\"new\\" stuff and trying to coattail additional material on to a firmly established classic is simply wrong in my book. Better to polish those unfinished nuggets and unveil them as their own individual jewels bridging the lifetime between then and now instead of pawning them off as some dream version of the album that should have been. For better or worse, the melodies and instrumentals that spawned these new/old tracks - some of which are good and some not so much - were discarded during the making of the record and we have lived quite happily with the amazing final product for nigh on four decades, thank you very much. The new material is simply goodies for the diehards and nothing more. It seems to me that bonus material for previous releases should focus more on alternate takes and live material from that era instead of unfinished tracks the band deemed not up to par at the time, and there is plenty of the former still hiding away. Thankfully, we get a taste of the alternatives included and the most noteworthy of these chestnuts is a truly priceless spin on Soul Survivor with Keith riffing lyrics that are simultaneously hilarious and God-awful. There is also a short but totally bitchin' instrumental called Title 5 that sounds not so much like a song as just a jam moment. For my taste, these comprise the highlights of the bonus disc for me.<br /><br />Sadly, it seems that the band is content to piecemeal things over the twilight of their lives instead of compiling some big box set of material, so we have to be content with what we get, I suppose. Still, last year's Ya-Ya's update and this year's Exile all point in the right direction. Given what must assuredly exist behind the locked vault doors, the Stones will no doubt one day rival Jimi Hendrix in terms of posthumous material. It's a safe bet that long after all of us have passed on, when the keys have been handed down to the band's grandchildren and the doors finally flung wide, future generations will be hearing stuff that we could only pine for when we were alive.ould focus more on alternate takes and live material from that era instead of unfinished tracks the band deemed not up to par at the time, and there is plenty of the former still hiding away.

B001HN69AY|4.0|I watched this movie  on a flight from Japan to Hawaii.  It took a few minutes to get into the  movie and understand the point it was trying to make.  But once you got into the gropve it was really good.  Great acting by all, sad and funny, and thought provoking once you had time to digest.  I'd highly recommend for your home DVD collection.
1597801577|2.0|It was an interesting read. But what's with modern sci-fi having such an apparent agenda. I'll take a pre 1990s sci-fi over this any day. I think this crap started with the book Earth by David Brin. THEIR APPARENT AGENDA RUINS THEIR NOVELS.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|There have been way too many reviews already of this over-hyped movie. It has been criticized for deriving its plot from other movies (e.g. Dances With Wolves, The Mission, It's a Bug's Life, among others), but many great works of art have been derivative from previous works (how many times has Robin Hood been remade, for instance?). It has been criticized, too, for its banal dialog and almost complete lack of character development. Well...it does live up to that.<br /><br />Then there are the flat performances from otherwise terrific actors, phoning in their lines. But who can blame them with the lines their given? When Zoe Saldana's CGA character, for instance, in coming up with an explanation why she didn't kill Sam Worthington, says, \\"You have a strong heart,\\" she looks to the side as if embarrassed by what she's just have to read. She could just as easily have said, \\"You have a cute tail.\\"<br /><br />And finally there's the enough-already irritation everyone's felt from James Cameron's hyperbolic pimping of what was just a thumping good Saturday Matinee. He did have a great vision. If only he could have hired a good dialog writer.<br /><br />But Avatar is really breathtaking to look at. I know it's almost a kiss of death to a movie to compliment its art direction and production design, but as a moving painting it is well worth it...even in 2D. As you can listen to great music without noticing it's trite lyrics, you can also just settle in and immerse yourself in the visual \\"music\\" of this movie. Think of it as opera. Nobody ever rates La Boheme for its story, but man, that Puccini could write moving music.
1423113381|4.0|I loved The Lightning Thief, as did my 11-year-old boy bookworm, which is why I picked up The Red Pyramid. Unfortunately, the many similarities to the first in this second series make it a subspectacular (though still good) read. The Lightning Thief \\"TLT\\" is about a 12-year-old boy who turns out to be the son of a Greek god. The Red Pyramid \\"TRP\\" is about a 12-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy whose bodies act as hosts for Egyptian gods. In both, the main character or characters must learn how to harness their powers and successfully complete a quest to prevent something horrible from happening. Both end rather expectedly. Unfortunately, changes in the writing recipe don't always work. The two-children-raised-in-different-countries aspect of the story didn't make sense. Younger sister Sadie was raised in England, and is portrayed as using some British-specific words and mannerisms, while Carter traipsed all over the globe, accompanying his Egyptologist father in his work as an archaeologist. The occasional parenthesied comments provided by the non-narrating sibling were annoying. Chapter titles, though still humorous, weren't as funny as those in TLT, nor was the dialogue, save for some stuff in Chapter 26 about a character named Bloodstained Blade. Lastly, one of the best aspects of TLT is the many clues, hints and happenings that somewhat slowly lead to the eventual revelation of Percy's status as the son of a god, while in TRP, it seems like the siblings' godlingness is revealed almost immediately. I preferred the delay. Last but not least, I love an author who can significantly switch things up from series to series, as Suzanne Collins does in Gregor the Overland versus The Hunger Games. In that way, the book is a bit of a disappointment. Fortunately, this type of story, which provides tons of great information about history, is still a wonderful way for kids to learn. Also good: The Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins, Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, and A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket.A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I have always loved this trilogy. The Matrix is my favorite movie. If you don't know the plot, it can easily be found elsewhere. This is just a BD upgrade of the previously released DVD version. The set includes the three movies, The Animatrix, a digital copy of The Matrix, and all of the features included on the DVD version. The conversion to BD is nothing short of fantastic. The picture looks great and the audio is superb. This is by far the best version of The Matrix Trilogy.
B003MPH6EI|5.0|I saw the first couple of shows because a friend recommended it, and then I was hooked.  Its kind of like driving by a fatal car crash on the highway and you just have to slow down and look....no matter how bad it makes you feel.  This is a very well scripted and acted show, that constantly has you on the edge of your seat. One of the things I really appreciate is that no matter how hard these guys try to make a LOT of money fast, things always go wrong and one thing leads to another that complicates things even further.  They do not give the impression ever in this series that crime pays... instead the lives of these people and those they touch are usually destroyed. My other favorite is \\"Sons of Anarchy\\"... both are my addictions :-)
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I got to read this book when I was into a reading withdrawal, meaning I'd read just about anything... to my shock, this is excellent. I did not read the other reviews (until now) and I did not look up the author, this is the first work I've read from him, and kudos.  The book is smart, and Hilarious. I made the mistake of reading it outside the privacy of somewhere where I was alone, and found it terribly hard to not laugh.    The main character is someone whom takes you into this emotional ride, in how you feel about him, first you aren't sure if to feel bad for the guy or feel sorry for him. I even sometimes felt depressed about my own answers to the questions he asked himself, it is deep into the book where you find the answers along with him.    The supporting characters made the story, without them Colin (the main character) wouldn't be himself, and it is because of his pure sense of being that this book is so great. Read it, tell other people to read it.  There's some math in it, but if you skip it, you'll love it as much, and like myself even feel more fulfilled about the story without knowing the tedious details of the math, just as I did not google all the other historical facts in the story to verify their validity until the second time I read the book.   The book is smart.    There's some parts where it \\"lags\\" a tad, but what book doesn't? the good outdoes the bad by Miles.
0307388921|2.0|This book is definitely not for everyone to read.  It is very perverted and just wrong in so many ways.  I couldn't even finish reading this book.  I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way.  I'm really not into the dark and perverted stuff that was in this book.  If you are into stuff like this, I highly recommend it to you.
B0012GMV58|5.0|Just want to point that you're dealing here with outstanding drums and percussions. Surrounded by Areas and Peraza, Michael Shrieve is playing drums with tons of finesse. They are driving through complex changes with such smoothness. And i can't help to add that Kermode plays great piano here and there, the vocalists are top notch and if i had one thing to say about Santana's playing, is that he controls sustain on electric guitar like no one else. You also get here a guitar sustain master class for the same price. He impressed me so much. Just have a listen to the title track to see what i say, he even made me understand what this Coltrane piece is all about. This is absolute great music with a real sense of spirituality, no bubble gum stuff here, bow down...

030726999X|5.0|Along with many fans of the first two books in Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, I have awaited the final book in the series with a bit of trepidation. Would there be another cliffhanger, like the one that ended the second book, The Girl Who Played With Fire? Would questions be left unanswered, loose ends dangling, never to be tied up? Would we ever know why Lisbeth Salander has such a fondness for those frozen pizzas?<br /><br />Well, fear not. The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest is a very worthy successor to the previous two books, and oddly, since he had no idea it would be his last book, a very good conclusion to the story of Lisbeth and Mikael Blomkvist, with perhaps one of the most unique and intriguing characters an author has ever created.<br />Yes, really these books are all about Lizbeth Salander.<br /><br />In the first book we were introduced to her. Small, slight, often mistaken for a teenager, with dyed black hair and multiple piercings..and of course that tattoo. She lives almost completely off the grid, is extremely anti-social, but also extremely intelligent, with a photographic memory, unsurpassed in her computer skills, making her living..and seeking her revenge...largely through her hacking skills. Oh yes, she is a young woman who has been terribly wronged and abused, as we learn in the second book, and she is after those responsible.<br /><br />We left her at the end of that book with a bullet in her head and buried alive, at the hands of the evil Alexander Zalachenko, who himself ended up with an axe in his face. Well, while not giving away too much, they both survived, gravely wounded. But that is not Lizbeth's only problem. She is still considered to be responsible for three murders and the assault on Zalachenko, and if some very powerful people at the very heart of the Swedish government have their way, she will never be free to tell her story. In fact, they might prefer if she just disappeared completely.<br /><br />In these three books we have seen Nazis and serial killers, corporate corruption and secret government plots, any number of confusing Swedish names that might make you think it is just a bit too over the top. And yet, somehow Larsson makes it all work and has been able to keep us on the edge of our seats, keep us turning those pages and rewarding us with a great tale. Happily in this volume, he created another great chapter in Lizbeth's story, with a quite satisfying ending.<br />A very highly recommended book in a very highly recommended series.rs, corporate corruption and secret government plots, any number of confusing Swedish names that might make you think it is just a bit too over the top.

B001BMXFX0|5.0|If you're looking for a gut-wrenching imaginative novel to make time fly, Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones is a must read.  Sebold first hooks you with the gruesome description of Susie Salmon's rape and murder. Throughout the book, Sebold mixes the views of the living with Susie's view from \\"her heaven\\". My favorite parts in the novel are those from which Susie explains her heaven. It is distant but at the same time realistic, and leaves readers wondering what heaven may truly be like. Because the novel is written from Susie's point of view, the reader experiences the emotions felt by the victim as she watches, hoping, that someday her murderer will be found out.    Sebold's use of simple language makes the book enjoyable because it's easy to understand, but is descriptive enough to engage the reader and allows them to visualize what is taking place. My favorite part of the novel, besides Susie's description of \\"her heaven\\", is when Lindsey sneaks into Mr. Harvey's house because it literally has you sitting on the edge of your seat in suspense. You are able to see from Susie's eyes what is taking place, which only adds to the suspense. Although the middle of the book begins to lag, it is necessary for a full understanding and without it the end of the novel would be confusing.    If you've seen the movie of this book and enjoyed it- YOU HAVE TO READ THE BOOK because it's 100 times better. If you haven't seen the movie and read the book, don't, because you will be greatly disappointed. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an enthralling novel with a heart wrenching plot and language simple enough for a middle school student to read.    written by: AROWDON
0743454537|4.0|This novel is a good one.  It is way better than the movie.  The book goes a lot more into detail about things that happen than the movie does.  It is very sad, and addicting to read.

B0039TD7RC|3.0|Well, hard core Stones fans, the time has finally come....our long lost ship is in sight and coming in to port.     My feeling is summed up in the lyric from 'I'm Not Signifying': \\"Have you have ever had the feeling, baby, that you've been here before?\\"    After decades of holding off on releasing the endless hours of (officially) unreleased live recordings, film, studio outtakes, demos of songs that were forgotten, left unfinished, or didn't quite make the cut, that brilliant marketing / money maximizing tactician Jagger has decided it is time to keep the cash flow up by resorting to the bottomless ocean of their legacy rather than keep trying to flog new material.    It must also be kept in mind that Jagger and Richard have never cared less about what anyone thinks of them, their music, or their methods for building their legendary public image or musical reputation. As far back as 'Get Yer Ya Yas Out'...despite being at the peak of their ripeness as artists and players...they had no problem at all with erasing elements of the actual live performance and replacing them with well rehearsed, 're-take until it's perfect' overdubbed guitars and vocals. In other words the 'In Concert' subtitle is largely a big, fat, scam (particularly in that the main components...vocal and guitars...of what makes that album so spectacular are completely 'fake'. An outrage to purists and idealists, but a blessing to people (like me) who simply love the music...alot better than I would've if they'd kept Jagger's comparatively tired, lazy original vocal on (for example) 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' from New York on November 28th.    They knew, even then, it's about the sound and the fostering of myth...nothing more, nothing less.     Don't get me wrong...I have been in love with the Stones sound, image, and mystique since I first heard Satisfaction at the age of 11 or 12. With my first acquisition (Hot Rocks) I had similar immediate love for 'Street Fighting Man', 'Get Off My Cloud', 'Paint It,Black'. I still buy everything new they put out the day it is released, and am 100% behind the sentiment that...after almost 50 (FIFTY!) years together...they are only now fulfilling the obsession they originally sought as 19 year blues, R&B, and Chuck Berry freaks: to be like their idols who, at that same time, were all the age they are now. Their latest music has fabulous moments, and such a rich legacy of so many thoroughly assimilated styles emerging that I doubt they are even conscious of where all the hybrid sounds and slightly re-arranged licks come from.    So keep the soul alive Keith...you are still the essence of rock music as much as you ever were...and keep the cleverly metered out flow of archived treasures coming Mick...please!    All that having been mad clear, let's take an informed, unjaundiced and objective look at the 'new' Exile and it's 'bonus tracks':    I was immediately reminded of 1981's 'Tattoo You' in concept (albeit not in sound). While the intention here is openly acknowledged as being the revelation of music from the Exile era, with it's sublime spirit and archetypal Stones sound, the result comes across more like the lazy 'new album' in 1981 (which was simply a collection of patched up, repaired or completed demos from various sessions dating as far back as 1972). Any fan worth his salt knows this is true of ALOT of the Stones work: tunes recorded in the marathon 1977-78 'Some Girls' sessions in Paris often weren't squeezed on to a released album or b-side until years later (ie. 'So Young' didn't see the light of day until 1994).    While I'm sure, as claimed, titles and Exile-esque lyrical idioms were in place already when these cannisters were dusted off for review, the (at least partially) posthumously completed prose does sound somewhat squeezed into the cleaned up instrumental tracks occasionally. But the big problem I have is the obvious difference between Jagger's raw but ferocious 1972 vocal sound (Exile and Fingers particularly) versus his modern, technically broader but worn, comparatively uninspired sound. Listen to the climaxes of recordings like 'Moonlight Mile' and 'Bitch'...or 'Rip this Joint' in it's entirety...then to the more energetic moments of 'Plundered My Soul' and imagine if the '72 Jagger had sung them.     It's like the difference between the honesty and raw emotion of the original 'Wild Horses' versus the bland 1995 unplugged remake / re-issue. 'So Divine' is interesting, but clearly a melody being developed via jam (bootlegged hundreds of times as an instrumental track) with a vocal squeezed in to make a song out of it. It should be noted, however, that Lisa Fischer and cohorts do an admirable job creating the backing vocal ambience that Clydie King, Vanetta and others achieved in the original sessions.     Still...as an irrepressible fan / afficianado...I would much rather have these new, albeit crippled and somewaht hollow, insights into the band than not. No question. Now on to the good stuff.    The outtakes, and a couple of the demos that sound like they have the original vocals left intact, are tremendous and worth the price of the deluxe version alone. While I can't quite tell if the vocal has been replaced (a credit to Jagger if it was), I was delighted to hear a cleaned up, high resolution verson of 'I'm Not Signifying' (titled 'I'm Not Lying' on bootlegs for decades).  The rough demo of 'Loving Cup' (which may date back to '68-'69 when it was first written, and was also played at Hyde Park in '69) is a pleasure and enhances one's appreciation of one of the most beautiful tunes on Exile. 'Good Time Women'...the original working title that evolved into 'Tumbling Dice' has also been around for ages, but never with this clarity of recording (and the almost ad lib lead vocal is almost certainly original).    'Title 5' is pointless but, why not? If nothing else it satisfies that they have scraped the barrel bottom and given us the best of what was left over. There's lots of demos and outtakes available on bootlegs, so bless their hearts for confining this to retreads and mostly new, unheard material.     The absolute high point of the entire package for me, however, was hearing Richards' take the lead vocal on an early demo of 'Soul Survivor'. Fabulous.    The DVD is a very abridged sampler of the coming (in June) 'Stones in Exile' documentary which will be great. Hopefully the long overdue release of 'Ladies and Gentlemen' next fall will be better restored than it is here (though, again, it's great to see / hear versions of Happy and ADTL that are neverthless infinitely better than what's been circulating on bootleg DVD and on YouTube for years...really looking forward to that, and hopefully they'll release it as a CD as well). Finally, it was amazing to see some of the more comprehensible sections of CS Blues in such higher (albeit still pretty shoddy) quality than what's been circulating for years in the underground (Richards', in 1983, characterized even his copy as being like somewhat like watching a multi generation copy of 'Birth of a Nation').     The big disappointment for me was the exclusion of the alternate, very different acoustic version of 'All Down the Line', which is so stunningly cool...and gentle compared to the single / LP version...that it's exclusion is an absolutely confounding oversight. Oh well...maybe it was recorded for 'Fingers' and will make it on to that deluxe version.    Anyway I hope this is a portent for Goat's head Soup with 'Save Me' / 'Criss Cross', 'It's Only Rock and Roll' with their coveres of 'Shame, Shame, Shame' and 'Drift Away'...or maybe the original version of 'Lonely at the Top' (which didn't make it to completion and release until 'She's the Boss' in 1985! Hey Mick! How about releasing 'Claudine'? She wouldn't sue you at this point, would she? The statute of limitations will protect her lying ass from the damning expose that song was! How about the 'Hound Dog' homage to the then recently snuffed it Elvis from Memphis 1978? The Ian Stewart Memorial gig? Video of the 1977 El Mocambo gigs? C'mon! We made you rich and famous by appreciating you and your childhood buddy's tremendous talents and artistic sensibilities...time to give a little back!    The list of unreleased Stones treasures...circulating and merely mythological...is endless, but for what it's worth my all time Holy Grail / number one request would be a clean, soundboard recording of 'Roll Over Beethoven' from the 1970 European Tour. They have never done anything like it, before or since, but the only thus far available documents were all recorded on vintage 1970 handheld tape recorders.    Finally, may I also suggest a return to your original 1964 concept...do an album of cover versions! Always your celebrated forte!    Anyway here's to many more years fellows, and keep prying open those vaults!
0553381695|2.0|This book is pretty much a straight continuation of the first book. The annoying things are still annoying, and the good stuff is still entertaining. It is a bit raunchier than the last book, but not a big deal.    Spoilers below...you have been warned.    I am better than 3/4s through this book and am really just tired of it. The main plot arc is pretty cool, but the really dumb things that happened towards the end of the first book, and were cropping up in this book, have just gotten to be too much. To spell it out: the red woman birthed Stannis's shadow demon?! really? that's how you decide to deal with getting him more involved in the story?!!? This may be my last GRRM book. I have taken to completely skipping the \\"Dany\\" chapters. They are excruciating. Bran is not much better. What the hell is even happening in the Jon chapters?! The only interesting chapters anymore are the Tyrion ones (maybe Catelyn, but to be honest they are stupid as well...all she does is cry about her sons). Ugh... I am not to the point where I am not going to finish this book...but if Bran becomes a friggin' direwolf for real I am done.    It's pretty crazy how quickly this series has gone downhill.  I will certainly be spending my leisure reading hours with other authors going forward.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's \\"North and South\\" is beautifully done.  I enjoyed it more than the actual book.  The movie does not completely follow the book, but the things they changed made it better.  It's a classic favorite like A&E's Pride and Prejudice.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I bought this disc after seeing the trailer on the hsm dvd. The trailer pretty much has the feel of the movie. I am glad that Amazon.com put clips on its website because that pretty much sealed the deal for me. Yes there are slap-stick moments, but it never gets down to Home Alone slap-stick, which I am greatful for.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I spent a few hundred dollars on this set and it says on the packaging items it contains .. and it does not ... the disc have cheap plastic to supposedly protect them in shipping but half of them don't play.  Then, if you get them to actually play on some systems they play one day and not the next.  I tried 3 differnt systems before I now finally broke down and bought a second copy.  Don't buy the green set.<br /><br />These are inferior copies and while they may show a logo I do not believe them to be real.  If they are real, paramount owes me several hundred dollars and or a new set of discs in return.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS .. you will be disappointed.
B001PB3RU8|3.0|The lead singer's voice is amazing but some of the lyrics are definitely lacking.  Yes, she's young but I don't know that that excuses her seeming advocacy of spousal abuse in \\"Kiss with a Fist\\" or the bizarreness of \\"Girl with one Eye.\\"  Still, the vocals are spirited and the percussion contagious.

B001OQCV2O|2.0|Woody Harrelson's character is an annoying distraction.  I get the character's role...he is just the wrong guy for the job.  I cringed every scene he was in.  They should have cut the special effects budget and dropped some cash to get Gary Busey.<br /><br />It just starts there folks.  This movie is a joke.<br /><br />The scientist no one will listen to who knows the world is ending has been done to DEATH...the relationship between John Cusack's character and his ex-wife is stupid and predictable from the opening credits...the Russian billionaire with brat kids who wins us over in the end is some of the worst acting since, well, Woddy Harrelson in the scene right before it.<br /><br />Another bad decision was selecting John Cusack as the lead character.  There are a lot of movies I would go see him in, but this is not a good fit. Has he ever played a role where he isn't a writer?<br /><br />The disaster scenes are too far over the edge of believablity...even for a disaster movie.  So far over the edge you find yourself distracted by it throghout the disaster scenes.  Special effects should improve the look of the scenes, not create new and exciting laws of physics.  Even the easy stuff is exagerrated.  I like how Woody Harrelson's RV radio signal can be heard 1000 miles away while the Earth is falling apart.<br /><br />I can't quite put my finger on it but there is some kind of anti US undertone in there somewhere.  That is more and more and more common it seems.  Especially when the world is coming to an end.<br /><br />Don't buy it.  Rent it...then scratch it so no other lives are destoyed by it's badness.
0345350499|5.0|This book was an amazing read. It spans a long length of time without being slow going and was incredibly in depth with the characters and story. Not only was it a wonderful story and superbly written, but the characters often discuss subjects such as religious diversity with insights that provoke thought while reading. I didn't know much about the Arthurian legends before I began reading, so I don't know how closely it follows or doesn't follow any established understandings of the characters. Also, I didn't realize how long it was; I was very glad that it was though, because I was disappointed when it ended.

B00362DRQS|3.0|Just an early review on the 2010 remastered version of S.A.T.R.T.  I had been looking forward to this for quite a while, but when I popped the CD in, I was less than impressed.  My first thought was, Where did the snare go?  I was hoping for this album to have a real kick, but I'm afraid it did quite the opposite.  Like lots of newly remastered albums, this one suffers from severe over compression,  which equals everything losing a punch and a squashed dynamic range.  I have not looked at the waveforms to support this claim, but I know what I hear.  I compared it to the old CD version to make sure my ears weren't decieving me, but they were not.  The old version has a nice loud snare that sounds like a snare and not a tambourine (you'll hear what I mean).  It also had soft parts and loud parts.  The new remaster sounds kind of the same all the time.  Not loud, not quiet, just the same volume throughout.  It almost sounds like a third generation cassette copy you would make back in the day (remember those?).  There is sort of a hiss that is present on top of the music.  Normally this is the trait of a bad remastering job, which I'm sad to say might be the case here.  You might find it to be ok, so don't let me stop you from buying this.  This is just one man's opinion, but if you compare the new with the old, I think you will agree that this new one lacks balls.    As far as the packaging, it looks great.  There's tons of B-sides,etc.  I'm not the most diehardd DD fan, so I'm not sure if they missed a 12\\" version here or there, I'm sure others will be able to report if there is a rare version that was not included here, I really don't know.  I haven't had a chance to look at the DVD yet, so I can't comment there.  But I am familiar with the original CD release, and the verdict I'm afraid, is that overall this is NOT an improvement.   I really wanted it to be, but it just isn't.  It might still be worth it to pick up, due to the DVD and the bounus tracks, I'm not saying it isn't worth it for those reasons, but if you're main reason for picking this up is to get a great sounding remaster of a this great album, then stick with the old CD, which in comparison, sounds pretty good.

Something I can share with my kids--a toy for kids, but with the realism that I appreciate.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I pre-ordered the movie and it arrived on the day that it was released in stores. I thought that was great. The blu-ray is fantastic, and even without the 3D this movie looks amazing on an HDTV.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|This is a great album, I liked the cover song, Need You Know, so that's the #1 reason for my purchase but, after listening to the entire album it was a \\"BEST BUY\\" all the songs on this album are great. The rest of the ablum is being played on the radio so there are many great songs to choose from.   I would purchase this CD for a friend or family it is that good. This group will go far in country music they have that upbeat sound with a country flair. Love it! Even if you are not a big country song fan you will love this album, thier sound is so down to earth and in touch with many people that love the middle of the road new country.
1579128149|5.0|This is truly an awesome book.  The photos are strikingly gorgeous, and the text draws you in, giving each element its own personality.  As a chemist, I was sure I would like it, but even I was blown away.  My brother-in-law, who bought it for me as a gift, is a decided non-scientist.  He actually took it back so he could read it.  Everyone should read this book, just to develop an appreciation for the basic building blocks of life, the universe, and everything.
B0026P3G12|4.0|For this unknown lady to brave the stage at a singing contest and blowing the roof off the place I just new I wanted to hear more from this powerful voice from this shy Brit.  I'm so glad I purchased this album I thought I Dreamed A Dream was great you should hear her sing Wild Horses...Wow what a great album. Every song on the album are orighinal old favorites but with the Susan Boyle twist.  I look forward to seeing more CD's from this wonderful artist.
B001RTSPVY|2.0|I dunno what show you people are reviewing, but it is obviously Season 1 (brilliant masterpiece), and not Season 2 (tepid cliche) of \\"Breaking Bad.\\"    The character development, dark humor, nail-biting suspense, and ingenious plot devices... all gone, replaced by an endless segue from \\"soap drama moment to soap drama moment.\\" Look at the actors, they -know- it's dreck they are phoning in. Tell me you can't see it in almost every scene.    Completely extraneous subplots are introduced (Skyler's work flirtation, ill-fated romance between Jesse and \\"OD waiting to happen\\" girl) that add -nothing- to the basic premises developed so well in Season 1 other than perhaps to appeal to the teenaged female vampire melodrama set. In fact, the gripping, absurdly believable \\"dying chemistry teacher meth cook\\" premise is all but back-burnered while we get to watch \\"touching\\" scenes of Sonograms, young flirtation and love, endless cancer conferences (yay! feelgood moment!), and endlessly verbose hyper-dialogue drama moments one can almost hear an \\"awww!\\" \\"booo!\\" or \\"tada!\\" after.    To add insult to injury whoever wrote this mess decided that a highly coincidental plane crash needed to be added in as opposed to developing the very solid core concepts Season 1 was laden with. They could have put this show on auto-pilot by continuing awesome themes from Season 1 (boorishness of the bro in law, kleptomania of the sis in law, interaction with students in class v meth cook, ballsy use of dark side MacGuyver type tech to screw a-holes over... all interesting and smart, all tossed away inexplicably in favor of pure formulaic dreck).     Instead they neutered a masterpiece and drained every loving ounce of testosterone out of the show. Don't be fooled by viral marketing shills posting \\"objective\\" reviews here, three stars is a stretch for this tedious snooze, I gave it two because it is so very obvious that many of the fives are shall we say \\"bought and sold.\\"
B0036B8MZU|5.0|I felt compelled to give my review in contrast to some of those I have been reading saying this series is aimed at a male demographic.  I am educated, gainfully employed, well read, happily married and middle aged.  I love everything about Spartacus.  I think the problem is that some people go into it with specific expectations.  Start watching with an open mind.  As film art, it is absolutely beautiful.  Some of the visuals are obvious CGIs and in my opinion they were done to enhance the visual experience and it works.  I think the director is presenting it as his vision to us.  For a television series its stunning to watch.   As a story, it is riveting.  They have done a great job baiting the viewer and building interest and depth in the plot.  You become fully vested in the characters without even realizing it.  There is a natural continuity through it without becoming predictable.  So much going on, even the side plots are interesting.  As history, it is what it is.  A fictional story based on facts.  I know watching this sort of historical saga always piques my interest in true history and I research. Some people get all up in arms about how it really was.  I find the way a writer or director fills in the gaps or interprets history interesting and accept it for what it is.    Frankly, this bloody, dirty, depiction of that era is far more believable then some Disneyfied version.  (Don't attack.  I'm a big Disney fan as well)  As far as the actors and acting is concerned, kudos all around.  Lucy Lawless is the big name draw and she is amazing.  But equally good is about everyone else in the film whether you like their characters or not, the acting is all top notch.  The costuming and even the lack thereof, is beautiful without detracting from the show as a whole.  I wouldn't be surprised to see an award nod to the costume designer at some point.  All in all I have found this one of the most worthwhile and entertaining things I have put my time into to date.  Willeveryone like?  Of course not, for various reasons, just like everything.  I just hope they keep making it.  On that note, all the wishes and good thoughts to Andy Whitfield for his improved health.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|\\"Let The Right One In\\" has become a very popular Swedish cult film based on a vampire novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Tomas Alfredson did a fairly good job of directing. After reviewing some clips on line I was intrigued enough to buy the DVD. I should know by now the promo clips are always much better than the actual movie.     \\"Let The Right One In\\" is a bit of a twist on the usual vampire genre. I wouldn't say the movie breaks new ground though. Boy befriends female vampire. Boy is threatened by bullies. Vampire friend protects boy. Boy and vampire live happily ever after. For me the movie was interesting enough to make the experience pleasantly entertaining. I enjoyed this cult film much more than your typical big production Tom Cruise cookie cutter film.    I wouldn't give the film 5 stars though. Even 4 stars is a stretch. The film has some minor continuity errors that don't amount to much. It's hard to tell if twelve year old Kafayre Hedebrant, the leading \\"man\\", is really acting or just being a 12 year old boy having a good time on set. Lina Leandersson does a respectable job in the vampire role. The chemistry between these two actors does come through on film. It's that chemistry between twelve year olds that makes this movie memorable.
193413712X|5.0|Harding's poetic, short novel gives us a glimpse into the soul of a dying man and touches the reader with its story of life and loss.  An enduring work, it is timeless and classic in its appeal.
0679411585|5.0|This record of the savage Ia Drang Valley battle in Vietnam is a gripping story of courage and heroism. The extreme bravery of the officers, NCOs and enlisted men make you proud to be an American. The history of these courageous men is drawn magnificently by Hal Moore and Joe Galloway.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is definitely Avenged Sevenfold's best album. It's still one of my top albums ever. Amazing vocals, killer guitar solos, intense drumming, everything. For anyone looking to get into A7X, I'd say this is where to start. It's sad how this album and STST are overlooked because they came out before A7X got popular. There's not a bad track on this cd, and \\"I Won't See You Tonight Pt. 1\\" is bound to send shivers down your spine.
0307269752|4.0|I have had this book in my \\"to be read\\" pile for well over a year. With the hype now coming out about the movie, I finally decided it was time to pick it up.<br /><br />Mysteries are my favorite genre, and this is a very well done mystery with a dash of social commentary - no surprise when you read the author's mini-bio. There are actually three mysteries in one, here - the hero's stated purpose of figuring out a cold-case murder for an eccentric, elderly man, but then you realize that there is a also a mystery to be solved about why she was murdered, and finally there was also the mystery of what was really going on in Blomkvist's investigative journalism case that kicks off the novel.<br /><br />I like this - plenty of different thought processes and investigative techniques keep the book interesting. However, I felt that the 2nd mystery - the \\"why\\" of the murdered girl - was solved a bit too early in the novel. The rest of the story seemed to drag a bit from there on out. I saw the \\"first mystery\\" solution coming from a mile away, and the third - which more or less winds up taking the climax role - is not as interesting to me, though I enjoyed the denouement.<br /><br />I liked the flawed characters, and I liked that the author didn't take the easy way out by making everything turn out perfectly for them. I enjoyed the new to me setting in Sweden, though I do feel like I'm probably missing nuances by not being familiar with the locale. I'm sure the neighborhoods in Stockholm mean something, and then there are passages like, \\"You're heading out to Uddsk (not the right name, but the book isn't in reach) for a year.\\" \\"Not Uddsk, it's just Hedestad.\\" \\"Well, it might as well be Uddsk.\\" No context for me there - I can figure out, of course, that Uddsk must be the middle of nowhere, but it was somewhat disconcerting to feel so lost within the cultural references. Still, the settings were very well drawn and easy to picture.<br /><br />This was not a particularly fast-moving novel for me (partially, no doubt, because of the disappointment I felt with the too-early revelations) but I did very much want to find out what happened and stayed up late in the end to finish it. I will be reading the second in the series, as I feel attached to the characters and want to see what happens next. The writing is very well done - I recommend this as a \\"thinking person's mystery\\" as there is a lot more going on than just a standard whodunnit.no doubt, because of the disappointment I felt with the too-early revelations) but I did very much want to find out what happened and stayed up late in the end to finish it.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|When this album first came out, I wasn't too crazy about it since it didnt sound like the Avenged that I was used to with WTF and STST, but after listening to it many times, it really grew on me, and I realized how deep of an album it is. I love the orchestral bits in \\"The Wicked End\\" and the guitar solo in \\"Sidewinder.\\" Watch a video of \\"The Wicked End,\\" live, and youll get a feel of how deep these songs are. \\"Bat Country\\" has been a bit overplayed, thought its still a good song, its not the best representation of this album as a whole. Give it a listen and if you dont like it the first time, give it some time and try it again, I think itll grow on ya if you dont love it right away.
0140277447|5.0|I put off reading this book for over a decade because I didn't want to wince over the gory details or find myself hating Japanese people. My only regret now is not having read this before Iris Chang passed. What an amazing writer and I wished I could have met her at some public speaking event. Anyhow, it's a good thing these events occurred such a long time ago during my grandfather's generation as opposed to mine. I bet it's really tough for anyone who lived through the time to get over the atrocities depicted in the book. The storytelling is fabulous. You get the entertainment value of a novel together with the intellectual satisfaction of a history lesson.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Enough reviews have been written about AVATAR the movie.  My five star rating says enough. What impressed me was the fine service from Amazon.com.  I received the two disc blu-ray combo movie within 48 hours after I ordered.  The price was competitive and then unexpectedly Amazon sent me a credit because of fierce competition regarding the movie.  Great movie and great company.
0684857219|5.0|This book is great for all bodybuilders from beginners to advanced. I must say that before you start any of his programs you must read every detail of this book. You will get great results if you do what he says. You have to eat right to train right. With that being said you should take the basic supplements, Multi vitamin, protein (the number of grams of protein you ingest should equal your body weight in lbs), and Creatine. When you start this if you are a beginner and have never lifted you are going to be very sore due to the fact you have never lifted before, this is common and not a big deal. As you continue to workout your body gets use to the stress and recovers faster and faster. You do not need steroids, Arnold didn't use roids when he was 15-19 and look at him. He ate right and trained hard It's also a big mental game. I'm  tired of reading these comments from these so called bodybuilders that didn't get results. I bet if I worked out with you I'd be depressed due to your lack of effort and execution. Not every damn bodybuilder used roids either, look at the first chapter of the first bodybuilders I imagine they are larger than all you people who rated this one star, and they didn't take roids. Quit being a pussy and work your ass off. This book is a great foundation for any bodybuilder. Read it, live it, love it, worship it!    You so called natural bodybuilders with no supplements, don't eat right. That is your biggest problem, that and complaining to much. Eat 4000cal a day if you have to.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I enjoyed the movie at the theater in 3D.  I didn't think I'd like it unless it was in 3D but this movie on blu-ray on my TV is a visual overload.  This is my reference movie when I'm showing off blu-ray to people who haven't seen its benefits.

B00000DHTF|4.0|This package shows that Springsteen could have spent much of his career releasing double albums, with no loss of quality. There are tunes from the vault that others would release as their best singles. Some really great gems here.    Still, no original \\"The Promise,\\" no \\"Because the Night,\\" no \\"The Fever,\\" and no \\"Protection\\" bring down the grade a bit.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Mature, poetic, adventuresome, mindful. Ms Merchant is a wonderful companion - you should go with her.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|Unlike many of the one star reviews - that were posted before the show first aired on March 21st (either they are mediums or just wanted to voice their dislike with Oprah rather than basing the review on facts) - my partner and I have watched almost all of the series.  Although I am very knowledgeable about the animal kingdom, I found that I learned a great deal during each show. The footage is amazing, the behaviors and scenes captured were one-of-a-kind, and Oprah's narration was wonderful.  We like David Attenborough as well, but really enjoyed Oprah's narration and are purchasing this version as a result.  Be sure to buy the Blu-ray, if you have a player, to watch the spectacular footage at its best!    Don't fall into the trap of listening to people who are hateful for no reason and spouted off their displeasure before broadcasting started.  Even if, after they got to finally watch the show, they did not like the Oprah narration as much; I cannot believe it would justify a one star rating for this remarkable series.

030745455X|5.0|The cold blooded murders of a journalist and a scholar, who were about to publish a shocking expose on the sex trade in Sweden, are blamed on bad girl Lisbeth Salander. Salander's life has been far from normal, continually victimized as she has been since early childhood, at the hands of both family and state. Now she's a brilliant but psychologically damaged young woman, one who can solve Fermat's mathematical theorem or hack into any computer system, but she is truly incapable of connecting with people. Salander emerges as a hybrid of James Bond and Dirty Harry.<br /><br />The murder investigation plays out in several arenas, as the police, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and Salander herself are working independently to track down the true perpetrators of the crime. Author Larsson does a fantastic job with plot and characters, and while Salander is a veritable sociopath, as her background unfolds, it's possible to understand her paranoia and violence. Several of her antagonists are memorable for their physical characteristics and their horrific deeds. True, there are many over-the-top sequences in this thriller, but as in the case of James Bond, the reader is willing to sacrifice a modicum of reality for the thrill of the chase. The Girl Who Played with Fire takes on repulsive villains and appalling moral issues with intelligence and aplomb, never failing to engross and entertain. Highly recommended.
0307269981|5.0|This second in a trilogy, is as well plotted, well written as the first book, The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo. I won't give a synopsis, because so many reviewers have already, and probably much better than I could have. Although some reviewers have complained, very mildly, that this book is not quite up to the standard of the first one, I liked it better. It delves more deeply into Salander's past and in my opinion fleshes her more completely and also in my opinion, she is a fascinating character. I highly recomend this book and am really looking forward to the next one.
B003JH0LSW|3.0|Before you read any further, this is just a review of the Deluxe Edition of \\"Infinite Arms\\" and all that comes with it.  It is NOT a review of the album itself.      Being a big Band of Horses fan I decided to get the Deluxe Edition of the album instead of just getting it on vinyl.  I got it directly from the record label and thus saved over twenty percent off Amazon's price (which I find shocking).  So it didn't cost much more than the vinyl addition, plus I knew I'd get the digital download and the disc.  I really was interested in Christopher Wilson's photography though as well as the packaging.      Well what you see in the picture is exactly what you get.  I wouldn't say this is a bad thing, but it's not a great thing either.  Before I go any further though, I simply order the CD version from Amazon before I ordered this.  Now the CD version comes in one of those cardboard cases which I actually prefer to the plastic CD cases. It sort of tri-folds out. The outer parts of this tri-fold have the cover, a track listing on the back and just a plain photo on the third part. All of the photos are that starry sky picture from Christopher Wilson. The inner part of the tri-fold is this brilliant late afternoon grey sky over some mountains and pine trees evidently taken out West. Of course the disc just slides out of one side of the packaging. The real treat though slides out of the other side. You get twelve photo cars of Christopher Wilson's photography, each one for a particular track. Then on the back of those slides it says the song track, gives a lyric or twenty and lists who contributed what in terms of vocals and instrumentation. The final slide has a black and white photo montage of the band members with the back having the liner notes. All in all a really great collection for a CD.    Now the Deluxe Edition is a bit better and a bit worse.  It comes in a 12\\" vinyl size box.  The box is decorated with the album cover photography.  Inside is a twelve in bi-fold vinyl like cardboard case with photography that isn't included anywhere in the CD I mentioned above or in the vinyl addition.  You open it up to find the disc on the left that slots nicely into a little slit.  Howver the disc is only in a little cardboard case which isn't as nice as the one that comes with the regular CD edition.  To the right you have a bigger slit that houses Christopher Wilson's photographer.  I'm not photographer, but these appear to be actual photos on photo paper.  They vary in size, but they're all pretty good sized photos.  They're really great though and feel really nice.  My gripe would be that the slit tore on the sides a bit due to the photos bulging it out.  Also included in this edition is the album on vinyl.  The vinyl edition was also a bit disappointing compared to the CD edition.  You don't get the separate photo slide cards.  Instead you get a glossy paper piece which has all the photo cards photos on it with the tracks listed as they are on the back of the photo slide cards.  You also get the little digital download card.  Finally you get a poster with another of Christopher Wilson's fine photographs.      Overall I gave this 3.5 stars for the entire package and how much it costs.  If you love Christoper Wilson's photography, get it.  If you don't, I'd recommend buying the CD and Vinyl separately.  My suggestion to the folks who put this package together would be to make it a bit more worthwhile for the price.  If you're going to include the disc then you may as well include the regular CD version.  With the vinyl version you should include more actual photo slide cards.  Maybe also include a replica of a gig poster instead of the generic band poster.  Or instead of the generic poster just include more photos from Christopher Wilson.     3.5 stars for this edition  5 stars for the included Christopher Wilson photography

0307463745|3.0|The Twitterverse was abuzz when 37Signals released their Rework book (complete with availability from Amazon.com, and even in the Kindle format). At first I refrained from listening to any hype; but with a quick glance at the back matter, I found myself a button click away from immediate Kindle satisfaction. Topics like \\"meetings are toxic\\" and \\"planning is guessing\\" hit pretty close to home with my previous job at Travel Tribe... so I clicked the button.<br /><br />I had actually owned 37Signals' previous book (Getting Real) for some time, but failed to crack open the PDF. With some spare time on my hands this go-round, I started to read through Rework on my PC before wrapping it up on my Kindle.<br /><br />Rework is a culmination of good, bad and ugly. It's not really a book. It's a collection of inspiring essays with the 37Signals team talking at you. The book is an extremely quick read filled with opinionated business talk, but most of it is well informed and very pragmatic. Many of the tenets are things that I've just been discovering just recently.<br /><br />Rework goes against the grain because the quality of writing is intentionally poor. It's not that the ideas are unclear. It's that the book wasn't written to be a business book that tops any charts. It's written as if spoken. It's written clearly and directly - straight to the point - and doesn't let business manual fluff (or proper writing style) get in the way.<br /><br />As a book of axioms, Rework hits a ground rule double. It might not score you any runs initially, but it'll at least advance the runners. It's up to your own hard work to bring them home.<br /><br />After reading Rework, I decided I liked it enough to finally give Getting Real a try. This was my mistake. As it turns out Rework is just Getting Real minus a few chapters, minus all the quotes, and rewritten so as to speak more directly in its prose. Rework is essentially a \\"reworked\\" Getting Real. This was disappointing to find out. I was able to glean a few pearls from the dropped material between the reissue, but for the most part, I was just reading something that had already been out for a while.<br /><br />Say what you want about 37Signals, but they've been able to build a successful business using their philosophy (which is found in these books). There is certainly a lot of \\"I wish we did things that way\\" in these books. Well, 37Signals has done it that way, and they've been very successful with their products, while Ruby on Rails has helped turn them into the golden children of web 2.0 programming. I recommend you forget about Getting Real and instead take an evening to read through Rework. If anything it's a fun look at what a successful small business thinks makes a successful small business philosophy.pped material between the reissue, but for the most part, I was just reading something that had already been out for a while.

0810988232|5.0|I was a little reserved when I heard that there was going to be another Deck released by the Froud family but I am so glad that they released it. I really want them to turn their Runes book into a deck as well, (wink,wink) they would be amazing to work with.<br /><br />There are 68 Oracle cards and a beautiful hard cover 160 page book. It has the same texture and smell (yes I like the smell of books) as the other deck. This deck was created as a way for people to connect to Faerie Wisdom to transform life and relationships.<br /><br />The art work is simply breathtaking, Brian has always been amazing at what he does and the book has wonderful messages about the Fae and the cards.<br /><br />There are nine Faerie Queens in the deck that represent nine different aspects of the feminine and the power of those energies. To compliment that there are the Queens' Consorts, nine male energetic representations. While these polarities work together they do not have to be read as pairs, they have their own messages alone.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this deck to anyone who loves the Fae and who loves the Frouds wonderful artwork (there really is nothing quite like their expression and experience of the FaeryWorld around).
0812973992|1.0|Collum McCann commits the literary crime of the century by introducing a collosally intriguing character, John Corrigan, and then killing him in a car crash before you can say, \\"Well if you didn't want him, why didn't you hand him off to me???\\" With one exception (the fabulous transcontinental phone call trick), the 'novel' grinds on interminably, filled with tedious events and dull people, who, if they did come to life, would surely pop off the page to ask why a man's third novel is filled with sentences in the style of an eager workshop student who will do anything, now matter how atrocious the result, to include a word we may not have expected.  I am frightened by the praise heaped on this thing.  If this is our best, I say burn the libraries and order premium cable for everyone.
B002T45VX6|1.0|This was the absolute WORST most UNINSPIRED album of hers EVER! Tracks too short, no pizzazz to them; too mellow, I kept waiting for the tunes to get better as they went along and they either ended too quickly, or it never happened. Seems she just \\"hurried\\" to put an album together and it lacks EVERYTHING I'm used to from Shakira. The only track that was half way decent was \\"Give it up to me\\" with Li'l Wayne. She is great live, though. I hope her next one is much better. This one really disappointed me!
B001VNB54A|4.0|I thought that The Pacific was very well done. I've seen some pretty harsh criticism of the show, mostly claiming that there was a political agenda to the series. But color me naive; I didn't see a political agenda. I saw a miniseries that mostly took us through the hell that war was in the Pacific.<br /><br />Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie were US Marines during the time period, and much of The Pacific is based on their  memoirs respectively titled [[ASIN:0891419063 With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa]] and [[ASIN:0553593315 Helmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific]]. The miniseries tells the stories of the two authors and a third Marine named John Basilone. Basilone's story is apparently derived from the memoirs of a Marine that fought by his side during the war.<br /><br />The battles in The Pacific are brutal and life on the battlefield and war ridden Pacific islands was, well, again...hell. The series gives you a realistic look at times of battle, and takes some liberties with various shenanigans that went on among the troops on and off the battlefield. It also touches on how one could be affected personally by the war experience and how it affects the families back home. Almost two full episodes are devoted to relationships: one by Leckie in an Australian fling and the other detailing how Basilone met and married Lena Mae Riggi, a Sergeant in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve.<br /><br />But a tad morbidly I say that the real action--and what The Pacific portrays the best--is the ruthless battles that occurred in the Pacific regions during WWII. It is just amazing how brave the men were who enlisted in the service back during WWII knowing that if they were going to the frontlines, chances are that they weren't coming back. Hats off to them and thank you (the men and women today who go off to foreign lands to fight for America are of course just as brave...thanks to you too).<br /><br />The Pacific for me was thoroughly entertaining. While perhaps not a classic, it had some scenes that will probably stay with me forever. I'm not sure that the price of the DVD or Blu Ray makes it worthy of collection, but do try to catch it on HBO on Demand or at minimum rent it....That is if you've got 10 hours to spare.d some scenes that will probably stay with me forever.

0312427646|5.0|The Uncommon Reader, by Alan Bennett (124 pgs., 2007).  Bennett is known as one of Great Britain's leading dramatists.  He's written numerous plays for the theater, screenplays for the movies, & plays for television.  This was only his second published work of fiction.  His first was a collection of three short stories.  This is a novella.  He's also published three autobiographical books.<br /> Like most British playwrights, Bennett has a biting wit & that low key British sense of humor.  The premise of this novella is very unique.  The uncommon reader is the most uncommon of all citizens of the United Kingdom.  It is Queen Elizabeth II, herself.<br /> When her unruly Corgis wander into a mobile library truck parked near Buckingham Palace, the Queen feels obligated to take out a book.  Norman, a lowly peon in the Royal Kitchens is the only other patron in the library & she strikes up a conversation with him.  Soon the Queen is reading more & more & she has moved Norman upstairs to be her page & assist in her reading endeavors, much to chagrin of the other pages & her Private Secretary who soon feel left out of the Queen's new world.  Bennett's trick is turning the mere act of becoming a voracious reader into some sort of revolutionary act on the Queen's part.  In this age of the Internet & video games, reading is seen as some sort of subversive activity.<br /> This novella is short, but much sarcasm of today's world & the insularity of the upper class & the unintelligence of many political leaders, fills its pages.  The more intellectual the reader of this book is, the more one chuckles while reading it.  After doing much reading the Queen decides she wants to become a writer; but not a writer of fluff or dryness.  She wants to write critically of the many Prime Ministers who have served under her & to write about all the political games & upheavals she has seen & to finally express her own opinion about things.  The current Prime Minister & many of her privy councillors are aghast at this latest plan of the Queen.  In the end, Bennett delivers a totally unexpected resolution to this crisis.aghast at this latest plan of the Queen.  In the end, Bennett delivers a totally unexpected resolution to this crisis.
0440539811|5.0|This book has a unique ability that I have come to love and appreciate. From reading the works of RAW, and The Illuminatus! Trilogy and Schroedinger's Cat, I was exposed to numerous philosophies, movements, and figures that I otherwise had no familiarity with. At that time in my life (early 20's) when I felt the most isolated from my fellow man, I found refuge in the works of people such as Wilson. It was helpful to know \\"there are others,\\" and Wilson (being one of these others himself) guides you to many many more.<br /><br />It is a sad world we live in without that wonderful man.
B0030IEHMQ|5.0|Brooklyn, by Colum Toibin (264 pgs., 2009).<br />  This novel takes place in both small town Ireland & Brooklyn, NY; during the early 1950s.  Although Toibin is male, he has chosen a young woman as his protagonist & writes in her voice throughout this novel.  Not being a female, I think I can say he has done a yeoman job of writing in the voice of a young twenty-something immigrant girl from a small town in Ireland.<br /> The novel is populated by Eilis (the female protagonist), an Irish priest (who is a procurer of favors), Rose (the beautiful & well-poised older sister who remains in Ireland to care for their widowed mother), three brothers who have all traveled to England to live & find work, Mrs. Kehoe (an Irish-American widow who runs a boarding house in Brooklyn for single Irish girls), Eilis's fellow boarders in the home of Mrs. Kehoe, a retail clothing shop on Fulton Street where Eilis finds work, the real-life Loehman's (where Eilis loves to shop, as did my Mom & most every other female I knew in Brooklyn in the 1950s & 1960s), visits to Irish dances, visits  to Coney Island, rides on the subway, Italian families, baseball loving Brooklyn Dodger fans, & ocean crossing liners with lousy third class accommodations.<br /> I was a mere lad of single digits in this Brooklyn in which Eilis finds herself.  However, she's in her early twenties & is seeking the beginning of her new life.  She finds true love in Brooklyn.  Then, tragedy strikes.  She must return to Ireland.  Will she come back to Brooklyn?  To a life she's unsure whether she wants to return to, or stay in the Ireland of her heart.  Will she remain with a man she once liked who never had the guts to tell her he liked her but now he has & they are mutually attracted to each other; but she has already promised herself to another man?  To throw a monkey wrench into these already complicated choices is a vicious gossip monger who through familial connections learns all about the life Eilis has left in Brooklyn.  She threatens to overturn all the happiness Eilis has found in Ireland.  What will Eilis do?  Ach, for that, ye'll have to read this book.lyn.

B000002U82|1.0|I've always liked DSOM and have heard it a million times. It's great music and very interesting. I've been thinking about buying a copy for a long time and finally decided to buy it.     Unfortunately, this is a horrible, horrible recording! It sounds flat (no depth to the music) and highly compressed. Don't bother buying this particular release. Save up your pennies for the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs (MSFL) version (very, very expensive on ebay) or maybe on of the original CD releases.

B002C6A6FY|5.0|I just LOVE this movie, \\"CASABLANCA\\", for so many reasons. For one, there is an excellent cast. Another thing are the classic \\"lines\\" - which are memorable, and so perfectly timed. (There are so many of them,  one has to see it a few times to catch them all.) For those  who think of it as a \\"chick flick\\" - it is not. The romantic part is just what all movies are expected to have: romantic, comedy, what is going to happen (i.e. boy meets girl, loses girl, then gets girl USUALLY), and then there is a great cast.  This movie was not expected by neither the actors, studio, or others to enjoy the success it got and still has. But, it has stood the test of time as well as taking home the BP OSCAR. The two-disc edition is for those who love outtakes, etc., but all I need is the movie and I cannot see it enough. I don't get bored with it, and still - after at least 40 viewings - find new things which crop up I haven't caught before.  After the number of actors who turned the part(s) down - it worked perfectly the way it was. Sometimes, it is hit or miss, and this is a sure-fire hit! (I only wish they still made movies like this!)

The video and sound are the best that I have seen on any concert video and the performances are some of their best. My favorite was the Rio concert DVD, the energy that those one and one-half million fans added to the concert was something to see. I think that the Stones could teach Martin Scorsese something about filming a rock concert video!

Today we know what's in their products and how it affects our lives.

015206396X|5.0|Eighteen-year-old Katsa is a king's niece in a world where a small percentage of the population of seven different kingdoms have supernatural gifts called Graces. When Gracelings come into their powers in mid-childhood, they become wards of their king. Orphaned Katsa came into her Grace at age eight when she accidentally killed a man who attempted to sexually abuse her. Her uncle, the king, ordered her trained in fighting skills then employed her starting at age ten as his personal one-girl vengeance squad against rebellious subjects. Katsa is emotionally scarred from this horrible work, and at the start of the story she's in the midst of a secret revolt as the creator of the Council, a rescue league she established to save innocent people from the cruelties of her own king and five of the other six kings.<br /><br />I am personally not a fan of sword-and-sorcery fantasy. I much prefer light, contemporary fantasy and urban fantasy. Mainly because I don't enjoy reading about Medieval times, and throwing in magic to leaven the brew has never helped me overcome that dislike. Until this book.<br /><br />I unequivocally loved it, primarily because of the romance plot, but also because of Katsa. Her power and how it affects her fascinated me. Inevitably, every young-adult fantasy with a strong romance plot gets compared to Twilight, but speaking as a big fan of the Twilight series, I don't see the similarity. Instead of a romantic pairing of a relatively powerless mortal with an all-powerful immortal, this is a case of two mostly equal partners. Both are magically gifted, and the heroine's magic is definitely stronger than that of her romantic partner.<br /><br />At the beginning of the story, the heroine Katsa is emotionally isolated. She has business associates, her two sidekicks on the king's gruesome punishment missions, a middle-aged warrior who trained her in fighting skills and a handsome young nobleman who, unknown to Katsa, is in love with her. And she has the companionship of her supportive lady's maid. But none of them are Graced like Katsa and can never understand what it's like to be universally feared and avoided by ordinary people.<br /><br />Then Katsa connects with the love interest of this book, Prince Po, and romance fans like me get a truly great First Meet. Not only that, their connection is the beginning of two of my favorite romance story lines: \\"us against the world\\" (AKA \\"no one ever understood me the way you do\\") and \\"two for the road\\" (a shared mission/journey). Katsa discovers in Po, for the first time in her life, a kindred spirit and potential equal--and vice versa for Po. He is able to keep up with her in hand-to-hand combat, and Katsa assumes he's a Graced warrior. As they verbally and physically spar with each other, they immediately learn extremely important things about each other: that each has a powerful Grace accompanied with self-control, integrity, and poise under fire.<br /><br />Po is almost as alienated and isolated because of his Grace as Katsa. In spite of (unlike Katsa) having a loving family who aren't, in general, intimidated by Gracelings, Po has two problems: He's the only Graced one in his family, and his Grace is so particularly off-putting that his mother has urged him to pretend he has an entirely different Grace than he actually has. Because of this burdensome secret, Po feels guilty of dishonesty and believes it will prevent him from ever having emotional closeness to anyone. As a result, he's wandered for years from land to land. But in spite of their mutual emotional disconnection from others, both Po and Katsa are what I call Positive Warriors. Negative Warriors employ their strength and skill to unjustly dominate and hurt others. Positive Warriors use their might to defend those weaker than them, and they are some of the most sympathetic protagonists an author can create.<br /><br />Another aspect of the best romance plots that this book has in spades is that the lovers actas catalysts for important emotional growth in each other. At multiple key turning points in the story, Po does what no one else has ever been able to do for Katsa. He helps her realize that she has the freedom, and responsibility, to choose exactly how she will use her Grace. And at a very key point in the story for Po, Katsa acts as a catalyst for Po, too, helping him make a crucial life-changing choice as well.<br /><br />I personally think the main romantic conflict separating the two lovers is believable and well motivated, that is, Katsa's refusal to marry or have children. This is not an ordinary woman. Her mission in life is not to nest and nurture. It is to protect and defend. She has no natural ability or desire to learn, engage in or teach domestic skills or to be soft and cuddly. She's never been mothered, or fathered, and she has no concept of how to exist in a marriage or make a family.<br /><br />I enjoyed very much the clean, crisp writing style of the author. In particular, she avoids the irritating distraction of present tense that more and more YA authors are employing these days. And the book is written in close third rather than first person, which is even more common in YA fiction. Close third has all the advantages of the intimacy and close connection with the protagonist that first-person provides, but it doesn't feel as claustrophobic or make the protagonist sound as narcissistic as first person does.<br /><br />I am greatly hoping that any sequels that follow this book will be a continuation of the story of Katsa and Po. There is so much more I want to know about their relationship and so many more adventures they could have as they continue the work of the Council together. I'm personally hoping for a revolution spreading through all the kingdoms until every capricious and cruel king is overthrown. And I'd like to see Katsa marry Po!in each other.

B000AAP7FI|2.0|Since the other reviews of this collection so far have been favorable, and mine is not, I think I should make clear at the outset where I'm coming from.  I am one of the hardy group of enthusiasts who really like early jazz -- ragtime, if you consider that jazz, and the recorded jazz of the '20's and early '30's.  To some of us, anyway, \\"boogie woogie\\" has a very specific meaning.  It refers to a type of up-tempo piano blues that features a rolling bass in the left hand, often in octaves, and a syncopated melody in the right hand, sometimes improvised, sometimes not.  Call this \\"classic boogie woogie.\\"    Classic boogie woogie is (1) hard to play and (2) highly infectious.  A good performance is a major accomplishment.  This is the music that was played at rent parties, notably in Chicago, to raise the money to pay the rent.    When Amazon alerted me to this collection, I got very excited.  Ten CD's of nothing but boogie woogie.  That must be every boogie woogie recording ever made; and at a nice price.  This is almost too good to be true.    I didn't want to assume this was what I would be getting.  So I tried to check it out.  The little ad listed some of the major practitioners of classic boogie woogie -- e.g., Pinetop Smith -- and nobody else.  Promising.  You get a full list of the tunes.  The problems are, there is no indication as to who was performing each tune, and there is no way to listen to any of the music.    So I bought the collection.  And, yes, it was not at all what I was expecting.  The music was in roughly these proportions:            classic boogie woogie:     10%          miscellaneous songs about boogie woogie: 10%          ordinary piano blues from the period (generally slow blues):               20%          big band blues music from the period: 60%.    Now.  This might be fine with some people.  The miscellaneous songs about boogie woogie are pretty bad.  (Lena Horne sings a rhumba about boogie woogie; somebody sings about a boogie woogiecowboy.)  The slow piano blues are pretty good.  The big band music is an extremely mixed bag.  A high proportion of these tunes are by bands you never heard of.  In my opinion, in most cases, there is a good reason why you never heard of them.  The names of the people I assume are the band-leaders appear on the sleeve of each disk.  There is no further explanation.  (There are no liner notes.)    Incidentally: a rough count indicates clearly that this set does not include anything like all the classic boogie woogie ever recorded.    So. If you like all the big band music of this period regardless of the source, you will reasonably object to the two stars.  If you are a collector of classic boogie woogie, you are pretty sure to find this collection frustrating because of the large amount of second-rate big band music it includes; I would not recommend that you add it to your collection.  If you are new to classic boogie woogie but would like to try it, I don't recommend this set of disks either.  Try, instead, Boogie Woogie Giants, Blues 88's--Boogie Woogie Instrumentals, and/or the Anthology of Boogie Woogie Piano, all available from Amazon at reasonable prices.
0810979772|5.0|My 8-year old creative son loves this book.  It provides a great methodology for him to express himself in a creative way that he would not have thought of on his own.  The book accomplishes this by having the child answer questions, draw pictures, create stories, and draw & write cartoons.  My son is a second grader, and I think this is the minimum grade level for this book due to the book's content and the required writing skills.
B0035V35PI|3.0|STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE! No doubt the reason why this is being so highly rated is because Ninja/Kung Fu movies have die hard fans. They usually can't see anything objectively through their Ninja colored glasses.<br /><br />Ninja Assasin is a fun popcorn flick (if you can keep your food down?)! There is a choppy story line that is not bad. The acting on the other hand is (for the most part). Rain a Korean Pop Star, plays a deadly Ninja named Raizo. he was abducted as a young child and trained to become a deadly assasin. The \\"family\\" kills the only thing he ever loved which sets Raizo on a hellbent course to destroy them. That's it...not really much else.<br /><br />Now if you don't care for acting and execution, but you love stylized kung fu violence, this movie is for you!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: This movie is probably best suited for full 1080p viewing! It looks great, and sounds awesome too. FINAL THOUGHTS: Wait for it on cable! NINJA FANS: Go get your black suits on and take out your foam nunchucks...BUY!

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Only just rating a second star Dan Brown has not improved or developed his writing style after five year's gestation on this novel.  His characters remain two dimensional and unbelievable.  Huge amounts of research and opinionated mumbo jumbo.  If he wants to write his thoughts on the Freemasons and Noetics why not try and write a factual book (answer it would not sell 500 copies) rather than pad out what should be a fast moving story with lengthy expositions and to the author clever speculation and explanations.  The reality of course is that there is very little story to pad out.  The impression here is that this has been written not for the inevitable best seller status following the Da Vinci Code but for the film rights.  Unfortunately the poor actors chosen to play the parts will again be left with cardboard characters to interpret and this time even less of a story or historical context.  As an interntionally best selling author this book is also too simply and completely American to appeal. When it comes to mystical systems of thought that have existed since Mediaeval times I am sorry Dan - Washington DC is simply not the centre of the universe.  Slow paced, boring at times, badly edited and could only perhaps have been retrieved a little by cutting by a third.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|The film is beautiful visually; it's done well, and if you want a film that looks great and has plenty of action, you should really enjoy this one.  However, the problem I had was that I couldn't enjoy it because of the messages and implications Cameron put into the story; Military= bad (a favorite theme in Hollywood unfortunately)  and the slightly more subtle (but by the end of the film you've been hit over the head with it for hours) American history= evil, when you realize the Na'vi represent American Indians, it's tough to not see what Cameron is saying about American settlers.  The themes aren't new in the film industry, or other art fields (in fact they're so overused it's comes across, in a way, as a standard formula of sorts; rhetoric, simplistic?) but they lessened the experience for me, overpowering everything else. Again, if you're not put off by these messages you should enjoy the film; but if you're offended when the military is shown in a bad light, or when it's implied that American history is something to be ashamed of, you may want to check out something else.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|After seeing Avatar in the theaters multiple times in 3-D, I was unsure if I would enjoy it as much. However, I enjoyed it even more. Viewing it out of 3-D is amazing as you can see the entire screen clearly. The attention of detail is unlike any other film. If you have a Blu-ray player and HDTV this is a must buy. Its the best looking movie I have ever watched on Blu-ray. The price was great and it comes with both a Blu-ray DVD and a standard DVD; which also looks amazing. The one complaint I have is neither disc has any special features.
B002KV723U|4.0|The \\"Miss You\\" bass line alone is worth the price of this disc. It's got world devastating infectious power. I like the Stones more sinister, nasty stuff most, but this one tune never, ever gets old. If \\"Happy\\" off of Exile on Main Street is the height of joy - I can't think of a more boisterously celebratory sound in the Stones' catalog - then \\"Miss You\\" is their K2. (Note: K2 is the second highest peak on the face of the globe after Everest...) The rest of the songs here are fine, solid music with a few standout moments, like the radio friendly \\"Beast of Burden\\" that is the epitome of \\"timeless\\", or \\"Far Away Eyes\\" which could have easily nestled in on Exile. \\"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\\" predicts, in a minor way, the gorgeous mood of 'Waiting on a Friend\\", but without the island accent. \\"Before They Make Me Run\\" has Keith crooning as well as ever, propelled on Wyman's snappy bass line and Charlie's tight popping beat. And \\"Some Girls'\\" sly rhythm creeps deep under your skin and works some strange mojo there. It grows on you like the sweetest poison ivy.<br /><br />The Stones are playing just easy and loose on all the rest of the tracks, and seemingly enjoying themselves very much, in spite of rumors to the contrary.<br /><br />The sound quality is questionable as the compression is annoyingly audible; much of the original's softer, hazy balance is stripped out. The mid 90s remaster is much, much better, truer to the original. You might find this remaster to be a butchered sacrilege, or possibly a welcome refinement. There's no accounting for taste. With its pronounced, shrill highs and booming, over-sharp bass, this remaster really tests my patience.

B001UV4XWY|4.0|'The BOX' is just one of those flicks that after watching it, I'll find it hard to forget about - in a good way.  Maybe because the story itself is odd and puts off such an odd and creepy vibe to me in which I had to buy it and place it in my Horror collection.  I really enjoyed Frank's character!  Heck, I've always enjoyed Frank's acting skills!  Anyway, 'The BOX' is a must own movie for me - the flick has cool things going for it such as: One heck of a creepy character, which is awesomely played by Frank Langella, a simply made wooden box that somehow manages to come across as kinda stylish but yet iconic, sort of (haha).  And last but not least, Frank's character rides around in a wicked black sedan!  The story as a whole, might be a little out there, but that's why I like it.  I can easily understand why this flick isn't for everyone, but with time, I can also see this flick growing on some of those who might not of liked it (haha).  I wonder if I can try and be Frank's character, 'The Presenter', for this years' Halloween?!  I gotta make that box and maybe someone will know who I'm dressed as (haha)!

While I want it and will get it eventually, my one big gripe with it is more with the companies putting it out (Turner Classics, for the movie and Warner Brothers, for the outtakes, etc.). Anyone expecting a lot of extras (outtakes, etc) as of now (May 21st, 2010) they have not come to an agreement as to packaging it all together.  When the extras have been included I will, without doubt, buy it. But, I just can't justify buying it now, then in 6 months or a year buying another copy of it because \\"now with outtakes, bonus footage\\", etc.    DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND ME, PLEASE: \\"Elvis On Tour\\" is great without the extra footage, outtakes, etc. I just want to make sure you know that as of now it's just the movie and limited else as to what extras are on it from what has been told on at the official web site [...]
0007205236|5.0|At first I really didn't know what to think as I began reading Angela's Ashes.[[ASIN:068484267X Angela's Ashes: A Memoir]]<br />The author basically writes with an Irish accent. I had been looking forward to reading this book for a long time and I was kind of worried that this style of writing was not going to work for me.<br />I guess I was very wrong. This was a wonderful read! The stories and his style were perfect! I loved everything about this book except that it ended! It was so sad and desperate at times and funny at other times. I found myself smiling as I read of the conversations between Frankie and his Grandmother. I have met quite a few people that had come over from Ireland in my time but by just reading this book, I felt as if I knew them that much better.<br />Of course I will read the next book \\"Tis\\" because I need more!
0143038419|4.0|I originally bought this book 1 1/2 years ago at the recommendation of a friend or coworker (I no longer remember who).  It sat on my TBR (to be read) shelf until a few months ago when I decided that it was time to get it read.  Having just finished it, I wish I could go back to that day in 2008 when it arrived in the mail from Amazon and read it right away.  Then again, perhaps I wasn't ready to read it until now.<br /><br />If that last line sounds like New Age hooey to you, then you are not likely to enjoy this book.  Ms. Gilbert's real-life adventure is divided into the three segments of her year-long adventure around the world.  Part 1, Italy, was to me the least interesting part of the book.  I enjoyed it okay while I was reading it, but it didn't inspire me to keep picking up the book or to read late into the night in bed like the other two parts did.  In fact, I've already forgotten most of it.  Part 1 was, to me, the surface stuff.<br /><br />Part 2, India, finds Liz living in an Ashram, spending hours every day meditating and scrubbing floors.  She meets a guy there (not romantically) who she calls only \\"Richard from Texas.\\"  Richard is quite a few steps up on the spiritual ladder from where she is when she arrives, and he helps her get her head on straight, to see what really matters.  Part 2 is her spiritual journey.  To me, it was her transition from neuroses and \\"It's all about me.\\" thinking to finding peace and spirituality and strengthening her relationship to God.<br /><br />In Part 3, Indonesia, Liz returns to Bali and seeks out an old Balinese medicine man (Ketut) who had read her palm in the past.  Through him, she furthers her meditative and spiritual journeys.  She also meets a female healer, Wayan, who becomes a dear friend.  Both of these people figure hugely in her time in Bali and in her life.  Both are very interesting characters, and it is quite fascinating to read about Balinese culture, especially in regard to Wayan.<br /><br />I have long had a habit of using tape tags to mark pages I read where a passage touched me, resonated with me in some way, or its writing was especially beautiful or profound.  I have many such tags marking the pages of this book.  I was quite impressed with Ms. Gilbert's writing.  I can't always say I liked her while reading about her year of travel, but I can honestly say that I was, at times, moved, inspired and even awed by her ability to express her thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />Finally, it must be noted that she finds love in the final chapter of her journey, though she remarks that this man didn't save her--that she saved herself--and I was quite happy that it happened this way, because I've read too many books about supposedly strong women who didn't get it together until Prince Charming waltzed into her life and made it all possible.  I've nothing against love (or men); I just think that we must each take ultimate responsibility for who we are and how we make our way in this life.tags to mark pages I read where a passage touched me, resonated with me in some way, or its writing was especially beautiful or profound.

B00111L0MY|5.0|Wonderfully ambiguous, uncompromised, morally complex story of young private eye involved with a local kidnapping case.  Terrific performances from Casey Affleck, Amy Ryan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman et al.  Also note worthy is the film's great sense of place.  The world of the film feels real, and not like a tinsel-town projection of a working class Boston neighborhood.<br /><br />Ben Affleck brings surprising subtlety and depth to his directorial debut, and ends up making one of the most intelligent Hollywood mysteries in recent years.<br /><br />There are minor flaws; the last 1/3 isn't quite as strong in terms of plot - a few twists are hard to swallow.  And the `girlfriend' role is written a little thin for a film where most characters are so filled out.  But the film leaves us shaken and thinking.  How many recent films can you say that about?
B000JLTRKE|2.0|Okay, so here is another review dedicated to my Ammy twin, Mr. Know it All.  You knew this one was coming though.  I'd get into the whole `United 93 is a masterpiece and you really need to revisit that' but you can read my comments on you review of this train-wreck to know my stance on that.<br /><br />To be honest, I already wrote a review for this film a while back, but I have since switched personas here and thus have the opportunity to write a new one, just for you!<br /><br />Okay, so I'll get the obvious out of the way.  I just don't `get' Nicolas Cage.  Yes, he has moments of brilliance (`Leaving Las Vegas' & `Adaptation') and he even has moments of greatness (`Matchstick Men') but overall he is an emotionless mess who doesn't seem to understand how to emote anything other than a blank stare.  He's, in a word, ridiculous.  So, walking in I wasn't expecting much from him, so I can't say that his stagnant performance shocked me, since it didn't.  Michael Pena is an actor I am not really familiar with.  In fact, outside of this I'm really only familiar with his work in `Crash'.  For being such a retched film, `Crash' at least toted some memorable performances and, for me, Pena was one of the standouts (better than Dillon and far more deserving of an Oscar nomination).  Sadly, I think my expectations got the better of me for he was rather dull here.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt and blame it mostly on the script, which didn't give him much too really do.  In a few scenes (mostly when accompanied by Gyllenhaal) he actually makes an impact, so I see that his talent is still in tact.  Sadly, this film is beneath him.<br /><br />So, with two poor performances stuck in the middle of this film, it's kind of off to a bad start for me.<br /><br />As mediocre as Cage and Pena were though, this film is destroyed by Stone's direction.  It is just so stagnant of emotional impact.  The film really just meanders around, proving to be a wasted opportunity.  9/11 was such a tragic time and it still lingers as a haunting reminder of the fragility of peace.  That said, so many claimed that 2006 was just too soon to make so many films about the disaster.  I don't agree with that at all.  If the films had been done properly (ala `United 93') then we wouldn't have been attacking them as a nation.  `World Trade Center' serves as a valiant effort gone terribly wrong.  Stone is never one to back away from controversy, but this film seems so tame for him.  It doesn't challenge the audience at all.  He is a director that I am constantly on the fence with BECAUSE of his controversial visions, but at least when he challenges me I can admire his ambition.  This film is just lazy.  It doesn't go anywhere, and the stale performances he drew out of the two leads only serves to water down the emotional impact a film like this should carry.<br /><br />But alas, there is always Gyllenhaal and her BRILLIANT performance as the emotionally conflicted wife of Pena's character to help ease the pain of this poorly constructed drama.  The way she embraced her character's struggle without ever once playing to the clich&eacute;s surrounding her `stock character' is completely commendable.  Every moment feels very, very real (from her gut wrenching agony to the playful way she teases her husband).<br /><br />In the end, my friend, I urge you to take a second look at this film as well as `United 93' (I know, it's painful) and reconsider your rankings.  Taste is taste, and I'm not here to belittle yours, but we are supposed to be twins and so you kind of have to agree with me!ll lingers as a haunting reminder of the fragility of peace.

B00005JLD4|5.0|Some films just touch something inside you that you didn't know was there.  For me, `Rabbit-Proof Fence' is one of those films.  It is honest, heartfelt, brutal and reaching.  It is also one of those hidden gems that don't get a lot of attention.  In fact, in a year as rich as 2002, this beautiful film was all but forgotten come awards season.  Instead, it was disregarded for big budget mediocrity like `Gangs of New York'.<br /><br />Sad; very sad.<br /><br />`Rabbit-Proof Fence' tells the true story of young Molly and her sister Daisy and her cousin Gracie as they escape from a training camp in Australia, year 1931.  During the years between 1905 and 1971 (HUGE time span), law in Australia allowed white settlers to basically kidnap half-castle children (that is half white/half aboriginal) and place them in camps where they were integrated into white society.  The purpose of these camps was to basically stamp out the race, forcing these young children to mate with whites in order to phase out their race.  Molly, Daisy and Gracie were stripped from their homes and brought to one of these camps.<br /><br />But they escaped.<br /><br />After fleeing from their brutal new home, these three girls made the 1,500 mile trek (along the rabbit-proof fence) back to their homes, covering desert for nine months.  As grueling and dangerous as their journey was, it serves as one of the most heartwarming and uplifting stories put to screen.<br /><br />Adapted from the book of the same name, which was actually written by Molly's very own daughter, Doris Pilkington Garimara, this beautiful film is bound to touch your heart.  The performances by the entire cast, especially these three young girls (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan), are outstanding and very raw and real.  Everlyn Sampi especially carries this film with such honesty.  I was amazed at her beautiful performance.  Kenneth Branagh (yes THAT Kenneth Branagh) is brilliantly used as the enforcer at the camp.  His steely gaze breathes a subtle evil that never overdoes it but respectfully (if you can call it that) approaches this man's wrong ways with honesty and realism.<br /><br />`Rabbit-Proof Fence' is a film that broaches the subject of racism in a way that will make it a real issue for us.  Instead of tacking a slew of clich&eacute;s in a row and calling it provocative (`Crash'), this film uses a subtle yet harrowing approach to give validity to a horrible atrocity.  This film makes racism real to the viewer and raises awareness of the disease.<br /><br />This is a brilliant film that everyone should make a point to see!that never overdoes it but respectfully (if you can call it that) approaches this man's wrong ways with honesty and realism.    `Rabbit-Proof Fence' is a film that broaches the subject of racism in a way that will make it a real issue for us.

B00081U7HC|5.0|\\"Pretty Woman\\" made Julia Roberts a star. In the film she plays a high-class Beverly Hills prostitute who is hired by a rich businessman (played by Richard Gere) to accompany him on various events through several days. The film went on to be a huge financial success raking in nearly $400,000,000 at the boxoffice and became one of 1990's top films. Gary Marshall directed the movie and \\"Pretty Woman\\" has gone on to be one of the most famous romantic/comedies in Hollywood history. Roberts received a Golden Globe and Oscar nomination for her role as the call-girl and quickly went into the running as one of Tinsletown's formost up and coming actresses.<br /> Filmed entirely in Los Angeles, \\"Pretty Woman\\" spawned the sequel \\"Runaway Bride\\" that reunited her with both Gere and Marshall.<br /> This new edition features a slew of bonuses including the original \\"Pretty Woman\\" featurette, audio commentary by Gary Marshall, music video by Natalie Cole, blooper reel, wrap party clips, and more.
0061689246|5.0|\\"Stardust\\" is a simple story about a boy named Tristan Thorn who lives in the English village of Wall, a boy who's in love with a beautiful woman and promises to bring her a falling star they both witnessed.  The star falls beyond the wall in Wall, which is the entrance to an enchanted world and the star takes the shape of a girl, instead of a rock.  Tristan and the star set out on an adventure, as unlikely road companions, through the faerie realm, trying to get back to Wall and Tristan's love.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, funny and charming book with a sweeping story which is both fresh and original.  Each chapter starts with a subtitle about what we're about to read, reminiscent of Don Quixote, which helps move the story along.
B000006Z8E|5.0|I still remember the day my brother's friend, owner of an excellent music store in Ottawa, ON, gave me a copy of Darwin based on my love of neo-progressive bands such as Marillion, Pendragon, Jadis, IQ, etc. Those bands I now consider \\"gateway\\" bands to the older symphonic marvels of Italian prog rock in the early to mid 1970s. I was immediatelt struck by Banco's intensity of songwriting and finesse of the muscianship. The twin keyboard set-up gives the music a richness and color that paints the album from beginning to end. Branching out from the obvious symphonic prog touchpoints, this album also features some jazz and folk influences, particularly in the guitar, all the while maintaining a distinct Italian identity. The soaring vocals can easily be linked to the classical / operatic tradition, but the phrasing and emotion give the singing a strong rock edge. Hard-charging, with moments of quiet, jazz-influenced brilliance, this is a great introduction to one of prog rock's finest.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I LOVED this series and have watched it twice so far but I want MORE! I can't believe they won't tell us what happens to everyone!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Never have I felt so many emotions while watching a TV show.  Dexter is definately the best written, best directed, and best acted show on TV.  I am so conflicted about liking the main character, Dexter Morgan, becuase of his repeated actions.  But for some reason, I always root for him to \\"get\\" the bad guy.  I was an English Major in college and I am currently an English teacher, and this show (if I had the time) could keep me in critical writing projects for years. The depth of each character is mind-boggling. Irony and foreshadowing drip from every scene with being campy (like any CSI show in my opinion).  Also, its great to see Michael C. Hall back in good health.  Go watch Dexter NOW!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|the beatles remasters debate - stereo vs mono rages on. i have a foot in both camps and fall into the catergory of those who needed both boxes. for those who can only afford one or the other,. the stereo box is the one or you could buy the mono box and cherry pick stereo titles to suit but on an album by album basis here are my recomendations -     Please Please Me - mono is the way to go here. sounds unnatural in stereo, although there is better separation and clarity, mono rocks more and the vocals sound more natural    With The Beatles - mono again for the same reasons    Hard Days Night - stereo, the vocals are dead centre and the clarity is awesome    Beatles For Sale - stereo again    Help - stereo again. yesterday is a standout, you can hear the individual string players clearly    Rubber Soul - mono slightly edges out stereo but only just, great to hear in both versions    Revolver - stereo edges out mono but enjoyable in both    Sgt Pepper - mono over stereo, even a day in the life sounds great in mono. stereo for a different view but mono all the way    Magical Mystery Tour - stereo, it lacks something in mono    White Album - stereo sounds phenomenal but mono rocks as well. a must have in both    Yellow Submarine - weak album sounds better in the recent remix than here    Abbey Road - only available in stereo and the best sounding album of the set. a must buy if you are cherry picking    Let it Be - i prefer Let it Be Naked but this still has its charm    Mono Masters - second disc singles paperback writer, revolution etc. rock way more than the stereo counterparts, later singles suffer a little. past masters in stereo a good listen as well but i prefer mono mixes of singles as they were designed for am radio    so there you have it both boxes will give you all you need and more otherwise buy the mono box and cherry pick Hard days Night, Beatles For Sale, Help, Revolver, White Album, Abbey Rd and Let it Be.      Whichever way you go the sound is excellentand the music is timeless.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie, Food, Inc., should be seen by every american. We are being fed a bunch of lies, not to mention the real garbage we are putting in our mouths. This movie is so full of information, and all from the \\"horses' mouth\\", so to speak. You will know the truth about how our food is engineered, where it really comes from, and the huge problems arising from all of it. This should be shown in consumer education classes in every high school in the country. This film is absolutely excellent!
B003BKF696|5.0|I previewed this album on NPR and KCRW before its release because I thought I had liked some singles from The Boxer but did not own anything by them.  I liked what I heard well enough that I bought High Violet upon its release.  My appreciation for this album has grown with each day that I listen to the CD.  They sound like a great Brit band and I only recently discovered they're from Brooklyn.  I'm a sucker for building crescendos and somewhat indecipherable lyrics.  \\"Sorrow\\" and \\"Bloodbuzz Ohio\\" are amazing songs - \\"I don't wanna get over you . . . \\"; \\"I was carried, to Ohio, in a swarm of bees; I owe money to the money that I owe.\\"    I intended the title to be ironic since TNBT sounds like something Rolling Stone magazine would say.  But, I do hope that with the NYT article and their recent appearance on David Letterman (where they performed \\"Afraid of Everyone\\") that their fanbase builds and this band gets the credit it is due.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Saw the movie in theatres twice in 3 D.  DVD version was purchased (not blue ray as I didn't have the player as yet).  The detail on the DVD was fantastic and I am looking forward to release of the blue ray edition (I am ready for it now)with all the extras that were not available with the original blue ray release.  The story is a melange of plots but the execution is without fault.  Breath taking colors, backgrounds and scenery with the actors unencumbered by the restrictions of prosthetics of makeup.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes science fiction as well as anyone who enjoys a good story.

This book is a staple for serious fighters at our gym. Thanks to Mark for sharing his expertise and raising my performance and fitness to new levels.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|I've noticed a good deal of bad press surrounding this album since it came out on Tuesday. Music review sites are damning Infinite Arms as samey and a general lack of progress on the Band of Horses aesthetic. But, here's the thing: if you thought for some reason that Band of Horses was going to pull a major shakeup on this album, you need to get your head screwed on straight. Band of Horses have been doing one thing and doing it well since the release of their debut, and that is writing hook-laden, catchy country rock anthems. Bridwell's honeyspun vox are a hallmark of the band's sound, and whether backed by straightforward rock as on Everything All The Time or atmospheric grooves as on Cease To Begin, his voice is as distinctive as Band of Horses is predictable. On Infinite Arms, Band of Horses have brought us another collection of songs that unmistakably sound like Band of Horses, and I don't get why people are unhappy with that. If you're looking for constant stylistic reinvention, this isn't the band for you, but that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with the band or the album. As the title implies, Bridwell is reaching out on this album, trying to contain and hold close his feelings of love, loss, abject confusion. Bridwell finds comfort in the everyday, remembering past lovers in the wrappers of candy bars. He is a poet of the simplest style, taking the mundane and acknowledging that it is through these things that people often remember specific, better moments in time. This album is without a doubt one for the fans and for those who don't expect Band of Horses to ever step outside of their comfort zone. In fact, it's when they do step outside their well-trodden style, as on the lifeless, trudging \\"Evening Kitchen,\\" that the band struggles the most.
0142428213|5.0|WARNING: This audio book starts with an Introduction (about Richard Bachman) that gives away the ending.  Skip it and listen to it after finishing the book.  When I heard it, I thought, No way!  They couldn't have just done that!  And the whole time while listening, I was in hopeful denial, but sure enough they gave it away.  The good news is that it didn't ruin the ride.    This story just keeps \\"running\\" in a man-against-world, pulse pounding story.  I felt my adrenaline rise more than a few times--an odd feeling while sitting passively in my boring, long commute.  Also, I've seen the Schwarzenegger movie a long time ago.  While that is fine entertainment, this is way better, different, and more dimensional.    This was my first time listening to this narrator.  Like any new narrator for me, it took a few chapters to settle into his reading style and intonation, but once I did I thought his voice blended perfectly with the story's mood.  Ben's voice was especially powerful and suitably badass.
0440245915|1.0|This book was the longest,  most boring book I have ever read and I read constantly. This book  dragged on and on and on, with characters that were so boring they had no life at all.   By the time I got two thirds of the way through I could not stand it any longer.  I began skimming until I finally had to just go to the last chapter to see how it ended.  Then I felt it wasn't worth it.  I wasted so much time getting through this piece of boredom that I am mad at myself.  What a waste from a good author. I wouldn't pay a penny for a used copy and am sorry it is on my Kindle. I give this a no star, but that option was not available.
B0009MAO46|4.0|Pretty good movie for a child to watch. I remember watching this movie on VHS when I was a kid. I had to get online just to find a DVD copy, it was pretty hard locating a regular DVD copy of this movie so I ended up buying it online. of course wal-mart and other places had the \\"blu-ray\\" pack with this version in it. But I'd rather not pay $25 for any movie just cause you can access menu controls while you watch the movie along with a set of other pointless features.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I am a loyal Sherlock Holmes fan and loved the old Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce movies.  However, Dr. Watson was portrayed as loyal but a bit of a bumbler.  The orginal stories of Doyle portrayed him quite differently.  Not on Holmes intellectual level but not a bumbler.  I think that this current version portrays the good doctor as Doyle meant him to be.  The action is fast, with plot twists galore.  Good fun and very enjoyable.
B001B92E5I|5.0|I can't remember how I got turned on to Gaslight Anthem ( probably sat. radio) but I am certainly glad I did.  I can't describe the sound, and  I think that is a good thing.  But what I can say is I love this CD...can't stop playing it.  From the first cut to the last.  All I can say is...Great music.  Any rock and roll fan would love to own this effort by the Gaslight Anthem. buy it.
B002XISFCM|4.0|I really enjoyed the added quality that the blu-ray edition added to this wonderful movie.  I also own the book and DVD.  I just wanted to let people know that, if they are willing to wait for up to 2 weeks, they can get this for $17.31 from http://www.amazon.co.uk

B0018SWA56|5.0|Finally - an Emily Giffin book that I truly enjoyed from start to finish!  This one is the sequel to Something Borrowed, but is told from the perspective of Darcy - a beautiful, spoiled, obnoxious young woman who just found out her fiance cheated on her with her best friend while she was busy cheating on him with his best friend and subsequently getting pregnant with his child.<br /><br />I found myself completely disliking Darcy in Something Borrowed, but really found myself not only liking her in Something Blue but genuinely relating to her as well!  I loved exploring the depth of her character and watching her evolve throughout the course of the book.  I actually found myself sort of disliking Rachel in this book even though I had really pulled for her in Something Borrowed, so that was an interesting twist.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with Emily Giffin's novels has been the lack of strength portrayed by her female characters..... but I felt that Darcy broke that mold.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend reading Something Borrowed before reading Something Blue, but since Darcy basically summarizes what happened in the first few chapters of this book, it can be read on it's own as well.... but I think you may miss something if you go about it that way.<br /><br />All in all, this has been my favorite of Giffin's books to date (I've only read 3 so far)!

Preston takes a fresh view of the signature works of the man that wrote the rules of music as an art form.  If you've ever wanted to explore this holiest of grails you could not go wrong with this set.
B001993Y2C|5.0|I can remember \\"the first Galactica\\", broadcasted many years ago. I was a small child and I still keep the old Baltar in my mind. There are many differences between \\"that Galactica\\" and the new one included in this set. Baltar is not old anymore, Starbucks is now a woman...Well, you know, everything changes. Anyway it's great to see this \\"adaptation\\" to our \\"modern times\\". The set itself is detailed, with a pretty box and a collectible cylon inside (again, quite different than those first cylons I could see when being a child). The series? Well, it's a great show. This time we are talking about a production dedicated to older people, dramatic sometimes but always striking. Somehow, it makes you be sitting on your sofa, open-eyed because of the action or.....something else!!...Definitively \\"a must\\" to be seen specially after many years with the cylons in your mind and....perhaps...in your heart too.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|An excellent sci-fi epic.  I saw the movie originally in the theater in 3-D.  The standard 2-D blueray is very good, but not as powerful as the 3-D.  Great flick, regardless!
B00003CX8Y|4.0|This movie includes the new bonus features and songs that come with the dvd.  It's the same movie I loved growing up, and now it even has subtitles to sing along with!!
0439023483|4.0|Wow... In the beginning I didn't think I was going to be able to really get into the storyline but once part II of the book began I was TOTALLY hooked. Excellent story. I love the character development and the pace of the book. I couldn't put it down once I got into the story. The ending has left me wanted more. Can't wait to begin reading the next book in the series.

B002RSDW80|5.0|I had read the book by Julie Powell, \\"Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously\\" but did not particularly enjoy it for various reasons. So I stayed away from watching the movie for a long time despite the positive reviews. Well, being a fan of Meryl Streep, I finally decided to give it a try, and boy, am I glad! This is truly a wonderful tribute of sorts to the cooking icon that is Julia Child, who is flawlessly portrayed by Meryl Streep  - I can't believe how this veteran actress managed to master Child's way of speaking, as well as her mannerisms. It goes to show that Streep can make any role her own, as evidenced by her great and impressive body of work - [[ASIN:B00371QQ5W Out of Africa: 25th Anniversary (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]], [[ASIN:B00005LOKU The French Lieutenant's Woman]], [[ASIN:0784011710 Sophie's Choice]], and many more.<br /><br />The story is actually split into two narratives - in the present day, there's the young Julie Powell, who languishes as a temp in a government agency despite having the potential to be a good writer. Julie is portrayed by the adorable Amy Adams, though her role here does escalate into whining and tantrums, and is downright annoying most of the time. As a means of proving that she is capable of finishing a project, she takes on the challenge of creating and maintaining a food blog which documents her exploits in the kitchen - creating each recipe written by Julia Child in the course of a year.<br /><br />The other narrative centers on Julia Child herself back in the 50s - both Child (Streep) and her husband Paul(played to perfection by Stanley Tucci, lately seen in [[ASIN:B001QOGYAO The Lovely Bones]]) are portrayed as a loving and fine food loving couple who have moved to Paris due to Paul's government posting. Julia finds herself at wits end trying to keep herself occupied whilst Paul works and tries her hand at a variety of pursuits - hat-making, bridge, and finally, cooking classes at Le Cordon Bleu. This serves as a catalyst that ignites Julia's passion for French cooking and the rest is of course history.<br /><br />The two parallel narratives flow well - and the excellent casting makes this movie a joy to watch. Streep personifies Child to a hilt - her gastronomic delight in enjoying fine French cuisine, her affectionate and close bond with husband Paul (it helps that Tucci and Streep share credible on-screen sexual chemistry, though I would not have thought it to be so had I not watched this movie), her unspoken sorrow of not having a child with Paul, and her zeal in pursuing her passion for French cooking - these scenes with Streep make this a memorable viewing experience. Amy Adams seems sweet enough for the role of self-doubting (initially) Julie Powell, but her whining and self-centered ways when things don't quite go according to plan and the abominable way she treats her wonderfully supportive husband and best friend, make watching her quite a pain.<br /><br />Personally, I was more riveted and entertained by the Child-centered storyline and only wish there could have been more of such scenes. The movie though does work well with this dual narrative format and the themes of strong-willed women chasing after their dreams through resilience as well as the support of loving spouses make this an entertaining and engaging movie which will appeal to both foodies and those who are fans of chick flicks.nites Julia's passion for French cooking and the rest is of course history.

B0015DROBO|4.0|I could not put this down.  Just when I thought there couldn't be anything else, I turned the page...
B002ZG974M|4.0|BABIES is a feel good movie that arguably has absolutely no point, or is very profound.  It is a documentary that essentially films the first year or so in the lives of 4 babies from vastly different parts of the globe.  We simply observe them eating, evacuating, smiling, discovering their toes, learning to crawl, learning to play, and so on.  Certainly babies are cute, and it's easy to get an adult audience to smile with and laugh at these silly little creatures.     That could be the point of BABIES...\\"look, how cute.\\"  And frankly, it's pretty satisfying on that level alone.  But it could also be showing us, and the most basic levels, how we're all so VERY similar, at least when we start out.  That all of us, whether from Namibia, Mongolia, Tokyo or San Francisco...we all have so very much in common.  That's a simple, almost clichéd \\"lesson\\", but BABIES presents it in a clear and undeniable manner.     I very much appreciated the underlying points to ponder of BABIES...but mostly it was just a 79 minute delight.  It's a wonderful cultural lesson:  short after birth, we see the Namibian baby essentially spending his time completely nude and the little Mongolian child swaddled tightly in many layers.  Both are valid child-rearing approaches...but are starkly different and both are moving.  Seeing the Mongolian child wrapped like a cocoon is a startling image...yet given his stark and cold surrounding environment...it is a way for his family to show their love and caring for this child when they are unable to physically be there holding the baby.     The Mongolian child was my favorite (although I liked all the kids)...and I suspect each person will have their own favorite.  For American viewers, the San Francisco baby may either strike a strong chord, or may seem to be the least interesting.  The Mongolian child was interesting because he was so darn cute, but also because he had a deep relationship with the animals that were such a part of his family's farm:  roosters, cows, goats, cats, etc.  You can see how this tiny child will grow up to care for and understand the animals in his charge, because being around them is as natural as breathing.  I found all those scenes to be rather touching.     Do be sure to enjoy contrasting the American child-raising to the styles around the world.  One of my favorite moments:  we see a toddler aged Namibian baby enjoying sitting outside his hut with his extended family, enjoying tribal music in the very area of the world it originated in.  It feels integrated and RIGHT.  Then we cut to the American girl, who is with her father participating in a group with lots of other kids and parents, sitting in a circle in a classroom, singing \\"Native American\\" songs and clapping their hands in a \\"tribal\\" rhythm.  The American baby leaps up and runs screaming to the door of the room, trying to get out.  The audience I saw this with just busted out laughing...we all saw the irony of an African child enjoying African music and an American child balking at enjoying \\"fake\\" African music.  Draw your own political conclusions.     If you've seen the trailer for this film and enjoyed it...then you WILL enjoy the movie.  It's just more of that.  Simple and sometimes moving.  And while there's lots of baby nudity and topless women in Africa...the movie is suited for the whole family, in my opinion.     (PS:  It's a French movie, but that makes no difference.  There is no \\"dialogue\\" or narration...nor is it needed.  Sure, you understand what the American parents are saying...but believe me, when you hear the Mongolian boy say \\"papa\\" for the first time...you don't need a translator.)

B001VNB54A|2.0|In agreement with several other reviews on this series, I was sorely disappointed in TP.  I think we can all agree that it would be unfair to compare it to BoB in terms of story and cast, however, with the same backing as BoB it did have the potential to be as engaging.  While I found myself attached to a few of the episodes (Okinawa, Austrailia), I felt that the series lacked any sort of emotional consistency.  The characters, with exception to Basilogne, were disconnected and rarely present long enough for one to become fully immersed in the hell of the Pacific Theater.  Gene and Lucky were both great characters, yet the skipping around between stories was not as well threaded as was done in BoB.  The battle scenes were well shot and set, yet they lacked excitement and energy found in BoB.  My grandfather, and grandfather-in-law, were both Navy men--one of whom was a Pearl Harbor survivor.  Knowing the two of them, I know that every soldier in the War in the West has/had stories to tell--some hopeful, some otherwise.  TP just doesn't meet expectations and doesn't deserve a solid rating in my opinion.  Good filming, visually speaking, but technique doesn't make up for story in this series...If you want to see an engaging retelling of the Pacific, watch The Thin Red Line.

0446569895|5.0|First off, I have to say I don't listen to Black Sabbath.  I've never watched The Osbournes.  I love \\"If I Close my Eyes Forever\\" and that is the only song I've heard of Ozzy's.  My point is, you don't have to be a fan to read this book and enjoy it.  I've read it twice so far.  I love it.  It is pure entertainment and Ozzy makes some good points.  He regrets things but doesn't hide the fact that they happened.  It's what made him who he is, as he says.  I love how Ozzy tells his stories.  The pictures are awesome.  The book is full of humor but also some tragic moments.  I highly recommend this book.

B0039TD7RC|4.0|Dearest-On-Earth and I have been with a sick relative in Cleveland for the last week, so, needless to say, I was bit...\\"primed\\" to get back and hear \\"deluxe/remastered/refurbished,\\" whatever, Exile On Main St..  The NEW tracks are great, and the old tracks simply reiterate the contention that Exile On Main St is about the finest Rock and Roll album ever released.  Still...for all the histrionics surrounding its release, one would think that \\"whoever-is-in-charge-of-marketing-the-Stones-stuff-now\\" could have/WOULD have spent more time & effort on the \\"packaging.\\"  Nope.  For some reason, this magnificent music doen't even rate a \\"jewel box\\" - nope again - just some flimsy bit of cardboard repackaging that will, I'm sure, be worn out by the end of August.  And the much-ballyhooed \\"booklet?\\"  6 pictures of Exile-era Stones, most of which we've already seen before.  BUT:  Thank GOODNESS there is NO Chuck Leavell and NO Ron Wood on this, and it goes without saying that Mick Taylor, Ian Stewart, and Nicky Hopkins SHINE like fireworks in a funeral home or something.  Mick was right in a sometimes-during-the-eighties interview, in which he noted that \\"There is no future to Rock and Roll...it's all recycled past.\\"  Sigh: ain't THAT the truth.  Maybe we can all hound \\"Rhino\\" or somebody to \\"re-release\\" all of Big Daddy's four albums for some REAL \\"recycling...\\"

B002JVWRAO|5.0|I started watching Supernatural during the 2nd season. For the most part, I have really enjoyed it. Although some of the episodes were a bit silly. Near the end of Season 4 and for all of Season 5, this show rose to a level rarely seen in television. It was extremely well written, directed and acted. A rare combination you just can't beat. I highly recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is another tragic waste of an excellent assembled cast of actors, writers, and directors[[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]]. Just when the characters have been developed and the audience is fully entrenched in the storyline... Oops! It's time to replace the show with something completely lame...cheaper and short-lived. Gotta' watch that bottom-line! Instant-profit comes before the long-term payoff. Star Trek sound familiar? Stargate SG-1 stayed on the air and did very well? Why not this show? Let's hope there are more reunions ahead in the near future!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|When I saw this film in the theater (in 3D), I was blown away by the beauty; it is awe-inspiring to see how computer-generated image technology has advanced from \\"Andrea and Wally B.\\" to a movie like this one.

B000PTYUQG|5.0|Obras completas de Stravinsky, com regência do próprio são um verdadeiro deleite para várias horas de audição. São indispensáveis todos os ballets, sinfonias e outras obras mais dificeis de se achar a venda, dispensando-se o trabalho da procura, às vezes infrutífera. A impressão é de que está tudo com a assinatura do maestro. O box é compacto (ocupa o espaço de uns 4 ou 5 cds convencionais)e as obras estão distribuidas em 22 cds guardados em papel cartão. Um dos testamentos da música moderna e apíce da tradição musical ocidental. Não traz informações detalhadas sobre as obras, impulsionando o ouvinte neófito a buscá-las em outros meios. Relação custo-benefício excelente.

031237593X|5.0|This 900+ page behemoth of a novel was supposed to last me my 3 week Christmas break.     I finished it in 5 days.     I was totally riveted from the first page to the last. The characterizations are amazing, the research impeccable, the writing superb. The battle scenes moved a little slow for me, but I've never been a military history type girl.     I would recommend this book to anyone interested in historical fiction. The book is daunting when you first pick it up, but it goes very very quickly.     Seriously, this is the best book I've read in a long time; I can't wait to start from the beginning and read it again.
006056251X|4.0|I thought this book was ok for many reasons:    1)I like the fact that Evie actually came from the loins of Jenner, a character in one of Ms. Kleypas books. Now Jenner was not our main hero in that book and he wasn't very likable either. In fact, I was wary of him until the end but I just thought it different that a heroine was coming from him.    2)The whole story was totally unexpected because Evie was someone who was lacking in confidence and didn't strike anyone as someone who would be bold enough to propose a marriage convenience with the villain.    3)I also like the fact that despite what St. Vincent did to Lilian, Evie did not let that deter her.    All in all good book. Not my favorite of all the books, but good.

However when a prince named Vaveen (Voiced by Bruno Campos) with his assitant Lawrence (Peter Barlette) come to town, they are invited to a special party to meet the local mayor's lovely daughter Charolette (Voiced by Jenifer Cody) with her father Big Daddy La Beouf (Voiced by John Goodman) that is until they meet up with a fiendish yet sly Vooodoo witch doctor named Dr. Facilier (Voiced by Keith David). He gives them an offer they can't refuse, unfortunately it turns the prince into a frog as he meets Tiana who remembers the old story of the Frog and the Princess who's kiss has to turn him human but it turns her into a frog.

We started singing some of their songs over the phone together..he knew the lyrics quiet well.  I thought it be fun to order the set and surprise him. He's coming from AZ to drive with me to Oregon.

B002VECM72|5.0|I fell in love with this movie.  I loved the story and the actors who portrayed it.  Sandra Bullock deserved every bit of her oscar.  A family of faith extends their love out to a young man who has had a very hard life.  They don't care what others say or think because they are only interested in doing what they know in their hearts is the right thing to do.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|Good sharpener but with caveats.    Positives: small size, carbide cutters are very effective at removing metal, ease of use (no special techniques)    Negatives: small contact point on the blade (see below, not very stable if much pressure is applied    Due to the small contact point with the blade, pressure is directed onto a very small portion of the blade.  This pressure will vary as you slide the blade through the sharpener (either as a result of nicks in the blade or human error/ inability to maintain perfect pressure).  As a result you will end up with a slightly wavy edge to knife.  Over time this waviness will likely be exaggerated.      I would say this sharpener is okay for a \\"quick and dirty\\" field sharpening of a camping or pocket knife, but I would not use it on fine blade steel or good kitchen knives.    Cheers.

Anchor Bay always delivers a great package, so you get a wide screen presentation, two audio commentaries, a 70 minute featurette, interviews, deleted/extended scenes, trailers, still galleries, etc.<br /><br />Judging by the case of the Millennium Edition, this has a lot more to offer and it's gone down to a reasonable price, making it a great buy for fans of HP Lovecraft, Stuart Gordon, Jeffrey Combs, or flat out fans of gore flicks in general.

0596804822|4.0|Hi haven't read the hole book, but so far is quite good.<br />Althouth,  I have to say that this book is not for starters. I have quite experience in iPhone apps and I find it just fine. But I have the impression that some starters will find it difficult to read. The explanations are not step by step, they are kind of fast peaced specifically when talking about UIKit  and Objective-C<br />The main goal of this book is to teach how to use OpenGL for 3D rendering and does not teach how to use objective-c or interface builder ( no in a clear way)<br />I would say that the real audience of this book is people with at least basic iPhone programming experience and maybe a little bit of OpenGL ES. (Jeff  Lamarche's tutorial really helps)<br />If you want to pass from opengl beginner level to intermediate or high level this might be a good alternative.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The first thing I REALLY LOVE about this blu-ray release is that it is in 1.78:1 aspect ratio. NO BLACK BARS!!! I just don't understand why all directors/producers are not adopting this format, when 16:9 (which equates to 1.78:1) is the most popular HD-TV standard out there. I have yet to see a blu-ray movie that is so incredibly crisp on my Pioneer Kuro. And I am not going to comment on the movie itself, because a lot of people already did that.    I will summarize this review with one phrase said in the movie: \\"When they are sitting on stuff that we want, we transform them in our enemies.\\" That is Cameron's wisdom at work, not to mention all the other hints about how incredibly **not** advanced we humans are. We still have a lot to learn. Enough said.
0385523386|5.0|I was moved by the book. It reminds me of a war story where, if you knew what you were getting into, you wouldn't dream of enlisting. Piper's fling with the drug business was her enlistment.     In the trenches of the prison system she found humanity. The seemingly lightweight stories of cheesecakes and crocheting are just individual brush strokes in an emotional painting. I'm glad she took the time to write the book because I benefited from her experience, her soul searching, and her ability to show me an environment that, gracias a Dios, I'll never see.     I don't understand how another reviewer could think the author was self-righteous, self-pitying and felt no guilt in her crime. I got exactly, and I mean EXACTLY, the opposite feeling. She stated her feeling of guilt several times. In a radio interview I heard, she was asked if her past caught up with her because someone, probably the drug person she was working for, gave her up in exchange for a lighter sentence. She replied that, if that was the case, she harbored no ill will. She takes responsibility for her situation. There is no self-pity there.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|This movie is ridiculous. Yeah, the special effects are nice and all, but the wrong aspect ratio causes the dreaded top and bottom black bars on HD-TVs, so what's the point. The story line is non-existent and as others have mentioned here, if all we get save to repopulate the planet are stupid politicians and greedy mega corporate moguls, I rather fall in the yellowstone cracks when it explodes and die. What a load of you know what this movie became. I feel sorry for the actors that probably felt like they were participating in some kind of super block buster movie. They were scammed.
0385504225|3.0|I was excited but quickly grew weary of this book.  It took me over a month to return to the book after dropping it around pg. 100.

Overall, a disappointment (given the high expectations) but I don't regret reading it.
B000000I02|2.0|One reason why groups like this did not succeed in the progressive rock heyday, and others did, was because they used the term progressive rock as an excuse to noodle/fool around and call them compositions.     There were plenty of fusion bands like Collessium that went into instrumental excursions, but were very professional about it.     Camel, another band from the Canterbury scene, was able to use instrumental excursions as part of the composition in a profession manner    This appears to be just joking around in the studio, and putting out an album
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston's debut album was one of the fastest-selling albums in the history of the US, selling (to my understanding) multiple millions of copies in its first week. That's an incredible feat, but it's made especially mind-boggling when you consider that this album was a debut album.    From the fade-in effect of \\"More Than a Feeling\\" to the final warbling note of \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\", Boston's opener really delivers. Tom Scholz's mastery on \\"More Than A Feeling\\" is evident, with a guitar hook that is instantly recognizable. \\"More Than A Feeling\\" also allows vocalist Brad Delp (RIP) to show us his vocal range. \\"More Than A Feeling\\" is a lament about Marianne, sung from the point of view of someone who \\"closed my eyes and she slipped away.\\" Definitely a well-known (and perhaps slightly overplayed) classic rock tune.    My personal favorite from this album, \\"Peace Of Mind,\\" reminds us to take it easy, because in the grand scheme of things, life's achievements really don't matter. And all I want is to have my peace of mind, after all; to heck with indecision and falling behind.    \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" is one of the better-known tracks on this album, and the third of the \\"triumvirate\\" (if you will) of songs that really boosted this album's sales. Clocking in at 7 minutes, 45 seconds, it is the longest track on this album, with the first two minutes, 45 seconds - called, in this case, \\"foreplay\\" - being what kick the song off. A very instrumental jam that I often find myself nodding my head to (and sometimes air-drumming or air-guitaring to). Then, master that he is, Tom Scholz takes the song in a completely other direction, as \\"Long Time\\" is a tune about another lost lady.    \\"Rock And Roll Band,\\" a fairly up-tempo, infectious jam, clocks in at just three minutes - the album's shortest song. It seems to be a brief biography of what Boston went through (\\"Just another band out of Boston...\\") in their early days. Delp shows off his incredible vocal range on this songas well. Great guitar on this feel-good tune.    \\"Smokin'\\" is another feel-good rocker about the nearly drug-like effects of the music of that time.    The album's pace slows down a bit with \\"Hitch A Ride\\", a beautiful, slower tune about leaving everything behind and \\"heading for the other side\\"... being free from what's holding you back. Great guitar soloing in this one.    \\"Something About You\\" is another personal favorite of mine - a catchy hook leads into this up-tempo song about a lady that catches someone's eye. More catchy guitar, more good singing. All around great song.    \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" is another song about a special lady, who the singer wants to \\"get high\\" on love. Good harmonies in this one and more great guitar work from Scholz.    It's easy to see why this debut album is among the greatest of all time. \\"More Than A Feeling\\" can be found on any \\"Greatest Classic Rock Ever!\\" compilations, but as for the rest of these songs (especially the last four), the best place to find them is on Boston's debut album.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Pre-ordered this headset less than a month before it's slated release.  Got the Astro A40 about the same time, so I had something to compare it with.  Here's the long and short of it:    Pros:  - it works as advertised - chat and in game sound in one headset  - controls are somewhat usable  - I loved the 'mic monitor'; being able to hear your own voice helps, especially when you start screaming like a little girl  - the boom is one of the best I've seen (Astro headset included), it articulates well and very, very adjustable    Cons:  - clip broke the first 5 minutes (I haven't even been using it)  - distortion (not hissing) on the left earpiece occurs, usually when something explodes  - sound quality is ho-hum, to be expected at this price range  - cables are flimsy, particularly the ones you attach to your TV/PS3 (analogue L/R)    All in all, this product is a huge disappointment, despite its merits (and I do so love a well made mic boom, something no other headset could manage).  Thank God I had something to fall back on (the Astro, though I've since stopped using the headset and replaced it with a Sennheiser HD-650 I had lying around).      Until such a time Turtlebeach sorts out quality issues, I suggest steering clear from this product; quite a shame really, it had such potential.
0143036556|4.0|A decade ago I read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize winning classic \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\".  I have just completed reading this recent work by him.  Like his previous work, both take the long view of human history, except this one looks specifically at how different societies have collapsed or endured.  The author examines about a dozen societies across human history, presents the evidence from various sources such as written records, pollen records, weather data from tree rings, dated human remains, etc..., and postulates how these societies endured or collapsed.  The focus is on the environment, and how each of these societies exploited their environment to the point that it could not sustain the local human population any more.  Factors examined include overfishing, soil erosion due to overgrazing by livestock, cutting down of forests, and failure to adopt hunting/farming practices of aboriginal people.  The societies examined include 20th century China, the Mayan Empire, the US state of Montana since the Industrial Revolution, and the Greenland Norse colony that was set up and then abandoned by the Vikings, and post-colonial Australia; hence a diverse breadth.  Each chapter is self-enclosed and could be read independently of the other chapters, which makes the book quite easy to read in parts.  The subject matter is a good synthesis of hard science such as geology and climatology, plus the social sciences; i.e. history, economics, and archaelogy.      I would have given this book 5 stars, except it does not even mention, let alone examine, the collapse of mankind's greatest society, the Roman Empire.  Also, for a book written by an American, the author neglects to mention more pertinent examples for the American audience, such as the fossil fuel industry's impact on the US Gulf Coast, and the decline of the North Atlantic whaling industry over the past 300 years.  Overall, an insightful and very readable book; I just wish it had covered more famous cases.
0385504225|3.0|Like his last two Robert Langdon books, Dan Brown combines okay writing skills to describe a story involving stick figure, unreal characters.  This is Robert Langdon's third book.  What do we really know about him?  He's smart.  He has gotten a lot of awards.  He teaches when he isn't being drawn into some protracted story, that always combines a nice twist on history with a series of ridiculous events, often falling into the science fiction category.  But who and what is the real Robert Langdon?  I read for two reasons: first, for good character development.  I want to relate to the characters in some manner.  I want to be able to understand what drives them. Second, I want to enjoy a relatively realistic story with lots of excitement.  Those criteria suggest that I have given up on Dan Brown.  Readers know virtually nothing about Robert Langdon, Brown's ONLY real character.  Brown's other characters are supernatural forces of good and evil that no reader can identify with.  While the history lessons he presents are interesting, the stories always drag with useless prose that defocus the reader from the story line.  The Robert Langdon character, himself, is a conflict in terms.  At one point he is the genius who presents theories and answers that seem like information stored in a computer database in his head.  Then, within one or two pages, he appears to be a complete goof, not knowing what to do next.  In essence, the other characters are there as straight men/women to support his character.  I only hope that this book doesn't emerge into another dull, convoluted and time-consuming screenplay.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout, because I can squeeze it in on my busiest days.  Even with the warmup and cool down, you're working out for 25 minutes max.  Jillian encourages to work hard every single second!  She combines cardio, core work and strength training.  I consider myself to be pretty fit, but I'm always sore after this...even just level 1!  I feel like I get a great, well rounded workout.
B00335EQ0E|3.0|As these (two) Aice in Wonderland DVD's were purchased as gifts, my only feedback is that they were very much enjoyed
1906694176|4.0|I was thrilled to receive this book as I've read the two previous installments from Stieg Larsson. It was actually a gift for someone, but I will be reading it when she's done. It's great to find a seller that has the UK version since it hasn't been released in the US yet.
B002ELM5HY|4.0|Mark Knopfler can write sings like few other can, with such vivid imagery and clarity. Since his Dire Straits days, Knopfler's music has evolved and Get Lucky is his most refined release to date. His trademark insightful lyrics and guitar wizardry remain. A richer sound though is present on this album with strings and woodwind playing a larger role than in previous releases, usually with a Celtic-like sound.  Impressively, Knopfler's voice sounds fantastic on this album and seems to be getting better with age, with a richer and deeper tone that bodes well for the style of music he creates these days.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|I always love Alanis, but this album is definitely her best since Jagged Little Pill. The first four tracks are fantastic, but Incomplete is the one I'm most in love with. I have worn this CD out since I got it.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|Dido's music speaks for itself; if you like it, you will certainly love this DVD. I for one found that I enjoyed the music even better when seeing/hearing it performed live. For one thing, Dido herself has great on-stage presence when she sings (much less so for her between-song chats, but those are easily forwarded past). She can make a song come alive by her delivery, in a way the CD alone could never do justice. And if you're one of those who finds her visually stunning, well, let's just say there is plenty here to be stunned by. :-)  The lighting on many of the numbers is creatively done.    But visuals aside, the musical performance itself is outstanding. It's a treat to be able to watch the band members in action (the drummer in particular, and also lead guitar). And many of the songs are greatly expanded from their album versions, in almost every case much to their advantage. The bonus CD included in the case is great because it allows you to listen to these expanded versions. My favorite is \\"Isobel,\\" which absolutely rocks in the DVD (but comes out rather bland in the album version).
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This is a superb album, both from a production standpoint (with production by Damian and Stephen Marley) and from a lyrical standpoint.  The Hip-Hop Reggae hybrid is perfect.  For anyone who does not believe hip hop can have a positive message, give this album a listen.  The guest appearances are well timed, and each guest adds to the quality of the album.
0790720434|5.0|One of the best movies of all time.    Not scary, not sad.    Not violent, not preachy.  No flying monkies or scary witches.  Dumbo's monther does not get put in cage.  Bambi's mother does not die.   There are no growling, menacing wolves/dogs, coyotes.   There are no loud noises, ghosts, bullies, or children victimized by mean siblings/cousins/parents etc.  No threatening, no bad words, No in your face talk, no put-downs.    This is an enjoyable, funny, and uplifting movie.  It is a family movie without being dorky!    You can't help but be entranced by the plot, which centers on 10 year old boy & girl cousins in England in the 1800s, meeting for the first time, both of whom have had little in the way of parental contact.   The girl is snobbish and aloof from having grown up lonely and cared for by servants in India and the boy is self-pitying and inactive, convinced that his poor health spells his doom.   Self absorption abounds...until they unexpectedly discover each other's existence.   Will these two strong willed children become friends?   Will they join forces and discover a secret garden?  Why is it secret?      Kids are the stars of the film, and whenever you have adults out of the way and kids in charge, children love the movie!  There's a bit of magic that children accept and love and even some adults want to believe in.      This film teaches the power of persistence and belief in yourself, and the power of having a friend.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This story is just unbelievable and very touchy. It shows a dog's loyal wait for his  beloved owner. This just confirms the unconditional love and bond, animals develop for their loved ones. I openly recommend this movie. It is a must see, especially for animal lovers.
B000002N3N|4.0|I only recently discovered this album by Enya, as for years I only knew it through her \\"Paint the Sky with Stars\\" CD. It is a nice CD, and it shows Enya experimenting more with synthetic orchestral sounds like \\"Anywhere Is\\" and with a more pop atmosphere on songs like \\"On My Way Home\\", though not as overdone like she did on her recent \\"Amarantine\\".     The low points are \\"From Where I Am\\", which sounds like a new version of \\"No Holly for Miss Quinn\\", and \\"Tea House Moon\\", which sounds like something off of a quirky sci-fi soundtrack and not like the peace and beauty it was supposed to represent. Otherwise, the album is nice and has a good variety, ranging from the hushed \\"Athair Ar Neamh\\" to the lively \\"On My Way Home\\". I do have to agree, though, with other reviews that some of these pieces are not exactly unique. I believe it was with this album that Enya began to be caught in the web of sameness and sadly has not gotten out yet.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|What a powerful story, a remarkable leader, and incredible direction here.  Invictus is the true story of Nelson Mandela and the '95 Rugby World Cup.<br /><br />Eastwood easily could have pulled on the emotional strings and presented the harsh realities of the apartheid in South Africa.  He also could have appealed to any impatient movie watchers by inserting graphic details of the grueling years of captivity Mandela endured.  But instead this story begins immediately after he was released from prison and is elected president.  He has the daunting task of rebuilding the country after the fall of apartheid.  Could sports really help a country unite?<br /><br />The acting here is impeccable.  Morgan Freeman has turned in tons of great performances, but never has he felt more perfect for a role.  Plus Matt Damon did great with his accent and mannerisms of the team captain.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the actions and words of Nelson Mandela.  He reminded me of Mahatma Gandhi.  Despite his lengthy imprisonment and his country's animosity that lingered from the past, he refused to act out of hatred.<br /><br />\\"THIS IS NO TIME FOR PETTY REVENGE\\"<br /><br />This film never gets too political.  It focuses more on human relationships and the country's underdog rugby team.  Invictus is an extraordinary true story about the power of the human spirit.  A movie not to be missed

B001NXDSLG|3.0|I switched over to a blu ray system a few months ago, and with very few exceptions, the visual and audio improvement blu ray offers over standard DVDs has been nothing short of phenomenal.  This disc I found to be one of the exceptions.<br /><br />One of my blu ray players can play videos, so I compared a few scenes playing my old VHS version alongside the new blu ray disc.  From an audio standpoint, there was no comparison:  the blu ray sound is spectacular, and simply blows away the older eight track mix used on the earlier versions of \\"Woodstock\\".  Visually, however, there was little difference between the blu ray and VHS version, and with the blu ray discs carrying a $60 plus price tag, that's unacceptable.  That earned this release a one star demerit, in my view.<br /><br />Another half star comes off for not offering a version of this blu ray release with simpler packaging.  I realize this set was issued in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the concert last year, but, really, the wasteful, kitschy packaging this comes with probably adds $25 dollars or more to the cost.<br /><br />It was still great to see this fine documentary again, especially with the added performances contained on the director's cut, and the additional performances on the second disc.  A five star rating for the film, reduced to three and a half for the reasons outlined above.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|In my humble opinion Nas is the best MC alive. I know what you are thinking now, what about Jay. I happen to like Jay, but lyrically Nas hands down. I was waiting to find the song on this album that was just ok and did not hear it. The colabo between these two is amazing. Money well spent and I look forward to future project from these Legends. For me album of the year! Hopefully Nas can get his first grammy and Damian can get another. They deserve it.
B001CTDH76|5.0|O.K., so I was in my local library looking at their DVD collection trying to find something I wanted to watch.  I came across \\"The Mentalist\\", but had never seen or even heard of it.  After reading the blurb on the box, I thought it might be interesting, but also thought \\"eh...\\" and put it back on the shelf.  I was a little leery because I have checked out other TV series with which I was unfamiliar and ended up being disappointed.  However, after failing to find anything that looked more interesting, I grabbed \\"Mentalist\\" and checked it out.    I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised by this series.  My husband was watching the pilot episode with me and both of us were immediately drawn into the story.  It was fascinating and that same fascination continued through every single episode in this season.  I didn't think any of the stories were boring or dragged at all.  Simon Baker, who plays Patrick Jane--the mentalist and lead character with a tragic past--is a critical reason for the success of this series, in my opinion.  He plays his character with humor, charm, and an exuberance that is highly enjoyable to watch.  The fact that he's good looking doesn't hurt either. :D    As at least one other reviewer mentioned, the formula for this series reminds me of a law-enforcement version of \\"House\\"--but only in the sense that it centers around a highly unique, off-beat, fascinating character with an uncanny ability to see things and solve mysteries that no one else can quite figure out.  Unlike House, Baker's character has a well-mannered, smooth charm.  This and the way he is always several steps ahead of everyone else also reminds me of Aloysius Pendergast--the FBI Agent character who features prominently in the novels by Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston.    Additionally appealing is the interplay amongst the main characters.  Despite the fact the mentalist is the key character, the others are written in such a way that they are integral to the show.  All aregood actors, as well.  The stories are highly creative and interesting, the dialogue is great, and it's entertaining to try and figure out who committed the crimes.  It is also quite clean with almost no bad language (I love the fact that they say \\"crap\\"--I think it's hilarious) and very little raunchiness.      Overall, my family and I loved this show.  It's very high quality and extremely entertaining--definitely worth watching.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|While the x41 are great for 5.1 Dolby Digital sound offline, it's horrible during online play. People will complain about having a reverb effect and it's completely hard to fix it due to the cheesy production of the talk-back cable. If the talk-back cable was made of higher quality parts then the reverb effect wouldn't be a problem and this product would be near perfect!
0425200450|3.0|Let me start by saying I love Agatha Christie.  And Then There Were None is my favorite book of all time.  That's why I was a bit disappointed to slog through reading one of her most famous books, Murder on the Orient Express.<br /><br />The mystery itself is a good one, the old room locked from the inside conundrum, and the solution at the end was good and the explanation of clues satisfying, but I found the story telling itself to be very tedious.  It's a seemingly endless recitation of interviewing everyone on the train, then searching everyone's luggage, then interviewing everyone again and again.  It was very tedious to sit through multiple interviews with every single person of interests on the train.<br /><br />Part of what I, and most people, enjoy about a mystery is trying to guess \\"who done it.\\"  But the large number of characters and red herrings in the story, and the amount of time spent on them, made me give up trying to figure out the puzzle and want to just skip to the last chapter so it would be over with.<br /><br />All in all, its still a Christie novel so that makes it a good one, but I'll never read it again.

0143116738|5.0|This book was talked about on a tv program.  Saying kids are being left behind in school, as some learn differently.  My wife talked to me about it, as we have 5 boys, 2 of which do well in school.  The other three boys are much smarter at other things but have really struggled in the formal classroom setting.  My wife wondered if this book would help us as parents help our boys succeed even with all the odds stacked against us.  I thought that we should try and told my wife that this would be worth it even if it just helped a little bit....Wow what an eye opener as we read this book an learned we had 9 senses instead of just 5 and read the stories of the great successes others have had even though they stuggled in school..... We learned lots that we are applying to are boys and to ourselves.
0141439793|5.0|When I read the words written by Jane Austen telling me that Catherine Morland had been in training to become a heroine I knew I was going to enjoy this novel.  This book allows us a glimpse of Jane Austen as a younger woman, as a beginning novelist and as a woman with a lovely sense of humor.  There isn't any denying that this book, then titled \\"Susan\\", was the first to be sold by Austen to a publisher.  There it languished in some forgotten corner for thirteen years before she tried to get it back from a firm which had no intention of publishing it.  Ultimately she had to borrow the money to buy her own book back.  People can probably get involved in scholarly discussions as to whether or not any revisions were made to this book by Jane Austen before her death, but that's isn't what I'm interested in.  I wanted to read this book because I just couldn't believe that Jane Austen had really written a book which I didn't like.  At all!  Thankfully, I proved myself to be both right and wrong.  I completely and thoroughly enjoyed this book and am only sorry that I allowed film versions of the book to turn me away from actually reading what the author had created.<br /><br />Catherine Morland became a heroine for me to love and to sympathize with, while I watched her grow and mature.  At the age of seventeen Catherine is quite young to be starring in her own novel but according to the times she lived in this was a perfectly respectable age for a young woman to become a wife and mother.  Up until the time Catherine was fifteen she was the epitome of a tomboy, much preferring playing games outside to learning the skills to help her in her housekeeping and marriage.  When she was around fifteen she discovered novels.  It was the most delightful thing to read Jane Austen's words in defense of her heroine reading novels and particularly Gothic novels.  The information contained within those books colored so much of Catherine's thinking and when she is given the opportunity of having a prolonged stay in Bath with close friends and neighbors she is ecstatic.  Mr and Mrs Allen will become the surrogate parents of this young woman for their stay and upon arrival Mrs Allen continually bemoans the fact that she knows nobody in Bath, therefore she and Catherine are restricted as to who they can talk to.  Very quickly Mrs Allen meets a former schoolmate, Mrs Thorpe, her son and daughters, and from then on Catherine can move in society with Isabella Thorpe and later her brother John Thorpe.  One process leads to another and Catherine makes the acquaintance of Eleanor and Henry Tilney along with their father Colonel Tilney.  Austen uses Catherine and her new friends to demonstrate the social limits and restrictions on young women of the time.  She also illustrates how easily deceit can be camouflaged as friendship.<br /><br />My reading of this novel was enhanced greatly because I was sharing the experience with a friend.  We discussed the novel from the viewpoint of our previous interest in the writings of Jane Austen.  I must rank this book right up there with my other favorite novels now.  Yes, there is melodrama.  Yes, Catherine is a very young woman prone to being fooled by others.  Thankfully it is also about Catherine conquering her fears caused by the melodrama by facing reality and Catherine learning to see the motives of other people more clearly.<br /><br />This novel is Jane Austen at her most natural, at least it seems that way to me.  She is obviously having fun with this writing, she also seems to genuinely like her heroine and the other \\"good\\" characters in the book and shows us the deceitful characters we all need to recognize and avoid.  Austen seems young in thought and spirit in this writing.  The prose is light and very readable.  It is also a relatively short novel.  I would have liked for it to be longer (of course!) but specifically because I would have liked for some of the characters, even major characters, to have beenpresented in fuller form.  The only portion I'm definitely a little disappointed with happens in the final chapter, but I'll let you discover that for yourself.  Who knows, you might not have the same reaction at all.  I do highly recommend this novel as a truly great early novel from a writer who was to go on to a fame which probably would have truly surprised her.  This Penguin Classic edition is a wonderful version of this novel.  It contains much information aside from the novel which was a great help for me while I was reading.  The Notes from each chapter by Marilyn Butler, Exeter College, Oxford, were invaluable in keeping me in the time frame of what was happening in Austen's world when this book was written.  I also highly recommend this specific edition of Northanger Abbey.presented in fuller form.

1400096936|5.0|I'm pretty stingy when it comes to issuing 5 star ratings but The Power of the Dog is a genuine tour de force.  It's an ambitious novel, epic in scope, providing a cynical look at 30 years of the US War on Drugs.<br /><br />The story follows the lives of a large cast of characters from San Diego to New York City to Mexico to Central America.  The characters are on both sides of the law, including a DEA agent trying to atone for a mistake early in his career, the head of the powerful Federaccion in Mexico and his ambitious nephews, a high priced call girl, an unconventional Roman Catholic priest, a small-time Hell's Kitchen hood turned hit man, shady CIA operatives, the mob, central American drug cartels, communist rebels, and corrupt officials.<br /><br />Winslow conducted years of research for this novel and has incorporated numerous historical events.  In many cases the characters in the novel are either loosely based on, or are a composite of real people.  The torture and murder of a US DEA agent in the novel is based in large part on the similar abduction and brutal murder of Special Agent Enrique \\"Kiki\\" Camarena.  Father Prada is loosely based on the real life and death of Juan Jes&uacute;s Posadas Ocampo, a Mexican bishop of the Catholic Church who was shot `by mistake' in an airport parking lot by drug cartels.  The novel incorporates the 1985 Mexico City Earthquake, the Iran-Contra affair, the 1994 assassination of Mexican Presidential candidate Luis Colosio, and NAFTA.  The novel seamlessly blends fact and fiction and manages to demystify some of the shady politics and clandestine operations related to US involvement in Nicaragua and its futile war on drugs.<br /><br />This is a novel that succeeds on all levels.  It's a page turner, even at more than 500 pages.  It's well researched and provides fascinating insight into the drug cartels, the futile effort to stop the flow of drugs into the US, the role of the Catholic Church in the drug war, and atrocities committed in an effort to quash communist uprisings in Central America.  Winslow's prose is lean, but effective.  The characters are flawed and fully realized human beings.  This is a complex novel.  There is no clear right or wrong.  It's a world of `lesser evils' and `sacrifices made for the greater good'.  There are no easy answers in The Power of the Dog.  The long suffering DEA agent finally realizes his career-long goal, but whatever victory he has is hollow.  The price paid and the personal sacrifices made, in the end, outweigh the futile effort.<br /><br />This is an exceptional novel but it may not be for everyone.  I've enjoyed a number of Winslow's other novels, but aside from the writing style; they have little in common with this novel.  The other novels I've read have been considerably lighter in tone.  This is a much more ambitious novel and may not appeal to anyone expecting lighter fare.  This is also a novel that is not for the squeamish.  It's extremely violent.  It's brutal and cruel.  People are tortured.  Innocent children are savagely murdered.  It's not always easy to read.  And finally, some people may be turned off by the politics of the novel.  Winslow is critical of the US Government's role in Central America, NAFTA and the futility of the War on Drugs.  If your politics lean far to the right, and you're convinced in the noble necessity of the War on Drugs, The Power of the Dog may not appeal to you.<br /><br />In my opinion though, this is a powerful novel that delivers the goods.  It's an enlightening, compelling read, and it's the kind of novel that stays with you long after you've finished it.  It's one of the best novels I've read.  Highly recommended.o quash communist uprisings in Central America.  Winslow's prose is lean, but effective.  The characters are flawed and fully realized human beings.  This is a complex novel.

If your politics lean far to the right, and you're convinced in the noble necessity of the War on Drugs, The Power of the Dog may not appeal to you.    In my opinion though, this is a powerful novel that delivers the goods.  It's an enlightening, compelling read, and it's the kind of novel that stays with you long after you've finished it.  It's one of the best novels I've read.  Highly recommended.
B001HN69B8|2.0|Being a huge fan of both Johnny Depp and Heath Ledger, and not to mention a love how should i say it...trippy movies? I saw the previews for this and was so excited. However as much as i want to say it was a great movie, it was not. Heath Ledger did a great job, but Johny Depp, Colin Farwell, and Jude Law only appear in the movie each for like 5-15 minutes. It was really a let down as at least i thought they were going to all have seperate rolls but, unless you have seen the movie you understand, they do not. The plot was very dull, but the visuals (when they finally came back after the movie would dull down for like 45 minutes) were pretty nice. But overall, big letdown.
030745455X|4.0|I enjoyed this follow up to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but I think it's fair to say it comes up a little short when compared to the first novel.  It's still very good, and better than almost any other suspense novel you're likely to pick up, but not nearly as good as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  (Of course Tattoo did set the bar pretty high)<br /><br />The Girl Who Played with Fire moves a little slowly at first, focusing on a largely irrelevant storyline involving Salander hiding out in the Caribbean.  The novel doesn't really kick into gear until mid way.  I'm a patient reader though so the diversion didn't bother me much.<br /><br />My second beef is a little more significant.  I was disappointed that after creating such fully developed, complicated, and flawed characters in Tattoo, Larsson gives us some pretty thin characters in this novel.  The freakishly huge henchman who can't feel pain seems better suited for a James Bond novel than a character-driven series like this.  Similarly, the world famous ex-boxer, lesbian musician girlfriend, and the disfigured, sadistic, master-criminal all seemed like stock characters.  The primary characters remain well developed though and Lisbeth Salander continues to be one of the most memorable characters in recent fiction.<br /><br />My third and final beef is the far-fetched near-death experience one of the characters has near the end of the novel (I don't want to give too much away here).  I don't object to plot twists but this one strained credibility a little too far (so much so that I may have actually 'rolled my eyes').<br /><br />All in all though The Girl Who Played with Fire is an entertaining novel that builds momentum effectively (once it gets going).  The central characters in the novel are as compelling to read about as they were in the first novel even if some of the secondary characters are too cartoonish.  The second novel in the series may not be as high caliber as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but its still a very good novel, and well worth reading.<br /><br />The ending of the novel could have been tagged with \\"To Be Continued...\\"  But that's OK.  I have the third novel ready to go and plan to read it very, very soon.<br /><br />NOTE:  If you haven't read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you should read it first.  You won't have any trouble following whats going on if you read this novel out of sequence, but doing so will reveal countless spoilers about the first novel.novel, and well worth reading.

B002SQFZ68|1.0|Very low quality recording and mixing compared to the Blu-Ray of David Foster:Hitman, The Police Certifiable Blu-Ray, Michael Bolton Live at the Royal Albert Hall Blu-Ray, Andrea Bocelli Live at the Tuscany Blu-Ray. Jon Bon Jovi consult David Foster on how to record and mix high quality Blu-Ray. Your songs are great but it is wasted on recordings if you do not seriously consider high quality recording and mixing. Blu-Ray discs are lifetime recordings... wake up Bon Jovi and do not be low-budget in terms of mixing and recording!!!
B0039SFKSW|3.0|I have tried in vain to embrace this album for the past week since it arrived by free shipping from Amazon (I had my doubts from day one). If you love John Wetton's voice and his self-absorbed lyrics, then this CD is for you. This is basically a John Wetton solo album backed by three of the best players in the business. What also put me off is the lyrics. I can't tell whereby many of the cuts are either about divorce or being \\"born again\\". In either case, I don't like either topic. So to make a long story short, here are the few winners for me: the only 5-star cut goes to the opener - Finger On The Trigger. I also understand that this one took years to work out to this point. Great rocker and rhyme scheme. The remaining 4-star cuts are: End Of The World, Through My Veins, Listen Children, and I Believe.<br />Somehow they pulled off back-to-back positive to negative cuts with Listen Children and End Of The World, although the difference is very subtle. The remaining 3-star cuts are: Light The Way and the Beatlesque Don't Wanna Lose You Now. The 1-star turkey award is a toss-up between the Beatlesque Emily and the \\"too many religions in one song\\" Holy War. The rest rate as 2-star. On the bright side, this CD will save me a 400-mile trip to Houston on a week night to see them later this year. By the way, I have been a die-hard Asia fan since I ceremoniously opened the shrink wrap on their debut vinyl album the day it was released way back in 1982. I even found some of the John Payne era to my liking, but this Omega offering is worse than Arena. Sorry. At least I'm honest.
0312382464|5.0|Sharon Kay Penman really does bring history to life in her novels. With a lot of authors these days, they don't stay true to the facts, but work around it just to make the story interesting (Phillipa Gregory is one of the worst). Penman proves that history can be fascinating, no matter when the time or place. \\"Falls the Shadow\\" is the second book of the Welsh trilogy, and though it was not my favorite (the first one was way better) it still left me enthralled, and I learned so much more about the time then I ever knew, as in the previous one and will in the next. Sharon Kay Penman will remain one of my favorite authors so long as she keeps churning out great novels like this one.
B001I2URGQ|4.0|As the title suggests, the whole theses of the book is that our society, which was once valued a strong back and hands and then moved on to valuing left-brained and MBA-type thinking, is going to be moving to creative, design-type thinkers.<br /><br />The book has a section on how the brain works, which ties in with some of the other books I have read on the brain.<br /><br />One reason given for the right brain people becoming the new ruling class is that left brain activities can be globalized. So programming, tax return preparation, legal work, etc., which were all expensive, well-paid jobs in the left brain society can be moved offshore where people can complete the tasks less expensively.<br /><br />This reminds me of John Naisbitt's book, Megatrends, where he talked about the increase in computerization and mechanization, but there is still a need for a human touch.<br /><br />\\"High touch involves the ability to empathize with others, to understand the subtleties of human interaction, to find joy in one's self and to elicit it in others, and to stretch beyond he quotidian in pursuit of purpose and meaning\\".<br /><br />At the end of every chapter is a section on things to do to increase right brain thinking and to help gain an appreciation for right-brained things like visiting a design museum or going to an art museum, listening to classical music, etc.<br /><br />When you think of traditional right brained activities you think of things like painting, music and all the creative tasks which I don't generally consider myself to be very good at.<br /><br />I was relieved to find out that right brain activity not only refers to that type of creativity but also refers to the type of creativity that I have used in entrepreneurial situations which has helped me with my business's success and much of what is pointed to is that design helps develop products that are easier to use. The example they use is the voting machines that were so confusing (poor design) to use that people spoiled their ballots.<br /><br />Although the book over-advocates that the right brained people will be the winners, I think it had to do that to make the point. In reality, my opinion is that we need a healthy balance between the right and left portions of our brains.k over-advocates that the right brained people will be the winners, I think it had to do that to make the point.

B0031ZWZR2|1.0|FlashForward had an interesting premise and some inate potential but in the end it's an utterly useless proposition. At least half of the characters were annoying as hell and when I say annoying I mean Nikki and Paulo from LOST type of annoying. The quality of the writing changed radically from episode to episode as well. And then there's the unfortunate fact that the series wasn't renewed last week which means that buying this set is akin to buying part of a novel that will never be completed. I truly feel sorry for those customers who wasted their hard earned money on this.
B0018AK9RA|2.0|I just cannot get into this cd at all.  I love their 70's albums and some of the 80's ones but this one is just too slow moving for my taste.  It has about three good songs on it and thats it.  I hope their next one is a return to form because this one put me to sleep.

0393072231|5.0|Great Book!  Got the Book on Tuesday evening and finished reading it on Thursday morning.  I could not put it down.  Best book of its kind I have ever read.  Wish there was more detail on some things but it shows what fools steer the ship on Wall Street and Government.
B0037MNKDC|4.0|True Blood is the HBO adaptation of the popular Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels. While I have not read the books, my wife has and she says that at least the first episode (Strange Love) is somewhat more graphic sexually and is more violent than she thought it would be. On that note, this show has a lot of nudity (both male and female, but mostly topless women), graphic sex scenes (human and vampire), bondage, occult references, graphic violence (somewhat bloody), homosexual characters, insensitivity to overweight people, and even a murder... so if any of those things are not to your liking you might want to pass on this series.<br /><br />If you are still reading this, you will want to know that this is also a very clever and well produced series that does seem to work combining the harsher elements with a good bit of humor and surprisingly well developed characters.<br /><br />Set in Louisiana after vampires have \\"come out\\" because they can now get a synthetic blood to curb their thirst of humans, this starts off with most people's impression of what a \\"hick\\" town is like in the more remote parishes. The main character, Sookie, is a fairly straight laced \\"good girl\\" who works as waitress in the local bar. She also happens to be able to read minds (not a spoiler, this is stated in the show \\"synopsis\\" and is obvious very quickly). Things get interesting quickly when the bar gets it's first vampire customer (\\"Bill\\") and around the same time, Sookie's handsome brother finds himself in some legal trouble.<br /><br />The casting was fairly good and the actors are mostly believable, which is a relative term in reference to a vampire themed HBO series. The special effects have been kept to a minimum, so far, so the plot is mostly story driven.<br /><br />This is not for everyone and there is a big difference between reading about the subjects I covered in the first paragraph and seeing it expanded and shown in full HD in your living room. Definitely also not for the younger crowed either!<br /><br />CFH

B0039SFKSW|5.0|\\"To rise from the ashes of the Phoenix...\\"<br /><br /> If you're an avid fan of the original version of Asia, then by all means, buy this album. Most of the Omega tracks are, by far, more superior than Phoenix. Sonically and audibly speaking, it definitely surpasses Phoenix. Melodic Rock, AOR, Prog-Pop or whatever you wanna call it, they're classic pioneers at their finest. Aged to perfection, in my opinion. As they seem to be termed as being cheesy, poppy, mellow and old (I'm old so go figure), it's disheartening to notice these humiliating remarks knowing we grew up with their songs. Does it matter? What's the difference? It would be a disappointment if not one track from Omega had somehow made a musical statement at least. I find such denials and objections pretentious if that's the case. And, dude, it's not hard rock or heavy metal, for crying out loud. You're barking up the wrong tree.<br /><br /> In today's burgeoning musical trend, it's quite a relief having these guys back. Certainly not mainstream but an alternative to the present music industry's absurd whims and implacable madness. A preferable option of the average 'midlife crisis' driven mature audience (and proud of it, too) with ears for harmonic rock progressions augmented with symphonic overtones and spruced up with euro-pop sensibilities. It's an acquired taste and it doesn't get any better than that. Years ago, most of us longed for their return and here they are and what do they actually get in return for coming back? Your answer is as good as mine. It's a doggone shame. The truth is, they get most of the flak here in the states. If there was to be a web poll survey of being the most controversial and intriguing 80's rock band who made a comeback, I'd pick Asia followed by Journey, with their issues after the departure of their premier lead vocalist, Steve Perry. And to think we have the original members of Asia back in our midst and still rant about it doesn't seem to register in my brain cells at all. In Europe and Asia, their return is widely acknowledged and their fan base is broader than you can imagine.<br /><br /> They are an unusual pedigree of musicians. Call them, dare I say, nostalgic, but that's Asia. They even took risks at some point and went out of their norm in their latest release. From the aberrant \\"Don't Wanna Lose You Now\\" to the beatlesque \\"Emily\\", a bonus track released under the Italian import, Frontier Records, and the bluesy \\"Drop A Stone\\", another bonus track released and promoted exclusively for the Japanese import, King Records. Even though the three tracks are deemed unconventional by many, I regard them as a breath of fresh air. I really wouldn't recommend purchasing the Japanese import since it's pretty pricey unless you're a completist or a consummate audiophile. For collectors, a mint/near mint cd and a well kept 'obi' strip that goes with it can carry a high market value in the long run. Incidentally, love the inspired Roger Dean artwork for Omega since 2010 is The Year Of The Tiger in the Chinese Horoscope.<br /><br /> After their successful 25th anniversary worldwide reunion tour (Fantasia-Live in Tokyo being the most widely acclaimed and officially documented in audio/video formats), the fab four decided to put out a record of original materials in 2008. Phoenix was then launched as a continuum of where they left off during the 80's. Phoenix was a protoype or, shall I say, a litmus test to determine the band's next stage of existence. Omega therefore, in my opinion, is the end result of Phoenix' critics galore of sorts, fanning out claims and accusations of phoning it in. In my observation, despite Phoenix' encouraging and favorable reviews, it was a lesson to be learned and from it they reinvented and reworked themselves and thus gave rise to Omega. I consider it as a tactical prosumer effort based on fans' and critics' feedbacks which perhaps made this new release come to light. Unfortunately, the naysayers see Omega unsatisfactory the same way they see Phoenix. Despite the malevolent remarks, what you have here in Omega is a reformed and a refined Asia. Streamlined yet solid and tight. It only affirms the popular theory among the majority of fans that Asia still got the knack for 'catching lightning in a bottle.' Adversus solem ne loquitor. Any description or explanation other than that I see rather dubious.<br /><br /> I will not attempt to compare Omega with the first three albums (Asia, Alpa and Astra) since the trilogy are already hallmarked as classic Asia standards. In my perpective, it seems irrelevant and futile. The review will only end up being overly critical. Considering that these are new materials, the review should rely on their own merits, on their own strengths and flaws and not relying from other sources, what is present should not be based from the past. The music speaks for itself depending on, as I've said earlier, your acquired taste. For argument's sake, if there weren't any existence of Asia, Alpha and Astra at all, where would you think you'd be basing your review on Omega? From Phoenix? Omega has elements quite different from Phoenix - it can stand on its own. So can Phoenix. Neither the audacity to even compare it with the Wetton solo releases nor the Wetton/Downes collaborative 'Icon' projects though the Asia version of \\"Finger On The Trigger\\" is more to my liking. Even to a lesser degree comparing it among the Payne-era Asia catalogue since they have their own distinct style and attributes. Yes, I do admit they are considerably good in their own way, believe it or not. I'd be a hypocrite if I stated I wasn't even impressed with some of their releases. I respect both versions of Asia. Everyone is entitled to their own tastes and opinions on what's cool and what's not and that's okay, it's everybody's given right to express theirs but as a forbearing purist, I'm inclined to differ in taste and opinion. It just so happen that they still run 'through my veins'. Ad finem fidelis.<br /><br /> Thus, in conclusion to my impulsive chitchat, if you're into Asia featuring John Payne, have an unrelenting dislike towards Mr. Wetton or with the other members, Messrs. Howe, Downes and Palmer or the whole band in general (whether it be professional or personal), or a former fan that just gave up on them after their 1982 eponymous debut album, or a 70's prog-rock retrospective enthusiast who dwells only with the individual members' past or occasional association with their former groups King Crimson, Yes, ELP and The Buggles or you're just not into the reformed Asia at all, have this utmost prejudicial tendency towards their new release, ticked off with these unforeseen circumstances or just having a really bad day, then needless to say, my dear friend, don't dabble yourself in Omega and save your hard-earned money and reviews (or should I say frustrations) because this album is definitely not meant for you.<br /><br /> If you happen to find yourself in one of the above categories I just mentioned, just click 'no' for an unhelpful review.

B002WY65VU|1.0|Keep in mind I am not a fan of zombie movies in general. But I do appreciate campy horror classics like The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, Elvira, The Addams Family (90s era), and the Scary Movie sequels.     Zombieland started off like your typical zombie thriller and ended like your typical zombie thriller. There isn't one piece of originality in the script or acting. Any attempts at humor fall flat. The only noteworthy bit of humor is when they pay homage to The Ghostbusters.     Woody Harrelson portrays a Twinkies loving zombie-exterminator in the movie. And along the way he finds a few college aged kids that have survived the zombie pandemic. The highlight of the movie is when they end up at Bill Murray's Hollywood Mansion.     Throughout the movie I felt bored and cheated because this was yet again another zombie movie that resembled a dozen other zombie movies. Zombie movies have become trite and predictable. And this is one of those zombie movies that you should not spend any money on. Grade: D+

They are able to correspond with letters in a common mailbox and must try to find a way to get together in person since they form such a strong bond just from writing.      Keanu Reeves gives a better performance than usual, while Sandra Bullock is reliably good.  They do the emotional scenes well.    It moves a bit more slowly than necessary, but has a satisfying conclusion.
0307455874|4.0|For someone the right paints as radical, our fourty-fourth president is reasonable and even-handed in this wide-ranging, yet concise, look at American politics. The president's tone is chatty, engaging, and personal; the book is sprinkled with anecdotes, pithy quotes, and glimpses into life as a senator.    The chapter titles are Republicans and Democrats, Values, Our Constitution, Politics, Opportunity, Faith, Race, The World Beyond Our Borders, and Family. The book has an epilogue.    In \\"Republicans and Democrats,\\" Obama credits recent Republican presidents for wanting to do the right thing for the country. But he singles out Reagan as the first in a series of divisive GOP personalities that include Bush, Rove, Cheney, and Gingrich. On page 32 Obama writes, \\"...after Reagan the lines between Republican and Democrat, liberal and conservative, would be drawn in more sharply ideological terms.\\"    Obama is not alone in this assessment. In a best-seller published in the midst of Reagan's presidency, _The Closing of the American Mind,_ author Allan Bloom comments on Reagan's referring to the Soviet Union as \\"the Evil Empire.\\" Bloom writes:    \\"What was offensive to contemporary ears in President Reagan's use of the word 'evil' was its cultural arrogance, the presumption that he, and America, know what is good; its closedness to the dignity of other ways of life; its implicit contempt for those who do not share our ways. ...The opposition of good and evil is not negotiable and is a cause of war.\\"    Conversely, Bloom also credits Reagan for his commitment to values.    This reviewer agrees with Obama's criticism: you may gain broad popular appeal with easy slogans, but you trade it off for flexibilty in negotiation skills.    A politician in a high office who is not able or not willing to see shades of gray is dangerous in this nuclear-tipped world.     Obama's views on the Constitution are thoughtful (not a surprise since he taught the subject for ten years at the University of Chicago), and this chapter is engrossing. Viewing this document through the lens of an African-American was enlightening. Obama is even handed in his approach, praising the brilliance of the Founder's foresight yet ultimately assessing the Constitution's value progressively and viewing it as a living document. That it has been amended 27 times is, in part, testament to that.    The \\"Politics\\" chapter has an anecdote about Bush and Rove. Obama relates a story \\"...about the negotiations surrounding a first round of Bush tax cuts, when Karl Rove invited a Democratic senator to the White House to discuss the senator's potential support for the President's package. Bush won the senator's state handily in the previous election -- in part on the platform of tax cuts -- and the senator was generally supportive of lower marginal rates. Still, he was troubled by the way the tax cuts were skewed toward the wealthy and suggested a few changes that would moderate the package's impact.    \\"Make these changes,\\" the senator told Rove, \\"and not only will I vote for the bill, but I guarantee you'll get seventy votes out of the Senate.\\"     \\"We don't want seventy votes,\\" Rove reportedly replied, \\"We want fifty-one.\\"     After reading this passage, I paused to wonder if this was an example of the kind of coalition-building that was behind the Iraq invasion.    In \\"The World Beyond Our Borders,\\" Obama begins with details about Indonesia and then flatly states that most Americans cannot locate Indonesia on a map. There's some great imagery in this chapter, where Obama writes about being in Indonesia: \\"...I'm haunted by memories...the frenzied sound of a gemelan orchestra, the musician's faces lit by fire...\\"    Overall, I'm impressed by Obama's astute observations about the American experience.    For example, he makes the important point that, although the sixties are over, the issues that surfaced  then and were not resolved, ultimately will need to be resolved.    I read this book and I think Obama is being reasonable. So, why does what Obama writes in this book seem so audacious?    Fairly early on in the book, Obama reminds us that it is not audacious for Americans to ask for much: clean air, clean water, an education for our children. How did we come to believe that it is audacious to expect these things; further, that government cannot help us attain them?    If I have a complaint with the book it is that Obama may not be radical enough in some areas. Each of us needs to see ourselves, and the earth, as sacred and not merely tools of entrepreneurs. Ultimately, I do not thnk that Obama is radical enough to put the interests of the worker above those of the working-house.     Obama quotes Justice Louis Brandeis: \\"In a democracy, the most important office is the office of citizen.\\"    So why is it not also true that in the workplace the most important asset is the worker?    This reviewer can only hope that the regressive and downright ugly workplace atmosphere that began to appear in this country from 1980 onward can be reversed worldwide so that both worker -- and entrepreneur -- are winners. This would be a great benefit not only to Americans but to the world.    Let it begin in America.

B0036SUQWA|5.0|I was skeptical about this movie after hearing mixed reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The humor was certainly not slapstick, but it wasn't too much of a \\"thinker\\" either.  It was a great combination of amazing actors and excellent script.
B001TZQITM|5.0|This is a very well made case, that can handle the toughest conditions.  It is also a great size, while some people may prefer a larger case that can store more, I find this to be the perfect size  (The camera carrying space dimensions are 6x4x3\\" as other reviewers have mentioned).      I highly recommend this case for anyone that wants a tough and compact camera case.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Short and sweet, as the movie has been out for quite a while.    This was a FUN movie.  Remember when Hollywood knew how to make fun movies?    Humor, Action, Drama, Great Special Effects, Well Written Script and Plot.  Also, somewhat politically incorrect in parts, something welcome in the PC orientated Hollywood.      The Star Trek franchise needed a reboot, and JJ Abrams instead gave it a kick in the ass, in the very best sense of the phrase.    All your favorite characters are back, but given knew life by talented actors and a truly well-thought out script.    Due to interference by a time traveling Romulan, however, the characters you knew so well and the universe THEY knew has been radically altered, and all of their fates are once again unknown.      Ordinarily I would bemoan the time traveling device because Star Trek (all the series and too many of the movies) unfortunately drew from that well too often.      This time the scenario fits perfectly with what they need to accomplish with the reboot, and if they follow through in the subsequent movies with the concept of a known yet UNKNOWN universe, they will have served the franchise well.    Complaints are minor.      Hard as I tried, I had a hard time warming up to the actor in the role of Chekov.  He gives it his all, and is not a bad actor, but he LOOKS more Irish than Russian to me, so I found the role not quite convincing.  He would have been right at home in Angela's Ashes.      Also, I know Star Trek is known for somewhat, er, cheesy make-up for aliens, but I thought this reboot could get away from that.  However, I found Scotty's alien companion to be just that sort of not quite convincing xeno.      Other than that, it was a great ride, and I am hoping Abrams makes the very most of what he has wrought with this new vision.    Again, FUN!
B0039TD7RC|4.0|The original Exile LP, the now remastered version, is the one to get if you do not yet have this Stones classic.  It is one of the great rock records of all time.  The second disc of extras on this 2-disc deluxe is OK but in no way essential unless you must have each and every track the Stones released.
B001U3AM6S|4.0|This book gives you insight into another world of hardship, and the absolute lack of fundamental rights that  people--especially women live through every horrible day and night. Unforgetable!
0345495004|2.0|Not impressed. As one of the earlier reviews stated \\"another book about an adulterous woman.\\" That s kind of how I felt. The writing was well done but I never felt a connection to any of the characters. In fact, I held more sympathy for her husband than for any of the \\"heroes\\" or \\"antiheroes\\". I felt that the main character complained too much and relinquished her independence to live with a brilliant man. Of course, such human issues are not the fault of the writer. Still, the writing seemed to change in the past 80 pages. It was a bit more disjointed and not as descriptive, as if the author had a brilliant idea and wanted to get it out before she might forget it. While some parts dragged, the most important climatic moment left me feeling underwhelmed and unsatisfied. Perhaps, Horan wanted to make characters with which people had difficulty sympathizing. However, in order to do so, there has to be more depth in the characterization which in turn creates more conflict within the reader. Without this, the main characters appear superficial and unworthy of the reader's time. While the secondary characters, are more dynamic and interesting.
B00133KHCY|5.0|First I have to say I LOVE this movie.  I am somewhat cynical and rough around the edges, but this movie got to me.  \\"August Rush\\" is lovely fairy tale about a little boy, Evan Taylor, who has grown up in a state home, who is a musical prodigy.  Unbeknownst to him, he is the son of two musically gifted parents (played by the wonderful Kerri Russell and the brilliant Jonathan Rhys-Myers.  Evan is convinced he is still loved and wanted by his parents, and rightfully, as his mom was tricked into giving him up by her duplicitous father.  We meet the young lovers who connect on a rooftop, discussing music and the connection it is in their lives, only to be spearated.  Evan is sent away, his mother thinking he died in her emergency delivery.  Evan think he can reach them through music and he hears music in the most mundane of sounds.  The opening is a bluray delight(between image and audio) with Evan \\"conducting\\" the wheat colored fields of his orphanage as the wind pours through it.  He runs away one night to find his parent, convinced if he can play his music where it can be heard they will find him.  He meets a street grifter (a wonderfully dispicable Robin Williams) who tries to exploit his gifts to line his pockets and even gives him the stage name of August Rush.      The movie relies on a lot of coincidences and leaps in credibility, but the fairy tale tenor of the story makes this permissible as we feel we are watching a fable, but the genius of the movie is the realistic look and feel of the film and characters.  Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) is brilliant.  The film is set on his shoulders and he delivers.  He is winning, lovable, and as an actor, Highnmore has a poise well beyond his years.  The film is by turns, funny, aching, lyrical, and ultimately it has its moments of sheer joy, and it earns every one of them.    The films was a must-have for me on Blu-ray between the gorgeous cinematography and fabulous meoldic score by Mark Macina.  The film is stunning in 1080p.  There is not a single flaw on the print or the high-def transfer.  Blacks are inky, colors have wonderful saturation, and there is a light veneer or grain in the image retaining the film-like look.  The Dolby TrueHD sound is a revelation, as opposed to the lossy standard track.  The scene where August plays his rhapsody the church organ is booming, exciting, with enormous detail added.  This is a fine example of how high def only enhances and serves the story rather than special effects and explosions.  The current price of this disc makes it a no brainer if you are a fan of the film.  To those new to it, this is the way to see it.  It's perfectly suitable for children (my 8 yr old LOVED it), although it is not a children's movie.  Highest recommendation.
030738683X|3.0|As with most of Austen's books, the plot is simple because the drama is within the people and their relationships. Catherine Morland is a sheltered girl who lived with her family in the country and never had nay friends or suitors. When a friend of her parents decides to take Catherine to live in the city, her whole life changes. She immediately befriends Isabella Thorpe, a deceitful and self-centered girl. Isabella's brother, John, attempts to court Catherine but she remains unswayed for her interests lay with Henry Tilney. As the story continues, Isabella becomes more demanding and almost tries to force Catherine to be with John. Eventually, Catherine finds her voice and refuses John's advancements. Yet, it takes Catherine almost the entire novel to completely come into her own. The title comes from the abbey that Henry Tilney's family owns. Catherine, who spent the majority of her youth reading Gothic novels, is completely enthralled with the abbey so when she is finally invited she just about bursts at the thought of hidden chambers and locked away skeletons. However, what she finds it nothing like what she had planned and when her imagination runs away with itself her relationship with Henry is put at risk.    I really enjoyed this novel much more than I thought I would. I found other works by Austen to be boring, dated, and bombastic. Yet, Northanger Abbey is charming and has a message that still rings true today: don't allow yourself to be naive or prone to deceit because people will take advantage of you. In addition, I liked that the romance in the novel took a backseat to Catherine's development. Though it felt sluggish at times, I was never disinterested. I also loved Austen's defense of novels and the Gothic elements in this book.
0307266303|2.0|The last thing you want to do with an awe-inspiring story of incredible endurance is to drown it in a sea of exaggeration.  Mr. McDougall uses so much cliche and hyperbole that by the time the actual facts unfold you are too weary to fully appreciate them and they no longer stand in contrast to anything else that was written.  Combine this with unnecessary salacious details and gratuitous obscenity and it becomes obvious that Mr. McDougall is mentally stuck writing for the eighteen year old consumer of Men's Health magazine and not the larger public audience that this book could have reached.
B000PAAJYW|2.0|In 1999, the film Magnolia was nominated for three academy awards including best supporting actor (Tom Cruise). With such an all star cast, including John C Reilly, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, and Jeremy Blackman, it is shocking that it did not win more actor/actress nominations! The plot of the film is a bit confusing though similar to Crash and Happy Endings, in which various story lines are presented that appear unrelated only to link up by the end of the movie. In this film, the stories all involve some aspect of the network television industry. The story lines include:        Tom Cruise as a seller of a chauvinistic \\"help book\\" called Seduce and Destroy which teaches men how to seduce women without feeling any emotional connection.         Philip Seymour Hoffman as a male nurse for Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) who is an extremely wealthy network owner and husband of Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore)         Philip Baker Hall who is the game show host for the show \\"What Do Kids Know\\" (a precursor to Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader) and father to coke addict Claudia (Melora Walters)         John C. Reilly plays a police officer who meets Claudia when he is called to her house on a noise complaint.         William H. Macy plays Donnie Smith, the winner of \\"What Do Kids Know\\" in the 1960s who is now forgotten and facing money troubles.         Jeremey Blackman as Stanley who is the current leading contestant on \\"What Do Kids Know\\" but is about to buckle under the pressure.    Each story is extremely tragic and there is little levity in the entire movie. With the running time passing three hours, this film can be best described as oppressive. For those who love depressing movies, tragic characters, and superb acting...this film is absolutely for you! However, be aware that there is an extremely odd event that occurs within the last half an hour of the movie that made me cock my head to the side and wonder \\"what is the director thinking?!\\" Still, it does not distract too much from the film's story. All of this is typical of the director Paul Thomas Anderson who is responsible for such modern classics as There Will Be Blood, Punch-Drunk Love, and Boogie Nights. If nothing else, watch this movie for Cruise's performance alone. His depiction of an insane chauvinistic pig is so much like his current personal state that it is a wonder it was more than ten years ago and not filmed yesterday! Though it's longer than most viewers would like, or even be able to stand, it was worthwhile.
B001BYLFE4|5.0|I've been pleased with the X-Men series overall, and X-Men United is a fitting end to the trilogy. The plot is a bit far-fetched - Jean Grey being an all-powerful super mutant - but it does up the ante (including one memorable death scene). My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer - it seems as if the film is rushed in only 100 minutes. Otherwise, if you liked the first two, you'll love this one.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|I was first introduced to disaster films when I was in college and immediately fell in love! From Danger: Volcano in New York to Dragon Wars to The Day After Tomorrow, I was hooked on apocalyptic movies for good. When I first saw a trailer for 2012, I was honestly scared. I had heard about the Mayan calendar and knew that some people believed that the world will end in two years but I just thought that it was a revival of the Y2K nuts and by 2013 we would have a Family Guy episode mocking the event just like we did in 2001. However, the trailer for the movie actually frightened me and I refused to see it for fear I would have some sort of attack in the theater. When it came out on DVD a couple of weeks ago, I couldn't help myself. The disaster lover in me needed to watch John Cusack get washed away by a giant tidal wave that pushed an air craft carrier onto the White House lawn. After the movie was over, the credits rolled and I had realized that I had fallen asleep twice, I thought that 2012 was even worse than Komodo vs. Cobra and not nearly as compelling.    2012 follows the same formula as most disaster movies, dead beat divorced dad realizes that the world is going to end and wants to save his children and ex-wife who are more shocked that he has come back into their lives than they are by the extinction of the human race in less than 2 hours (movie time). Cusack plays a writer who has written a book about the apocalypse that no one has read and those who did hated it...oh, won't they be mad when it all comes true and they only read the SparkNotes version! The first disaster occurs when Los Angeles is ripped apart by an earthquake and falls into the ocean and the nation is shocked (hasn't the discovery channel been telling us that for decades?). Cusack, kids, and ex-wifey all escape and try to outrun the apocalypse by flying to Las Vegas (because of course Las Vegas will survive the apocalypse...it's like a cockroach) and eventually China where the government is housing giant \\"arks\\" that will only hold a certain amount of people but can assure that those people will survive the disaster. Of course they meet all kinds of international people on their journeys all of whom are walking stereotypes.    The movie runs over two hours for an event that could be summarized in one sentence: only science fiction authors and wealthy Americans can defeat big waves. The most irritating aspect of the film is that the acting wasn't good but it wasn't terrible therefore it was difficult to make fun of! It was also disturbing that everyone's favorite characters die and dumb daddy dead beat lives with the promise to his children of being a better father. Personally, I was not invested in the daddy-kiddie relationship and therefore did not care about his future role model status.    Some of the graphics were cool but not scary. Yet even this did not sustain my attention for though I didn't miss a second of The Gathering, I fell asleep twice during 2012 and knew that I hadn't missed anything. So I guess the moral for the future is that when 2012 actually comes, I'll probably sleep right through that as well!

B00337KM2S|4.0|Though I originally had no interest in seeing Up in the Air when it first came out, its numerous Oscar nominations made me rethink my point of view and I decided to rent the movie to see if there is finally one George Clooney movie that I liked. I went into this movie thinking that it would be just another Clooney movie that showed how snarky he can be without having any substance. I was greatly surprised!    The plot of the film is very simple, Clooney plays a man whose job it is to fire people. His company is hired by another company that wants to downsize but does not have the heart to let the people go themselves. Instead, Clooney flies in to personally fire each person that the company has decided to let go. While others view his job as rat-like, he honestly enjoys his career. He is not sadistic nor does he take pleasure in people's unemployment, but he loves to constantly be on the road. Clooney's character boasts that he is well on his way to reaching 1 million miles after which he will be given a plaque, a special flyers card, and the chance to have a conversation with a pilot. It is a great achievement for any constant flyer for only 6 other people have ever reached 1 million miles. Because he flies constantly, Clooney has no home and lives out of a residential hotel when he is \\"home\\". This doesn't bother him though because he enjoys the travel life of different hotels and restaurants each night.    His entire life gets thrown off course when a new college graduate is hired by his company and she develops a way to do their work remotely. Instead of flying to each agency to lay off people in person, she has created Skype-like software that allows Clooney's company to fire people from their desk at the home office. Before this program can be implemented, Clooney challenges the young woman to join him on the road so she can see how difficult and sensitive his work is. Their time together is touching and humorous in a completely sincere and not cliched way.While on his travels, Clooney meets his female counter-part in Vera Farmiga. Though both have sworn that they will never marry and only enjoy having a relationship when they are in the same hotel, Clooney starts to think about giving up his traveling life and settling down. Of course, none of these female relationships are what they seem and nothing goes according in plan.    I thought that this movie was incredibly interesting and quite tender without being sappy or annoying. I had an inkling where the film was going to take me but I still enjoyed \\"the ride\\". In this struggling economy and extremely high unemployment rates, I found this movie to be incredibly timely and poignant. I enjoyed Clooney's character as well as his acting which is something that I have been unable to say in the past. The female supporting roles were equally powerful and I was very impressed by Anna Kendrick's performance. Though some viewers thought that it lagged at times, I disagree with that perception. Some parts were certainly not as dramatic at others, but I completely enjoyed the entire film and highly recommend it!

B000H0MKO2|4.0|Less than 12 hours after I finished this novel, I ran out and rented the movie. Though they share the same title and some of the same plot points, the novel and movie are completely different. In order to make the movie stay within in an hour and a half, the director/screenwriter took out a main character who was crucial to the novel. In doing so, the film has a completely different feel than the movie. The moral of the book is to basically watch one's back because a friend or co-worker could be your greatest enemy. However, the moral of the movie is that you should never tell anything to a reporter even if you are sleeping with her and she seems sweet. In other words, the enemy is from the outside. Due to this, the ending of the novel and that of the film are almost exact opposite of each other. While the film eliminated a pivotal co-worker character, it added Nick's son. Though the scenes between father and son were humorous, I don't believe that it added anything to the movie. In contrast, the book only mentions Nick's son once or twice which further shows Nick's alienation from his family and any kind of love. Lastly, the novel puts a great emphasis on Nick's relationship with the owner of the Academy of Tobacco Studies (known as the Captain). It is this relationship that gives Nick any hope for the future and the Captain acts as Nick's only ally. Yet in the movie, the profoundness of this relationship is stripped down. Overall, I think that the movie and the book are wonderful! I fully enjoyed both. I have to say that I might have even enjoyed the movie a bit more than the book (but the jury is still out on that).
0525421033|4.0|When i first started this book i thought that i wouldnt really get into it. But the more i read the more i was absorbed into the story. I found myself wanting to know if she stayed or if she goes. It is an easy read and only roughly 200 pages. the story is good and the main character is strong. I thought the ending could of had a few more lines but i found out which way she went so i guess i was ok with that. A really good light read.
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Vicky Cristina Barcelona is about two friends who decide to take a vacation to Barcelona. Vicky is a straight laced academic who is engaged to an equally straight laced man. She wants to spend the majority of her time in libraries and research repositories working on her thesis in Catalana identity. Cristina is basically the antithesis of Vicky in that she is fun loving and free-wheeling. The way that she is introduced makes me appear like a loose woman who is lost in life. Cristina has come to Barcelona to find herself. What both women find is an attractive Spanish artist who woos both women, even though Vicky tries to resist. Though Vicky believes herself in love with the artist, she refuses to continue a relationship with him. Instead, Cristina takes up with him and eventually moves into his villa. The movie really gets interesting when the artist's wife tries to kill herself and must move in with Cristina and the artist in order to protect her. Of course, drama ensues.    Though the movie is filled with strong performances, I still found it to be boring and the plot hackneyed. Some reviews state that the movie was created so that Allen could watch Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz make out. I believe that that is a true assessment. Overall, I was underwhelmed and do not recommend this film to anyone except hardcore Woody Allen fans.

0618871713|3.0|To call this a \\"coming of age tale\\" would be inaccurate. Written as a memoir, Bechdel describes how her self-discovery and acceptance of her sexuality helped her understand her father and his demons. The artwork is absolutely excellent, both humorous and thoughtful. The reader feels as if he or she is flipping through an old family scrapbook. The intimacy of the story, language, and pictures creates a strong connection between the reader and the characters. Bechdel is able to balance some of the gut-wrenching moments in the book with humor that does not negate the sorrow but alleviates some of the pain.  An excellent story about family and the journey to self-discovery. As Bechdel begins to accept the fact that she is a lesbian, she is able to find greater compassion and understanding for her father who (though in a heterosexual marriage) is also gay.

That is, until next year when it begins all over again.<br /><br />The whole process it takes to get into the games when chosen is so ridiculous. First they give you a whole make-over as if you are going to enter a beauty contest. They then parade you down in outfits that represent your district for the country to see.

B002VECM6S|4.0|Last week, The Blindside opened in theaters across the country heralding a superstar cast including Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, and Kathy Bates (among others). The movie was advertised as a feel-good movie about a young homeless boy who finds love and family in a white southern family. However, the movie is much more than that! The story is really about a young African-American boy, Michael Oher, who lived in the Memphis projects with his drug-addicted mother. At a young age, he was taken from his mother and placed in various foster families from which he always escaped. By coincidence, he was enrolled in a preppy, white, christian school where he was considered an outcast by both students and parents. At this time, Oher was homeless and found food by collecting alreayd eaten popcorn leftover after athletic games at the school. One day, Leigh Ann Tuney (Sandra Bullock) finds Michael walking down the street in the cold and welcomes him to sleep on her family's couch. Within months, Michael becomes part of the family and is accepted by Leigh Ann's husband, and two children. Of course there are difficulties that arise, but Michael is soon placed on the football team. With the help of a tutor (Kathy Bates), Michael becomes eligible to attend college.    The aspect that makes this feel-good movie more than just a stereotypical tearjerker is that it is a true story with as much pain as it has happiness. The first 45 minutes of the movie has the audience clutching their guts in hopes that the sorrow experienced by Michael will hopefully subside. Though his circumstances improve a great deal, the film never lets the audience forget Michael's past and therefore keeps it ever looming in the back of the audience's mind. The characters are real, and they should be, because they are based on real people.    Overall, it is the perfect holiday movie! It makes everyone want to jump up from their seats and give back to those less fortunate. I was not a fan of Sandra Bullock before this movie, but I now have to say that she did an excellent job. I often find tearjerker movies to be annoying and shallow, which this movie is neither. The autenticity of the story is further bolstered by the ending of the movie in which actual photographs of Michael Oher and the Tuney family are projected on the screen alongside the credits. There is even footage of Oher being drafted for the Ravens by the NFL in which Oher and the Tuney's are shown together. The sentiments and values that this film embodied touched my heart and I am sure that it did the same to the other viewers in the theater. It may even get me interested in football! (though...probably not)

B002SQ364Q|2.0|As a huge fan of the 1960s music, history and culture, I have to admit that my expectations were a bit high. Still, Taking Woodstock did not even come close to my hopes for this film. The plot centers around the character of Jake Teichberg and the motel that his mother and father own. The motel has been sitting vacant for years and the family is in jeopardy of losing the place to the bank. In a certain twist of fate, Jake discovers that a music festival has been turned away by two towns in upstate New York. He is able to secure a permit to have the music festival held in his own town of Bethel. Suddenly, the producers of the festival and their staff are lowered into Bethel by helicopter. With them come thousands of audience members who inundate the sheltered town with hoards of hippies. During this historic event, Jake is battling with himself and his family over his need to leave his hometown and secure a future for himself elsewhere. Though Jake never actually gets to see Woodstock or any of the singers who performed, he does meet his first transvestite, smokes his first joint, and trips on acid. Though he basically missed the entire event that he helped save, he comes out the other side an adult.    Though it sounds like a great premise, the way that the director (Ang Lee) actually created the film made it drab and boring. Jake came off as being an extremely sheltered, neurotic, and whiny boy who was caught between his own life and that of his parent's. It is clear that his relationship with his parents created a great amount of stress for him, but his personality made it almost impossible to root for him. In addition, the characterization of the audience members was entirely one-sided. While the town laughed at them and called them hippies, Ang Lee did not do anything as a director to make the audience feel differently. The only character that was in the least bit dynamic was the transvestite Vilma who was played by Liev Schreider. Even Lee's portrayal of concert producer Michael Lang seemed one-dimensional with Lang being the sage-like hippie who spoke almost like Yoda. Perhaps the most upsetting, is that because Jake never gets to witness any of the actual festival neither does the audience! To add insult to injury, none of the music from Woodstock was even played in the movie. Basically, this is a film about Woodstock without any elements of Woodstock included in it. Overall, it was a huge bust and I believe that Woodstock experts and novices will find this film to be greatly disappointing.
0380820846|1.0|How in the world this book has gotten 137 four and five stars, I do not know.  This was one of the most boring books I have actually almost finished!  I had read some of the others in this series and thought they were pretty good.  I kept reading, thinking this one would get better.  Finally, toward the end, I realized I had been wrong all along and had wasted my time.  I didn't finish.  These were two of the most uninteresting lead characters ever.  That after 10 years, Colin finally noticed and fell in love w/ Penelope after a few conversations and a color change in dresses just did not work for me.  Even her love for him doesn't make sense.  Supposedly, he smiles a lot and is friendly.  So what, so are some toddlers, but they're not good leading men either.  So he wrote a little, big deal.  There wasn't anything about him to get excited about.  I just didn't get it.  I did not buy the love story here @ all.  I do not recommend this one in the series!!!
B002ONC9NC|3.0|Last week, I flew to the movie store to rent An Education which was nominated for three Academy Awards including Best Movie and Best Actress. Though the acting with very good, the screenplay with extremely tight, and the movie was an overall success...I was disappointed.    The film has been described as a \\"coming of age tale\\" and it is just that. taking place in 1961, Jenny Mellow attend private school where she excels as a student and a musician. Her ultimate goal, and that of her parents, is to graduate and attend Oxford. Due to this, she spends almost all of her time studying and playing in the band. One day, on her way home from band practice, an older man named David overs her a ride home. Though she is hesitant at first, she finally accepts and the two instantly have a connection that is fostered throughout the rest of the movie. Jenny is terrified that her parents will not approve of their relationship, but to her great surprise they are ecstatic (though completely naive). Slowly, Jenny realizes that David is nothing like what he seems and his true self is far more devious than she could have ever expected. However, she is so enchanted by him that she is willing to throw away everything that she worked for in order to be with him. That is, until she discovers the complete truth about David and must decide to either follow her heart or her better judgment.    Overall, the movie is predictable. There is nothing new that hasn't already been done in previous films such as Lolita (though Lolita is far better!) or American Beauty in which an older man seduces a younger woman. Consequently, the young girl discovers the truth about the man who sexually awakens her and the resulting drama threatens the happiness of both parties involved. Thus, this story is not new or is its production anything different from its predecessors. With a screenplay written by Nick Hornby, I expected a bit more from the writing but was disappointed. Overall, it's worth a viewing because it is a good film but do not expect much from it. If you want depth and complexity, pop your old VHS of Lolita or your beaten up DVD of American Beauty into the player and enjoy one of the classics!

0199233381|1.0|Here is a scholar who thinks (page 113) that Athens, not Atlanta, is the capital of the state of Georgia, and that it is vital to the reader of his 202 page tome that the (rather insignificant) city of Sparta, Tennessee, \\"...was the setting for the famous movie of pre-civi rights racial intolerance, starring Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier, In The Heat of The Night\\".  Wow, thanks for sharing that in a history book about Greece - VERY PERTINENT!  Seriously fellow lovers of culture - do not buy this awful book.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|It's not often that I am left speechless in hearing some new music, but this is a KNOCKOUT of a musical work.    I'll leave it to the other reviews to detail the sounds taking place, but one thing is remarkably clear:    This young woman is a STAR, and an artist ready to make a serious mark on the contemporary music scene.    WOW!
B000Y7U98W|4.0|AV and PQ were great 5 stars. I got bored watching 50-60% of the movie. I guess for me anyway I was hoping for something with more action and stuff like Star Wars or Star Trek....but it was still a good Sci-fi. Get it.
B0039TD826|5.0|Enough of this! Please!! I have heard and read this refrain too often: \\"Exile On Main Street\\" is the Rolling Stones best album, even though it doesn't contain their best songs. (Blah, blah, blah.)\\" This is not true. \\"Exile on Main Street\\" (EOM) is their best album for lots of reasons, including that it contains their very best songs!    First, there is no better Stones hit song than \\"Tumbling Dice.\\" Period. With the possible exception of \\"Satisfaction,\\" no other Stones song gets more cover by local bar and club bands, or gets more radio play, television and movie soundtrack play, or higher inclusion on Top Hits lists (and \\"Satisfaction\\" had a ten-year head start!). Like \\"Satisfaction,\\" everyone on Earth knows \\"Tumbling Dice\\" by its first three notes.    Beyond that, there is no collection of rock, blues, or country-influenced songs on any album that set or raise the bar higher than EOM. Here is a great test of a good rock-n-roll album: Does it meet the \\"Oh, just one more song\\" test?  Frequently I have desired to listen to a song, something that's been rolling around in my mind, off one of my favorite rock albums, whether that be from The Beatles, Jimmy Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, The Who, The Grateful Dead, etc. Whether that song be on a CD or my iPod, I'll set it up and turn up the volume. Often as the song winds down, I'll want to hear it again. So, as the music player begins to play the next song on the album's playlist, I'll hit the 'replay' button. But with EOM, I never get to the previous song because I am immediately swept up in the next song. I think to myself, \\"Oh, I just need to hearone more song!\\"    Think of the amazing songs on this album!! There is not one dud! Here are some of the best of the best (by the way, if you've heard the Stones play any of these songs \\"live\\" - and I've heard them play almost all of them live, you know immediately that you are getting the best stuff): Soul Survivor, Ventilator Blues, Stop Breaking Down, Loving Cup, Shake Your Hips, Let It Loose, Shine A Light, All Down the Line, and Sweet Virginia. WOW!  These songs aren't just in my Top Twenty Rolling Stones songs, they're in my Top Twenty All-Time songs.    If I try to listen to one song on this album, I invariably end up listening to the entire album.    People have frequently discussed with me the subject of the greatest albums of all time. In all honesty, there are only two albums that are anywhere close to \\"Exile On Main Street\\" in greatness. In terms of sheer popular appeal, you have to tip your hat to Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller.\\" Its not my kind of thing, and I've never owned it, but its place in music history is secure.    The second possibility, in terms of creative expression, is The Beatles' White Album. I think this is even more true than the argument that can be made for \\"Sergeant Pepper's.\\"    But both of these are clearly bested by EOM. It is brilliant, dynamic, spiritual, textural, and the produce of history's best band at the height of its creative power. It is the greatest album in history.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|5 star rating. Best war movie ever!!!!! Blu-ray was excellent. AV and PQ were 5 Star.
B003AO1SVS|2.0|This album is a huge departure from their past work and I don't like the direction they are heading.  It's too slow and lacking the fun, raw sound of The Big Come Up, Freakthickness and Magic Potion.  I appreciate the fact they are trying to change it up but it's not for me.  Check out Radio Moscow if you want to listen to music similar to the Black Key's old stuff.  They also happen to be produced by The Black Keys.
B001DF68MA|5.0|This was a great buy.  Our little guy loves it.  I wasn't sure about purchasing a front mounted bike seat verses the typical one's.    Assembly was a snap.  The seat comes on and off easy for the times you are riding alone.  Getting him in and out of the seat alone isn't hard. The design of the front cushion where he can hold on and/or rest his head is cool.  And he's done both.  The quality of the product is first class.    Having him in front has lots of benefits.  I can keep an eye on him better.  He can see more and is enjoying the ride a lot more being in front.  The issue of riding with your knees sticking out as you peddled has not been an issue.  I really don't notice a difference.    Highly recommend this bike seat.

0061020710|4.0|I guess everyone has those authors floating around in their peripheries, often recommended by friends and favorite authors, who you know you'll like but just never have gotten around to reading. Terry Pratchett has been one of those authors for me. Everything about my tastes has suggested that I'd like him, and sure enough, having read The Color of Magic, I expect I'll be reading more of Pratchett in the future.     I began with The Color of Magic because it's the first of the Discworld novels, even though I'd heard that it wasn't Pratchett's very best. I'll admit that it does feel, at moments, like a first novel. The plot is episodic, really several shorter stories with the same key characters. As the first in a series, the novel strays sometimes from the story itself to describe the Discworld universe. These moments seem tangential in the immediate reading experience, though I'm sure they're important for fleshing out a storyworld that can sustain the series.     Still, the novel has a certain undeniable magic. Pratchett has a talent for word-play, and the characters and situations are likable and absurdly funny. The running motifs, like the luggage and Death, are called upon deftly to create the best moments of the novel. And in the various creations in this novel alone--the circumfence, the imagined dragons, the eight spells, and Discworld itself--Pratchett exhibits a seemingly endless imagination. I've copies of the next Discworld novel and the recent, acclaimed Nation on my shelf, and look forward to exploring more of Pratchett's world.

B001QOGYBI|4.0|This turned out to be just a \\"fun\\" movie to watch...  In actuality,    I would have to say the dialogue was definitely geared towards adults more than children..  Would recommend this to anyone who just wants to watch something for relaxation...
0307593525|5.0|I am not the first, but I have been using this book to gradually educate myself about cooking. The Sauces section is an eye-opener, and I am soon to tackle meats.<br /><br />I don't expect a movie to be made about my efforts, but that is not the point. I am learning, and eating  well in the process. Thanks, Julia.
0307454541|2.0|This does not really review the book in general (there are plenty of more interested and insightful reviewers already appearing in this forum), but I did want to critique one aspect of this book, which I find annoying even in small doses, and which absolutely saturates this book.  I think an appropriate term is the \\"Di Vinci Code Paragraph Hanger\\".  Basically, the idea is that the author has a character seeking something through a chapter or section and then abruptly ends the stream by hinting at revelation without telling the reader what it is. Here's an example(not actually from the book):<br /><br />\\"Detective Jasper meticulously searched the dank room.  He looked on the shelves and under the bed, beside the nightstand and even in the loose ceiling tiles, but just as all his predecessors had, found nothing of interest.  He collapsed onto the bed, sighing into his hands, resigned to never solving the mystery of El Cortes.  Then, he saw it. Looking down through his fingers he saw what everyone had missed for all these years - the evidence that put everything together. 'Ah-ha', he whispered.  'I've got you now.'<br /><br />Meanwhile, across the lake, Mrs. Butterbottom sat down to afternoon tea; it was a pleasant day out, much better than the usual indian summer in these parts.  She breathed in the cool salty air, glad that she had taken her neice's advice to retreat from her hectic schedule for a fortnight...\\"<br /><br />Annoying, huh?  The whole idea is to keep you reading for another couple of pages to see what the heck it was the Detective Jasper discovered.  I find it to be a cheap trick and can be found at least a couple times in every single chapter of TGWTDT. It drove me absolutely.... Did you know that they are looking at making a movie out of this book?  Supposedly Brad Pitt's onboard.  Should be good.... Bonkers, it was bonkers which the reviewer had been driven to.<br /><br />Ok, snark notwithstanding, I think I would recommend this book in general, but you have to be prepared for about 100 iterations of this little convention.about 100 iterations of this little convention.
0142410373|2.0|My 7-yr old daughter got this book as a birthday present.  I usually try to read all the books she reads so I know what to expect for her.  I read it, and I don't find it appropriate for her at all.  Modern children are growing up with values much different than the old days, or at least the norms projected in this book.  A principal hurting and humiliating children in her school the way Trunchbull does and that too publicly is unimaginable in today's world.  In a child's world - this is like Taliban's atrocities.  And that there is nobody this principal is answerable to - not even to law enforcement - is absurd in today's world.  Given that the setting of this book is mostly at home and at school - children will try to imagine themselves in Matilda's position and may believe that these situations do happen. Resorting to magic, and getting rid of Trunchbull only through trickery - gives a very wrong message to children.  I am going to have my daughter wait until she is 10 before she reads this book.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|Well well well. If I could, I would rename this film \\"Rediculosity\\". For it is one the most pointless, plotless Mini-Adverts I have ever had the mis-pleasure to watch. Speaking of Mini, I just bought one and so sat through this mental agony to see some nice shots of the car in action. In any event, I have never witnessed so much potential and talent wasted (except maybe in Godfather 3). Not much of a story or plot, and the stunts kill the suspension of disbelief for anyone with a functioning brain. Mind you, I like mindless fun but this movie didn't even do that for me.<br /><br />Somehow I can predict that this review will not be considered...\\"helpful\\"...as most people vote by whether they liked this film. And yet, if you enjoyed the first Italian Job (and I did), I can almost guarantee that this one will leave you flat and unfulfilled - kind of like the chick in the movie. I mean, where the \\"bleep\\" is Benny Blimey Hill anyway???<br /><br />If you any of you have seen Billy Madison, there is this great line where someone (after listening to Billy answer a question) says \\"we are all stupider for having listened to that\\". Well, I sort of feel the same way about the time I wasted watching, and listening to this.<br /><br />:0 Cheerio!
B001TD1XWG|5.0|When I first heard \\"The Carter\\" was releasing a rock ablum I was like \\"this is about to be a piece of ?*&^\\" Then i listen to it. This is Wayne's Greatest ablum ever. I love all music, I guess thats why I like it so much. All I see on here is people puting it down. All the tracks are lovely. Maddonna and Wayne did thier thing on \\"Revolver\\". \\"Prom Queen\\" is a classic in my eyes. \\"The Price Is Wrong\\" \\"Knockout\\" all of 'em are nice. For those who say this is not rock it's not what you would describe as rock, it's his own version of rock, which is good. And for those who say this was a crappy mistake, I suggest you listen to it again and LISTEN TO YOUR BOY WAYNE SPIT.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|The DVD box is really well put together, and seems like it won't fall apart when you touch it. The episodes are clear and are a nice change from the crappy youtube quality that we have been forced to watch until now. After a few minutes into the first episode i began to notice the music is different, after 2 episodes it is very obvious and a little annoying. (Amazing how greed almost stopped this show from coming to DVD, but with a little change in music the series is finnaly here.) As a daria fan i want to give it 5 stars but due to the music changes and the episodes not being fully intact i leave it with 4. If your new to Daria you won't notice. But if you watched the show when it aired then you'll know what i mean. Still it's better to have something rather then nothing. Long live Daria!
0316044938|4.0|Alice Sebold takes us on a unique journey to what she feels is everyone's unique heaven, told through the thoughts of a murdered 14 year old girl. From her treacherous rape and murder to her resolve of the fact that life must go on without her, a quite different approach in a life-after-death storyline takes place.  As other reviewers before me have summarized the storyline, I will suffice it to say that The Lovely Bones turns out to be a good read although at times it can become very lengthy and somehow cause the reader to stray.  I would definitely recommend sticking to it and finishing the book as there is no comparison to the movie.  Hands down, don't see the movie until you have read the book. The book does not disappoint!
0810993139|4.0|\\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" is a great book. It's very entertaining with the illustrations and the way it was written. I recommend this book for someone in middle school, not so much for someone in high school.<br /><br />I chose the book \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" because I don't really read a whole lot, so I was looking for a book that was fun, entertaining, was a going to be a light read, and this book was all of those things. All of the reviews I read said that this was a great read for kids in middle school, for someone who doesn't spend a ton of time reading. The reviews also stated that this book was a very humorous read, and would keep you entertained and laughing all the way through. And that's why I chose this book. Because I was a very small kid n middle school, and I felt the same way at times just like he did. Like I was in middle school with a bunch of hairy men!<br /><br />The author \\"Jeff Kinney\\" Is very biased and uses overgeneralization and stereotyping in his book \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" the one I noticed the most is stereotyping: In the book \\"Greg Heffley\\" refers to certain groups as either \\"The Nerds\\", \\"Morons\\", \\"Cool Crowed\\", \\"The Hairy Ones\\", and the \\"Bullies.\\"<br /><br />To be completely honest, I'm not sure that the author \\"Jeff\\" has any real reason for writing this book. Sure every child in middle school goes through some problems, and feels smaller and weaker than everyone else, but unless this book is about him as a kid, I don't feel that this book is 100% accurate to how life as a middle school kid really is.<br /><br />I agree with what the reviews were saying about this book. It is really good, funny, and easy to read. But I do agree that this book is for a much younger aged person to read.<br /><br />So in all, \\"Diary of a Wimpy Lid\\" is a great, easy read, but is for a more younger audience. But if someone of my age read this, they would have to have the same humor as me to enjoy it any.<br /><br />Senior English Student 2010
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I rented this movie and enjoyed it greatly. My only complaint is that I feel it was a bit long and dragged out at the end. Also, Downey muttered a bit at times, so I watched it with closed captions to catch some of the dialogue.<br /><br />Otherwise, it exceeded my expectations! The chemistry between Downey and Law is full of charm and charisma and they click in their versions of Holmes and Watson. They draw you in quickly! Downey steals the show with his hip, swagger, brilliant, funny portrayal of Holmes. I never read any of the novels or have been an uber-fan of anything involving Sherlock Holmes, but it is not really necessary in order to enjoy this movie. There is a fine blend of action, suspense, and intrigue. Not to mention some very funny stuff too! The costumes and the overall atmosphere takes you back to a more primitive time in our existence. Purist fans who have read the novels will find flaws, but they always do.<br /><br />I am also a sceptic who believes everything can be explained through science. Anyone who believes David Blaine can really levitate is a stupid moronic idiot! No one can REALLY do magic! Holmes uses the science of that time, maybe exadurated a bit in the movie, to prove fact from fiction.<br /><br />Even if you are not a fan of Holmes and Watson, I highly recommend this fine film! I may be right or I may be wrong. Take care all! Carpe diem'!<br /><br />[...]

B00371QQ2U|2.0|My rating is for the Blu-ray only, not the movie which of course is one of a kind.  I did a side by side comparison of the HD DVD and the Blu-ray (using the same player, so no difference there). First off, the Blu-ray picture is noisier. Usually this is a good sign, as it indicates that less Digital Noise Reduction has been applied. Unfortunately, in this case this didn't result in more detail (I have no idea why's that. Maybe the people mastering the HD DVD managed to apply more DNR without losing detail). Also it looks like edge enhancement had been used for the Blu-ray, but I'm not quite sure, because there are no revealing halos, so strike that. What's most annoying though is that colors also have been changed with the Blu-ray now being distinctively reddish when compared to the HD DVD. In fact, everyone looks piggish, even Tom Hanks. The colors on the HD DVD are definitely more pleasing.  Why couldn't Universal just have their perfect HD DVD transferred to Blu-ray instead of all this improvement for the worse? And while I'm at it, they could have also forgone all the gimmicky intros which take forever to load.

I appreciate his numerous citations to history as well as traditional references and that they are purposefully not represented as footnotes. In my readings, he is singly able to looks across cultures to find universal truths.<br /><br />I suppose that this book would be found in the \\"Self-Help\\"  or \\"Psychology\\" section of the  bookstore, but it is not a book of lists of how to be happy. It is more of a delicious dissertation... it is so rich in content. I was looking for it recently, as I was finding myself off balance and not coping with the stresses of daily life adequately.<br /><br />Briefly, FLOW strives to recognize that \\"being in the flow\\" is not accidental. It is not genius. It is not based on your economic status or your state of health. It is not a given that it carries over from one aspect of your life to another easily. It's fostered by an awareness and acceptance of yourself and the idea that you need to give yourself adequate challenges. Probably the most essential part of the book for me at this time are the last two chapters that address how to make sense of tragedy and decide what it is that you are living for so you can rise above it. This book raises interesting moral questions, and above all, seems relevant in every aspect to modern life. Be prepared to be influenced in a new, positive way. I have this in paperback and now Kindle.
B0039TD7RC|3.0|I had this album and played it ALOT in the 80's. Then I bought the CD in the early 90's. It's on Rolling Stones records CGK-40489 and that mix is awesome. Nice loud guitars, bass and drums. So, I just can't bring myself to buy another version, especially if the music is lower in the mix. I'll have to find another way to get the bonus tracks because I do want them, but to buy a new version every decade? That's just silly.

630460288X|2.0|I like this movie, but when I got the disk I hated it. It was one of those disks where they recorded on both sides. So both sides are vulnerable to damage. What made it even worse is the wide-screen side starts automatically with the Directors commentary turned on and there seems to be no way to turn it off.   Finally I found it under the Languages menu option, which is NOT where it should be. Now to turn it off you have to select English from the first column of options, which then causes the subtitles to be turned on. So now you have to go back to the same menu, Languages, and this time move to the second column, subtitles, and select off. What a total pain!  This is a very poorly designed disk!!!

0307474712|4.0|This is the question that 22-year-old Emma Morley asks herself on the day of her graduation from Edinburgh University in 1988, a day spent in the company of fellow graduate Dexter Mayhew climbing Arthur's Seat, the small mountain overlooking the city. The question is recalled in flashback at the end of David Nicholls' novel, after the book has in effect answered it for both of them. The moving final chapters, which beautifully interweave past and present, go far to rescue a novel that, like the lives it represents, occasionally loses momentum along the way.<br /><br />The novel opens in the early morning of that day, 15 July 1988. Emma and Dexter have spent the night in bed together (in the literal but not the figurative sense). He says something; she looks up and \\"not for the first time she felt a reassuring shiver of dislike for him.\\" That wonderful phrase, provocative, astringent, halfway down the second page, hooked me immediately. It made me a willing signatory to the book's premise of tracing the lives of these two on each July 15 for the next two decades, and also suggested that their voyage might not be plain sailing. Emma and Dexter will remain friends, although each will have separate romantic entanglements (or lack of them), and their careers will take quite different shapes. Dexter will find early success in television, only to enter the wilderness when he can no longer sustain his role as a youth culture icon. The more talented Emma will struggle for years in her own wilderness of minimum-wage jobs and move only gradually towards her personal Promised Land. In attempting to map the often chartless lives of twenty-and-thirty-somethings in the last quarter-century, Nicholls' powers of witty observation come close to perfection.<br /><br />So what's not to like? Unfortunately, the book's scheme of annual episodes -- a novelistic version of the movie SAME TIME NEXT YEAR -- can become mechanical and limiting. There is a long stretch in the middle when events seem rather arbitrary and put in only for completeness. Nicholls has no trouble coming up with new episodes to fit into the matrix; it is much harder to perceive an overarching shape into which each event fits through inner necessity. It is hard to watch as one or other of them (usually Dexter) screws up and be unable to stop it. And failure at the end of a chapter generally continues as failure a year later. There comes a point when it is hard to believe that the friendship is strong enough to withstand the screw-ups, or even to care whether it should. Life may be like that, but it is a risky strategy for a novel. And yet, four-fifths of the way through the book, the shape does become apparent, and one starts to care very much indeed. Those final chapters may well be worth the wait.itrary and put in only for completeness.

1400052173|5.0|This is well researched chronicle of a reporter's interest and journey to find the origin of the He-La cells. This group of cells is  widley and quite matter of factly used in just about every kind of bio - medical investigation since they were harvested, with out permission, from a dying young black woman in Baltimore MD in 1951. At the time these cells began replicating beyond science's wildest dreams. They flourish today, hence the title of the book. This book is not just about science. It mirrors our society and our values. The author digs into the history of the family Henrietta Lacks left behind and her legacy is colorful and heartbreaking. She and the daughter look for clues to her mother's and sister's demise in a cloud of fears from all reaches of reason. I recommend this book for every doctor that ever practiced medicine, for every social worker, and for those that would like to be touched by a great story. Easy to read, a bit tedious at times (if you are not used to reading about cells) but as the book comes together it's all necessary to present this picture of an American family.

Brown<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn; based on the comic book by Mark Miller and John Romita Jr.<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Matthew Vaughn<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Comedy<br />Release Date: 17 April 2010<br />Review Date: 22 April 2010<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that most of us have seen a movie or two that displayed all of its greatest achievements in the trailer. This holds particularly true to films of the comedic genre. Kick-Ass however, had the exact opposite effect. Based on its trailer, I was more than skeptical. I was wondering what Nicolas Cage was doing in a film like this. Man, was I surprised.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes or so had me let down and I was sure the film was gonna be a total drag. But then, out of nowhere, I was completely taken aback by a sharp turn in the tone of the film, and was rolling with laughter from there all the way to its hilarious climax. The fact that the trailer also led me to believe that it was only rated PG - 13, was another genuine treat. It's very much rated R.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson stars as your everyday American high school kid, David. David fantasizes about his teacher, the hot girl in school, and of course what it would be like to have super powers. The latter causes him to ask himself why no-one has ever tried being a superhero without any powers. He shall like to be the first. He orders a costume off the internet and goes to work to fight crime.<br /><br />He looks absolutely ridiculous in his hideous pine green and yellow ninja looking outfit, but that's what makes the film fun. It's called Kick-Ass folks, so if you are taking the time to watch the film, you can't exactly expect it to be Oscar-worthy now can you? Oh yeah, and it's called Kick-Ass, because that's the superhero name he deems himself with.<br /><br />When David finds himself ready to due battle against two local punks, while dressed in his costume of course, we are rooting for him. We expect he will actually take be able to take them down. We expect pretty much anything other than what actually happens, to happen! This would be the 90 degree turn the film takes that I was referring to earlier. We go from a comedy, to a very dark comedy laced with buckets and buckets of blood brought forth from hilarious scenes of violence.<br /><br />There are additional characters in the film, who I found even more appealing than David. Nicolas Cage plays a single father raising his 11-year-old daughter. We meet them in one of the most creative and humorous scenes that I have ever seen and I won't spoil it for you. It's safe to say that only Nicolas Cage could have pulled the scene off as good as he does, and still have us liking the character.<br /><br />Cage and his daughter (Chloe Moretz) play Big Daddy and Hit Girl. They two are masked avengers of justice, and are far better at it than David. Their costumes are so B-rate, that they are in fact genius, and will no doubt be among the most popular come this Halloween.<br /><br />Bid Daddy has trained Hit Girl to be the ultimate crime fighting machine. In addition to that, he's also taught her a long list of choice four-lettered words, to which she delivers with a classic juvenile charm.<br /><br />What so many people have found absurd and offensive about this, is what I appreciated most about the film. The violence that is depicted here isn't exactly what you would call your everyday comic-book movie violence. Hit Girl and Big Daddy brutally murder every bad guy they come across. It may sound strange and twisted, but seeing it in this film, it is hysterical. Cage and Moretz are both sensational actors and are perfect for these roles. They steal the show in every scene and a star has been born in Chloe Moretz.<br /><br />When a ruthless mob boss (Mark Strong) hashad enough of the mysterious crime fighters spoiling his plans, he puts forth a counterstrike to trap them, using Kick-Ass. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell.<br /><br />There are a few things wrong with the film, and even though it's ridiculous, I know they could have written it better. Some jokes were missed and or executed poorly and at times the dialogue wasn't what it could have been either. Nonetheless there are so many genuine laughs, that we are still able to enjoy the film.<br /><br />If you have been told you don't have an open mind, then skip this film. It has been ridiculed by far too many uptight cry-babies and it needs to stop. Don't sabotage a good thing. The film is absurd but it wants to be, and its fans prefer it to be. So leave it alone, or I'll (insert this film title with the word your implanted in the middle of it, and then smile.:)rike to trap them, using Kick-Ass. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell.

B000FC2ROU|4.0|This is the second book I've read by Haruki Murakami (The first being [[ASIN:0307389839 What I Talk About When I Talk About Running (Vintage International)]] which is entirely different) so I didn't know what to expect.  From other reviewers and the synopsis available here I gathered that it would have a philosophical bent, which it did, however many of the philosophy references were completely over my head not being well versed in philosophy myself.  Even without getting every reference the novel was still a beautiful read.<br /><br />At times Murakami telegraphs what will happen next but the structure of the novel still allows for a great deal of suspense as the chapters alternate between Kafka, a runaway fifteen year old from Tokyo, and Nakata, an elderly man beginning a journey of his own.  The storytelling becomes very sweet towards the end of the novel which contrasts nicely with the raw realism from the earlier chapters.<br /><br />This book is certainly not recommended for everyone.  Some might find it too abstract or outlandish.  It combines traditional literary storytelling with elements of fantasy and science-fiction without truly being a genre work.  It's also a compelling story full of literary and philosophy references that enrich the narrative. With that in mind I would recommend the book to current and former college English and/or philosophy majors, fans of Plato, and readers looking for a very different work of fiction to read.  It does have some cursing and explicit material so I would not recommend it for children or students, although high school juinors and seniors may enjoy it as an extracurricular read.

B002VPE1AW|1.0|As I watched Avatar, I started to think that I have seen this before...    -At the beginning of the movie where the main character wakes up from a long sleep while traveling in space: Movie Similar to: Alien (because Sigourney Weaver is in the movie?).    -Wasn't the robot riding machine the same one that was used in Alien, and was also in the final Matrix movie?    -The main character is sent out to make connections with the aliens. In Pocahontas, John Smith meets the natives and eventually turns and supports their side.    -The planet where the story takes place...looks like the \\"Lion King\\", especially at the end of the movie, as the scene flies over the tree tops. Throw in weird colors here and there like in Dumbo.    -The main characters fall in love like: Pocahontas. (remember Pocahontas and John Smith).    -In Pocahontas, they came to the new world looking for gold. In avatar, they are looking for that special rock.    -The helicopters in Avatar look like the helicopters  from Pixar's Incredibles.    -The special tree in avatar that gave life, remind me of the old woman tree in Pocahontas. Or, have you been to Animal Kingdom in DisneyWorld, where there is a tree of life?    -The people in Pocahontas were connected to the land. Same thing in Avatar.    -The leader of the alien people acted like Pocahontas father. Even the voices was similar.    -Pocahontas was suppose to marry one of the warriors. The female alien was suppose to marry an alien warrior.    -Why did the aliens ride horses like Pocahontas people?    -The jelly fish looking thing remind of me of \\"Nemo\\". Thank goodness they didn't get drunk when the jelly fish thing touch them. However, the jelly fish looking thing select the main character as if he is the chosen one who will save everyone, just like Neo in the Matrix.    -The floating islands looks like \\"Castle in the Sky\\" (yes, it was Japanese movie, but it was released in the US by Disney).    -John Smith almost dies in Pocahontas and he had to go back to England. In avatar, the main character almost dies.    -You enter another world using a machine like the Matrix.    -The aliens do a \\"Mind Melt\\" like Dr. Spock in Star Trek.    -Finally, the Aliens in Avatar looks like a cross between an over grown human and a cat, with eyes used on Michael Jackson Thriller in the final scene.     I did see this movie on my HDTV, and guess there was something missing by not seeing it in 3D. However, the plot was too familiar and I couldn't get into the movie. I'm sure if I go to sleep right now, in the morning I can come up with more \\"I've seen this before\\".
B002JCSWV6|5.0|This is a movie reflecting the reconciliatory Nelson Mandela with the whites (predominantly Afrikaners whose favourite sport is rugby) in 1995 during The Rugby World Cup in Ellis Park, Johannesburg, South Africa.Morgan Freeman plays the great Mandela brilliantly with Matt Damon playing the captain (Francois Pienaar). His accent & mannerism match Francois Pienaar's very well indicating the brilliance of Matt Damon as an actor! The movie is produced by the legendary Clint Eastwood. Recent events in South Africa (the brutal murder of the right-wing leader Eugene Terre'blanche & Julius Malema's antics of ANC Youth League), may indicate the failure of the South African society to continue where Mandela left off but not the failure of Nelson Mandela himself. A great movie about a selfless story by Nelson Mandela to reconcile a nation devided by decades of Apartheid, highly recommended!
B001FB55HQ|4.0|see it finished a few minutes ago, the action secuences are just great, the argument that connects this with the other three films is superb, the sarah connor picture, the records, Kyle Reese, and of course Arnold, Sam Worthington in deed is worth to watch as the human hybrid-terminator(he rocks here much more than Avatar) , however, hardly a heart transplant can take place in a tent, further that the surgery is performed by a veterinary!!!....mmmm talking nonsense... i give it 4 or 5 stars, nevertheless is a very good movie!

0596009208|1.0|I have experience programming, and tried to use this to learn Java, and about OO programming generally.<br /><br />I really wanted to like the book. It is (as many say) entertaining, and I like the idea behind the book (that people learn best from illustrated instruction that isn't too dense and serious).<br /><br />After reading a few chapters and doing all the exercises, and some of the puzzles, I tested myself, and found that I hadn't acquired any ability to do even simple things in the language, even though I can program in Pascal well, and in C pretty well.<br /><br />I switched to another book (Cadenhead's _Java in 24 hours_). At the end of that, I could do reasonable things such as write applications to find medians. I looked, also, at Weisfeld's _Object-Oriented Though Process_, which taught me about OO programming concepts. I like both these, and would recommend them.<br /><br />Then I came back, and found this book entertaining, and occasionally informative. It is a slightly unsystematic tour through the Java language, with sidelights on topics you use, but which seem odd. The style is casual, but so are the explanations. I would have no good idea what encapsulation was from this book, for example.<br /><br />Before I had bought the book, I would have liked to know how hard it is to use the book to actually acquire the skill of programming in Java. I regret having bought it, and would have preferred to just look through it in a library, or borrow it briefly from a friend.<br /><br />Is it possible that many of these positive reviews are from people who already understand Java?

B001TH8UUA|1.0|I ordered two of these due to the good reviews and the awesome low price. However after several months of use I am left rather disappointed with both cables. I use(d) one to connect my PS3 to my HDTV, and one to connect my PC to my monitor. Both have problems transmitting signal between the devices. The PS3 cord fits loosely into the back of the PS3 and will lose picture at the slightest provocation, and the PC monitor cord causes SO much trouble that I went back to the VGA hookup. (Monitor would not pick up a signal, would have to restart PC umpteen times before it finally would catch it and display a picture.) As far as that goes, I troubleshooted using every different configuration I could come up with. Final verdict is poor quality HDMI cable, I switched back to older cables and now everything works fine again.    Save yourself the hassle and buy a better quality brand even if it's more money, these aren't worth the effort. Video and sound quality was fine through them, when they WORKED the way they were supposed to, but just so not worth it.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I was lucky to catch the early promotion for this series (me who never watch live TV!) and was hooked from the first episode. I used to occasionally watch Zena and Hercules but this is better, more serious. I find that the second season is even better (more Darken Rahl and Cara!). It's different from the books (I haven't read everything yet) but not in a bad way. Breathtaking New Zealand! Solid acting (especially Bridget Regan). I wish it would never end...

B00005JKL8|4.0|For whatever reasons, the civil war in Bosnia (1992-95), and the horrific practice of ethnic cleansing, has largely slipped into the folds of history, and seems not to be mentioned much today.  Behind Enemy Lines (2001), is one of the few mainstream films set during this period of conflict.  It involves a Navy F-18 shot down while on a routine reconnaissance mission.  The film does a good job of capturing the cold pure fear of being under fire, and the shock of suddenly being blasted out of the sky, and plunging to the earth, to face a desperate fight for survival.<br /><br />Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) is a flight navigator, aboard the carrier USS Carl Vinson, on patrol in the Adriatic Sea.  With two weeks to go before his tour is up, Burnett's commanding officer, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman), orders pilot Jeremy Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) and Burnett on a routine patrol over Bosnia.<br /><br />The F-18 enter the `no-fly' zone, and unknowingly photographs a mass grave site.  General Lokar (Olek Krupa), the local army commander, orders a missile strike, and surface to air missiles bring the Navy fighter down, deep in enemy territory.  The crew ejects, and parachutes to safety, but the enemy is close behind.  An injured Stackhouse is quickly captured, and then executed.<br /><br />Free for the moment, a shaken Burnett contacts base, and then attempts to evade capture and reach his pickup point.  Scanning the countryside searching for him, are the army, and Lokar's personal expediter Sasha (Vladimir Mashkov).  Back at command, politics and red tape, get in the way of a speedy recovery.  It's a gritty and desperate journey for Lt. Burnett, who runs headlong into the results of ethnic cleansing, when he falls into a muddy mass grave.  This is the film's most poignant moment, and while the brutality and suffering of the people is certainly a part of what the film is about, it is soon overshadowed by typical Hollywood style heroics.<br /><br />Under first time director John Moore, Behind Enemy Lines starts out quite strongly, establishing a tense and desperate situation, but the level of reality soon becomes a casualty of political factors on both sides.  The Bosnian army employing an assassin seems a bit much, as is their clever use of the media to misdirect the UN command.  The obstacles placed in the way of Burnett's rescue, hype up the level of drama, and eventually cause the Admiral mount up and get personally involved.  All the stops are pulled out in the final act, as any sense of realism falls away.<br /><br />Burnett, who has been climbing mountains and cross-crossing the countryside, somehow has enough spring in his step to take down Sasha.  The Admiral personally leads a rescue mission, as a group of choppers come in with guns blazing to engage the enemy, while Burnett dodges fire, recovers the evidence, and makes a death defying leap for freedom.  It's spectacular, flag-waving overkill, that serves to diminish what could have been an excellent film, with an important message.<br /><br />Despite the hyped up ending, Behind Enemy Lines is definitely worth seeing, for the grim realistic aspects, and an impressive gutty performance by Owen Wilson.  Gene Hackman's performance as a by the book commander, who takes matters into his own hands, is textbook Hackman, and probably exactly what the writers wanted.<br /><br />The bonus features include two commentary tracks, one with director John Moore and editor Martin Smith, and a second with co-producers Wyck Godfrey and John Davis.  Between the two tracks, you get some awareness of the production issues involved in shooting on a carrier and on location, and how negotiations with the military was also factor.Behind Enemy Lines starts out quite strongly, establishing a tense and desperate situation, but the level of reality soon becomes a casualty of political factors on both sides.

B002ZG98VE|5.0|\\"Robin Hood\\" is great! This is how the story goes: In 13th century England, Robin and his band of marauders confront corruption in a local village and lead an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power. And whether thief or hero, one man from humble beginnings will become an eternal symbol of freedom for his people.    \\"Robin Hood\\" chronicles the life of an expert archer, previously interested only in self-preservation, from his service in King Richard's army against the French. Upon Richard's death, Robin travels to Nottingham, a town suffering from the corruption of a despotic sheriff and crippling taxation, where he falls for the spirited widow Lady Marion, a woman skeptical of the identity and motivations of this crusader from the forest. Hoping to earn the hand of Maid Marion and salvage the village, Robin assembles a gang whose lethal mercenary skills are matched only by its appetite for life. Together, they begin preying on the indulgent upper class to correct injustices under the sheriff.    With their country weakened from decades of war, embattled from the ineffective rule of the new king and vulnerable to insurgencies from within and threats from afar, Robin and his men heed a call to ever greater adventure. This unlikeliest of heroes and his allies set off to protect their country from slipping into bloody civil war and return glory to England once more.

B001LF347E|5.0|This is a interesting and excellent well written and directed television series. It is a show that allows one to escape into a realistic fantasy world and watch the King Arthur legend from Merlin's view point.  The characters are well developed and Merlin and Arthur entertaining.  I enjoy it as much as \\"Harry Potter\\"
B000BKACO8|5.0|I had to read this for 9th grade English, and I expected it to be dull and boring, like everything else we had to read. Boy, was I wrong! I had to force myself NOT to read ahead, it was so interesting! It wasn't entirely about Tom Robinson's trial; there were some side plots, such as the stories of Boo Radley, Mrs. Dubose, and the tree filled with gifts. None of them were pointless, though. They all tied in to the central theme of the story.   When I first started reading, I could not understand what the heck \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" meant. Even when I cam across that quote halfway through the book, I didn't get it. When I was done, however, I could understand the symbol perfectly. I also enjoyed how the very first sentence in the book, about Jem's elbow, is explained almost at the very end.  I want to mention that I have a friend who never reads anything, ever. She hates books and reading with a passion. She had to read TKAM for the same reason as me, for English class. Her class read it before mine, and when she was done, she told me she loved it. I think that just proves how excellent the book is: if SHE loves it, it's got to be good!  My one complaint is that we had to do so much work on it. We had to write Jane Shaffers, we had to complete reading guides, we had to do quickwrites, we had to take excessive notes. All that, in my opinion, just killed the joy of reading such a wonderful book. I fully intend to go back and re-read it when the school year is over so I can appreciate it even more for what it is.   To Kill a Mockingbird has replaced Beastly (Alex Flinn) as my favorite book of all time. Absolutely nothing can beat it. If you have a chance to read this book outside of school, by all means, do so.
B003AYBD7W|1.0|As you can tell from the title I'm more than disappointed in this reissue.    Let me begin by saying that I have one other Audio Fidelity release as well as several DCC gold CD's and they are all excellent (all mastered by Steve Hoffman).    I have had this album in 3 versions since 1979:  a. The original A&M record (was not too bad as I recall).  b. The Mo Fi half speed mastered album (Oh how I wish I still had that !!).  c. The horrible A&M (1989 or so) CD (which until now has not ever been re-mastered).    I also have several of these songs from the 2 disc \\"Gold\\" best of.    This disc is only a mild step up from the standard CD but both are terrible !!  They are flat, one-dimensional and totally lacking in any drive or punch.  I would have expected more even from the dim-witted record companies re-issue ???    I'll be kicking myself another hundred times that I ever got rid of my 300+ vinyl records back in the 80's. I have poorly made copies of the Mofi 1/2 speed record that make this gold CD sound like a 1960's transistor radio.    Don't buy it.....    Todd    P.S. I'm listening to this on over $10k of hifi equipment including a high end player with HDCD capability. HDCD is NOT 24/96 but uses a trick (I won't go into it) to get closer to 20bit resolution (still @44.1khz sampling) in the middle frequencies !!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is an amazing album every music lover should own.  One of those few albums you can play the whole way through and wish there was more.  Absolutely amazing lyrics and melodies that make hairs on the back of your neck stand...
B003CIG7AE|5.0|I preordered the vinyl version of this album a month ago and highly awaited the release date for the cd. WOW!! Greatness!! Having only listened to BoH for about 2 months, they have grown into one of my favorite bands, not to mention, opening for Pearl Jam just sealed the deal in my opinion. After listening repeatedly, I can't find a weak track. True, BoH aren't pushing any new boundries, but why should they? These guys have found the perfect blend of vocal harmonies, and mellow folk-rock acoustic sound that just grabs you, and slowly puts your soul at ease.    Key Track: Blue Beard
B002VPE1B6|1.0|The reason why i buy blu-rays are because the special features.

B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Much like many of the other reviewers, I have been a fan of Slash's work from his works with guns, through his Snake Pit years, and into Velvet Revolver. This album is straight rock and roll, much like he began with.  There are softer songs like Gotten with Adam Levine to the punchier rock sounds like Watch This Dave with Dave Grohl and Duff to Dr. Alibi with Lemmy.  The songs are well crafted and the vocalist are paired nicely with the music, and the mixing is supurb without the vocals or guitars overpowering one another.  Slash works with the melodies and doesn't showcase himself too much in loud and long solos, just nice guitar work melodies and appropriate solos tucked into each piece.  My personal favorite tracks are the ones from Myles Kennedy from Alter Bridge (Starlight and Back from Cali, both just good tracks) along with Watch This Dave. No matter what version you pick up (US standard, Classic Rock UK edition featuring Alice Cooper bonus track, US Vinyl, or Import Vinyl) it's a nice addition for fans of the 70's & 80's rock fans.
B000002H6Q|5.0|This is a solid, kickass, rock n roll album, but what else would you expect from a band as amazing as Motley Crue? Theres not a bad song on it and the highlights of the album?? Well, just about every song!
B00000IQC8|1.0|\\"Clerks\\" is a comedy, filmed in black and white showing a day in the life of Clerks working in a convenience store.  It is a cult film directed by Kevin Smith.  Most of the film looked like it was shot for a high school film project. Potty-mouthed dialogue between Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) was ninety-percent of the film.  Two scenes outside the convenience store (hockey game on the roof and visiting a funeral home) were the only breaks one got.<br /><br />Overall this cult film is just boring.
B000V6BE6C|3.0|I give this album 3 stars because it does have some really good songs on it like \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\", \\"Scream\\", \\"Brompton Cocktail\\", and \\"Afterlife\\", but overall, I didnt care so much for this album. Its not the Avenged Sevenfold we all know and love from previous releases.

B001SGEUNI|4.0|First off, Lzzy Hale has got some amazing vocals going on. Shes probably one of my fave female vocalists now. This is a really great cd, but as someone else has stated, there are a lot of love/heartbreak type songs on it, which do tend to get old when its almost EVERY song on there. Other than that, this cd and band rocks. I like that she has a real rock n roll type voice. Stand out tracks: Its not you, Dirty Work, I Get Off, and the bonus track, Tell Me Where It Hurts.
6305428050|1.0|I bought this DVD in my local department store in May of 2010. It says \\"Widescreen (1.85:1)\\" on the back of the package with no indication whatsoever that it is letterboxed. We were so disappointed when we popped this into our hi-def DVD player to watch on our 50\\" plasma. For so many years we have been watching this movie from a VHS copy we bought on eBay for $20 back when it was out of print. Yes, it is true we don't have to watch these letterboxed movies in postage stamp mode on our big screen by going into the DVD player setup, telling it we have a 4:3 screen and then using the resize button on the TV remote to scale it up to the screen. However, quality is lost. It's not a whole lot better than watching the VHS copy through our upscaling JVC VHS player. I suppose it will only be a short time now before Buena Vista releases a \\"Collector's\\" or \\"Special\\" edition DVD of this movie with a real widescreen version -- what we thought we were buying this go-around. Selling a letterboxed movie in a package that doesn't say so is unforgiveable. Fortunately for Amazon shoppers, the on-line product description now states \\"letterboxed\\". This is a great movie and I heartily recommend it. If letterboxing doesn't bother you then by all means get it. If it does bother you, then rent and wait for the real thing. This review is for the Buena Vista 2000 release ISBN 0-7888-1688-8.

1439190275|5.0|I have been through many diets, including being a vegan for almost 8 years. I believed that animal based fats were evil and that animal protein was unnecessary. I believed in consuming whole grains, soy products, fruits and veggies of all kinds. I am a Registered Dietitian.  I developed Type 2 DM, I was 40lbs overweight, with elevated blood pressure.  On statins and medications for all the rest. In desperation and frustration I went to a MD who suggested the low carb approach. He suggested I do some reading starting with Gary Taubs' book Good Calories, Bad Calories. I realized as my labs improved, my weight dropped, my need for medications dissipated that what I thought I knew, what I had been taught, was fundamentally flawed. The more I study this, the more I read beyond the 'headlines', the more I am convinced that a lower carbohydrate based diet, which reduces carbohydrates primarily from grains &  refined grain based products, eliminates added sugars and starches in all forms, and eliminates processed vegetable oils and the products made from them is probably the healthiest diet for the majority of people. A diet rich in vegetables and animal proteins and fats, raised in as close to \\"natural' conditions as possible, with minimal pesticide or chemical intervention seems, when all the rhetoric is peeled away, the most sensible.  Some people may choose to avoid whole classes of foods for reasons other than nutrition, and others will find any given diet will work for them, but there seems to be a general consensus around eating \\"whole foods\\" be they animal or vegetable, limiting \\"processed\\" foods and avoiding the refined grains, vegetable oils, sugars and starches  that seem to be added to everything, especially everything that is cheap and convenient.  The vilification of animal protein & fats, saturated fats, and the subsequent substitution of refined grains, vegetable oils, sugars and starches are in general where we as a nation have lost our way.  The abundanceof foods whose calories come from these nutritionally void ingredients, and the relatively low cost of these foods, underly the DM & Obesity increases we see in ever increasing numbers. I certainly don't think we can blame these trends on the over consumption of vegetables, olive oil, fruits, animal proteins or saturated fats (the consumption of which has decreased over the last 40 years).  As has been stated many times in  these posts to date, no one diet is going to work for everyone, and any given diet will work for someone.  Maybe the place to start is by changing public & private policy to reduce the consumption of refined ingredients and foods which we all seem to agree are not supporting our desire to improve our individual and collective health.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|There are plenty of positive, inspirational underground and non-mainstream rap and reggae acts. And you can go back to the late 80s and early 90s to find many excellent releases from both rap and reggae genres, before they degenerated into odes to sex and violence. But this \\"Distant Relatives\\" is a true gem, one of the few CDS that I listened to from beginning to end without skipping any tracks. Actually, \\"Distant Relatives\\" feels like a late 80s and early 90s record because it does not draw anything from what is currently out there in mainstream rap and reggae. All that to say, that this one is timeless, because it can hold its own with the classics from years gone by. Yes, I give \\"Distant Relatives\\" classic status and not from lowered expectations. I know other people have merged rap and reggae. But how many of them actually had something to say, in the best voices of rap and reggae?    At 65 minutes, you are getting both quantity and quality. There are no fillers, just thrillers, from anthems and rasta chants, to cuts for your jeep or benz, to consciousness raising yet radio friendly tracks. \\"Distant Relatives\\" shows how you create a CD with mass appeal without selling your soul. If you love the street origin of rap or the roots origin of reggae, something on this CD should move you. My favorite track is \\"Count your blessings\\". I think Damian Marley really drove the point home on that one. The way the beats switched up for Nas' verses was perfect. \\"In His Own Words\\" is another one that will give you inspiration. Just amazing stuff. Damian is doing a lot more than giving this a reggae feel. Nas is speaking on so much more than women, money and crime.    On every track, both Nas and Damian sound like they \\"belong\\". On so many modern collaboration you can tell that the artists were nowhere near each other. Nas and Damian sound like they are on a mission, a quest, instead of just picking delivering an album to fulfill label requirements.    Damian Marley was the executive producer and quite obviously the musical director behind this effort. The album sounds more Kingstown than Queens. That is not a knock or diss on Nas or Queens. All that to say that the CD has more world music, world beat vibe with the variety of styles and the live instrumentation.    Finally, I like the fact that even though Damian and especially Nas point to Africa as The Source, they conclude that EVERYONE comes from that same source, that we are all Distant Relatives.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is my 2nd time puchasing this cd. I am glad I doubld-dipped. Onto the disc. There is no one song that I dislike, but track 10 outstays its welcome by clocking in at 8 min.

1591843065|2.0|The book started off great with information about how to use basic visuals (instead of complicated PowerPoint and Keynote slides) to communicate your ideas. However, about one-third of the way into the book it starts to get complex. \\"For this type of presentation, consult the matrix.\\"I started to lose myself in the details.

B000002H70|5.0|In the Al Massa review provided by Amazon, he says: \\"The lyrical focus is intensely personal throughout, and, with the exception of \\"Love Song,\\" the mood is overwhelmingly dark and brooding.\\"<br /><br />Correction: Including \\"Love Song\\", the mood is overwhelmingly dark and brooding. Apparently Mr. Massa wasn't in tune with the tune's subtle sorrow. Subtlety tends to go over people's heads in our ongoing age of dimwit worship and illogical leaders. If one only reads the lyrics, you'd think it was going to be a happy shiny smiley song. But the melody is lead by a funereal organ in a minor key set to a task master drum beat. Then Robert Smith sings mournfully:<br /><br />\\"Whenever I'm alone with you<br />You make me feel like I am home again\\"<br /><br />Wherever he is, it's nowhere he wants to be.<br /><br />\\"Whenever I'm alone with you<br />You make me feel like I am whole again\\"<br /><br />A man in pieces.<br /><br />\\"Whenever I'm alone with you<br />You make me feel like I am young again\\"<br /><br />Old beyond years.<br /><br />\\"Whenever I'm alone with you<br />You make me feel like I am fun again\\"<br /><br />Depressed and down.<br /><br />This is a song of deep longing from a dark place. It's a style of writing called irony.<br /><br />'Disintegration' is a brilliant work, more so because it was released in 1989 when it was evident that the creative \\"New Wave\\" was dying out in favor of increasingly retrograde grunge, industrial ruckus and biznizz bop boredom. This album proved creativity was not only alive but vibrant if only the recording industry would get out of the way of the art of music. Equally, Robert Smith overcame the tragic cultural stereotype that turning 30 means turning into a lockstep one-dimensional society system droid. Mourning the myth inspired transcendence. A masterpiece.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|I found The Pacific to be a big disappointment.  It lacked depth, several episodes were horrible, and the writing was poor.  I feel asleep several times watching episodes and had to rewind to see what I missed.  Two positive's is that the acting was excellent and the finale was very good.  I would say about 6 out of the 10 episodes were just bad and felt as if I was watching a poorly written soap opera.  That leaves us with 4 good hours out of 10 hours.  With names as Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg attached I was expecting a lot more.  I can't recommend this mini series to anyone unless you has time to kill and there is nothing else to watch.      While some of the battle scenes were good, several scenes just don't do a good job getting any point across.  The writers look to be trying to makes us feel that the Pacific theater was hell, mission accomplished.  Yes, the marines fought hard for nothing at times, with no purpose but to survive.  War is hell and loss of life is tragic and this series does get the point across, but with little entertainment or historical value.  Take 10 hours and read a good books about the Pacific war.  The sacrifice made by Marines for our freedom isn't given justice in this series.  I wanted to love this series, because the Pacific was really the United States War.  The US was attacked and had to defend itself.  The European theater was more about a madman that was given power by brainwashed citizens looking for simple solutions for their problems.  While just as important to America at the time, we had more help to fight the Germans than with the Japanese.  We fought most of the Pacific theater with little help from our allies.  Australia was already helping to fight the Nazis and could only offer limited troops.  China had no power and was no better than a militia.  Japan was hoping for a quick war with the US and anticipating that the US would back down to concentrate it resources to fight the Germans.  They didn't feel the US couldfight 2 wars. Luckily, America was up for the challenge and the US prevailed.       Back to the series.  If you are going to watch this series be warned that it is long and jumps around to much.  You never really get a feel about the Pacific war except that it was brutal and effected the lives of many Americans.  This series is too much a soap opera and gives little in depth study of the war.  I feel the producers and writers were tying hard to show us a individual marine perspective, but they failed.  An episode or two devoted to troops under MacArthur command would have been nice.  With 10 hours you would hope to get some understanding of the Pacific war as we did with Bands of Brothers about the European theater.  Instead you are left with love lost and missing hope episodes.  Questions on why battles are fought are never addressed and sometimes the answer is there is no answer.  This series has too many incomplete story lines.  Almost every episode left me incomplete and unsatisfied.   A big disappointment.
B003E8P9G0|1.0|I really wanted to like this book. I read the Percy Jackson series and I loved it, but this book is a total letdown. It is poorly written, and could have been exciting but isn't. It is also confusing. First it was Carter telling the story, then it was Sadie. Sometimes I lost track of who was telling the story and had to flip back. Aside from that, the book is just plain boring.

I was still hesitant to watch, having little free time. Finally I did, and I'm glad that I did. It's a wonderful movie, great acting, and a great story.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth's first album, \\"Orchid\\", came out in 1995, and they've been at it ever since.  This album, however, stands out from the rest because of its more quiet, gentle feel.

Nevertheless, I'm glad Opeth put out this album -it has to be one of my favorites.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|The life of Robin Hood is, of course, a vague legend.  It concerns an outlawed man who fights for the downtrodden in England's midlands in the 13th century.  It is a story that has been reworked many times both on television and in film.  In this case, we have Ridley Scott reprising the story with Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett in the starring roles as Robin and Marion.<br /><br />The plot used for this film is arguably implausible.  Robin has returned from the Crusades (scarcely one of Christendom's high points) and passes himself off as a man of wealth in Nottingham.  He sees the injustice of King John and his heavy handed taxes.  In due course, he is forced to be an outlaw and, thus, the legend is born.<br /><br />Crowe and Blanchett are good in their respective roles.  However, it is the grandeur and scale of the scenes that really capture the viewer's attention.  These are truly magnificent.  Yet what really excels is the grittiness of the scenes.  The castles seem dirty but very believable.  There are no Disney type scenes here.  Ridley Scott has managed to capture the times well.  All too often, films of the middle ages are simply too clean.  Here, \\"Robin Hood\\" has cred.<br /><br />So, how to sum up?  Well, it a good film without being a great film.  Two hours well spent.

0385340540|3.0|Entertaining read, like other Grisham novels I've read. I read it in a few hours before bed the other night. I'd rate it 2.5 stars.  4 stars for the entertainment. I liked the main character, loved the feisty ancient head of the CIA, was proud of the Pentagon's head of  military intelligence, and I am very happy I'll likely never run afoul of the likes of Sammy Tin and an Israeli kidon! I also enjoyed the tour of Northern Italy and its culture that Grisham gave his readers.  However, I give only 1 star for plot and execution. Average the 4 and the 1 and you get 2.5 stars. I have the same complaints that many other reviewers have mentioned and so I won't repeat most of them. The only one I have that I haven't seen others point out is the portrayal of various US Gov't agencies. Are the actual FBI and CIA REALLY that incompetent? Really? Naaah, don't think so. US wouldn't be the superpower it is if they were. The main character runs off on the CIA, FBI, and various high level assassins from assorted countries. Yet none of these agents  or their bosses think to bring the son or the Italian tutor lady in for questioning. That would be among the FIRST things I'd do, and I'm just a rather boring law-abiding very average US citizen who's a small cog in a  big US corporation that has nothing to do with espionage, defense or law enforcement. The best option the highly experienced multiple decades at his job fiery  head of the CIA can come up with to get the answers he and his agency need about the secrets Joel/Marco carries is to let other countries do the dirty work? Again, I have to give the CIA more credit than that.  I didn't quite see how that plot was really supposed to provide any answers for the CIA, either. Any one of his enemies could have been the first to take Joel out, be they Israeli, Chinese, Saudi, or Russian. All that would have been proven is that ONE of the enemies killed the guy---all of them had a pretty good reason for wanting the guy dead, after all. Hard to reveal your deep dark US National Security threatening secrets to the CIA when you are dead, killed by sone other country's assassin! That part of the plot would have worked better if the CIA had set up Joel/Marco to be eliminated by others merely for the revenge factor.    Grisham admits he did little or no research for the book, and sadly it shows.  A Major as head of the Defense Department's investigative and espionage division? A MAJOR? Ummmm. A Major, eh? I very much doubt the real head of that division is a Major. Much is made of that fancy smartphone Joel/Marco obtains and GOLLY GEE WHIZ!!----it works in Europe!!!!! How astonishing. The poor son had to really scour all over Virginia to find it, too. Uh-huh. I traveled in Europe around  the time the book is set, and the US cell phone my friend  and traveling partner already owned worked perfectly fine there. Silly thing wasn't even a smartphone, just a plain old run of the mill Nokia phone  that she bought from Cingular. All she did before we left was bring it in to a Cingular store to let them know the phone was going to be used in Europe, and VOILA! US low level cell phone that worked beautifully in Europe. That would be because, oh, I don't know, Cingular (now ATT) uses the same technology for their phones that the cell phone companies in Europe do. Handy bit of info anyone can find out with very little effort. Another complaint in the book was that it was claimed 1 US Dollar = 1 Euro. No, no it didn't not at that time it didn't. A simple bit of research, about 5 minutes on the Internet, would have shown that. It's how I confirmed the memory I had of what the exchange rate was when I'd been in Europe around the same time.  Apparently, Grisham couldn't be bothered to do even that small amount of research. If he's that much of a technophobe,as he admits in the author's note at the end, it's probably a bad idea to go and write about technological gadgetry. At least not without doing his homework.    'TheBroker' is the literary equivalent of a popcorn movie. Entertaining and enjoyable as long as you suspend your disbelief and try not to delve into the plot too deeply. Otherwise, you're bound to feel at least a bit dissatisfied.

B00062IVKI|3.0|This film probably would have been better received and honored if it had been edited down a bit. It's over 2 hours and 43 minutes long. While I love the musical numbers, the weaknesses lie in the script development of the main characters. Liza Minnelli played Francine Evans, a USO singer, and Robert DeNiro played Jimmy Doyle who is both a con-man and a musician. He plays the saxophone. They have tumultous relationship that they only pull off and the ending needs to better explained.     I watched it without the commentary by the film director, Martin Scorsese.     I didn't even check the deleted scenes because the film is already so long and slow moving that I just wanted to see it once and donate it. It's an okay movie with the period costumes, art direction, and big band sound. The problem was the lack of storylines behind Francine and Jimmy. They never seem to develop and there is little interaction with other characters except on the stage.    There is no doubt that Liza can belt New York, New York and I am puzzled as to why it lost the Oscar and was never nominated for original song. It became the song for New York City. Of course, the film was also overshadowed by blockbusters. Still, this is a satisfactory film from Martin Scorsese which is truly his love affair with his native city.
B000NY17J6|4.0|They're all here -- the hits that I enjoyed in the '60s and '70s. Ronstadt's voice is clear and strong, and she's a master at conveying emotion. From \\"You're No Good,\\" with its strong guitar licks, to the plaintive \\"Desperado\\" and her cover of the Buddy Holly hit \\"That'll Be the Day,\\" Ronstadt mines the lyrics for all they're worth. More than 30 years on, some of the songs are a little weepy for my taste -- \\"Love Has No Pride\\" and \\"Hurt So Bad\\" come to mind -- but at the time they were released, I found them relevant. The 23 songs in this collection span much of Ronstadt's career, and it's an impressive one. I recommend this album both to longtime Ronstadt fans and those who'd like to learn more about her musical style.
B00051E906|4.0|I purchased this product for my daughter's science project. She used it to measure the relative radiation of four different Uranium samples. The results ranged from 15 to 270 micro-rads per hour, effective enough to show the relative difference in radioactivity of all four samples. I was satisfied with it for the science project but disappointed that it does not click on each gamma ray penetration. It also is not very sensitive as unless the samples is right next to the side of the meter, it does not work. If you have the money you should buy the more expensive product, but for this purpose, I was able to get by with this low cost unit.
B0037TRVD0|5.0|Comparing this via headphones to the Hannibal/Rykodisc CD of yore, I honestly couldn't hear much of a difference. But you do get a 16-page booklet with impressionistic liner notes by Robin Williamson, lyrics, and some rare photographs and concert posters. The music, of course, remains magical; not only one the greatest albums of the '60s but of all time.
B002VECMAE|2.0|The original by Jon Ronson was a great non-fiction book about how the Bush Administration brought back all sorts of goofy discredited psychic quackery like telepathy, remote viewing, psychokinesis, fortune-telling, etc. that the military had funded in the 1950s with absolutely zero credible results -- then OR now.<br /><br />George Clooney's movie overlays a fictional story about a reporter in modern-day Iraq (supposed to be Ronson, played by Ewan McGregor) trying to get a story from Clooney, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges (playing composite characters) who supposedly worked on this stuff during Vietnam (not post-WWII).  Despite the great cast, the fictionalization doesn't really work.  The movie can't decide whether it is a comedy, a satire, a farce, a spoof of the Bush Administration,  or a serious war movie.  I can see why it bombed in theatres -- it was a lousy adaptation.  All kinds of confusing (and pointless) subplots, conflicting points-of-view, shifting tone, pointless exaggerations, Dr. Strangeloveian stereotypes, and plot devices which go nowhere.<br /><br />In short... the book was better.
B000002O1Q|5.0|Ok the film was good not great but the music for the time can still be listen to today!! Awesome. Micheal and Diane did a great job! Moranis was always good! Dafoe a great american actor.     THE SOUNDTRACK KILLLER MAN
B00335EQ0E|5.0|I was a little hesitant about purchasing Alice in Wonderland Special Un-Anniversary Edition.  Once, I received the tape I was very pleased.  It met all my specifications and the kids enjoyed the cover.  I will recommend family & friends to use Amonzon.com for all their future purchases.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This CD is easily one of my favorites. If you like classic Ray Charles, you'll enjoy him perform with other greats in duets with a full orchestra to back them. It's aweome and timeless
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Are you put off by the subject of death? No problem. This is a movie about life. Imagine a sensitive young bride finding a video of her new husband as a corpse in a mortician's demo tape. This heart opening, mind expanding tale unfolds with humor and exquisite beauty. According to the Buddhist tradition, a person who has not yet faced death and come to terms with it, has not begun the spiritual journey.
0199233381|4.0|One of the most readable summaries of the Greek experience I have read in years. This book provides a quick overview of Greece. Though this has some great images of ancient artefacts, it is not an extremely light read. If you have an interest in Greece this is a good start, though. I appreciated Martin pointing out that, in many ways, what we know of Greek history is actually a history of Athens, and therefore, not truly Greek history--since the various city-states of Greece had very different cultures and methods of operation.

B002QSTTOM|5.0|This is an excellent inside view of the thoughts and actions of someone who survived the Natzi prison camps.
0192802380|5.0|You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced.  What took you so long to figure that out?  Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients.  Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not dretract from it.  The editorial material is even somewhat amusing: e.g. one note in the chronology \\"the United States declare war on Britain.\\"  There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the word \\"declare\\" where we Americans would more likely use \\"declares\\" is symbolic of the British conception of our republic.  But we digress.<br /><br />Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs.  He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels.  There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses S.(stands for nothing)Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S.  Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat Lincoln in 1864.<br /><br />I apologize for wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed.  I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel.  There are other reviews that attempt this.  Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I.<br /><br />The reviewer is an anglophobe.  If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel.  For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more.  It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience.
0385339607|5.0|REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I love the unexpected which this novel has.  His characters might be stereotypes, but they were well done, fun, and had me chuckling.  The theme is David vs. Goliath.  The ending is happy with a bitter component.  The evil, greedy, large corporation leaves a bad taste.  The story took a while to get going which was fine.  But the last third of the book had me on the edge of my seat, not wanting to put it down.  Before reading it I didn't know if I was going to like reading about an insurance company trial.  But I did.  It was excellent.<br /><br />Most of my reading is romance novels, so for me to love something like this should say something about its broad appeal and entertainment value.<br /><br />If I could, I would change two things about the story.  (1)  The ending was happy, but it could have been happier.  (2)  Grisham never tells us who burned down a law firm early in the story.  I was wondering if Great Benefit was behind it, but it was never explained.<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />Rudy just finished law school, is broke and cannot find a job.  He passes the bar and gets his license just in time to represent a low income family against an insurance company.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Setting: current day mostly Memphis, Tennessee.  Copyright: 1995.  Genre: legal suspense.
B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|I'm not going to lie. The first 2 times I listened to this cd I was COMPLETELY disappointed. I was wondering who this band was and where the Keane I have grown to love was. After 2 weeks I have grown to absolutely LOVE this CD. Your Love is a catchy song with an 80s flair. Clear Skies is by far the best track on the CD.     In summary, this CD is not for the impatient. YOU have to be willing to give it a couple of shots but its worth it. Can't wait to see what's in store for Keane next!
B002YIHO7I|4.0|I do not listen to a lot of R&B music, but I have always liked Sade.  I have been listening to Soldier of Love for a couple of months now, and I have really enjoyed it.  Most of the songs are smooth with a good bass line that is offset by either acoustic or undistorted electric guitar.  My favorites that fit this description are \\"Moon And The Sky\\", \\"Long Hard Road\\", and \\"Be That Easy\\".  Each deals with loss or sadness in some fashion, and the instrumentation really complements the emotive lyric delivery that Sade uses.  Sade's music has always been about emotion.  One partial exception to this style is the title track.  Here Sade is not merely pining away over loss but rather being aggressive about the losses in love.  However, the drums and the trumpet that comes in and out give the song a military feel to it, and the song conveys a message of hope.  Sade is not ready to surrender yet in the game of love.<br /><br />One song that did not work very well for me was \\"Babyfather\\".  It seems to be written to a \\"love child\\", and it just comes off less personal than the rest of Solder of Love.  I also found this to be the one song where I didn't like the vocal delivery.  The additional voices between the children's chorus and the men detract from the main voice that I want to hear on Sade's music.  However, this was the only low point on the CD for me.<br /><br />Overall, there is a lot to like on Soldier of Love.  If you like smooth R&B with expressive vocals from a beautiful voice, you should give Soldier of Love a try.<br /><br />Download this:  Moon And The Sky
0393072231|5.0|Other reviewers will tell you about the content and the characters. Buy this book as it's like reading about knowing the end of the world is coming, you are not totally sure when but it will be sooner rather than later and you're largely sure that almost no one else knows, but the evidence is overwhelming, you just have to live long enough for all your inside bets to work. We had Long Term Capital in 1999, the GFC in 2009, keep this book for 2018 and be ahead of the next market correction from greed and stupidity as it will come as night follows day.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|While the colors were great, and some of the songs were fantastic I had to stop the movie at about the 45 min mark.  This movie took a seriously dark turn, and it is very disheartening that Disney chose to include voodoo in a movie.  Young girls do not need this type of satanic media around them, and frankly I wish I would have read the reviews before buying.  I will not be finishing this movie.  Watch a classic disney movie over this one any day!
B00005JPS8|5.0|This movie is great. I have seen it many times. The dvd is excellent, lots of extras. This is a different case, it's not the one that looks like iron man's helmet, as i had thought because of some of the pictures that were posted, but it's still a special edition so i was happy about that.
B000069HZP|4.0|Michael Douglas stars as Nicholas Van Orton in this great thriller. On his birthday, Nicholas younger brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) tells him he should play a game. He is hesitant at first but goes thru with it and the movie really takes off from there with various twist and turns. The ending was a little over the top but doesnt take away from the movie. Douglas is great in the lead role and Penn does a good job as well. This is a must watch if you enjoy movies that keeps you guessing.

B000059XUO|1.0|This review is based on the DVD product, and not the movie.  The product description here says released 2001 but the actual box says 1996-1999.  I received this off my wish list last year and just tried to play it on my Sony PS3 40gb model.  The first disc (feature film) freezes the PS3 (black screen only).  I had to unplug the power of the PS3.  The second disc (special features) loads up and it is poor quality on my HDTV (looks like standard video).    I tried disc 1 this time on my PC and it tries to load this old DVD player off the disc.  I went back to the PS3 and turned off BD/DVD Upscale (under Video Options).  Now it finally loads disc 1 but the video is terrible.    Hard to believe this \\"Collector Series\\" is such bad quality and for such a high price.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This is a good movie, but the service from amazon is great it arrived the day the movie was released. Thanks
0385523386|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book.  It is a fast, interesting and transporting tale.  Kerman's life, both before and during her prison term, is something so foreign to me that I really appreciated her letting others in on the story.  I was not at all bothered by the small sections of Kerman's correctional system opinions.  They are timed well in relation to the story point and never last very long.  It would be hard to do any time without forming some pretty solid ideas about what should and should not be done in jail.  Plus, her complaints are tiny compared to the bulk of the story's uplifting elements.  This is not a depressing book at all.  And Kerman relates the lessons she learns and the deep emotions she feels for family, friends and her fellow prisoners in a pure way.  Kerman is lucky in may ways during her incarceration and she freely admits it.  However, she also is able to write as one of the prisoners, as a compassionate woman, and never as a condescending bystander.
B003JYOEYM|1.0|Save your money. If you liked 'Diary of the Dead', then this film is for you. If, however, you demand a certain level of production values in your entertainment, go elsewhere. Check out Romero's earlier work, rent 'Dawn of the Dead' (2004 release) or either of the '28 Weeks' series. We all owe a great debt to Mr. Romero for his groundbreaking art, but his vision is old and outdated by modern audience standards. The lack of budget and quality talent sadly shines through every frame in this needless addition to his body of work.
B00004WKII|4.0|I am writing this review based on the VINYL box set, not the CD box set. . . although i think they have exactly the same songs, the presentation is different.<br /><br />I bought it on vinyl about three years ago and was blown away with how good the presentation was, with a nice felt cover/ purple colour, and a booklet inside with lovely large scale images of the man and more information on the recordings.<br /><br />My favourite track is the unedited 3rd Stone with Chas Chandler and Jimi laughing a lot in the intro....its nothing new though, it was on previous recordings and I am sure there are many tracks in this box set that have been issued before....but there are also some that I have never heard........personally if i wanted to lsiten to Jimi I would put on electric ladyland album pretty much everytime.......but this box set for me was a total bonus and something that i will cherish forever after.
B002VECM72|5.0|I wish more movies were made like this one.  A movie is enjoyed more when it is  focused on a true to life story. I do not care to watch a movie filled with crime  and sex. The public is starving for decent movies. Writers today lack the talent  for a good story line.  I really enjoyed the movie and wish there more caring people as that family.  I am sharing the DVD with others who were not able to go to see the movie in the  theatre.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I resisted watching this for a long time because Henry VIII is one of my favorite historical passions, and the guy on the cover of the DVD didn't look like Henry Tudor.  Trust me, this doesn't matter.  It is apparent that getting an actor who is handsome to play the part was a deliberate ruse to get people interested in the Tudors.  People like me that know the story to a tee need not get anal about the slight tweeking of historical points and this Henry looking a lot better than the real one.  It is fun and pleasing to the eye to see a handsome young guy playing this part.  The sets, locations and costumes are incredible!  They modernized Henry's look a bit making him look like a medieval rock star.  Catherine of Aragon, who is my favorite person in this whole story (Henry's first wife) is played absolutely perfectly by an actress named Maria Doyle Kennedy.  She should get an award for this, if there is such a thing for a Showtime offering. In fact, the whole presentation was cast to perfection.  I especially love the actor who plays Sir Thomas More.  I have read extensively about the Tudors and was blessed to have visited Hampton Court Palace (where most of Henry's antics took place).  If you enjoy experiencing this period of British history, you will adore watching this DVD.
B000DWMN2S|1.0|\\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is an embarrassingly bad stinker on almost every count, with two exceptions: Eugene Hutz is weirdly, wildly charismatic as Alex, a goofy young Ukrainian who imagines himself a hip-hop star. And \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\"'s score is excellent, consisting, as it does, of authentic Eastern European folk music.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" consists of g-rated versions of \\"Borat\\" jokes. Ukrainians are funny because they try to be cool like Americans. Ukrainians are laughable because they speak English in a simple-minded pidgin, calling \\"African Americans\\" \\"Negroes,\\" for example, and saying \\"repose\\" for \\"sleep.\\" Ukrainians are funny because of their sex lives. Ukrainians are also dirty, irrationally and by nature violent, they hate Jews, they wear unattractive clothing; the men are ready to beat up any newcomer to their town naïve enough to ask for driving directions; the women are either cowed housewives married to husbands and fathers who lead with their fists, or slatternly, sullen, obese waitresses; goat-herding Ukrainian children engage in mindless vandalism like flattening car tires. These folks are so debased that even their dogs are ugly, stupid, and vicious. Yup, there's even a creepy household pet. Of course these comically stupid, ugly, crude yokels are responsible for the Holocaust. At one point, Elijah Wood, as Jonathan Safran Foer, insists that the Ukraine was as bad as Nazi Germany.<br /><br />This nasty stereotype is not the invention of Liev Schreiber, the director and script writer. Schreiber and Safran Foer, the author of the book on which the film is based, are merely exploiting, not inventing, hateful ethnic stereotypes. The image of the brutal Eastern European peasant has been around for centuries. Americans are most familiar with this stereotype from Polak jokes and the film \\"Borat.\\"<br /><br />Eugene Hutz is genuinely funny in his thankless, Eastern European \\"Amos-and-Andy\\"-style role. He acts the Ukrainian dunce with as much grace and dignity as possible, and is the only thing worth watching in the film. Some scenes are laugh out loud funny, especially when Wood lectures Hutz on the use of the term \\"African American.\\" But \\"Amos and Andy\\" was funny, too.<br /><br />After about an hour of Bohunk jokes, \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" abruptly turns off the comedy tap and turns into a turgid, static Holocaust film. What little action there was in the film, provided by Hutz's kinetic mugging, shuffling, and jiving, or by Ukrainians punching other Ukrainians, stops. Characters stand still and offer speeches about horrible things that happened in the past. Jonathan and Alex arrive at the one pleasant house, with the one dignified resident, in all of Ukraine. The colorful cottage is out of a Disney fairy tale. Clean laundry snaps on the line. Orderly rows of sunflowers surround the home. The peasant woman living in the cottage is gracious and lovely. Aha. She's not really Ukrainian. She's Jewish.<br /><br />On the other hand, Elijah Wood, as Jonathan Safran Foer, a modern American Jew, comes off no better than the stereotyped Ukrainians. He, too, is a stereotype: the uptight, obsessional, neurotic, socially backward, weak, frightened, passive Jew. Wood, as Jonathan, is so stiff he could be playing a corpse. A writer and director should have a very sound aesthetic reason for making the Jewish character in a film about the Holocaust a passive Jew. Scheiber has no good reason. He's just playing two stereotypes against each other, insisting that one needn't learn anything from one of the most horrendous crimes in history in order to make a film about it. Given that there is a very self-destructive death of another Jewish character in the movie, Wood's passivity is even more troubling.<br /><br />The Holocaust is never honored by \\"Everything Is Illuminated.\\" In the unlikely event that this is the only Holocaust film the viewer ever sees, that viewer would have no idea what the Holocaust was. As slow, pretentious, and ponderous as this film is, it never for one moment manages to convey the monumental horror and heartbreak of the Holocaust.<br /><br />Again, I'd love to see Eugene Hutz in just about any new film; meanwhile, I've been watching youtube videos of his band, \\"Gogol Bordello.\\" Hutz sings and dances like a man who has vowed to live fast, play hard, die young, and leave a good looking corpse.ious, and ponderous as this film is, it never for one moment manages to convey the monumental horror and heartbreak of the Holocaust.     Again, I'd love to see Eugene Hutz in just about any new film; meanwhile, I've been watching youtube videos of his band, \\"Gogol Bordello.\\" Hutz sings and dances like a man who has vowed to live fast, play hard, die young, and leave a good looking corpse.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|Yes, it's derivative, style over substance, cheesy and predictable.  And yet, in spite of - or perhaps because of, these flaws, it's rollicking good fun.  If approached firmly tongue in cheek, accompanied by a popcorn frame of mind, it's a pretty good watch.  Make no mistake though, if you are annoyed by effects driven blockbuster movies which defy logic and even science, then this film is not for you.  The movie follows fairly routine disaster movie narrative conventions.. there are disposable characters, and then the little guy caught up in the middle that we identify with, the scientists and politicians trying to come up with a resolution, and of course, being a Roland Emmerich film (Independence Day, The Day before Tomorrow, Godzilla) a dog with uncanny abilities to get out of tough scrapes.  In this case, solar storms are having a disastrous effect on the earth's molten innards, with a resulting realignment of the crust.  What does that mean?  Well, it means that along with scientific credibility going out the window, we get not one of the usual disaster scenarios - we get every disaster scenario you ever saw before, all shoehorned into one movie.  From Poseidon to Volcano, from Earthquake to The Day the Earth caught Fire, When Time Ran Out to... wow, yes, even actually some hints of Titanic.  It's all way too much for one movie to actually create a credible storyline which maintains suspense, but switch the brain off, allow a goofy grin to come over your face as the characters race from one peril to the next with only seconds between them and doom, while admiring the prolific computer generated effects (which sadly rarely generate any real feeling of impending threat  to the heroes / heroines) - and the movie somehow works.  Most of the cast play things fairly straight - that's ok, when the situations present all the tongue in cheek required.  The exception is the ludicrously yet wonderfully over the top Woody Harrelson, as the proverbial prophet of doom..  Itwould be silly to dwell on the negative points.  That would entirely  miss the point of the movie... It sets out to show some big screen effects driven thrills, with the brain required to be firmly in neutral, and that's what it does.  The tagline of the movie was `We Were Warned'.  Head into a viewing with that in mind, and you shouldn't go far wrong.
B000HEWEDK|4.0|This is the 2 disc 50th anniversary edition.  I had the previous version on DVD and this looks much better as far as color and overall print quality.  It also comes with a second disc with rare footage and documentaries which feature big time movie business folk. The Invisible Boy is included which I never saw but it has Robby The Robot in it and it is a little strange movie but interesting anyway.  Seeing Robby in a film like that is not really a good thing and I can understand why Stanley Kubrick destroyed all his props etc. from 2001 so they would not show up in other films.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|We saw Avatar in 3D at the theater, and immediately knew we wanted to own this one.  The Amazon offer of BOTH blue ray and DVD for one price is UNBELIEVABLE!  Local stores wanted more than this for the DVD alone!  We don't have a blue ray player yet, but we knew we WILL have one soon, so we are now ready.  Service was outstanding, as always when dealing with Amazon.  We have now shared this wonderful film with our son, his wife, and both of their children.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|Full disclosure, I was never a big Beach House fan before listening to Teen Dream.  That's changed.  This is easily going to be one of the best albums of 2010 for me, if not the decade to come.  Every single song is good and gets better with repeat listens (I'm at 50 and counting).  This is a sleepy stunner that I would recommend to fans of almost any type of rock or pop music.  The 3-song arc of \\"Better Times,\\" \\"10 Mile Stereo,\\" and \\"Real Love\\" is as strong as any in my music collection.
0810983915|5.0|My son has been buying the Wimpy Kid stories, starting with the Second (Rodrick's Rules) and now the fourth, Dog Days. Sooner or later he'll get the first. As usual, the chapters are short and funny, and can be enjoyed in short pieces. Or course, it's never really convincing that it's a kid writing all of this - seems more like a hipster with a sense of humor, but never mind, it's good fun, even when it's a bit embarrassing. Check out a description of Greg's trip to the pool:<br /><br />\\"At the town pool you have to go through the locker room before you can go swimming, and that means walking through the shower areas, where grown men are soaping down right out in the open. The first time I walked through the men's locker room at the town pool was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. (Cue picture of hairy men showering, with certain areas blocked by a strategically-placed table) I'm probably luck Id idn't go blind. Seriously, I don't see why Mom and Dad bother to try to protect me from horror movies and stuff like that if they're gonna expose me to something about a thousand times worse. I really wish Mom would stop asking me to go to the town pool because, every time she does, it puts images in my mind that I've been trying hard to forget.\\"<br /><br />Besides this part, the book had a few other laugh-out-loud parts (the naming of the family dog is pretty funny, even if the dog chapter is a bit irritating/uncomfortable). The book is full of great illustrations, in particular the \\"hisssss\\" drawing that appears on the back cover as well as the beginning of the book. The book covers the start of Greg's summer, when he tries to be a hermit because life is lame, but he quickly gets out. He also gets traumatised by watching \\"Hello, You're Dead\\" with the story of the \\"muddy hand\\" that goes around killing people (is this some sort of Oliver Stone thing?). There's also the Reading Is Fun club that Greg's mum tries to organise, then some sort of nonsense around Greg working off $83 that he owes Rowley's dad for having ordered up too many fruit smoothies at the country club.  Ooops!  Greg's venality gets a bit over the top as he tries to start a landscaping business with Rowley with no experience or equipment.

030745455X|5.0|This was the first book in a very long time that I would think, when seeing how many pages were left before the end \\"I wish there were more,\\" i.e. \\"I wish I wasn't so close to the end, I want to read more\\". Just like the other book, the first fifty pages have nothing to do with the following 600. In this book, we learn less about the background story of Mikael Blumkvist and more about the mysterious background of Lisbeth Salander. We almost comprehend how a Mensa-level brain can be mistaken as a mentally undeveloped social outcast.<br /><br />Once again the book begins in a leisurely fashion, telling this story, telling that story, then in a lacksadaisical fashion describing what Lisbeth Salander eats in the morning, how she hangs around her apartment, how she hacks into something, how she learns something else, how she wanders into the expose of prostitution rings, and then how she haphazardly becomes the target of a national manhunt as she's fingered as the main suspect in a double murder.<br /><br />Larsson introduces several more interesting characters into the plot, including a blond hulk (that's HULK, not hunk), a sadistic psychologist, some bikers, some leather dikes, and a police investigative unit. While the hulk is interesting, he's also a bit of a liability - how can an antagonist who can be spotted from a kilometer away be stealthy?<br /><br />The book is episodic, and Larsson gives attention to characters, only to abandon them after only a short stretch. He also allows a plot that doesn't quite make sense, murky motivations, and a sparse connection to the main crime of the book - the Eastern European sex trade. An Estonian prostitute is brutally murdered, but it's not clear in the end who is guilty, except by association and some circumstantial evidence.<br /><br />On top of this, we do see some expert operatives making classic blunders. For example, are we supposed to believe in a situation where a sharp mind like Lisbeth Salander can become too deep in concentration to hear the rumble of approaching Harley Davidson motorcycles. Well... I don't think so.<br /><br />But the book was better than many I've read recently, and I did love it dearly. I want to read the third one. I just hope its plot is a bit tighter than the second one, but I'd fear not - by the time he wrote it, Larsson was running out of time.le of approaching Harley Davidson motorcycles. Well...

0307454541|4.0|I initially bought this book out of frustration; I had a coupon to buy a book at Borders, a store I now despise, but they had none of the books I wanted to buy (Tintin and the Alph Art, Zombie Survival Guide, etc), so I bought a book from the display near the cashier, a book I had heard about and was curious about (I'm drawn into all \\"global sensation books\\", if for nothing more than to try to understand their popularity) and was quite sure I'd like. I was right. The book follows the life of Mikael Blomkvist, who is an interesting fellow, and who bears some similarity to the book's crusading journalist author - who I now know made it a personal mission to bring down right wingers and neo-Nazis, and who lived under death threats due to this (brave). The fact that he wrote this trilogy in his spare time simply amazes me, just as the fact that he died on the eve of the publication of the first of the three books depresses me.<br /><br />The book starts off with Blomkvist on trial for a libel he's foolishly allowed himself to be tricked into committing; this, and all the establishing stuff, occupies the first 50 pages of the book, even though it has nothing to do with the murder mystery at the book's heart. No matter, there's a leisurely pace throughout, and with time we eventually grow to care about Blomkvist and his odd entourage of life-friends and associates. We also meet Lisbeth Salander and slowly get to know her. The first part of the book is about him, then it's about her, then it's about them. Then, eventually, at its own leisurely pace, we find out about the mystery, and the aging industrialist who wants to find out what really happened 40 years ago. Great.<br /><br />The book eventually boils over with thrills and chills, and it's bloody good fun; the fact that it all takes place in Sweden, a country I've never explored, makes it oddly exotic.<br /><br />One of the strange things about the book is Lisbeth Salander; she is described by reviewers as a fascinating, sexy, riveting creature. I'm not really impressed throughout, as she seems like dozens of pouty adolescent girls I've met over the years, a non-personality of sorts; of course, it's not until the end of the book (and all throughout the next) that she really becomes interesting.<br /><br />Funnily enough, I did manage to guess the central mystery of the book at some point, and that almost never happens; but what I couldn't predict was how interesting the structure of the book is. To say too much would be to give things away, but I'd like to find out how often (other than in the Lord of the Rings) this has been done in bestselling literature.<br /><br />One criticism of the book - I'm mystified why Larsson puts so many brands/product placements (7-Eleven, Jack's Pizza, etc) into the book. Is this something he did, or is it a liberty that the publishers took knowing that the author had passed away? It would be interesting to find out, because it doesn't seem like Larsson's style to allow commercial concerns to have a place in his work.ure.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|Finally another release by the most beautiful woman in show business. I've been a fan from the beginning and have all of her albums. All of them are stunning, song after song. This one is no different, except for the fact that it comes a decade after the last one (her album releases have been timed as 1984, 1985, 1988, 1992, 2000, and now 2010). The approximate doubling of time between releases means that we might not get another one until 2030, when Sade (pronounced Shar-day) will be 71 years old, means that this one will need to tide us over for some time. The songs are beautiful, and very focussed on her voice and the plain, simple messages that she has, more often than not with simple production values. The opening song \\"The Moon and the Sky\\" is somewhat Spanish-sounding, and it's quite heavily-produced (but not over-produced). Melancholy. \\"Soldier of Love,\\" the title track, is very theatrical, but also hypnotic. \\"Morning Bird\\" is boring, while \\"Babyfather\\" is a pretty song about parenthood that sounds like a duo with Bob Marley, and a child's choir thrown in. \\"Long Hard Road\\" is a simple song with vocals, acoustic guitar and drums. Beautiful. \\"Be That Easy\\" is similar, but a bit more upbeat, while \\"Bring Me Home\\" is just as melancholy as \\"The Moon and the Sky\\". \\"In Another Time\\" sounds like something from the \\"Stand By Me\\" soundtrack and is quite jazzy, with plenty of saxophone. \\"Skin\\" is a bit sedate, while album-closer \\"The Safest Place\\" is a good ole beat-pounder to make the recording memorable for more than Sade's hypnotic voice, which commands any song she's ever added her voice to.

Although there were some stereotypes that I expected in the narrative, there were welcomed unexpected characters and events.

I was really able to see the women as people that I interact with in my own life.  I learned that most can adapt to whatever life offers, even when freedom is taken away.

B00368PSN2|4.0|The story takes place on Earth in 709 AD. A space tarveler named Kainan (Caviezel) crashes in Norway. He believes he is the only survivor of the disaster, but quickly realizes the terror he tried to escape has followed him. When he is captured by Wulfric from the nearby Viking village, they hold Kainan responsible for the attack. Kainan must work quickly if he's to gain the trust of the king's daughter Freya, prove his innocence, and unite the Vikings against the most powerful creature they will ever face.<br /><br />Honestlty,this totally works! The box says it's Predator vs. Beowulf, and they are right. The acting is fantastic! Led by Jim Caviezel and supported by John Hurt, Ron Perlman and wonderful Sophia Myles. The story is compelling and believable. The cgi beast looks wonderful on Blu (it did look poor on DVD) and the action sequences are well done.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A major improvement over the DVD! Sharp picture with vibrant colors. The sound is also a good mix which booms the explosions and carries the dialogue nicely. The beast looks so much better on Blu then DVD. FINAL THOUGHTS: FANS MUST UPGRADE!!! Anyone else needs to give this movie a chance.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|First, I provide a copy of my review of the original \\"Exile on Main Street\\" CD, to provide context and background. Second, some reflections on the addenda to that album.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />I'll begin by echoing what some other reviewers have mentioned: this is a terrific Rolling Stones album (actually, when released, it was a two album set), but without a lot of great singles on it. But that may be a part of why this is such a good work. There is rawness throughout the set of songs--and raggedness. It has an earthy rock and roll/blues sensibility and it works because of its rawness, as opposed to despite its rawness. One characteristic, too, is how difficult it is sometimes to make out the words to the songs (there is a famous quotation attributed to Mick Jagger that this was intentional at times).<br /><br />The CD begins with two flat out neat rockers--\\"Rocks Off\\" and \\"Rip This Joint.\\" Jagger growls and the band plays with a hard edge to it. Then, to one of the gems--the Stones' version of Slim Harpo's great blues number, \\"Shake Your Hips.\\" Jagger sings it differently from Harpo, but he is effective in his own way. The Stones show that they can play blues well (and note a later piece on \\"Exile,\\" once recorded by Robert Johnson himself, \\"Stop Breakin' Down\\").<br /><br />One of the few \\"hits\\" off this work, \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" well played here. Some interesting features: Jagger on guitar and Mick Taylor on bass. Then, \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" which, if my memory serves me correctly (please correct me if I'm in error), was inspired by activist Angela Davis. A catchy hook and tune. \\"Ventilator Blues\\" seems to focus on a bad hair day, with one line being \\"I feel like murder in the first degree.\\" This is a down and dirty song, with some gritty instrumental work.<br /><br />One of Keith Richards' earlier solos shows up here, the up tempo \\"Happy,\\" featuring a nice guitar riff to start the song off, presumably Mick Taylor's work. And \\"Exile on Main Street\\" concludes with \\"Soul Survivor,\\" a lively song featuring some guitar work and nice keyboards. Jagger's voice is ragged and, because of this, quite effective in the context of the entire CD.<br /><br />The Stones near or at the pinnacle of their career--Jagger on vocals, Taylor and Richards on guitar, Wyman on bass, Watts on drums. \\"Friends\\" showing up: Keys on sax, Price on horns, Hopkins on piano, Stewart (an old Stone himself) on piano, and so on. A rip roaring rock and roll album.<br /><br />Addenda:<br /><br />First, the print of the cover notes for this edition are so small that it's hard to see who played on each cut (it's tough to see one's vision decline with age!). Here are a few observations on some of the ten bonus tracks. Some of these were fragments and the Rolling Stones finished them in 2010. Others were in \\"the vaults\\" and reproduced as they were then. Given that \\"Exile\\" was not a \\"great hits\\" album, these bonus tracks, for the most part, fit in pretty well. Let's take a look at a few of these.<br /><br />\\"Pass the wine\\" is a bluesy song. It fits well with Side 4 of the original 4 sided album. There is an alternate version of \\"Loving Cup,\\" too. There is nice guitar work here and this is an interesting alternative look at this song. Then, \\"Soul Survivor.\\" Keith sings vocals. I'm not sure he carries this off as well as Mick Jagger, but it adds an interesting variation to this exquisite song. \\"Good Time Women\\"--this starts off with some nice guitar work. Jagger's singing works well here. This is an upbeat song with a raunchy ethos to it. Finally, one last example--\\"Title 5.\\" Only three people play: Keith Richards, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts., It's as much a jam session as anything else. It is laid back and kind of fun to enjoy (although nothing special). Watts' drumming is awfully good. . . .<br /><br />Do the new cuts add anything? On the one hand, no. The original \\"Exile\\" stands on its own. On the other hand, it is interesting to hear some of the songsthat did NOT make the album or to hear alternate versions of songs that did appear. For historical interest only, this makes the additional cuts worth listening to. However, some of these are also interesting musically. . . .id appear.

B000002GY9|5.0|I don't think I can conjure up anything great to say about \\"Small Change\\" that hasn't already been said.  And that's a sad thing because there are so many great things to say about this masterpiece and Waits deserves way more recognition then he gets (which is still a lot, admittedly).    Okay, so here goes.  First off, if you like Tom Waits and you don't have this album, just buy it.  You've probably heard some of the songs anyway but trust me having this thing around really gets you through emotional catastrophes, and those of Homeric proportions.  What I'll do now is simply go through the ones you'll want to hear over and over again.    \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\" - This is that \\"Waltzing Matilda, go waltzing Matilda with me\\" song that always gets a lot of pre-performance applause once the audience members hear the familiar opening chords.  It's big time, string-powered stuff that brings up a lot of sadness and feeling and whatnot, but really it's just a beautiful song that Waits himself has said is about \\"throwing up in a foreign country.\\"    \\"Step Right Up\\" - You know those guys who stand on soapboxes and hawk cheap jewelry and junk at you as you walk down the sidewalk?  That's what Tom does here.  The hawking, not the walking.  The song is all repeated bass line, drums and Waits' voice--his voice is something else entirely, don't let me get into it--and at about seven minutes or so w/r/t length, it might get tiresome for listeners unfamiliar with Mr. Waits' style, voice and... the _____________ that makes his music what it is.  But it's a fun one and humorous at times.    \\"The Piano Has Been Drinking\\" - You've probably heard this one.  It's four chords that sound kind of drunk and glass-eyed and runs primarily on the lyrics.  It's funny, sad, heartbreaking, etc.  Kind of those laughs that you sort of feel bad about laughing, y'know?  Here Waits describes what sounds like a ratty lounge with shag carpeting, annoying patrons, disdainful waitresses, a vertically-challenged owner and other stuff you'd probably want to avoid but all of which Waits finds recognizable and harrowing all at the same time.  Now go on YouTube and find his performance of this song on \\"Fernwood Tonight,\\" a spinoff talk-show with a script and wacky hosts.  They're not really funny but Waits is hilarious and if you like his on-stage antics then you'll like this video, I guarantee.  There are also some rare versions of this song that sound a little more harrowing and skeptical floating around on the net, all of which are very interesting as well.    \\"I Wish I Was in New Orleans\\" - Now I know I'm nobody okay, sure I get it, but for about as long as I can remember I've hated piano because it was too, I don't know, traditional or something for me.  Well, this song got me playing piano.  For enjoyment.  And I taught myself.  Okay, enough self-promotion.  This song is magic.  It's slow and sort of Louis Armstrong-sounding (Tom's voice on \\"Small Change\\" definitely brings Satchmo to mind) and it's simply a great song.  Piano, strings, saxophone, bass, drums.  Oh, and the Voice.    \\"Pastries and a G-String\\" - Don't know what to say about this one except it's funny and it's sort of like \\"Step Right Up\\" in the way that's primarily about the Voice.  There's that, a drumset and not much else.  Mildly inappropriate for children, but what the hell.    \\"Invitation to the Blues\\" - A lot of people will tell you \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\" is Waits' epic, grand concert hall magnum opus song or whatever, but really, I think \\"Invitation...\\" is better.  Generally speaking, I feel that if \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\" is Waits' ballroom diamond, then this track here is the one he plays at the nightclubs and gets everyone feeling pretty much the same way the other one does.  Beautiful song.  And it's not even really my favorite Waitsian song, it's just one of those longer songs that usually gets a lot of attention.    \\"I Can't Wait to Get Off Work (And See My Baby)\\" - The song that got me addicted.  Up to that point I'd enjoyed Waits' music very much but when I heard this song, I was hooked.  Everything I wanted to hear in music exists in that song.  Well, okay, I don't know, but it's a sweet, simple, relatively short track comprised of piano, the Voice, and maybe some bass.  Yes, some bass, but lightly; it doesn't stick out and form the backbone of the song as in \\"Step Right Up.\\"  The song is about Waits' experience working in a pizza joint a loooooooooooooong time ago.      I skipped a few tracks for convenience but they're all good--\\"Bad Liver and a Broken Heart,\\" \\"The One That Got Away,\\" \\"Jitterbug Boy,\\" and the title track--and simply, if you're a fan of Waits, chances are you probably already have this one and are imagining yourself bashing my brains in because I didn't duplicate exactly what you think about each of the tracks or I skipped your favorite or I said \\"Invitation\\" was better than \\"Tom Traubert,\\" and if you don't know the songs on this album and would like to hear more of Waits, buy this one for sure.  If you're completely new to Waits, go to confession first and then buy this album because first of all it's a great place to start and secondly you're wasting time already.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|Unplayable disc.  I'm returning it and FOX will need to get their act together before they can add my hard earned dollars to their financial statements.  Producing an unplayable disc is just plain sick.    The Avatar motion picture is great.  I've paid for and seen it in 3D and standard theaters.  I've paid for the Blu Ray Disc and with a very new and capable Blu Ray Player I cannot play it.    FOX has produced a product (Avatar DVDs and Blu Ray discs) that many of its customers cannot use.

0393072231|5.0|What this book describes is obscene and insane.  The author explains the complex subject in a very understandable way. He effectively uses the tool of repetition, using different analogies, to explain his subject. I thought he could have done a better job moving the story along between January 2007 and June 2007. He seemed to become a bit disjointed -- hiccupping back and forth chronologically -- and the story was not as well developed -- and even stalled a bit -- during that period. But that had the effect of building some excitement about the book's end. Kudos for his character development. I loved the way he highlighted the quirks of the characters in both comical and dramatic fashion. My favorites - Dr. Burry and Cornwall Capital; those guys embody the vision of the best of American capitalism - the little guy playing in the big leagues and hitting grand slams. Their mental and personality quirks led them to play the market so perfectly.  I also enjoyed reading about the observations of Eisman by his colleagues.   I laughed out loud many times while reading the book.
B000GG4KTU|3.0|I first heard Diana Krall visiting friends in Phoenix. It was winter and the fireplace was burning, the lights were turned down low, the gorgeous Mexican waterfall was making its own music on the patio with the doors open, the gleam of the mahogany wood -- goodness what a wonderful mood setter all that was. And then she began to sing -- several staples and few extras thrown in for a little lagniappe (as they say in N'Awlins). Diana is a wonderful singer, she's smoky and her voice is often almost manly. At times she sounds as if she's barely singing but rather talking breathily. It's a different voice and may be the reason she hasn't achieved musical super stardom. I don't know, but I do know you'll enjoy this album as much as I did. When the day or week has been just too much for you, lower the lights, pop the merlot, and sit back and listen to Ms. Krall. She's delightful! And the fact she's married to that Brit, Elvis Costello, is an interesting side that makes for many enjoyable moments.

It is followed by five separate Curious George stories.<br /><br />I downloaded the Curious George collection for my daughter, who has a whole collection of Curious George paperback books.  She is in kindergarten and is able to read the stories; but they tend to run long, so she tires and needs me to help her finish.<br /><br />The Kindle version sports the familiar illustrations, although they are in black and white.  Sometimes, an illustration in the paperback version would span two pages, which makes it awkward in the Kindle version because my daughter only sees half the illustration on a page at a time.  She understands what is happening, because she has the paperback version at home; but this can be a problem for young children.  Otherwise, this is a great collection for the price and a wonderful one to have when traveling with children.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|Firstly yes, I was a fan of the graphic novel before the movie was announced. That being said I liked the watchmen movie from the beginning with the theatrical version. Honestly people, the change in the ending just isn't that big a deal, they were trying to make the ending more appealing to those who were new to the Watchmen and it honestly makes sense too. They cut some things I wish they hadn't but that's what has to happen in the movie biz. The director's cut added a lot of important scenes back to the movie. I also enjoyed Tales of the Black Freighter. The Ultimate Cut takes the two and combines them and then some. The Black Freighter is split up and spliced in to the directors cut at about the right times. Doing this allowed the news stand scenes to be added back in, which was great. This is a long movie at about 3 and a half hours but it doesn't feel overly long. It looks like it has some great special features that I haven't checked out yet, and, of course, the digital copy that I will never use. The packaging is great, very high quality and much better than I was expecting given Amazon's thumbnail. If you are a fan of the graphic novel or a fan of the movie who wants to see as faithful a recreation as is possible this is for you.
B002WIDRM6|4.0|Music is good, but a bit more \\"country\\" than I expected.  I like Bluegrass.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|My whole family enjoys this film immensely.  Even the younger ones love the colors and creatures.  Well done!!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men is an educational delight. A great precursor for entrepreneurs in business and in life. I've learned more from one season of Mad Men then I learned in 4 years of high school!
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I didn't hear about Perfect Chemistry until I joined the book blogging community. Since then all I heard was great things about this book. I have to admit I was a little skeptical at first. It sounded great, but I was afraid the built up hype might set me up for disappointment. I am so happy to say that wasn't the case. In all honesty, to say I freaking loved this book would be an understatement.    The two main characters were fantastic. They were well developed and impossible not to care for. The alternating POVs in every other chapter allowed the reader to get a good grasp on where both characters were at. Brittany surprised me in a good way. Going in, I thought she was going to be just another snotty rich girl. But right in the first chapter we get to see that there is much more to her. Her relationship with her sister touched my heart. Alex was a guy that cared so much for his family, he was willing to throw his life away to protect them. His story really had an affect on me. I have been guilty of having preconceived judgment about people in gangs. Gang members are losers trying to be bad asses, right? But here you have Alex, a boy who grew up in a bad area where he feels the only way to protect his mom and little brothers is to join a gang. Alex and Brittany both reminded me not to judge so quickly.    Alex and Brittany together were wonderful and infuriating at the same time. Wonderful because of the raw, well, chemistry they had with each other. They were different in so many ways, but in some ways they were more alike than anyone else. Infuriating because of their stubbornness! It was so obvious to the reader that these two were perfect for each other.  But they kept letting other's opinions and how they thought they \\"should be\\" stand in their way at times. But that is the perfect example of pier pressure in high school. And of course their stubbornness is what made these two so realistic.    The story was perfectly paced. This is the fastest book I have ever read. It got me hooked. \\"I couldn't put it down\\" is usually an expression, but here I mean it literally. It didn't leave my hands until the last page.  I think what I loved the most was the author's ability to capture the \\"voice\\" of every character. Each one was so authentic.     I couldn't believe how emotional I got in the ending. I felt Brittany's and Alex's emotions like they were my own. I cried the whole ending, but they went from mad tears, to sad tears, and finally to happy tears. The epilogue was unexpected for me. It was such a sweet touch for this beautiful story. Perfect Chemistry is one of those books I would recommend to anyone, because who hasn't felt judged, or judged another too quickly at some point? This is for sure one of the best urban romances I have read. Elkeles is a fantastic author. I can't wait to read more from her.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I actually haven't played the Blue Ray or DVD, but saw the movie at the theater 3 times--once iMax.  Had to have the Blue Ray.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The film is buy far one of the best blu-rays that i have bought. Also its worth the price i paid $20 for a blu-ray and dvd. I would recommend this for others to buy.
B001FB55H6|2.0|This was one of the few movies that I was excited to see at the theater at the time, maybe that is why I was sorely disappointed. From one too-gratuitous sex scene (that wasn't needed to keep the movie going) to way too much narration this movie was one of the more boring comic movies I've seen. (With the exception of The Hulk - the 2003 version.) The movie was rated R for the violence, language, and sex. There were some gory portions to the violence, some which were meant to be amusing, but they didn't reach that far. Much of the movie was taking itself too seriously which didn't work when you have people who are dressing up in tights to be superheros - without any superhero powers (with the exception of one), and without Bruce Wayne's money to back up their plans. Oh, but wait, they aren't supposed to have superpowers, hmm, then how did...yeah, I'll let you watch that and figure it out. The few moments that were supposed to be funny, weren't. A Jerry Springer-esque talk show moment made it that much worse. The only bright light within the film was hearing Billy Crudip's calm voice as Dr. Manhattan.
1572814349|4.0|the card was match my expectation, the picture is very beautiful and good material to. just for the book that come with the card, the binding is not to strong, and the definition of card a little bit narrow. but if you are expertise and just needed the card it is very recommended
B00133KDM8|5.0|I love Tarja's voice! I was very disappointed when she was booted from Nightwish (I do like Anette and I still love the band) but WOW! what a debut! Her voice is very enchanting and she always keeps you hooked in (I let several friends and family listen to her and they all agreed with me). I look forward to her next album. But, just for those who may be curious, her sound IS different from Nightwish. Certain songs (Ciaran's Well, Die Alive) bear a resemblance to songs she sang with Nightwish but you can still tell the difference. I am more than certain her next release will be just as good if not better!
031606792X|5.0|I really loved this book and was surprised to hear the negative reviews afterwords.  I don't understand why people think things have to end in tragedy to be good.  And I really don't get why people think the characters somehow changed, the decisions made throughout the book were right on cue.  I was left feeling very satisfied.  I've read it several times and really enjoy it.  Can't wait for many more novels from Stephenie.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Chances are you have already seen this movie and have your opinion. The picture is great, the sound is great. I gave this a 1-star because 20th Century Fox is going to to shamelessly triple dip. This version (in which the two-disks are Blu-Ray and DVD) has ZERO extra features. There will be a second version with extra features. And then a third version with 3-D.    I did not know this when I purchased this copy.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Janelle Monae is an innovative musical storyteller who unlike most artists these days is actually saying something. ArchAndroid is beautifully produced, thought-provoking, and entertaining through its many dimensions. Not much else to add to the stellar (and well-written, might I add) reviews. It is clearly one of my favorite CDs this year. By the way, does anyone know where I can find the lyrics? I am particularly interested in the ethereal \\"57821\\". 5 stars!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I'm a huge Dream Theater fan and this is one of their best albums. This cd is there most aggressive album and rocks from start to finish. I couldn't believe the rating of this cd. It kind of pisted me off to be honest. Any way give this album a listen it's killer and flows with lots of different tempos and the most important thing \\"it's heavy!!!\\" Pick this up!!!!
B0018TLRTK|4.0|I never figured out if Billy Idol was for real or whether it was all a \\"put on\\".  So many of the 1980's rockers affected a way of presenting themselves, normally as misbehaving frat boys.  Idol could sneer with the best of them, turn a phrase in \\"cockney accent\\", and overall appear like a \\"punk\\", standard for the times.  On the other hand, he could sing, he could move(on DVD), he could rock.  His Elvis impersonations(vocally and body language) were fantastic.  His sense of music, of pace and rhthym, were also non pareil.  The music was \\"driving\\", very \\"macho\\", and with few apologies to PC or other standards of behavior.  Cool...
097747609X|4.0|The delivery was prompt and the price was just right.  The translation is gets a little weird with all the punctuation but other than that it's a great purchase.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Loved this movie! This is one of my all time favorite movies.  All though this is not in 3D, it looks great in blu-ray. I think I actually prefer it over 3D.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|It wasn't as good as watching it in 3-D in the theatre but I knew it was going to be part of my collection as soon as it went to DVD. Love this movie!!! Nothing like you have ever seen before. It is not a cartoon!! And is for both young children and adults to enjoy!!! So get the popcorn and make this Avatar a movie night the whole family will enjoy!
B001P9EQH8|3.0|Well, I bought this unit only hoping to get a little more sound out of my Touch.  And it gave me a little...only a little.  But it was enough.  For the price I paid...I was not expecting anything dramatic...but in my opinion it helped the matching between my Touch and SE310's.  So do not expect a night and day difference.
089381525X|5.0|This book is by far the best photography book I own.  My first thought when I opened it was that it makes my other books look poor in comparison.  The images are printed large and full page.. And stunningly crisp and clear.  Then you get to the subjects and content of the photos.. Wow!  Within minutes of opening the book at my workplace (I'm a designer) , two people went online and bought it.  Stunning content and amazing composition by an incredible photographer.  It's impossible to be disappointed with this purchase.
B002RKXO6S|5.0|I received this CD quickly and in great condition.  Very happy!  : )
0061922315|4.0|A heartwarming story that is thought provoking and engrossing. A perfect blend of the culture of India, and the trials of adoptions and inter cultural marriage. The beautiful writing style is inviting and beautifully weaves together the multiple layers of this story. Two main threads are at the heart of this book, both are engaging and beautifully executed. One deals with the agony of the natural mother as she mourns her loss and provides insight into the history of India and a culture that does not value female infants. It spotlights the social issue of poverty stricken families surviving atrocious living conditions in the slums of India. The other thread emphasizes the joys and struggles of the adoptive parents trying to balance the vastly different opposing cultures of India and America. It juxtaposes being female in both cultures and examines the depth of a person's cultural soul and the challenge of melding everything together to find happiness and contentment. A great light read.
B0030Y11O2|5.0|Based on what people think they know about him Michael Moore begets strong reactions.  \\"Conservatives\\" berate and detest him.  \\"Progressives\\" love him.  Wherever you are on that spectrum, if you care enough to view this film in the first place don't overlook the extras!  The film itself is somewhat less overwrought than Moore's usual fare.  It is still pungent but rather less adolescently shrill.  But the extras, a series of interviews and vignettes, provide food for thought.  You need perhaps to view them in a second sitting since they run about as long as the film itself.  But viewed in conjunction with the film they do validly raise a number of elemental questions.  Is \\"capitalism\\" fundamentally good or evil?  Are there better ways (Moore seems big on cooperatives)?  Are we in for a civilizational clash between \\"capitalist\\" special-interest dollars buying pioliticans' votes, versus \\"democracy's\\" populist one-person-one-vote?  The film and the extras have their point of view but taken together fairly put it to the viewer really to think about and consider things judiciously.  In that sense, unlike Moore's more polemical earlier works this film (with its extras) does provide food for thought.
0810970686|5.0|As a school librarian, I serve a young population of 5- to 8-year-olds.  If I had a dime for every time I am asked (daily!), \\"Do you have any of those Wimpy Kid books?\\", I'd be rich.  The \\"Wimpy Kid\\" books are, by far, the most requested books in our library!  I have multiple copies of each, and there is a waiting list for all of them, several kids deep.  At first I thought they wanted them because their older siblings were reading them, and they just sometimes like the feel of a big fat chapter book (not that these are that big or fat), but then after they would tell me about their favorite parts, I knew they were reading them themselves.  Kudos to Jeff Kinney--how rare to write a book that appeals just as much to a middle-schooler as it does to a YOUNG elementary-age child (and whose content is not too sophisticated or inappropriate for the younger set)!
159562015X|5.0|I bought this book while in 'career transition' (ie laid off) to see where my greatest strengths lie, especially in determining what I want to do next and the roles that would be best for me.  The on-line assessment that comes as part of this book (you need the one-time access code that comes in the book to take the test) was dead-on and gave me a great assessment of my 5 key strengths, what they look, how to apply them and also what to look for in others to supplement and complement my strengths.  A great tool for anyone looking to understand what their best strengths are and how to apply them.
0440243688|4.0|This is an action packed novel pulsating with energy. A fast paced thriller and mystery with a tightly written complex plot, but very readable. Two facets in particular make the book interesting. Jack Reacher and his superior analytical skills. He's likable, sharp and uses his intelligence to apply logic and reason to problems and obstacles. Of course when logic fails he rolls into action. Also, the core of the book revolves around a terrorist plot which pulls in the NYPD, members of the upper echelon of Washington DC and the FBI. Most of the action takes place in NYC, where I live and work. Lee Child has done some great research. His descriptions of the subway system, areas he visits and his general observations are amazingly detailed and correct. Not a book for the squeamish though, as there are some very vivid and graphic descriptions of violence. In Summary the book is a little too descriptive at times, especially Child's descriptions of guns, but this doesn't detract from the overall read. It's an entertaining books with a puzzle to be solved, many layers of intrigue and lots of surprising twists. The books starts strong and stays strong with an intense, powerful ending
B003BKF696|5.0|Much better reviews have already been written here, but I will just chime in to say that this is the single best album I've head in years. These guys are simply the most exciting and worthwhile band around at the moment and you owe it to yourself to get their their last three wonderful albums. I'm a pretty die-hard Radiohead fan, but when someone compared this to OK Computer I found myself in mild agreement (whereas I normally just slap people in the face who make such a comparison) I haven't owned it for long enough (or listened to it 10,000 times like OKC), but the arch and tone and beauty and sadness that made that such a great album are most certainly present here.     Also, If you're not going to get the album AT LEAST download \\"Sorrow\\" for $1. If there were any broadcast platform left that anybody listened to, it would be a #1 hit.
B000002U8G|5.0|One of the great rock & roll albums of all time. Of course, I am highly biased where the Floyd are concerned. And this is third of my four favorite Floyd albums, in this order:<br /><br />1 - Animals<br />2 - Wish You Were Here<br />3 - Meddle<br />4 - Dark Side of the Moon
B001GM28HO|5.0|No matter what I'm doing (stuff around house, driving, etc.) this music grabs me. Strong melodies, arrangements and voice. The ultimate show-biz creature she is.
0793573742|3.0|Bursts, and a couple of gold tops.  If youre not into bursts... this really isnt the book for you.  Not much else to see here, even for Les Paul fans.
B000HM7J96|4.0|This book is a great story that will touch the hearts of readers at all age levels.  It is simply written, yet profound in its wisdom.  A definite recommendation for other readers.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Great Movie! Great graphics!  Great Plot!  This is one movie you have to watch!  Great Price from Amazon!
B002VPE1B6|4.0|The movie was great.  I saw it on the IMAX in 3D and it blew me away being so good.  The Blue Ray on my 37\\" home TV was no comparison.  The Blue Ray was good but I was disappointed that there were no extras as I was looking for interviews and other usual extras like bloopers and how they made it.
B0010ZR160|5.0|I couldn't find a flaw in this movie DVD. It was an outstanding purchase and terrific buy!
B000001E77|4.0|half of the songs are awesome.but james is rather inconsistent to me. either the best stuff you ever put in your ear hole or dud (compared to his other stuff not other artist comparing him to other artist is like comparing cathrine zeta jones to other girls just not fair)
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|This album is a muddled mess and a complete embarrassment. It represents either Keane suffering an extreme identity crisis or Keane suffering an extreme bout of hubris. Clueless or cockey? No matter - any album \\"featuring\\" so and so rapper and songs so insipid and sallow, regardless the reason, is rubbish.  The only good tune is Back in Time which earns the solo star all by itself. It is actually identifiable as a new Keane song - fresh and catchy, not just a rehash, bearing their trademark sound - and with guitar to boot!  They should have just released this track as a single and ended it there if they could not mine more from the same vein.  This could have been a breakthrough, instead it is a breakdown.  Hopes and Fears and The Iron Sea are excellent in themselves and especially by contrast. Both are focused and cogent pieces of work with strong musical ideas and lyrics very satisfyingly expressed throughout. They were mature and independent albums and embodied a very keen Keane sound.  On Perfect Symmetry you could hear that the center was giving way and the risk of the bottom completely falling out was readily palpable. Night Train is that possibility fully realized. A record clattering noisely and blindly on toward its final destination - 36 minutes 9 seconds and... blessed silence.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I can't say it any plainer than this: Breaking Bad is the best television ever and Season One (even though it is short) is essential!!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I am very happy I got this for my birthday. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I have watch it several times so far.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Anyone buying this movie has more than likely seen it before, so I'll just sum it up in one sentence:  a truly ground-breaking masterpiece with some unforgettable sequences (despite a fairly slow second act, but that can be easily forgiven for a first-of-its-kind film).<br /><br />With that out of the way, let's talk Blu-ray. Firstly, the transfer of this film is simply gorgeous. I bought the DVD back in 2001, but this is the closest I've come to the experience of seeing it at the movies. Obviously it won't look like \\"WALL-E\\" or even \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", but you're getting the most faithful presentation imaginable for a home format.<br /><br />Furthermore, the extras are plentiful. Story meeting recreations, concept art, featurettes, abandoned concepts... it's all here, as well as some relevant pre-\\"Snow White\\" Silly Symphonies. I'm not a fan of the \\"Hyperion Studios\\" interactive VR-style menu format, but I feel ungrateful even raising such a complaint against so generous a package.<br /><br />Do you enjoy great craftsmanship? If so, buy this Blu-ray NOW!
B000J3OTTQ|1.0|I respect every step up fan but i dint like it, it was a bit slow and borring at the same time.
B001HN69B8|5.0|Not counting Monty Python, my first exposure to Terry Gilliam was in the mid-'90s when I taped \\"Brazil\\" off TV one night. I didn't know what to make of it.<br /><br />Still, something drew me back to it, and after buying [[ASIN:B000G8NXZK Brazil - The Criterion Collection (3-Disc Boxed Set)]] and watching the set carefully, the film won me over. Every time I see it, I love it more and more.<br /><br />Something similar has happened with \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\". Gilliam's best films are dense and challenging, and each viewing reveals more layers. Anyone wanting instant gratification can instead busy themselves with a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay movie: quickie \\"explosion\\" flicks are OK for temporary amusement, but they don't sustain the soul.<br /><br />And that's what this film is really all about. Are you game enough to climb Mount Parnassus? If so, you'll be rewarded handsomely, though it requires patience and an openness to the wonders of the imagination.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you want an easily digestible FX extravaganza, look elsewhere.<br /><br />This is an intelligent, adult fantasy film brimming with ideas that don't always occupy the foreground. Good vs. evil, simple joy vs. excess and consumerism, the magic in the mundane: these are all themes running through \\"Parnassus\\", yet it's also about religious dogma and the role of metaphor in giving life meaning. Give it a go with these things in mind and you won't regret the experience.<br /><br />Incidentally, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is probably a better epitaph for Heath Ledger, if only because he's front-and-centre there. In \\"Parnassus\\", we're instead getting a great (albeit unfinished) performance as part of an ensemble. And for what it's worth, Christopher Plummer is the real star here.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|While I liked Lament and Ballad, I found this book to be better.  Grace is a fairly believable character - a teen girl who gets decent grades and has an obsession with wolves ever since she was attacked by a pack when she was younger.  I liked the idea of winter's cold playing a part and the author did a great job building up the relationship between Sam and Grace.  The ending seemed a bit abrupt, but it was enough to get me hooked and waiting eagerly for the sequel.
B000NY6F48|5.0|The speedy delivery and excellent shape of this \\"used\\" book were almost as good as the book itself.  And I loved the book!!
B000MV8ABS|5.0|It's a frightening movie, more so when I was younger,remembering the films especially the Tall Man. Is what creeped me out the most or perhaps the eerie yet very well put together score. I think it is a Good scary and creepy fun movie to watch.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|When I saw this movie in the IMAX theater, I knew I had to buy it when it was released on Blue Ray!  This is not stop action that keeps you on the edge of your feet from beginning to end.  If you don't have this movie, get it!!!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Saw it on Netflix,although a bit long and overdramatic at times, it is the quintessential 80's movie and a must see. It still relates to High School and modern school cliques and how everyone goes with their own whether it be class,color or social.Just to see Molly she is beautiful, I love redheads,But I am A bigger Fan of Brunettes and found the quiet girl turned beautiful cliche even better than molly. Yes the movie is long,the dance sequence is looked aside by me but it's a good movie.
0446402397|5.0|Smith does an excellent job portraying a bleak Stalinist Russia in the early 1950's, which is quite reminiscent of Nazi Germany, complete with cattle cars packed with prisoners and the constant fear of denouncement by neighbors or loved ones.  The heart of this novel is Leo, a complex and superbly written character.  He begins as a successful and highly respected government agent, and by the end he is a desperate fugitive whose only goal is to hunt down a child killer.  The transformation of Leo is very compelling as he is forced to adapt to his circumstances.  The plot contains so many different facets that contribute to the outcome: Leo's own personal history, his wife's motives, his colleague's jealousy, the dangers of the regime, and the pursuit of a serial killer in a country that denies the existence of crime unless it is against the State.  All components are woven together so effectively to create this engaging novel.  It is a mystery and thriller, a character study, and a history lesson.  Smith was greatly successful in portraying this totalitarian society and how it affected its citizens, and I look forward to reading the sequel and witnessing Leo and Russia evolve.
B001VS46DC|5.0|My favorite Diana Krall song is whichever one I'm listening to at the moment. The Internet radio stations I listen to originate in France; they play Diana two or three times every hour. Also Louis Armstrong; and Miles; Coltrane; Ella; Billie; Nina Simone. All the best. Now and again (every day) they play Otis Redding and Sinatra. It's not an eclectic mix, it's simply the best music the world knows as Jazz.    I won't compare the great Live In Rio DVD with the great Live In Paris DVD and the great Live At The Montreal Jazz Festival DVD. One is better than another? I wish I had a hundred Diana Krall DVDs, each one worse than the next: the worst would be great.    But since Diana always pays deep respect and homage to Nat King Cole (who was my mother's favorite), I'll compare Diana to Nat. They both were blessed with apparently ageless and beautiful skin. Also, Nat had perfect pitch, which Diana doesn't have. What Diana has - and she may be unique for having it - is perfect affect. Paraphrasing Samuel Johnson's praise for poet John Milton's epic genius, I'll say Diana Krall isn't the greatest of story-tellers simply because she isn't the first.    Krall's perfect affect doesn't show only in her singing and playing. There's an absence of ego, or rather, her ego seems to disappear inside the music, deep into its histories. And seldom has a performer of such celebrity and popularity bothered to mention regularly the composers and arrangers of the songs she performs. Her respect and gratitude are bottomless.    I can't believe each of these DVDs of hers can be had for under $100! And you can play them as often as you like!
B002T9H2MO|3.0|A good film, well-conceived and well-acted.  Maybe not the best science fiction ever, but worth watching.
B0033AGPG2|5.0|This record is great music.  I got the music on vinyl so the quality is really good.  I actully like this record better than the recently released Valley of Neptunes.  If you enjoyed Valley of Neptunes you will enjoy this record.  Jimi Hendrix fans buy this record; you won't be disappointed.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Yes, I am a horror film fan, so you have to take that into account.<br />This one is wonderful.  It's not particularly scary, but it's very funny, very well-acted (Bill Murray as himself is great), well-directed, the script is lots of fun, and it's a pleasure to see.  And see again.
B000S5BUXI|1.0|This album should come with a warning label to not listen to it while driving or operating heavy machinery, because it will put you to sleep.  How is this good music?  If you close your eyes and listen (without falling asleep), can you picture these songs as radio hits?
B001MYIXAC|4.0|What to say?  This film isn't scary at all, but it does have a lot of atmosphere, it is intriguing, and the idea is a very good one.  The best vampire film ever?  No.  But one that should be seen.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|There was so much buzz surrounding this album and at first it sounded to good to be true.  I read some of the reviews on amazon and it got my attention.  I then listened to some of the tracks and I heard such a unique and amazing sound.  I went and bought this album on Wednesday and it has yet to leave my cd player/ Ipod.  Janelle Monae has such a beautiful sound to her voice.  The album literally has something for everyone, and the music lover in all of us will appreciate her sound.  Listening to these songs I was reminded of artists that I love like Prince, Jimmi Hendrix, Billie Holiday, Lauryn Hill, and a little of the white stripes.  The greatness of this album and the artist in general is that she remains her own person.  She borrows from R&B, funk, pop, soul and hip hop but she remains true to herself.  One thing I love is that her sound is different.  Each song has it's own power and magic to it that I instantly connected with.  This is an album that any music lover would love!
B000NIVJEU|5.0|I have the movie on HD but I wanted it on Blu-ray, it was well worth the extra dollars as there is some excellent special effects.
0767819659|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about watching this film since I had such fond memories of the book.  And Frances McDormand as a nun...  she who played in so many of the bloody Coen brothers movies?!    Not to worry!  The whole film perfectly captured the magic and charm of the original.  In fact I think it improved on it.  And McDormand was wonderful as Ms. Clavell!  She played her just right---proper and strict but warm hearted and funny, too.  I loved her ride in the old Deux Chevaux with Genevieve, the Lab, beside her.  It's a role that could have been terrible hammed up but FM was perfect.  It's nice not to see nuns caricatured.    Hatty Jones was just right as Madeline, too.  Having cringed at too many cutesy child performers I was wary about this, too.  But, again, this Madeline was just the right mix of cute, spunky and smart....none of those qualities being overplayed.      The whole cast was terrific.  I enjoyed the appearances of the various Ambassadors, from the Spanish one and his wife who lived next door to the ones from Liberia and Uzbekistan who were house shopping.  Each one was just perfect.  Great dog, too!    Last but not least was the amazing city of Paris!  There were just enough beautiful shots of the city to add to the enjoyment of the film.     The director did a super job of presenting this material in a way that hit all the right tones.  The story is really sort of silly but it's told in a way that totally lifts your heart into that place of childhood magic and innocence.
B00006DEFA|3.0|I have always loved Amadeus.  While much of it is not historically accurate, it's a great story, beautifully filmed and acted.  The official version deserves 5 stars, hands down.  But the director's cut left in a scene that, for me, changed everything.  One of the things I loved about the script was that it left you, the viewer, in a cloud of ambiguity in regards to your feelings for the characters.  There were times when you absolutely detested Salieri and times when you sympathized with him.  And isn't this the way most relationships go?  I appreciated the fact that it was left up to me to sort out my feelings for the characters.  But the director's cut left in a scene where Salieri completely humiliates Mozart's wife, Constanza - an innocent who is looking out for her family.  This scene changed the whole tone of the movie for me.  It made Salieri a totally unsympathetic character and I found myself detesting him throughout the movie. My feelings were determined for me.  It left no doubt or sympathy in my mind regarding Salieri's motives; no compassion and no liking whatsoever.  I'm glad they left it out in the final cut.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I caught this movie in a hotel room while on a business trip. I had never heard of the movie or Temple Grandin. First off let me say, THIS is the type of actor's role that should win an Academy Award for best actress. Claire Danes WAS Temple Grandin in this movie. If acting is the \\"Suspension of Disbelief\\" Claire nailed it.      Now for Dr. Grandin, WOW! That is all I can think of to say about such and extraordinary person!  She is the type of person our schools should be holding up as a hero, a role model and a great example.  If Temple did not have people around her who loved her and who encouraged her to try new things we would not even know who she is. Instead of being looked at as disabled or defective she was looked at as unique and inventive. God only knows how many Temple Grandins have been relegated to mental institutions where they have wasted away or worse yet were aborted and were never given the chance to enhance mankind.  Thank you Temple Grandin for being who you are!!
B0037W68F4|5.0|I am a relatively new MGMT fan.  I acquired Oracular Spectacular in 2009, and while I enjoyed (and continue to enjoy) it, I like this one much more.    I initially listened to the album the week before it was released on NPR's website, and I was interested enough to go and buy it when it came out.  The album on the whole has a much more coherent sound than its predecessor, Oracular Spectacular.  All the hits from that album were in the same style, but I felt some songs were out of place on that album; here I find the whole album to be unified and coherent.    It's Working-  A great opener, it has a surf like quality, however I also hear some influences of the Baroque period of music in the backgroud, i.e., the harpsichord (?) effect that is used, and it's use reminds me of Vivaldi's series of violin concertos called \\"The Four Seasons\\".  Baroque is the most applicable to this song, as it is both complicated and demonstrate influence of the time-period.    Song For Dan Treacy- Another good song, has an almost Halloween-feel to it, which is more prominently heard in the song Brian Eno.    Someone's Missing- For those who are die-hard Oracular Spectacular fans, this one is most certainly for you.  This reminds me a bit of The Youth and Electric Feel.  It is an entertaining song.    Flash Delirium- This was the only premature release by the band, however IT'S NOT a single.  It is one of my favorites on the album, and although it uses simple chord progressions, it is (in terms of musical theory) worth a decent amount of attention.  Throughout the song, it continuously modulates through three different key signatures.  It has an intricate bassline, and I am reminded (in the last chorus) of troops marching off to battle.  Interestingly enough, it has the longest lyrics on the album, yet it is not the longest song.    I Found A Whistle- another song reminiscent of Oracular Spectacular, this one reminds me a lot of the Youth.  It's OK, but I don't particularly like it in comparison to the rest of the album.    Siberian Breaks-  Initially titled as \\"The Hedgehog\\", this is the longest song on the album, clocking in at 12 minutes and eight seconds.  The beginning uses some strange chord progressions, and then eventually modulates into a period of G-Minor, and eventually it gets to the second part of the song.  The second part gives me the image of sledding at night in the snow, and it lasts for several minutes, then there is a sound-effects transition into the third part of the song.  This is not reminiscent of either of the previous, however it eventually descends back into the original melodic line, this time with ride cymbals.  The last section with lyrics is one of my favorites, right before the original melodic line, which closes this part of the song.  Then it goes into a two minute instrumental led by the keyboards.    Brian Eno- The halloween-like style that is hinted in on \\"Song for Dan Treacy\\" is back, and much more prominent.  It is an excellent followup to Siberian Breaks, and it makes effective use of modulation, between D-Minor and D-Major.  In terms of how the song is sequenced, it reminds me somewhat of Unnatural Selection by Muse.  Overall, this is thoroughly enjoyable.    Lady DaDa's Nightmare- A four minute instrumental.  Intersting, and a nice way of tying up loose ends for the last song.    Congratulations- I know someone who thinks this sounds like \\"the Weight\\" by the Band.  It is apparently based off of a cynical philosophy held by Van Wyngarden, and it is the perfect closing to this album.  It is calm, and relaxing, somewhat reminiscent of Pieces of What.    I would most definitely buy this album, if you pay close enough attention to the little intricacies, you will be rewarded with a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
B0000C9ZSV|5.0|During his four year recording career, this was Hendrix's best band and his greatest live performance. Billy Cox's bottom meshed better than Noel Redding's. And Mitch Mitchell's jazz flourishes here worked well within Jimi's framework. Eschewing stage gimmicks, Jimi let his music communicate.<br /><br />The superb consistency of this May 1970 concert may be because he started balancing his set list of old classics with more recent material. He could invent his newer stuff with inspired freshness and this could afford him the opportunity to reinvent his concert staples (e.g. \\"Voodoo Child\\", \\"Purple Haze\\") without the ennui that had set in on some other shows.<br /><br />Perhaps the definitive version of \\"Machine Gun\\" is on \\"Band of Gypsys\\" and the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" from \\"Woodstock\\" is so collected in our mindset that perhaps it's not equalable. But so what! Neither of those two concerts had the effortless flow that this offers. \\"Stone Free\\" smokes and \\"Hey Joe\\" has never sounder bluesier. But the three greatest prizes are the electrifyingly hectic-paced \\"Lover Man\\", \\"I Don't Live Today\\"(more impassioned here than its studio counterpart) and especially \\"Hey Baby(New Rising Sun)\\", a beautiful combination of blues and jazz that gave the best glimpse of where his future may have taken him.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|Penelope is a great movie.  The acting is really good.  Christina Ricci and Reese Witherspoon are both charming as usual.  The story is fun and has a good moral about...well, you will find out when you watch the movie.  This movie can also be watched by the whole family as there are no sex scenes and very little violence.  There is a little gambling, alcohol, and an occasional swear word.

B0039TD7RC|4.0|I can pinpoint the precise moment the Rolling Stones stopped being cool to me (a middle-aged fan who's been listening to them since the late 1970s). It was that awful Super Bowl halftime show when they slogged through Start Me Up, Satisfaction and some other crappy standard while looking ghoulish (and not the \\"fun\\" ghoulish they sported from 1981-2000). It was the end of a great run. They retained their cache through four decades, even after their albums stopped being good. I think Some Girls was their last good album, but that ended the best string ever published. 1967's \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" wasn't great, but then they recorded Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, Get Yer Ya-Yas Out (a live album, but a great one), Exile on Main Street, Goat's Head Soup, Black and Blue, It's Only Rock and Roll and Some Girls.     Even after the new records declined in quality, if you were a Stones fan, they were still a must-see concert right up into the 2000s.  Contrast that to the Who, whose live shows got unbearably dull after they completed their Tommy and Quadrophenia tours in the mid-1990s (though I enjoyed the Quadrophenia shows tremendously).  I'm still a big Who fan, but I would never buy tickets to see them live again.      I just listened (twice) to the new reissue of Exile on Main Street and I love it. They noticeably cleaned up the flaws on the original (they got rid of that annoying tape hiss on \\"Sweet Virginia!\\") without ruining the raw, gritty quality that made Exile unique and unforgettable. Some of the vocals are a just a bit TOO cleaned up, but overall it's much better than the original CD release.  And you still can't make out what Mick is saying on most of these tracks, which is good.      But it's rarely worthwhile to shell out cash for an album you already own on CD, even if the sound quality is better. I bought this reissue on the day it came out because of the tantalizing prospect of 10 unreleased songs from 1972. The new songs aren't nearly as good as the ones on Exile, and some of the vocals sound suspiciously like Mick's voice today.  But the newly released material is better than anything on, say, Undercover. Two of the songs are alternate versions of \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Soul Survivor\\" (sung by Keith), but the other eight are honest-to-goodness unreleased Stones songs from the best part of their career. Some of the songs stand out.  I particularly enjoyed Dancing in the Light, and Plundered My Soul, which they released to radios stations a few weeks before the album came out, is pretty good too.  At the very least, this is the last decent new Stones material we're likely to hear, EVER. Definitely worth picking up for that reason alone, even if you already have \\"Exile\\" on CD.     All that said, many of the reviews posted here praising the vinyl version have me very curious.  A few more classic releases like this and I may re-enter a word I left behind in 1984 involving turntables, diamond needle cartridges, \\"Discwasher\\" cleaning tools and nickels piled on my tonearm to reduce \\"skating\\".
B0007MWZEK|3.0|The other reviewers are right. This product is NOT for carpet cleaning at ALL.   I've used this product for just over a year, and it just died on me a couple of days ago. The battery no longer charges. I was satisfied with it while it lasted. I only use it on our tile floors in the bathroom, to mainly pick up cat litter etc. Im contemplating on getting another one of these for the price as it is easy to store, easy to handle and does pick up the dirt on the tile very accurately.   But I dont believe that it would even roll on carpet? It's obviously not designed for that.   The reason Im giving it 3 stars is, after all this time they should be able to make a more durable product that will not require replacing every year.  I do recommend the product if you want to have a separate cleaning tool for hard surface areas to conveniently pick-up litter, sand, dirt or crumbs etc...
0385504225|4.0|Fully knowing that this book was being read out of order, I bought it largely because it was being clearanced from a \\"going out of business\\" sale. Boy! What a steal! Now I'm back tracking to Angels and Demons and TDVC (knowing full well the book is superlative to the movie). I truly thought my loving wife was going to fight me for this book before I could fininsh it. It was great! Having had an uncle that was a 33rd degree Mason made this experience even a bit more interesting. The twists and turns were great and I know just the person to cast in Sato's part in the likely event this should ever be made into a movie. But of course, like TDVC, a movie could never do justice to the written word. Great job Mr. Brown. Keep up the good work as you have a new fan.
0141182504|4.0|Meursault is a clerk in Algiers, an intentionally non-descript young man with no particularly interesting traits, characteristics, skills or habits. Now considered to be mandatory reading for those interested in notions of existential or nihilist philosophy, Albert Camus' \\"The Outsider\\" or \\"L'&Eacute;tranger\\" is the story of Meursault's life. Or perhaps it might be more precise to suggest that it is the tale of Meursault's indifference to and virtually complete lack of participation in the events surrounding him - how, in a sense, he is almost an indifferent, meta-observer of his own diffident state of being.<br /><br />As the story opens, Meursault is told of his mother's death and, although he grudgingly attends her funeral, he does not weep nor does he display any of the typical reactions or emotions that are expected of a person in his situation. In fact, instead of mourning, he engages in a casual sexual relationship with a former acquaintance that he enountered that day. A few days after the funeral, as a result of an almost absurd string of events and circumstances, Meursault shoots and kills a man. But rather than displaying any remorse or concern, we witness Meursault casually sit through his own trial and judgment with virtually complete detachment and indifference. Before his execution, a chaplain attempts to discuss matters of faith with him and turn him to God but, as with other events in his life, Meursault is disinterested and reconciled to the world's lack of interest in him and his fate as well.<br /><br />In trying to make some sense of what I had read, I wanted to at least learn a little bit about existentialism. As I now undertand it, a central proposition of existentialism is that existence precedes essence, which means that the actual life of the individual is what constitutes what could be called his or her \\"essence\\" instead of there being a predetermined essence that defines what it is to be a human. Thus, the human being creates his own values and determines a meaning to his life. Ergo, I am concluding this means that Meursault is the quintessential existentialist in that he had determined the steps of his own life, made his own choices and lived with them. Having done so, he was indifferent to others and their reactions to what he perceived as his own self-worth.<br /><br />I can say that The Outsider was ... well, interesting. For my tastes, unfortunately, I'd also have to categorize it as very bleak and joyless and certainly far from compelling. Perhaps, as a reader, I'm a bit thick when it comes to thinking of matters philosophical. But it is what it is and perhaps that's why I don't jump up and down suggesting that this is a must read classic.

B002ZG4Q5W|5.0|Kurosawa fans need not be deterred by the negative reviews here - they are over-wrought for the most part and evidence of extreme loyalty to the Criterion Collection.  No doubt Criterion has done much to earn the respect and loyalty of cinema fans, but let's not be silly here.  For whatever reasons, Criterion lost the rights to this film and the blu-ray is done by Studio Canal.  The questions one should ask are: 1. is it the best available? and 2. is there likely to be an improved release in the future.  The answers are, yes it is the best available presentation of Ran and no, an improved release is unlikely.   Most of the so-called defects appear to be characteristic of the elements used - and may even represent the original look of the film.  I saw Ran in the theater, but it was years ago and I could not claim to be able to remember enough to compare the look then to this BD.  But others who have seen recent presentations seem to agree that the image on the Studio Canal release more closely approximates the original than that of any previous version.  And the most egregious defects are virtually undetectable in a normal viewing situation.  So the discussion is academic for the most part - this is the version to get if you want to won this film.  Once you get past the chatter, you will find that it is a beautiful transfer of a great and beautiful film.  It is not perfect - but it is the best you can get.  Enjoy -  and after watching for yourself, you will likely  wonder how anyone could give this less than a 4 star rating overall.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|I am rarely driven to write reviews but this album is an exception. I had all but forgotten about \\"Exile\\" until the hoopla of the past few days. Listening to it now, I see why it was one of my favourite albums way back when. As others have said, it is the album, the sum of all of its parts, that is great.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and fell in love with it, so had to buy it.  Of course it is not quite the same on a TV screen as it was in the movie, but I knew that would be the case.  It is a sci-fi story about a civilization on another planet that is being infiltrated by people from Earth.  The inhabitants of the other planet are very attuned to nature and can do marvelous things while interacting with it.  The earth people in general are only interested in exploiting the planet so of course there is conflict.  The earth people are stereotyped as the bad bullies, and while I find this annoying, it is probably necessary for the story.

0802713319|3.0|In Fermat's Enigma, Simon Singh offers a compelling trek through the last 2500 years of mathematical development, always focusing on developments that would impact a mathematical conundrum - a proof to Fermat's Last Theorem. This is a delightful book, and I think even the mathematically challenged will find the tale fun and exciting. While I think Simon Singh's The Code Book far outstrips this one in material, quality and challenge for the reader, this book is well worth the read.<br /><br />The book is aesthetically pleasing, having a wonderful font, important when text is intermingled with numbers and variables. Illustrations litter the pages, providing diagrams and representations of key concepts as well as the faces of major players in the story. Where math is required it clearly stands apart and is handled in a way that complements without weighing down the story. Beyond that, it is a quick read.<br /><br />While a good portion of the story covers a wide span in history, much of the story is a limited biography of Andrew Wiles, the mathematician responsible for the final ingenuity that proved Fermat's Last Theorem. Simon also highlights the secrecy of the work of Wiles, similar to that of Fermat's own work - with Fermat coming out as the more devious of the two, in my opinion. But the story clearly shows that the solution to Fermat's challenge rests not on the work of one man, but many notable men and women throughout history who devoted years to this problem. However, as with any retelling of historical events, Singh offers a subjective view of cause and effect that is somewhat arguable, and sometimes even derails the story a bit.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed reading about the development of mathematics among the Greeks, and the mathematical developments of the 1800's. Though the former does not speak to Fermat's Last Theorem, it provides the backdrop to it in the Pythagorian Theorem. And the latter provides an interesting look into the advances in both math and science that would shape the modern world. While Fermat's Last Theorem itself is not an \\"important\\" mathematical principal, its proof has been the catalyst for the integration of disparate areas of mathematics, as well as an impetus for developing new means of calculation and logic.ld shape the modern world.

B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book was gorgeously writen as Mia relives memories in her life after her body is detached while she's in a coma. My only complaint is that it ended abruptly, and I didn't evr want it to end. However, it was super climatic and I don't heavily complain...NOT AT ALL! This story is heart touching and pulls you in. Its very suspenseful as Mia tries to decide whether or not to stay alive.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and Andrew Lloyd Webber.  I was so excited to hear that he was behind the creation of \\"Love Never Dies.\\"  I had no expectations for it to \\"replace\\" the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and the music.  Webber is great at weaving melodies throughout his score, and I found this to be no exception.  The songs were catchy and memorable...in fact, I find myself humming them frequently.  I am excited to see the musical in person!
B0037W68F4|5.0|In Rolling Stone a few months back, I read that MGMT was going to release a new album soon, and my heart almost stopped. After falling in love with Oracular Spectacular, I couldn't wait to hear their second album. The weekend it first came in, I listened to Congratulations a total of 12 times the whole way through; it might sound somewhat obsessive, but I couldn't get over how much I liked it. Sure, it's hard to compare it to OS; there are some songs on the album that remind me of the first album (Someone's Missing, I Found a Whistle, Congratulations), but for the most part, it's quite the musical leap from their first. I was so proud of Andrew and Ben's decision to stray away from singles; the album is meant to be listened to the whole way through each time, the way albums are supposed to be. What a novel idea!     And as far as the album cover? \\"Well, people that are stupid don't understand it, but cool, smart people get how awesome it is.\\"  Andrew VanWyngarden, you sure have a way of explaining things.
B0035WTJFW|3.0|The review will be based only on picture and audio transfer on blu ray format. So disregard the script, the plot and actors of the film. If you wanna know the synopsis and story review, read elsewhere.     The blu ray format of this movie has a mediocre quality, grainy and shady in most scenes. It's a shame for this movie to be labeled on Blu ray since it doesn't meet the picture quality. Here's a good comparison of Perfect Blu ray and a mediocre Blu ray.  The Dark Knight (Christian Bale) is perfect picture, 10/10 liquid crystal clear picture while Minority Report is 7/10. It's a coincidence that Tom Cruise's \\"Collateral\\" movie has also the same problem.  30-40gb of data is just ridiculous.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|It's hard to fully explain how much I love this album; I listened to it nonstop the summer before my freshman year in high school, so it has a tremendous sentimental value for me. Every single song on this album is a masterpiece in its own way. With every listen I found intricacies that I hadn't heard before, making it feel like I was hearing it all again for the first time. Some people would argue that this album has its standout singles, the rest being fillers, but I disagree. Sure, Electric Feel, Kids, and Time to Pretend are the most well-known, but their counterparts are arguably better. This album blew me away; if you're looking for something a little off the beaten path, but not too obscure that it becomes unenjoyable, it's a great musical investment. I haven't been this excited about a band since the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and for me and my two year obsession with them, that's saying something. Buy it, listen to it the whole way through, and if you're still not convinced, I'm really not sure what could do the convincing.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Of course, if you buy this album today it is going to sound 80's. It was recorded in the 80's!!! Some of the ratings here even complain that there is no singing!!! hahaha. That made me laugh. I can see why those who do not play guitar or think of Ashley Simpson when they hear the word \\"music\\" can't fathom the technical and musical skills featured on this album, but for those of us who do play, even though not many get to the level of Satriani, it was, back then, an incredible source of inspiration, an eye opener to endless possibilities. After I heard this album for the first time, I saw the guitar in a whole different way. There is much music out there these days, more \\"modern\\" sounding albums, new styles, etc. But you have to appreciate this album for what it is: one of the greatest, most influential 80's-instrumental-guitar albums.

It trains your body in the basic steps, from arm movements to a tremendous shimmy drill that starts slow and builds to become a marvelous workout. These exercises build muscle tone, good posture, correct breathing, and everything you need to advance in learning the art of belly dancing.

Starting with a wonderful performance, and then breaking it down so it can be learned in sections. There is a section of \\"practice loops\\" which is very useful, so you can repeat each section until you know it by heart. The first piece is lively with a touch of humor, and the second piece is slow and sensual. Both are terrific and as taught by Rachel, easy to assimilate.

B0039ZF89G|1.0|I've been a huge fan of the Taylor years. Although my favorite album isn't this one, I decided to get this box set to see what Jagger's current position was with the golden era of the band. As many may or may not know, none of the top quality performance of this era - or of the entire history of the band -  have been released by the Stones officially, only available in bootlegs. From their US tour in 1972 to the European Tour in late 1973, the Rolling Stones have left behind a handful of brilliant performance to which level they were never able to reach after the departure of Mick Taylor. I as a guitar player always have loved the \\"Taylor Tone\\" especially form late 1973 and have been searching for it to come out of my own amplifier. His licks as well have become a huge part of my style, but the way he combines them as well as the scales, is just a work of a genius and out of this world - he played every show differently!!! Combined with the rough and wild playing style of Richard, Taylor gave the Stones' guitar section a \\"the Beauty and the Beast\\" kind of a contrast, as well as a huge dimensional depth. All of that just died after 1974 and worse, never revealed.<br /><br /> \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\" would have been the first official release that could have boosted the Stones way up to a higher position in Rock history - although it was one year before the European tour where they really peaked as a band and although they never will be able to recreate this quality anymore, neither with Taylor.<br /><br />As a result, how many tracks were there on the DVD??? I can only remember two. The only consolation is, that at least with the \\"All Down The Line\\" track it was made clear that the Stones with Mick Taylor were something in a completely different universe and that it was this era where they reached their height of their career as a band - especially live. And the fact that something like this - and even more - is still being kept behind locked doors, is now out in the open.<br /><br />Many of us started playing the guitar because of the Stones. But many of us -especially the younger generation- don't know what more there was to them. The Taylor years deserve much better treatment and deserve to be highly recognized and credited. Doesn't Jagger want to admit it officially? Or is he protecting something of value to his own personal sentiment? I don't know, neither am I interested. But \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\" should have been released completely from \\"Brown Sugar\\" to \\"Street Fighting Man\\". What they did to it on this box set, was just insulting to that era of the band as well as to their fans.<br /><br />Wait a minute.... Don't you dare tell me that a full version of \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\" will be released soon!!! If so, shame on you Jagger!!!us started playing the guitar because of the Stones. But many of us -especially the younger generation- don't know what more there was to them. The Taylor years deserve much better treatment and deserve to be highly recognized and credited.

1402712367|5.0|This is a must have if your daughters are into chapter books. My daughter who is 10 loves to read and has always love to read. I can't remember if I bought this when she was 9 or 10 but it is a great book and after she read it we watched the movie together. Another great book she loves is Anne of Green Gables and every year for Christmas she gets a new book in the series. She loves them and really loved this. It is easy to read and hard cover, it didn't take her very long but she will sit and read for over an hour at a time some times.
B000056OZP|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MILES' BEST ALBUMS EVEN IF HE DIDN'T LIVE TO SEE THE COMPLETITION!  THE SMOOTH SULTRY FLOW OF THE HORN COMBINED WITH EASY MO' B's RAP IS TOTALLY OFF THE CHAIN.  AND AT 20 CENTS B PLUS SHIPPING HOW CAN I SAY \\"NO\\"?
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I recently purchased this adapter to transfer accounts from my old macbook to a macbook pro.  Worked wonderfully and now allows me to use my old FireWire 400 drives without any problem.  Transfer speeds are only that of 400, but that's to be expected.  Really great product that kept my legacy drives and target disk mode available on new FireWire 800 hardware.
B00280LYIC|5.0|this was a very well written book. I read the whole series in 2 weeks.
B002HNAAZ8|2.0|I have loved Danger Danger since they played at the County Line Saloon in Melbourne 20 years ago. I have everything they've released. This release is so sappy and over vocal harmonized that it's hard to listen to. I've been through it 4 times and for me the only bright spot is Rob Marcellos solos. The problem is the songs have no edge. It's soft... kinda like Melodica. All the songs are too lovey dovey (even FU$).   Please fire Ted and bring back Paul Laine. At least he had a set.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Thsi is a really good informational  sidebook (side book meaning not actually part of the series but  unraveling the story even farther than the actual stories go). All in all a funny book.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Excellent movie, great quality with blue ray.  It is great that amazon offers it at such an affordable price
B002VPE1B6|5.0|After seeing this movie twice in the theaters we knew we were going to buy it as soon as it came out. Believe it or not it is even better on our tv. The colors and HD were amazing. The movie loses nothing by not having 3-D on the tv. So glad we purchased it!
0743270754|4.0|Have a few months free to yourself? I did, which is why I read this 940-page monstrosity. However, I did enjoy every minute of it and Doris Kearns Goodwin's writing style makes it easy to read. You feel like you're with Lincoln every step of his life and the depth at which she describes the \\"supporting cast\\" makes you feel like you know who they are too.
B001RT89UG|5.0|Ok, I know that to many fans the ultimate MSG live album was their Budokan album in 1981. I think it's a decent enough album, but 1983's Rock Will Never Die is the real deal. Well, the remastered & expanded version is. While it doesn't have the mighty Cozy Powell (RIP)or Paul Raymond, Rock Will Never Die features a hot band that does justice to all the material. All four MSG albums are represented on the 15 song remaster, along with the obligatory UFO's Doctor, Doctor encore. Lead singer Gary Barden sounds good here, but the temporary addition of ex-Ted Nugent vocalist/guitarist Derek St. Holmes beefs up the vocal department tremendously. Ted McKenna thunders on the drums so nicely that one almost doesn't miss Cozy. Michael Schenker is on fire throughout the show and has never sounded better. The sound is crystal clear and very powerful, giving the listener a great perspective of what it really sounded like the nights this album was recorded. For a single CD snapshot of what the original era MSG sounded like, there's nothing better than this one. Highly recommended.
1400082773|5.0|Upon securing the Democratic nomination in 2008, I went out an bought both of Obama's books to get better insight into this man that would go on to become our 44th President. What I enjoyed about Dream from My Father was it is not a political book since he wrote it prior to entering politics. It was also a very easy read as it's written like a novel and it gives great insight into his thinking and the way his mind reasons. I would highly recommend this book and if you intend to read both of the president's books, read this one first regardless of your political ideology.
0061245097|5.0|This book was fabulous and one of those that you cannot put down.  I am not going to give a book report on it but just my views of why I liked the book so much.  For one thing, Bones is a vampire who has attitude.  Also....he sucks blood and not bagged blood. I cannot even picture Bones feasting on a bag of blood.  Ugh!  When I read Frost's first book, Halfway to the Grave, I thought.....finally a real vampire book....a vampire who does not suck bags of blood.  Frosts lets you feel his power through her words.  He is the ultimate Vampire and I was not disappointed in One Foot in the Grave where Cat and Bones are teamed up once again.  The book is full of surprises even for me who can usually tell what is going to happen before it happens.  I do hope she continues on with the character of Bones for he is one hot vampire.  Of course, there is Cat who I think many can relate with.  She has a sense of humor that gets one laughing.
0143116177|4.0|Niall Ferguson goes through the history not just of money but also various security instruments like bonds, stocks, etc. He goes through great detail to examine not just the origin of each type of security but the needs at the time for the creation of such instruments. I recommend this book to any history buff that has read about all sorts of world history but has never read a detailed examination of the origin of money. His style can be a bit difficult to follow at times but it's worth the attempt to read through it.
0385006896|5.0|Everything that is to be expected on a hardback book. Arrived in good conditions, beautiful addition to classics collections.
0307455874|4.0|This book essentially launched his campaign to run for POTUS. What I like about this book is the frank and honest criticism of both sides, Democrats and Republicans. It is refreshing to see a politician criticize his own side in print to the same degree that he/she would critique the other side of the aisle.
B000003TAL|4.0|Daydream nation improves once again. After SST helped launch Sonic Youth forward, much gratitude from fans, THANK YOU!, Sonic Youth disconnected with SST and signed with Enigma/Capital/EMI.  Ok fine, whatever, this album follows suit to EVOL and Sister, with a comitted blend of semi-pop song structure and it's unique to form experimentalism.  If you like Sonic Youth, this is a must have in your collection.
B002KH4KSY|4.0|First off, I seen the original movie before I read the story by King and I loved the movie. I also loved the story and what we got is the best of both worlds. If I would have read the story by Stephne King first, I probably would have hated the original movie version, but both movies hold up. The revisioning does not show the slaughtering of the adult, do they really need to? The second version to me is more likely to happen than the first. Either way, both movies has its qualities and both deserve to be watched. I recommend watch both movies and then go read the story, then form an opinion.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|Madonna is awesome. Her concert was out of this world. I alway get the best from her. I have just one request from all her fans out there. Let's ask Madonna to release her Blond Ambition tour on DVD. Then we will have all her songs on DVD because this one is more on her recent songs.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The world of Ghibli has astounded its fans for almost 30 years and while the last ten years were not the kindest to this animation studio, Miyazaki himself knew it was time to take the helm once again to remind us what makes his films so great. With that he gives us 'Ponyo'.<br /><br />Loosly based on the classic film 'The Little Mermaid', Ponyo is a gold fish that knows there is more to a simple life than just staying under water in the care of her sorcerer father (who strangley enough it not fish like at all). With a little intuition she escapes to the surface and takes on a human form. The she finds a little boy names Sosuke, a boy who's favorite thing in the world is to help people. When he comes upon Ponyo he wants to care for her too and they form a very special bond. Now the two of them need to fight and let her father understand that the world of the sea and the world of the surface can live together in peace so long as both worlds understand just how important they are to one another.<br /><br />This film is such an enjoyable on, because of the fact that it has gone back to the magical roots that make Ghibli films so amazing. The scenes where the water looks like faces crashing onto the last is so creative and all the bright colors and the innocence of the characters make the film more enjoyable. 'Ponyo' is the very first Ghibli film to be shown on a wide release of U.S. movie theaters. It is about time too. While there haven't been such great films since 'Spirited Away', 'Ponyo' is a sign that hopefully as the studio reaches it's 30th annuversey there will be some new films that are just as magical as the greats that came before it.
B001J29H9I|5.0|By far and away one of the best collections of music I have heard.  Absolutely worth every penny and then some.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I've been waiting for this album to drop since I saw them perform at Rock The bells '09. This album far exceeded my expectations. This is a breath of fresh air. The combination of hip hop and reggae is truly amazing. I love every song however my favorite song is \\"Patience\\". I highly recommend this album for those of you who are tired of liatening to the garbage played on the radio.
0307454541|5.0|The book was outstanding and I started on it the minute it arrived.  I am anxiously awaiting the release of his third book.  The delivery on this was very prompt.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I really enjoyed the sixth part of the Harry Potter series. It really starts to pull at the heart strings and awaken emotion with young love and heart break. It is my favorite so far in the series.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Percy Jackson series and I had very high hopes for the Kane Chronicles. I can happily say Rick Riordan didn't let me down! First of all let me say this, as it was my main concern going in: it's FUN to read. Having said that, I'll also add that for readers in their 20's like myself, while we may not find the book challenging, it definitely does a good job of mixing egyptian mythology with lots of adventure (and wonderful humor), so it never feels like it's a \\"kids only\\" type of book. Sometimes I even forgot how young the characters were!<br /><br />I have recommended this book to friends and they've all liked it. I can't wait for the other 2 books to come out!<br /><br />PS: I bought the Kindle edition and I don't remember anything negative about it. It's even more enjoyable than reading a DTB edition of Percy because of how comfortable the Kindle is.
B00009RDG8|2.0|The move starts pretty good, but by 2/3 the way it becomes so unrealistic as to become almost unwatchable.  Fights are kind of cool, but don't waste your money here.  I'm sure some cable channel has it for free as a late night B movie.    Got 2 stars because it started well, and for the action...that's about it.
B001BGTWXI|4.0|ok seriously. cmon  corey, this is slipknot not stone sour.    1..execute: a good intro, kinda annoying but ok  2 Gematria(the killing name): a perfect song to mosh, headbang, or even just listen to. the lyrics are great  3.Sulfur: an ok song, i cant believe they made a vid for it though, it didn't need one.  4: Psychosocial: probably the best song on the album. although the bridge(screaming the limits of the dead) drags on.  5. Dead Memories: again ok, its worth listening to. the drum beat is awesome, but ,it lacks heavyness.  6. Vendetta: ok song, at least you can actually hear samples and turntables in this one.  7. Butcher's hook: hated it. it sucks.  8. Gehenna: got 30 seconds in and skipped it.  9. this cold black: better than the last 3 tracks. its listenable.  10.wherein lies continue: its ok. nothin special  11. Snuff: this was a great song. not typical slipknot at all, but still a good song. love it  12. All Hope Is Gone: a great song to name the album. the lyrics are very true in todays society, and they have several points: the hell is humongous, the devils among us: extremely true.  We will burn because we wont unite: its true, greed is corrupting everyone, and its horrible  what will you do when the war is over, what will you do when your system fails: the american government is polluting the world with lies and is corrupted. what will they do when the war  is over. theyll start another.  AND LASTLY THE CHORUS:  we have made the present obsolete: everyone thinks about what to buy next, and when to do something.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|one of the best revenge movies ever made! man has daughter, man loses daughter, man has to find daughter. awesome movie!
B002VPE1AW|3.0|Wow, It's like I had the Director's commentary track on.  Never have I seen a movie that was so predictable with such shallow stereo-typed characters and yet so visually stunning, that all I thought about was film making.<br /><br />During the whole movie I kept thinking:<br />-Wow that was a great CGI shot.<br />-Those military aircraft look really similar to those in \\"The Terminator\\".<br />-Look at how saturated the colors are.<br />-I like how that Alien looks like something from Cammeron's last film \\"Aliens of the Deep\\".<br />-Those things reminds me of the loaders that Sigourney Weaver used in Cammeron's other film, \\"Aliens\\".<br />-Now cut to hero shot.<br /><br />When Grace and her avatar were laid at the base of the tree, you knew instantly what would happen to her in that scene and to Jake at the end.  Not only did that scene show what would happen to Jake in the end, but also exactly what would be the last shot of the film.  Not that you didn't already know that from the first scene with the eye opening and the 'my previous life was just a dream and I'm just now waking up' voice over.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I liked it.  You will too.  Hopefully you'll enjoy the story.  For me it great watching a talented summer blockbuster craftsman at work.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Excellent story and brilliant affects. Principles and conviction and accountability. Loved it and will see it over and over.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I'm delighted with this recorder.  My previous audio recorder was a Sony Minidisc recorder - it's great to be digital now.  I found the recorder easy to use.  I added a RedHead windscreen, which works much better than the Zoom's foam windscreen.  My only complaint (easily resolved) is that when I hold the recorder in my hand, the mic is very sensitive to movements of my hand.  The solution is to hold the recorder by the mic stand (the short stick that comes with it).
0393932192|5.0|In preparation for an extensive trip to West Africa, I sought out a few novels which promised to inform and enhance my trip. One of the books I encountered was Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart. That was a happy discovery. As one travels through this part of the world, so much is hidden and mysterious, unexplained and distant. Achebe's narrative of one man's struggle to make peace with the colonialists who have conquered and dominate his Ibo village area of Nigeria is absolutely touching and brilliant. One needs to read little else to get an idea of the shame and the brutality and inhumanity that the Europeans brought with them to the places they traveled in the Third World.<br /><br />  The story itself is dramatically and skillfully written but the drama and the relationship between conquerors and traditional people who work so hard to retain the cultural practices they value is what makes it required reading for anyone who is interested in the interplay between the foreign visitors and the long time dwellers in such traditional places. The drums beat throughout in the background and the values of the village are well exemplified by the elders who set the tone and guide the story. This is a wonderful book by a fine representative of African literature. One of the best I have read in a very long time.
B002JOUNDY|5.0|This lines comes from a conversation between Victor and the Creature where he describes the intense mix of love and rage swirling inside of him.  \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" was somewhat maligned by critics which is a surprise to me given that it is the best, most beautifully acted, written, and produced version of the classic horror stoty.  It's also the only version true to Mary Shelley's vision.  Despite the criticisms, I watch the movie in awe, as ot captures very element to such superb and emotionally devastating levels, it ranks as one of my favorites of all time.  Want a cast?  Kenneth Branagh, Helena Bonhan Carter, John Cleese (unrecognizable), Tom Hulce, Iam Holm, among others and of course, a stunning performance by Robert DeNiro as the creature.  The Creature, as in Shelley's version, is articulate, sympathetic, and terrifying.  An abandoned, deformed child in a world that reacts with cruelty and rejection, leading him to lay siege to his maker and all he holds dear.  Everything is spot on.  The cinematography is no short of exhilarating, both in its panoramic shots of the swiss alps to it's candle lit interiors.  The score by Patrick Doyle is robust, sweeping, and romantic.  Branagh the director does not shy away from brutality and gore and the visual and make-up effects are superior and visceral.  This is the definitive version in my mind.  It looks stunning on Blu-ray as this is a Sony catalogue title, it has been given a painstaking remaster and its a revelation and will send your standard copies to the trash can.  Superb and will remain a favorite of mine for years to come.
B0037N7XEI|4.0|This is the second episode in the HBO adaptation of the popular Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels (the first episode is [[ASIN:B0037MNKDC Strange Love]], see my review there for the content description).<br /><br />This episode picks up immediately after the events of the first episode and finds Sookie in very bad shape. Since it is still early in the series, there is still a good bit of character development and introduction of main themes and additional new characters.<br /><br />As before, the casting was fairly good and the actors are mostly believable, which is a relative term in reference to a vampire themed HBO series. The special effects have been kept to a minimum, so far, so the plot is mostly story driven.<br /><br />This series is not for everyone and definitely not for younger viewers!<br /><br />CFH
B0019LY5IM|5.0|everything went perfectly. delivery on time and product in perfect condition. i'm a happy customer!
0393072231|5.0|Financially-savvy folks have already reviewed this book for financially-savvy folks.  This brief comment is for potential readers that, like me, don't know squat about the world of bonds or of those that live within that spooky world -- yet wonder whether this book can help them make sense of the recent economic mess.<br /> The book helped me so I'm pretty sure it can help you.  It can also help the uninitiated divine the efficacy of new government regulations for financial firms.  What's in new regs that will or won't matter -- what's smoke and BS; what didn't make it in for political reasons (the hedging industry is so huge back home); or because the lobbying industry is so huge in DC.<br /> You'll probably need Google and Wikipedia to unravel arcane things like short-selling, hedging, options, puts, derivatives, and such.  There's an alphabet soup of acronyms:  CDSs, CDOs, and similar nonsense.  My advice is to print out whatever definitions you Google up, else 25 pages later you'll be right back.  This stuff don't stick in your head.  There's also this strange language to get down:  \\"hey man, I've lived my whole life long and here I am short.\\"  Not talking here about tall and short people.<br /> Lewis assumes you already know that.  If you don't, but if you do make the effort to get on top of those things, at least till you're through the book, the recent economic mess and new government regulations will make much more sense.
B003BKF696|5.0|High quality album from a high quality band. As a fan of The National's early work; one can definitely notice an immediate slowing of the pace on this album - with the track primarily focusing on the plodding/brooding side of The National that you hear on their \\"Sad Songs\\" release. Perhaps a bit less depressed and more musically eclectic at this point in their career - the album may not immediately jump out at listeners like \\"Boxer\\" did with pounding drums and strong buzzed-up guitar backing. If you know The National and you know how close they are to going massive ... you gotta love how this album keeps you (and them) right on the edge of it. Maybe this is the year they'll make that plunge ... or maybe they'll just stay the best kept depressed secret ever.     Favorite Tracks Include: Afraid of Everyone, Bloodbuzz Ohio, and Lemon World
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Never ever viewed a move like this one! Cannot believe how animation can be so REAL !  I always order my items from Amazon because I know I will recieve it fast, in perfect condition and know that Amazon would replace promptly if necessary! I trust Amazon more than any other online \\"store\\" site.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|An excellent album - hipster critics be damned.  Nearly the entire thing is catchy and smart (much like their first two album releases) and they are clearly comfortable in their own skin - a unique one.  I suspect this is going to be in many Top 10 of 2010 album lists before things are done - and BoH will continue to become a more well known band.  They deserve it - and can finally shed the worn-out 'scene' they've left behind. The title track, Laredo, Northwest Apartment, and Dilly are just a few of the obvious singles - but the entire track-list is quality throughout.
0743454537|4.0|I bought this book for my girlfriend because she said she wanted it for her birthday.  She loved it so much that she is trying to get me to read it. I don't think I will, but according to her its a great book
0525421580|4.0|I think this is a book that will certainly be enjoyed by actual teens rather than adults who are fans of the YA genre, for the most part. The copy I have is a reader's edition given as gift. The ending was especially disappointing where our two Will Graysons and everybody named remotely something similar meet up at the Tiny crossroads, only to feel the need to loudly proclaim that they \\"appreciate you, Tiny Cooper!\\" as the entire crowd sobs in an overly emotional manner having their minds exploded over the masterpiece that his play, \\"Tiny Dancer,\\" is. Really? Watching 3 hours of a gay teen circumvent any backlash for his sexuality and ponder why he is such a man-whore who dated 18 boys in a few years was that impressive?
1582701709|4.0|My Mom was the first person to read this book in my family and she strongly recommended it. I reluctantly bought the book and read it and really can't praise it enough.  It really changed my outlook on soo many things.  I Think its a good read even for those out there that are skepticle
B000000H42|5.0|Such a perfect album, I could try to explain why it is so good, but just listen to it and you'll understand why its a masterpiece.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|So far I've used this device for over 300 miles of running.  It's better than some of my prior experiences with Polar, but overall, it's too pricey for the performance and features.    As mentioned in prior reviews, the scroll feature is ok, but it's kludgy and easily activated by brushing against the unit.    I have yet to get the software updates to work on my PC (windows 7).  Very annoying when it continually asks to upgrade, you click yes, the software 'installs', but it doesn't work or update.    The data transfer is mediocre at best - the proprietary software that loads events to the web and to the PC need work, and have this weird way of simply losing data.  I've had several sessions disappear on me.  Very frustrating.    The virtual partner function, heartrate function, and time of run functions work, but they aren't the easiest to navigate while running, and they could have done a better job to make the info visible.  I have good eyesight, and it's difficult to see the text while performing.    The software displays different info, but is also very basic and doesn't really do a good job of mapping historical info other than having items to click on where you can see information.  Probably there are more features that can be used, but it's not intuitive other than to see how far you've run, heartrate, etc.    Thinking of moving to another PC?  Good luck - it wiped my data on trying that.  Support is the pits to try and get help - the message boards are full of folks trying this or that.  Essentially this is yet another tool that falls far short of what it should do - reliably store, transfer, and allow viewing of data, and be able to massage that data easily into historical records/database for analysis.      The GPS function seems to work well - I've used it 3 times.      The watch needs to be calibrated to a track or use GPS to get accurate results - i haven't done that that, and using a treadmill means the watch is off by quite a bit until I do.    I suggest you spend your several hundred dollars elsewhere, or wait for some serious reworking of the software and technology.  A pretty watch is all you get - the functionality, support, and reliability is not present in this device.  I wish I could return it - it will be gathering dust along with my prior junky polar device soon.
B003LXSY60|5.0|I'm a bit new to the Keys.  My first record of theirs was Attack and Release.  With that record, it only took me two minutes into the first track \\"All You Ever Wanted\\" to know that the Keys were my new favorite band.  Likewise, with Brothers- from the first seconds of the first track \\"Everlasting Light\\" - I knew I was gonna love this record.  And having owned it now for only about two days, it's been in steady, constant rotation.  It's a total classic.  Blues, rock, soul, simmer, r&b, roadhouse shakers... man... the Keys just melt it all down into an amazing musical gumbo.  Standouts for me are Sinister Kid, Tighten Up, Next Girl, The Go-Getter, She's Long Gone, Ten Cent Pistol, and of course their awesome cover of Isaac Hayes Never Gonna Give You Up.  This whole album is deeeep.  Buy it ya'll.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I give this film 5 stars because the actors,actress and whole screenplay made the film believable and transported the viewer back into 1820s London into Little Dorrit's World.   This is a excellent movie to add to your BBC collection.
B003KGBISY|1.0|Editorial Review states, do not accept any less than the 203 minutes intended for this film, yet the description states this BR version is 145 minutes in length. Where did the 1 hour & 2 minutes disappear to. Hopefully this is a typo. Although I've read some negetive reviews I still believe this film in it's original version is a masterpiece, not to be toyed with. I read someone saying they would prefer a dubbed version. Good luck in finding english speaking actors that can express the same emotions the original actors did. It has been my experience dubbing is far inferior to subtitle. A good example would be Mel Gibson's Road Warrior. Though Mel speaks english somebody's infinite wisdom decided he sounded to austrailian and dubbed the film. Watch both versions of this film dubbed and subtitled and you'll see what I mean. Emotions tend to get lost in the translation.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I am so very happy to purchase this movie, I had forgotten so much about this beautiful movie, and my 3 y.o. is going to wear this dvd out so I might have to purchase another!
B0000032LS|5.0|This is REAL FUN. If at least once,you was present in a full packed theater,   with Frank N' Furter style dressed people screaming to death I'M A SWEET TRANSVESTITE!!   and throwing Rice and water and all the ritual supposed to be done along the screening.  Then, this experience return to You, every single time you play this record,(that still stand by itself in terms of music).  If you did not participate of this event, hardly will understand why some people do make a cult out of it.  I personally do not enjoy massive concerts or cultural events. But this case is a very different thing.  I don't have information for this continuing to be screened as it used to be in many countries for every week end,   and even less with the screaming crowd going to do the show, but if you find it. GO!   And then buy the record. It will be very hard when you play it not to sing along and wish to get free jumping and dancing.  I was extremely young those days, but hope people nowadays could be naive enough to do it again and enjoy so much as it used to be.
B000A0GP18|5.0|This version is a lot funnier, and a great tribute to the classic 1974 film. I loved that they brought Burt Reynolds back to play former football player Nate Scarborough. Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a disgraced former football who shaved points in a big game. After stealing his girlfriend's car, he is sent to Allenville Penitentiary in Texas. Warden Hazen wants him to put together a football team. Crewe, Caretaker, and Scarborough train some inmates in a game against the crooked guards. I highly recommend THE LONGEST YARD!!!
B000002MZ9|2.0|...well the good points being, lyrically it is pretty strong and some of the songs are listenable.  However, compared to a lot of Neil Young stuff, it really doesn't hold its own.  Yes, there is a lot of Neil to listen to...he's explored so many different avenues, and you really have to give him credit for that.  He wasn't necessarily trying to stay on top of the game so much as keep moving and stay artistically fresh.  That being said, this album is one of those experiments.  You might dig it, might not; I really haven't.  The album art is pretty incredible, and honestly that is why I bought it.  I guess the old adage about judging a book by its cover (album in this case) holds true.  A lot of these songs just drone on - there didn't seem to be much thought put in them past the lyrics.  Musically, it is sort of boring.  I kind of expected the songs to pick up, change...something, but they never do.  I can't say who is to blame for that, but I know Neil can and did do better on other albums.
044024238X|2.0|I read the whole Shopaholic series, great books, so I was eager to start reading her other books, and bought them all at the same time! I started reading this one, and I'm sorry, I know, and expect it to be, a \\"light and funny book\\", but I could not keep reading this. When this career woman makes a big mistake at work, and later on gets mistaken for a maid, and can't seem to be able to tell her new employer that she isn't and just stays there... Now I have this other book from her I didn't read yet, Can you keep a secret, I might get to read it someday, but I'm just not interested anymore. Thank God I read the Shopaholic series first, so I know that this author is capable of writting a good story, but The Undomestic Goddess book, is definately not her best one.
B00368PSN2|5.0|I've only seen a bootleg version of this movie in the desert, and I honestly wasn't expecting very much from it.  But this movie ended up suprising me.  It was a lot of fun, had a very good story, and was the type of movie you could watch again a couple more times.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a must see for everyone, it has opened my eyes. And it will change your way of thinking.
B00192IV0O|5.0|I read through a lot of the reviews that mention this CD isn't as good as past BEP music, but I disagree. Yes it's more electronic and what not, but it's still awesome. The songs are still traditional funky Black Eyed Peas, but with a twist. You can't help but want to get up and move around or tap your leg as you're listening to this. Get it, you won't regret it!
B000002GBJ|5.0|Back in the early 70's I first heard Yes I loved them and went out and bought the Yes album and Fragile. Those are in my opinion their best work. I was immediately impressed with Wakeman's keyboards, especially \\"South Side of the Sky\\" from Fragile.  I never bought this album back then as my musical tastes went off in a more heavy metal (AC/DC, Van Halen, Rush) direction for awhile. I just purchased this album and heard it for the first time and I have to agree with alot of the reviewers. Absolutely stellar keyboard work. It has a distinct classical baroque feel to it, almost like a Beethoven sonata with different movements, key changes and time signatures. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you appreciate TALENT, buy this album.  As they say in England, it's absolutely brilliant.
0316044407|2.0|I was really excited to read this book, but was pretty disappointed by the end.  The author is so random in her writing, and introduces many stories and concepts and never develops them enough for you to understand why she brought them up in the first place.  It got a little ridiculous when Suzie came back to Earth and chose to have sex with a guy who hasn't heard from her in 8 years.  Like some 13 yr old would even remember you after 8 years!  The mini-stories and flashbacks were so random and underdeveloped that I never got attached to any of the characters. And it was so random that the mom suddenly didn't want to be a mom and abandoned her whole family on a whim. No one made her get married and have three kids! Then her pansy dad just accepts her back into their life? That's not love! That's deseperation. I love that Buck cussed her out! Finally!    The whole book was just mini story after mini story and then the pages just stopped. There was no real ending, except of course, her sister naming her baby after her. Predictable. It left me extrememly unsatisfied.
B0035J6TA8|5.0|This is not the most easily accessible PG cd..but give it a few listens.  The \\"on demand\\" culture will probably give it one spin and never return...but it gets better every time you listen to it.  The song choice is very inspired and PG sounds passionate as ever.  Yes the tempo is slow slow slow throughout..but so what?   True PG fans will be happy once it settles in....
0810983915|5.0|Do Days is book 4 on Diary of a Wimpy Kid, great reading for kids, they are motivated to read these books which further enhances their reading ability. Anything to take them away from cartoons and the XBOX!
B000QUUD60|5.0|THE WAY THIS DISC IS...IS TOTALLY TERRIFIC!  GREAT FILMING OF ELVIS' COMEBACK IN 1970...WATCHING IT FEELS LIKE BEING THERE.  ELVIS IN TOP FORM WITH BOTH HIS HITS AT THE TIME AND FAVORITES FROM EARLY DAYS.  FORMAT IN VEGAS IS EXCITING TO WATCH...ELVIS LIGHTS UP THE STAGE WITH FULL ENERGY!  SHOWS HOW TIMELESS THE KING OF ROCK TRULY IS.  FOOTAGE OF STUDIO REHEARSALS AN EXTRA PLUS.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DISC FOR ELVIS FANS AND NEWBIES ALIKE!
0783226837|5.0|There is not a whole lot I can add to the very nice reviews already posted to this sight; difficult to come up with anything that has not already been said.  Never-the-less, since this movie is at the top of my list of films that are simply fun to watch, I feel a need to add my two cents.<br /><br />I am one of those people who love movies, but have an absolute loathing for T.V. in general.  I watch, not counting DVDs and VHS Tapes of movies, about one hour of Television per week.  Other than the movies I buy or rent (I dislike the movie channels because I hate to be tied to their schedule), I have no use for a television set, other than the fact that about twice a month I spend the evening mindlessly channel surfing.  I probably do that more to annoy my wife than for any other reason, although I do find it relaxing.  For some reason it is very comforting to me to know that at almost any given time, while I surf, I can find this movie playing somewhere.  This has been going on for years now it seems.  It is one of those certainties in life; sun rising, taxes, death and Tremors.  There are reasons for this!<br /><br />The first thing a viewer must do, to truly enjoy this film, is to not take it, or themselves, serious.  This entire work is a take off on all of the old 1950s horror films which were so popular at that time.  This film is not meant to be taken serious.  It is simply fun.  You can tell from the actions of the actors featured in this work that they had a great time making it, and this attitude leaks off the screen.  In many ways, laughing with this film is in many ways like laughing at ourselves...something that is quite healthy from time to time.<br /><br />The film features some very likable rednecks living in a remote desert crossroads community, in the absolute middle of nowhere.  I was a bit unsettled when I first watch this film, as I swear some of my family members certainly must have been the prototype for some of the characters.  (Don't snicker...you all have them, you just don't admit it in public as I am doing here).  Anyway, this unique and eccentric group of people is besieged by some worm like critters that tunnel under the sand and eat you.  Make no mistake, a bit of fun is being poked at Dune here (Rightfully so...Hollywood took a SiFi classic and mucked it up with a very poor rendition on the big screen...I will probably never forgive them for that).<br /><br />Kevin Bacon (Val) and Fred Ward (Earl) play two good old boys to a tee.  Michael Gross and Reba McEntire are hilarious in their role as two gun slinging survivalist Wing Nuts in their bunker, and the young lady heroine does a fine bit of acting as the only intelligent one of the group (plus having very nice looking legs).  All in all the word play and the one-liners alone make the film worth watching.<br /><br />As hokey as the plot is; as unbelievable as the situations get, you find yourself cheering (quietly I hope) for the small band of people and wondering if the worms are actually smarter than their prey.<br /><br />I like this movie.  It is relaxing, funny enjoyable and a great movie to have playing with a group of friends...you don't have to watch all that closely and can still carry on a conversation.<br /><br />I strongly suspect that this movie will be around for a long, long time.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksjust don't admit it in public as I am doing here).

B002VPE1AW|4.0|Great movie.  Saw it in the IMAX Theatre 3D and wanted to have the movie as a keep sake.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|This is a review of the DVD I got from Amazon last Christmas when they were $9.99 special pricing. Guess they knew what I didn't find out until 3 viewings later, the DVD is a piece of junk. After 2 viewings with no problems, on the 3rd viewing and all subsequent viewings, the DVD sticks, pauses, skips and generally does nasty things that make watching the movie a drag. Tried new DVD players with the new TV, then my old and first DVD player, it does it on every one. Not such a bargain at $9.99 after all since I now need to go buy a new DVD if I want to watch the movie again without all the problems.     As for the movie itself, not my favorite, they left out a lot of important stuff and added some things not even in the book (what's up with Harry and the waitress?) but it was still fun to watch and the special effects are fantastic as usual. I am really looking forward to the final 2 movies so I can have a POTTER marathon and watch all 8 movies in one day on some cold winter weekend !!!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Great movie with a fabulous cast.  Sandra Bullock rocks!  I had to have the movie even though I saw it in the theatre.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Of all the films devoted to popular music, only a handful rise to the top in my opinion:  \\"Woodstock\\", \\"Monterey Pop\\", \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" and \\"Gimme Shelter\\".  All of these films feature the cream of the rock music world and three of them focus on the now outdated fad of music festivals.  However, it is \\"Gimme Shelter\\" that separates itself from the rest as it is the only film that depicts the more sinister side of rock and roll ... by displaying the greed and general contempt the upper echelon of rock music displays towards its mass of followers.  \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is a one-of-a-kind film that is part concert film, part documentary and part drama/mystery/action/thriller.  It has all the ingredients necessary to keep most viewers glued from start to finish ... great music, hedonistic rock stars, crazy people and murder.  It is shocking, insightful and downright haunting ... even to this day.<br /><br />A simplified summary of \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is that it documents the Rolling Stones on their 1969 American Tour that culminates with a free concert at the Altamont Speedway in California.  The film starts with Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts (the Rolling Stones drummer) viewing the footage of the free concert; this is followed by a series of radio interviews of those involved with the free concert.  Right from the start, you realize that something horribly wrong must have occurred at this free concert.  But, just like a good book, the film immediately returns the beginning of the story, the optimistic and exciting start of the Stones' '69 tour ... forcing the viewer to see everything that leads-up to the impending drama.<br /><br />As \\"Gimme Shelter\\" proceeds, we are treated with some excellent concert performances of that '69 tour (including Tina Turner's stirring, soulful and sexually-charged version of \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\").  The Rolling Stones appear to be in top form as they appear before sold out venues, complete with adoring fans jumping on the stage to get a piece of the superstar, Mick Jagger.  Between the concert footage of the Rolling Stones tour, the viewer is given a \\"behind-the-scenes\\" view of the colossal effort involved in organizing the grand finale ... the free concert in California ... \\"Woodstock West\\".  Additional footage of the band offstage and in-between venues displays the cool, arrogant nature of Jagger, as well as an incoherent and apparently drugged Keith Richards.  It appears very clear that the Rolling Stones are only expected to show up for this scheduled free concert ... as they casually discuss this pending event, we see the organizers frantically trying to make the event a reality ... you immediately sense that it could be a disaster.<br /><br />Once it the free concert is finalized ... at the Altamont Speedway ... the remainder of the film is devoted exclusively to that concert.  Serving as a documentary of the times, the viewer is treated to seeing the migration of some 300,000 concert-goers to the Altamont Speedway ... a graphic and thoroughly entertaining display of drugs, outrageous attire, uncontrollable body movements and general lunacy.  Then, the mood of the film becomes darker as the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club literally takes over ... the crowd and the film.  As the opening acts of the concert perform, the violence begins as bikers begin beating concert-goers, as well as the Jefferson Airplane's Marty Balin.  By the time the Rolling Stones appear, it is night-time and obvious that it is the Hells Angels who are in control.  As the Stones play their music, the crowd's vocal reaction to the violence drowns out the music and there are points where the band is forced to stop playing in order to try and calm the situation.  Finally, when things appear calmer and the band begins playing \\"Under My Thumb\\", violence suddenly erupts again and tragedy strikes.  At this point, we realize what the beginning of the movie was all about.  The ending of the film clearly depicts the RollingStones fleeing the disaster of their free concert by cramming into a helicopter ... leaving their fans to fend for themselves in a sea of Hells Angel-infested waters ... an eerie and lasting impression.<br /><br />\\"Gimme Shelter\\" is a must-see for any fan of rock music, the Rolling Stones or popular American culture.  The footage is raw and entertaining ... it grabs a hold of the viewer and digs in.  The Criterion Collection version of this film has greatly improved the visual quality of the original footage and offers a few extras that were not included in the original video release.saster of their free concert by cramming into a helicopter ... leaving their fans to fend for themselves in a sea of Hells Angel-infested waters ... an eerie and lasting impression.    \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is a must-see for any fan of rock music, the Rolling Stones or popular American culture.

1400064287|5.0|I was totally engrossed in this book from the very first pages. The writing style is engaging and captures your attention throughout. The constant references to real situations help bolster the author's position.<br /><br />I walked away from this book with a heightened appreciation and understanding of what makes some things more memorable than others. It has helped me with my business marketing efforts and has enabled me to take a more critical look at not only my own advertising but also of my competition.<br /><br />I think this book would be enjoyable to read and would provide great insight even to people not involved in marketing. The principles outlined in this book can be of great benefit to anyone who communicates with anyone else... that includes just about everyone I guess. Really enjoyed this book.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie was awesome. It was full of action and I believe it had a deep underline message to send to people. It certainly holds your attention and pulls you into the story.
0679805273|4.0|What a perfect graduation gift as it teaches kids to believe in their dreams.  Another gem is Growing up with Loukoumi by Nick Katsoris which teaches kids that if they work hard and believe in themselves then their dreams will come true.  Both are excellent gifts this time of year and all year round. Perfect messages!
B000LPS47U|4.0|This is a great realease of one of the greatest horror films of all time, I would like some more extras but I'm asking too much, if the added 6 hours I would feel that good stuff is been left out.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|I don't know - is there such a thing as a BAD Enigma CD?  I don't think so!  I have all of their CD's and I love all of them, equally the same!  I am always eagerly anticipating their next CD, which it seems to me, doesn't come soon enough!  They are the best around providing this type of musical experience!  Buy it - you'll like it!
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This film transcends the exploitative horror genre by truly focusing on the characters.  Every person has believable motivation and a sympathy inducing background that serves to fully suck the viewer into the events unfolding.  It is not for the weak of stomach, even fans of horror should be warned...this film will draw you in so that it may deliver an antiviolent message by using shocking techniques to hone in on its point.  A cult classic.  Put this film at the top of your must-see list.
1401323820|5.0|I was happily surprised that the book was as good as the series. Fast, witty and with twists and turns that kept you guessing until the end. Can't wait for the next one!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm a beginner and this is great - you can pick your level of \\"comfort\\" (assuming your comfort level is going to be very uncomfortable), but I object to haveing to watch the promos before accessing the workouts.  I always put the DVD in, mute the t.v., and let it play through the promos while I get ready to do the workout.  I apologize if there is a way to skip this process and I have not discovered it - I've tried everything I know. I do not think they should require me to watch the same commercials each time when I have made a daily commitment to the program.  (I've tagged my review to be notified if anyone comments, so I would be glad if you could tell me how to skip the intro part.)  That said, I'm hoping for good results from this program.  20 minutes is definitely within my commitment range.  I do move between levels, although you're supposed to work through them in order.  I like the variety, and I don't memorize Jillian's comments so readily in this manner.  And I do try and do more than 1 a day - I like the challenge.  (I just don't want to be told I have to do more than 20 minutes to get results...)
B003HI3MSE|3.0|This band has great musicians and production, yet it gets lost in all the other Hardcore-Emo Rock out there. Nothing new here at all. This might as well be Breaking Benjamin, Chevelle, etc.....<br />Bored after the second song.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|I have been a huge fan of Keane since Hopes and Fears.  I have seen them every time they have come to Chicago except once (out of town).  Tom's soaring vocals, the quality song writing, nice piano based songs, the first album is great a song at a time or listening to in a complete sitting.  Under the Iron Sea and Perfect Symmetry flagged a little from the debut but still rang true as quality work.  But Night Train?!?.  I couldn't wait for it to end - I wasn't able to even finish some songs. I have no problem with Keane wanting to try rap but this is just bad rap.  Night Train lacks coherence, has poor quality song writing, there is no sparkle.  I can't bear to see Keane live anymore after this lackluster effort...
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Excellent compilation of his music. PLUS a bonus CD of the Bucharest Concert, with even better clarity than the original.
B00005NVDF|5.0|This has got to be one of my top faves. I can watch it over and over again if i could. Just to see how Allan's character starts out and how it all ends up.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Having 2 military family member, this movie felt very real. Plus I love the humor and the relationship portrayed between the guys. Felt so real. Good story. Everyone in my family loves it.
0312360258|1.0|I got about half way through this book before deciding I couldn't stand to read another page. Even for a young adult series the writing was unbelievably silly. The superficiality and immaturity of teenagers was highly exaggerated. I found it most amusing that the authors appeared to pride themselves on their \\"teen\\" dialogue by using words like \\"poopie\\". I don't know a single person over the age of 5 that includes the word \\"poopie\\" in their vocabulary. I also found the constant pop culture references to be a distraction from the story. With all the references to current celebrities this series is going to be severely outdated in a couple of years. Overall, a \\"vampire finishing school\\" was an interesting plot, but the writers failed at creating interesting characters to drive the plot. I suggest reading Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead instead.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Poor film, special effects looks bad and probability of some of the catastrophes occurring the way they portray are not within the realm of physical science. We ending up making fun of the whole film while watching it.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Oh my, seeing MJ in action is the best! You can really tell the difference between him in rehearsals and him giving it all. He is amazing and it shows in this video. He was an amazing talented man and super pop star.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I couldn't see this movie enough times. I'd go with anyone who hadn't seen it at the theater then preordered it. I love how they took such a potentially scary theme and turn it into a humorous film. Woody Harrelson is the bomb!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|A must have for any MJ fan. He was at his best til the end.
0307716988|5.0|Read this because MJ wrote it. Even tho he wrote it awhile ago, it shows some good insight how he grew up and it is easier to see why he developed his eccentricities. Seems like a coping mechanism for not being able to live normally, such as not being able to go out in public without being mobbed. Still he kept his values intact. He was very down to earth.
B003097ABA|5.0|Wow! Five great albums for less then $20= Mine sound great- maybe its the S.I.D. I just got but the insterments were clear and seperate and the whole thing Rocked Im tickled pink black and blue I got a Steal!!1
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Oddly, this movie is like an intricate clock, it's tempo steady and controlled, yet never boring; jeweled perfection. Or like smooth jazz, never reaching for a big ending, but complex, drawing one's attention into subtle rhythms.
B00362DRNG|5.0|Okay, I had some skepticism of the Collector's Edition of \\"Duran Duran\\" since I was unsure of the sound quality and the various selections that were being offered up.  To get the remastering issue on the table, the original album tracks (including \\"To The Shore\\") and the B-Sides of \\"Late Bar\\", \\"Faster Than Light\\", \\"Khanada\\", and \\"Fame\\" all sounded fantastic and the sound quality was enhanced to the degree that you can tell a significant difference between the original CD of this album and this remastered version.    The other reason that I had hesitated was that I was that I thought that the demos would not have been up to the same caliber of the original songs, but how wrong I was!  There are some rarities and unreleased versions included that will help bump up the collectibility of this volume.  Case in point, when I heard the studio version of \\"Tel Aviv\\", I was skeptical because the song starts out very brooding and dark (much like the debut DD album material), but during the instrumental bridge of this song, Andy Taylor just ROCKS IT with some really powerful guitar, complemented by the pulsating drumbeats from Roger Taylor.  Towards the end of the instrumental bridge, John Taylor KICKS IT with a pounding, bass beat to Andy Taylor's guitar.  It is by far one of the best tracks on the collection and I much prefer this version to the original instrumental version of \\"Tel Aviv\\", which was included on the original album.  Also, if you listen to the studio version of \\"Girls Of Film\\", it sounds like you are magically transported back to the days of the early 80s when synth pop was just beginning to take off (If you are older than 40, you know what I mean!  Anyone under 40, sorry you were not there to experience the magic and wonderment of the 80s, which DD was a big part of!)    All in all, I have purchased the Collector's Editions of \\"Rio\\" and \\"Seven And The Ragged Tiger\\" along with this Collector's Edition and this one by far surpasses \\"Rio\\" and \\"Seven And The Ragged Tiger\\"!  (I know, I know, a lot of the Duranies are probably saying, \\"Well, wait a minute, \\"Rio\\" is a bonefied New Wave Classic and \\"Seven And The Ragged Tiger\\" includes \\"The Reflex\\", which was the band's first Number 1 hit in the US)  But, it is a matter of opinion and how much of a DD fan that you are.  I run a continuous MP3 track of DD songs on my MP3 player of my all-time DD favorites and I had to include the Studio Version of \\"Tel Aviv\\" - it's that GOOD!    All in all, I recommend this as a strong purchase, as even though I'm an original DD fan from 1981, there were even a few pleasant gems that even surprised me!  The only thing I could not figure out are the differences between the Extended Night Version and the Club Mix of \\"Girls On Film\\" - they sound exactly the same!  You can tell a huge difference between the Night Version and the Club Mix of \\"Planet Earth\\", so I'm not sure why the band felt like they had to distinguish these 2 versions of \\"Girls On Film\\".  The rest of the goodies are included here including, \\"Careless Memories\\", \\"Night Boat\\", and the long-lost (but always welcome!), \\"To The Shore\\".  A great, great purchase that I am not regretting - Enjoy!
B00362DRQS|4.0|I had been waiting in anticipation of the Collector's Edition of \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" for quite some time and I was glad that the band finally released it in the US (The original release date was supposed to have been back in March, but for some reason, it was pushed back to May).  I think the sound quality sounds fantastic and I did not notice any hissing or popping and it does in fact sound much better than the original CD quality volume that came several years ago.      As far as the selection goes, DD could have selected some unreleased demos to really bump up the collectibility of this volume.  Don't get me wrong, the inclusion of \\"Is There Something I Should Know\\" and \\"Faith In This Colour\\" are assets to the strength of this collection.  However, years ago, I heard a bootleg of a demo of a DD song actually called \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" (it sounded like a cross between \\"To The Shore\\" and \\"Union Of The Snake\\")  However, the sound quality of this demo track was so horrendous, I only hoped that one day the band would officially release this lost gem.    The other shortcoming is that the band could have thrown in \\"The Wild Boys\\" and \\"A View To A Kill\\".  Now, before all of the Duranies jump me by saying that \\"The Wild Boys\\" was originally on the live album, \\"Arena\\" and \\"AVTAK\\" was on the James Bond soundtrack of the same name, then why was \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\" included in this volume?  For those fans who were not around in 1983 when \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\" was released as a standalone single, the band decided to bump \\"To The Shore\\" off of the debut DD album and replaced it with \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\" and re-released the first Duran Duran album in an effort to boost record sales for the debut album and \\"Rio\\" while \\"Seven And The Ragged Tiger\\" was getting ready to be released.  (After all, DD was very slow to catch on in the US and did not really catch until this time period - they were bigger in the UK before hitting it big in the US).  So, all in all, since the next DD Collector's Edition is going to be \\"Notorious\\", they could have included the hit songs, \\"The Wild Boys\\" and \\"AVTAK\\" in this edition and would have completed the 1983 - 1985 DD heyday period in the US.  (I would have rated this 5 stars had those two songs been included, but I still rate it 4 stars).    At any rate, even though all of the tracks on this edition are previously released material, it is still a great album to purchase for your collection, especially if you are a true DD fan, which I am since about 1981!  Great Job to EMI and the band, but for the upcoming \\"Notorious\\" and \\"Big Thing\\" collector's editions, try to include some never before released tracks or demo versions to enhance the collectibility value of the editions.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|'District 9' is one of those movies that blindsided me - I had heard a little about it before seeing it, but few specifics. I was excited and hopeful, usually signs that I'm about to be disappointed. Not only did the film not disappoint, it went well beyond any expectations I had of it.<br /><br />In terms of story, it's a film where very little is as it initially seems. You are presented with a deceptively simple scenario - a large alien craft has sort of broken down over Johannesburg, South Africa. The aliens within, numbering over one million, had to be rescued and brought to Earth, kept in a separate zone of the city (where the film gets its name). Their technology was advanced but only usable by the aliens. All this you learn in the first five or ten minutes, and the rest of the story develops from there at a breakneck pace.<br /><br />The first impressions of characters you meet early on shift and pull back, revealing hidden facets and surprising twists. Initially weak people end up showing surprising strength, and people who seem initially unimportant become very important indeed. Pay attention to the details as you watch 'District 9' - it's well worth it, and almost a necessity to catch the subtle hints of character and depth as they develop. It quickly becomes clear that there is something not quite right in District 9, and whether that is coming from the aliens, the humans, or both is what is revealed, with deliberate and calculated pacing.<br /><br />Stylistically, 'District 9' is just as impressive. The initial scenes are done in a broadcast news format to bring you up to speed with the story so far, and while the news team goes away relatively early, the style stays the same. The whole movie feels a little like a documentary shot on-location, in the moment, which results in a very genuine feeling overall. The effects are impressive and well-integrated into each scene, so much so that it becomes hard to tell what is effects and what is part of the scene. And after a while you just don't care, because the story grabs you and doesn't let go.<br /><br />'District 9' is one pleasant surprise after another. Simply put, it's science fiction as it should be - an exciting story, believable characters, and a real personality. It avoids the grandiose and exaggerated and explores its ideas and themes in a very personal way. 'What if this were to happen?' it seems to ask...and the answer is frightening, hopeful, and enlightening all at the same time.<br /><br />All this in less than two hours? Yeah, I was pretty blown away too.ust don't care, because the story grabs you and doesn't let go.    'District 9' is one pleasant surprise after another.

B002ZG98VE|5.0|The film is not only dealing with Robin Hood, the famous and mysterious character of English history and the Forest of Sherwood. It is a lot more, a film on the tricky period when Richard Lionheart coming back from his crusade is killed in a battle in France. This time when John Lackland is taking over and has to face the attempt to invade England performed by the French king Philip II Augustus. The invasion was prepared by a treacherous friend of King John who tried to use his friendship to serve the interests of the French king. He submitted the northern part of the country to heavy taxes and a lot of violence that caused their rebellion against the king, which should have enabled the French fleet to disembark and conquer London. The film is essentially an adventure film but it is also based on history and it respects that history. The way the King manipulates the rebellious barons to get their help in time to defeat the French on his own beaches is the perfect case of a liar that uses the belief in divine kings of the time only to seize more power and deprive others from any small piece of it. We know it will take fifteen to sixteen years for an alliance to be built between the barons, the church and the merchants of the City of London to force that king John to come to Runnymede and accept to sign the Magna Carta that will change the world, that represents the first step of that vast historical change that we call democracy. Fifteen small years in the heart of feudalism to achieve that phenomenal transformation. And that Magna Carta is so small when measured with our own values that we are amazed by the infinitely small in history. Robin Hood, who is not yet Robin Hood, since the film ends when Robin Longstride is outlawed by John Lackland, is thus only one small man among these men, and women, who made history then, or started to make history, though it seems fairer to say that they were those who finally brought England in the wake of the slowly moving boat of history. This action film only becomes that historical film I am speaking of if you know all these details of English history. Otherwise it will remain an action film. Ridley Scott just did a good film in both directions.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDhistory.

0385736002|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have read all of the Harry Potter books about a dozen times each(no exxageration) and liked them all, and I have found this series to be better for many reasons,some of which I will now list.                     - All of the characters(excluding Josh and Sophie) are real.                     - I found the writing style to be less childish.                     - It introduces you to many of the world's lesser known myths.                     - The plot too is much less childish, (instead of dealing with just one overblown freak baddie,you deal with many,and the baddies in this are much more sinister.)                     - They only go to real places, so you can go to google earth and follow their very footsteps.      For all the above reasons, and many more, I would recommend this series over Harry Potter.(And I am speaking as a 14 year old, name Coco Jumpylumps.)

0385484518|5.0|I read this true story after I had seen the TV movie that was based on it, and I thought the movie was as good as the book. The story reminded me of the most exceptional mentor in my life, my art professor, who encouraged and inspired me to love and create art with passion and live life to the fullest. Morrie's wisdom also inspires both the reader and his former student, Mitch Albom, about what is most important in life and how you should live each day with passion and as if it was the last day of your life. I loved this book and truly believed what Morrie was trying to teach Mitch, that our health and the relationships we have with each other as we go through the ups and downs of life, really are more important than any material thing we may own. This very touching story should be read by everyone!<br /><br />(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

0767020308|3.0|I am one of those who thinks that this (Kate Beckinsale's) version of Emma is the best one to date.  I finally broke down and purchased the DVD (already had it on VHS), only to be disappointed.  For some reason, this was released as a full screen, old \\"pan & scan\\" version.  It was reshown on PBS not long ago and it clearly was originally made in some ratio of widescreen.  Don't know why A&E did this, except that in 1997 most TVs where not yet widescreen.  Also the print does look rather dark in some places; but more than that, because of the \\"pan & scan\\" cutting, one misses so much of the lovely scenery.  Have no idea if this will ever get a more proper release, so I'm glad I have it nevertheless.  Do hope it will get a better release someday.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|She takes away from the experience, Attenborough is a perfect man for the job...why they hired Operah for America I will never know.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|There is a lot of good and bad in this film. This seems to be the new standard for hollywood these days. Lots of flash and glitter,<br />but not much else.<br /><br />The special effects are outstanding. An easy 5 stars for the eye candy.<br /><br />There are some excellent actors in the film and they mostly do a good job, but less than you would expect from them. Not entirely<br />their fault. Even the best actors need something to work with, and they didn`t have much. Considering that, they did a pretty good<br />job with what little they had to work with. 4 stars for the acting.<br /><br />Trying to mix sci-fi and fantasy together generally doesn`t work that well. And this film is no exception. The film is much more<br />fantasy than science fiction, but the jumping back and forth between the two causes some major disconnects while watching the film.<br />3 stars for that, and that may be a little generous.<br /><br />The story line is old and tired. At least 400 years old, probably much more than that. You would think that if they were going to<br />spend this kind of money on a film that they might want to come up with something halfway original. 2 stars for the story line.<br /><br />While a couple of the plot devices are interesting most of them are standard hollyweird, and defy all common sense.<br /><br />An example of a good one: Having a habitable moon around a gas giant planet. This is very possible assuming that it has a thick<br />enough atmospere to screen all the hard radiation that a giant planet would put out and is massive enough to maintain that atmospere.<br /><br />But as I said, most of the plot devices used are pure nonsense. A couple of examples:<br /><br />Human civilization is depected as being poor, but at the same time sending giant starships out on a regular basis. Any civilization<br />that is even capable of, let alone being able to afford to boost giant starships to 90% light speed would be insanely rich beyond<br />our wildest imagination. This is the kind of energy that would melt the crust of a planet.<br /><br />The mythical unobtanium (no such element exists) should be found in roughly equal amounts on any of the moons around the gas giant<br />as they would have formed from the same elements. Why not just mine it from one, or all of the small moons? Any civilization that<br />can build giant starships would be perfectly at ease working in vacuum and there would be no deep gravity well to have to lift it<br />out of as well as no big blue bogymen shooting arrows at you.<br /><br />How would the ecco-system on this moon have come about? Evolution doesn`t work that way. Evolution is competive. This is goofy as<br />some new age cult.<br /><br />These are just a few of the nutty plot devices, there are many more.<br />At best 1 and 1/2 stars for the plot devices.<br /><br />Another thing that really bugs me about the film is that with the special effects budget they had, why didn`t they try to make the<br />aliens look like something that might really have evolved on another world instead of just sticking tails and clown noses on people<br />and painting them blue?<br />A real alien is not likely to look like us.<br /><br />All in all the film is about what hollyweird is putting out these days.

1849162743|4.0|I've written detailed reviews of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire.\\" Since this final installment in the Millennium Trilogy will have many many reviews I'll lead off with a brief bottom line:<br /><br />If you liked the first two books, this one is a must-read. It provides a worthy conclusion to the series.<br /><br />If this book intrigues you, but you have not read the first two, go back and start with \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\"  As others have mentioned, author Stieg Larsson died too young, at age 50, after writing \\"Hornets' Nest,\\" so these are his only novels, and you must start this series at the beginning.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\" contains within it many of the strengths and weaknesses of the whole series.  Strengths begin with the main characters Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander; twists on your usual mystery or action formulas (or at least creative execution of them); and a strong social justice streak in Larsson's writing.<br /><br />Weaknesses include the a serious lack of editorial discipline throughout the series--and in my perception this became more problematic in the second and third books. Larsson's writing is often long-winded and filled with an excess number of supporting characters, especially in the police force.  All those Swedish names are annoying to keep track of when they refer to a cast of unimportant minor characters.  Larsson could also be overly didactic on the social themes, but that's a main point of his writing, so it's inherent in his style.  I can only image that since Larsson left behind these three completed but unpublished manuscripts, the editors tread lightly on his final words.  But the books could have been improved by a tighter edit.<br /><br />Finally, I do fault this book for keeping Lisbeth Salander confined to a hospital bed for most of the book. She's in communication with Blomkvist, and experiences some interesting danger in the hospital, but I longed to see her unleashed like she was in the first two books.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend the series, so if you are reading this review, you have one to three books of summer reading all teed up for you!s in the first two books.     Overall, I highly recommend the series, so if you are reading this review, you have one to three books of summer reading all teed up for you!
B002JCSWVG|1.0|I was really disappointed with this film. Eastwood definitely drops the ball all the way here. I've seen better made for T.V. movies than this. The quality of the script and cinematography were really sub par.  Worst of all the plot is by the numbers and telegraphs its intention to pull your sympathy and emotions this way or that.  The slow mo crowd reactions shots at the end were music video quality.  Boo.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie just keeps getting better and better with time.  I don't think Kate Hudson has had a role half so good.  The camera positively adores her.  Strong performances from first-rate actors even in small roles.  A good measure of its appeal for me is, of course, nostalgia.  And I probably wouldn't like it as well if I watched it more often.  But every so often it pays great dividends to watch it again.
B0037AGASG|5.0|Bieber is a talented young man, and his music is personal and passionate.  It's perfect for a road trip.  Turn down the windows, crank up the sound, and rock out to JB!

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I am certainly old enough to be a Leonard Cohen fan, but never quite made the grade, only managing to own one album \\"New Skin for the Old Ceremony\\". During my early years of music appreciation I gave most of my time (and part of my hearing) to Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />This is an excellent DVD, it somehow passes through the digital world and into your lounge, probably because of Leonard's ability to demonstrate that he is truly honoured and humble to be on stage.<br /><br />It is not often that a music DVD captures the total attention and heart of my parrot. He just loves it, swaying gently to the music, captivated by the smooth backing band and the husky lyrics from Leonard Cohen.<br /><br />I borrowed the DVD from a good friend, thought it would fill a small gap during a relaxing coffee by the fire one night. Instead it has become a new favourite and will necessitate a purchase for my own collection.<br /><br />Thank you Leonard<br />KEITH LIGHTFOOT

I can honestly say I was expecting the actual disc holders to be a bit better... it's four open boxes with sleeves you slide the blurays into.  I wasn't impressed with that for the money.    Otherwise, very happy with the quality, sound and the series.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Good action movie with awesome special effects. We haven't watched many Blu-ray movies on our HDTV, so I really appreciated how it looked on the screen. This is the kind of movie that critics pick apart, but, in general, I enjoy action movies as long as the plot is (somewhat) believable, and Avatar falls into that category for me.

0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis has done a superb job of combining story telling with information.

B002T9H2ME|4.0|Yes, this is another movie of which we could draw parallels between this and several other movies that we seen and know and love. Yes, we can pretty much guess what is happening. However, this movie does have its own story and plays out in its own way. It is well worth watching.<br /><br />Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) has been working a three-year stint for Luna industries. He is overseeing the mining and collection of clean energy on the far side of the Moon. In two weeks, he will be going home. He is starting to hallucinate. While concentrating on one of his hallucinations is involved in an accident. While recovering he overhears is a conversation between his caretaker robot and the Corporation. He is beginning to think the Corporation has other plans for him.<br /><br />So is Sam Bell still hallucinating? On the other hand, are we just paranoid? On the other hand, does our clean energy company have a dirty little secret?<br /><br />Watch this well paced movie and find out (maybe).<br /><br />Finally, we have a movie that that not have a lot of drum beating in the background ever time the action picks up. You can tell the miniatures are miniatures.  However, it does not distract.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare to others.  The voice over commentary is not that informative. The BD live is no really that alive and the other DVD extras are humdrum.

B001UREJWM|5.0|First of all, the metal world mourns the loss of one of its premier vocalists, Ronnie James Dio, famous for fronting Elf and Rainbow before replacing Ozzy in Black Sabbath for \\"Heaven and Hell\\", one of Sabbath's great underrated albums, alongside the awesome \\"Mob Rules\\", which remains my favorite Dio-era album.<br />  I'm not a big fan of his solo material, but that's just because I'm not into medieval imagery, dungeons and dragons, saving the fair maiden, afraid of the dark rut his work tended to stay in.  That doesn't take away from his powerful vocals or talent, however, and no reflection on the work he did with Dio, just a direction I personally don't care for.  With Dio, it was with Tony Iommi and Sabbath, who renamed themselves Heaven and Hell for \\"The Devil You Know\\", the CD that followed a successful reunion with the Heaven and Hell lineup.<br />  And what a heavy slab it is.  For a front man who was 66 and the others flirting with the 60's, this shows once and for all that metal is no longer strictly a young man's pursuit.  \\"The Devil You Know\\" is worthy of any of Sabbath's classic work, and reminiscent of the \\"lost\\" Dio album \\"Dehumanizer\\".  While most of the tunes are slow plodders, a Sabbath trademark, the vocals are worthy of anybody still in their 20's, and the guitars and bass of Iommi and Geezer Butler are as full and ultra heavy as they've ever been in their careers.  Nobody will ever top Tony Iommi's sound in the metal world, and Butler's bass is deep and throaty, not schizzed out metallic like too many bass players prefer today, making their contributions almost pointless.<br />  Favorite tracks include the opener \\"Atom and Evil\\" and the faster \\"Eating the Cannibals\\", but the whole CD is a fitting high note for one of metal's greatest vocalists, who couldn't have picked a better bunch of fellows to record with one last time.  And the CD cover is a great offensive cover in the tradition of \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\\" and \\"Born Again\\".

B001GKJ2DY|4.0|I was having a low, kinda off day.  I wanted a comedy.  I went to Red Box, looking for \\"It's Complicated\\".  It hadn't been released yet.  Most of the other available movies were for kids, or too bloody, or I'd seen already.   My son attends school in NY.  I knew Mama Mia was on Broadway.  I thought I'd sneak a taste of Mama Mia.  What a delight.  It was so much fun, lifted my spirits, and brought back memories of those \\"good old days\\" and young love to a mature (60 year old)chick.  Delightful, fun, colorful and loved the Abba music.   Just the right package.

B00063EMJ6|3.0|Few artists are more ill-suited to a Greatest Hits than Neil Young. First, several of his albums, including some of the best, are ideally heard whole. Second, singles are rarely his best songs. Third, and perhaps most importantly, he has one of music's biggest canons, much of it excellent; no sampler could ever come close to doing him anything like justice. This is why he has wisely avoided collections on the whole; Decade, the most famous, was a highly unusual, three-record mammoth with many non-singles, rare tracks, and even previously unreleased cuts. Lucky Thirteen, the only other collection, covers his much-maligned Geffen years. Decade remains classic, and Lucky is the only Geffen album most will need, but there has long been a sizeable potential audience for a single disc compilation spanning Young's career, especially as both prior albums precede his numerous and often high quality latter-day albums. Greatest Hits is that collection -- sixteen of Young's most famous songs, mostly from his solo career with and without Crazy Horse but with two CSNY tracks. Needless to say, it is not representative, much less comprehensive. The only people to whom it could appeal are extreme casuals wanting only the songs they hear on the radio, though even here it fails to include some of his better-known and best works such as \\"Powderfinger.\\" Decade remains the best compilation choice not only because it is far more representative and typical but because it has eleven of these sixteen cuts, and Greatest Hits' latter-day inclusions are shamefully scanty. No one should let this be their only Young album, and the curious are still best off with Decade plus Young's two or so best latter-day albums or, better yet, his six or so best albums overall.
0385504225|1.0|I finished the book only to be able say that I actually read the entire thing. Don't waste YOUR time like I did. Page after page of prose not remotely necessary to the plot, inserted apparently just to dazzle the reader with the author's brilliance (channeled through Langdon).
B000026GVA|3.0|I actually went in expecting a really good, quality Alice Cooper album.  Instead it's probably the most generic and dated album the man ever created.    The most immediate problem with Hey Stoopid is that it's completely stuck in the mid 80's despite being an early 90's album.  Everything about the loud power pop hair metal movement, to the generic guitar solos, to the way the album was produced sounds completely stuck in the mid 80's.  Why Alice would choose not to fit in with the times and produce an album to reflect the then-current early 90's music scene is something we'll never know.     Of course that can be easily overlooked if the songwriting is actually any good.  Is it?  Well in some spots it's alright.  These spots would be the Bon Jovi and Poison ripoffs such as the title song, \\"Love's a Loaded Gun\\", \\"Dangerous Tonight\\" and well... pretty much the entire album sounds like either Bon Jovi or Poison when you listen to it (and you don't have to listen hard to make this connection either).  This makes me wonder what Alice Cooper was thinking back in 1991.    Seriously, the lyrics are the only decent thing about this album, and that's because Alice's shock rock style of lyric writing is always pretty entertainting even when everything else fails.  By this point in time Alice Cooper completely lost his songwriting magic because the majority of Hey Stoopid is just watered down, second-rate hair metal.  No more originality here folks.    Despite all these problem, \\"Might as Well Be on Mars\\" and the closing track are pretty decent.  Nothing original about them or anything, but melodic enough to catch my attention.    I highly recommend you avoid this album completely and listen to one of his more distictive and fascinating 70's albums where his theatrical shock rock gimmick was better utilized.  Back then he had some really impressive songwriting to separate himself from *everybody* else out there.  Hey Stoopd however, shows a musician who can't even get away from the 80's, let alone create something original.  What a bummer.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I purchased the Kindle version of the ESV Study Bible at $9.99. I recently saw the hardcopy version of this Bible on my office mate's desk. Holy mackerel! I realized then that the incredible price I got this for was a steal.    NAVIGATION:   I find the navigation of the Kindle ESV Study Bible superior to my experience with the Kindle NIV. When I want to find Jeremiah 3:5 in the ESV Study Bible, for example, I just search on \\"jeremiah 3.\\" The Kindle version of the ESV Study Bible has its chapters titled with capital letters followed by the chapter number, such as \\"JEREMIAH 3.\\" In the search results then, I know exactly which location to pop to in order to get to Jeremiah 3. Nice. Saves quite a bit of time over the Kindle NIV bible's navigation, which sort of forces me (as far as I've been able to determine) to use the Table of Contents, and then after quite a bit of scrolling and clicks I finally get to where I want to go.    READABILITY OF THE ESV:  The ESV is more of a literal translation, which I find more difficult to grasp at times. I use my Kindle NIV quite a bit in tandem with my Kindle ESV. I read the passage in the ESV Study Bible first, to take advantage of the Study Bible part, then, when I run across a verse that stumps me, or that I want to make sure I understand, I pop over to the NIV. I then will footnote the NIV version of the word, phrase, or verse into the ESV Study Bible for my future reference. I do not find this a waste of time or annoying in the least as it allows me to keep God's word in my mind for a few moments longer than just reading the passage. It makes me slow down and think about what I'm reading. Works great for me.    Though the readability of the ESV at times is a bit rough for me, I cannot take a star away from this Bible's rating as it is what it is meant to be--a more literal translation of the Bible.    The navigation and price make it an outstanding find! I highly recommend it.
014241543X|3.0|I've been wanting to read this book since it first came out, but was good and waited until it came out in the cheaper paperback.<br /><br />If I Stay is about 17 yr old Mia, a talented celloist, who is in a coma following a car accident that kills her entire family. While in this coma she must make the ultimate decision: stay alive with grief and an uncertain future or join her parents and brother in death<br /><br />I have to say this book isn't at all what I expected, and because of that, I may be a little disappointed. It was a surprisingly simple story. There was nothing supernatural about it and all the conflict was an internal struggle. It went back and forth between Mia's stay in the hospital, and her memories which only seemed to complicate her decision.<br /><br />Truthfully, I didn't find it all that entertaining. Good thing it read very quickly, or else I probably wouldn't have finished it. For some reason, it never asorbed me. Perhaps it was the meandering pace. Even the question of Mia's choice couldn't make me feel interested.<br /><br />Mia's memories served the purpose to give some background to Mia and help flesh out the story. I kind of felt that they were repetitive. They didn't show anything that couldn't be guessed atfrom the first chapter. Mia's loves her little brother. Mia loves her \\"hip\\" parents. Mia loves her punk boyfriend. Mia loves music. That's about it.<br /><br />I guessed I just missed out on the genius of it all. I'm hearing that it was \\"beautiful\\" and \\"beautifully written, and while I admit that it had more substance than most YA literature, I still wasn't feeling it. A blurb on the front cover said it \\"will appeal to fans of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight\\", and I don't see that at all. I didn't like Twilight, but these books are nothing alike. On top of it all, I hear Summit bought the movie rights to this book. Did I miss something?
B002JVWRAO|5.0|S4 had been the most depressive season in SPN history. And with the brother split, I really had my doubts about S5. After all, how much more depressing can it get? Turns out, ALOT more.    S5 would've been a so-so season if it hadn't been for once again brilliant performances from Jared and Jensen. With the release of Luci and the on-going divide of Sam and Dean, it seemed like all hope was lost. Rest assured, it is not. By the end of the season, they showed the fans that there is still love going on with the brothers and hopefully, more to come with S6.    But I warn you, for all those that are new to show, S4 and 5 are the seasons that test you. And if you're still watching them, you deserve a gold star.    I would say the only positive thing to come from S5 was Castiel. I love human castiel, I love how he explodes and I love how he went from being wood paste to a character filled with much more emotional range who always keeps us laughing.    As for Bobby, don't look for alot of happiness there either. But is he walking so who knows.    The Sam we know is currently dead again {he did come back but we have no idea as what} and Dean has the family he always wanted with Lisa and Ben. We don't know what's going to happen next year, but I hope it's something good.    Oh and Bobby is walking now.    SPN is by far the best show on tv that is still overlooked and no matter what it's characters have gone through, is still pushing the envelope and still going strong.    lol, hey if you don't want spoilers, don't read reviews for a show that's been on for 5 years.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|From Hiyao Miyazaki(who if you didn't know created the Oscar-winning Spirited Away)is this his latest movie which is an original story, although slightly inspired by The Little Mermaid and some elements of The Frog Prince. This is his eighth film that he's done through Studio Ghibli, which he co-founded, and was fortunate to be released in U.S. theatres through Disney.<br /><br />A 5-year old boy named Sosuke lives right on the ocean with his parents. His father is a fisherman who usually isn't at home, and his mother Lisa works at a senior citizens center. One day, Sosuke catches a strange looking goldfish he calls Ponyo which licks a cut on his finger and heals him. The fish gets away, but is really the daughter of a strange Willy Wonka-dressed man who is some kind of keeper of peace in the seas. Ponyo uses her magic to transform into a human girl, although sometimes she looses her composure which causes her to change into a slightly frog-like creature. She runs into Sosuke who immeadiately recognizes her as the fish he caught, and is taken in temporarily by Lisa during a huge typhoon which floods the entrie area. Lisa leaves to go look in on the old ladies at the center, leaving Sosuke and Ponyo to set out the next morning in a toy boat that Ponyo makes bigger with her magical powers. They then encounter Ponyo's father who takes them to his underwater refuge, where Lisa and all the old ladies from the center have been kept to save them from the flood. There, they encounter Ponyo's mother who is essentiually a cross between a goddess and Glinda the good witch, and lets them know that Ponyo can stay with Sosuke and his mother. The movie ends with the balance of nature being turned back to normal, because somehow Ponyo accidently caused it to happen with her magic.<br /><br />I'd have to say I very much enjoyed this movie. It's Miyazaki's first movie intended for children since My Neighbor Totoro, and it comes off as such. There isn't any dark overtone like some of his last films like Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke, and is done purely for sheer fun. Granted, the plot didn't seem to have too much of a main direction to it, but Miyazaki makes up for it with his stellar visuals. The dub is pretty fair with the usually roster of celebrities that Disney gets for its movies, including Tina Fey as Lisa, Matt Damon as Sosuke's father, and Cate Blanchett as Ponyo's mother. I'd say Liam Neeson was miscast as Ponyo's dad, and it could have done without the Jonas Bros. and Cyus siblings being cast as the main characters, but was still acceptable. I'd recommend this film as a mainstay for someone's family, although traditional anime fans might find it a little hokey. So, definately look it up if you want another Totoro-like pump of the \\"warm fuzzies\\".ike Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke, and is done purely for sheer fun.

B002UNMWAG|1.0|The original Boondock Saints is a classic movie that even with the cult following it has developed, still dosen't get enough credit. As for the second, I just do not have the words. I tried to put myself in the director's shoes but, I have no idea what got into him. The movie is so bad. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting and even worse direction. I had hoped that even if it was bad, it could be that bad movie that I didn't mind liking. You know what I mean? No go. The only cool part of this movie is seeing Willem Dafoe in the ending sequence. I wish this title didn't have to die. It was set up for a continuation but, unless the rights are sold to a better film maker, another cannot happen. I know everyone is entitled to his/her opinion but, for the people who actually liked this movie, I'd ask you to reevaluate every thought you've ever had. Because you are so stupid you make stupid people feel smart. Get it?
0061729078|2.0|The author of Brave New World describes his experiments with mescalin. He should've stuck to fiction.     Fun with Patterns   The highlight is Huxley's discussion about patterns and colors. During one of his trips, he became intensely aware of the pattern of folds and wrinkles in the sheets of his bed. The experience made such an impression that he continued to take particular notice, even after his trip, of the patterns that occur in folded cloth. He also began to notice that some artists (Michelangelo) seem to lavish much more attention than others on these patterns. Did the mescalin help Huxley achieve a perspective Michelangelo attained without chemical aid? Who knows? But try looking at the Pieta after this without thinking about Huxley and his folded-cloth fixation!     Drop the \\"Mr Science\\" act and give us what we came for!   The above paragraph notwithstanding, this book ovarall is too long, and burdened with excessive and extraneous details along the lines of:   I took the pill and lay on the bed, looking at the ceiling, not sure what to expect. After a while, I got up and paced around the room, trying to decide whether I should get something to eat. Etc.  This gives the text an air of clinical respectability, but the scientific facade doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. The word \\"experiment\\" comes up a lot, but what exactly is being tested? Nothing objective is measured. There is never a discussion of what specific data is collected, or how it will be analyzed. At the end, no conclusions are discussed. It is simply too charitable to call any of this \\"scientific\\". I think the \\"science\\" angle was disingenuinous, and intended to lend respectability to a subject publishers and readers may have been uncomfortable with. Huxley probably felt he couldn't admit \\"I just wanted to see what it feels like\\". That's too bad, because it would have been a lot more fun to read if he had embraced the subjective nature of what he was doing, and addressed the questions most ofus probably wonder, like How did this experience make you feel?   Was it \\"cool\\"?   Do you feel like you \\"brushed the face of God\\", or some such trippy thing?   Was it FUN?     Would you let your kids do this?     Denying readers that is just a cheat
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book is a great \\"page turner\\" and I just couldn't stop reading it. Main characters,Blomkveist & Salander create enought intrigue with their characters and great chemistry when partnered up to solve the crime.

This is NOT the last Stieg Larsson book I'll be reading...can't wait for the other 2
B000002MFN|5.0|So... I finally decided to buy all Madonna's albums because \\"Celebration\\" got me good. And I thought I'd start with her most underrated albums - Erotica and Bedtime Stories.<br /><br />The moment I got it on the 20th, I had to listen to it through and through.<br /><br />Most of the time in this CD, she's talking about a bad break-up that she just can't get over.<br /><br />On the other hand, in \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Fever\\" she talks about her love in a positive way.<br /><br />In \\"Bad Girl\\", she's a bad girl (like the name says) and after getting drunk by six, smoking too many cigarettes, and kissing a kind stranger's lips, she's left unhappy and hoping she didn't hurt her real love's feelings.<br /><br />Lastly, in \\"Why's It So Hard?\\", she wonders why it's so hard for everybody to get along. I wonder the same thing, Madonna. :/<br /><br />Anyway, this is a wonderful Madonna album and I can't wait to hear her other albums soon. :) Hope you enjoy this CD as much as I have.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|We bought this video in a batch on sale because my wife loves Hugh Grant, and I think he's a decent actor.  Not only didn't we regret the purchase, we needed a second copy because the first was wearing out from so much usage!    The various story lines are very cleverly woven together.  Each vignette stands alone, yet is connected in a \\"Butterfly Effect\\" way with others, so that we see the protagonists in one story being supporting characters in one or two others.  This one is the friend of that one.  That one works in the other one's office.  That one's child attends the same class as some other child with his own story.  (The \\"first love\\" tale is sweet.)  And so on.  Most of the acting is bang on, too.    The thing is that with so many plots, there's something for everyone and for every mood; if it has to do with Love, you'll find it in Love, Actually.  One caveat, there is a homosexual relationship that was cut, and which you need to watch in the Deleted Scenes.  I wish it had been kept in, because it deals with a dying lover, which no other story line has.  (Though there is a story line with Liam Neeson about finding love again after the death of one's beloved, which is close.  And brilliantly done - he's a great actor in my book.)

B001TOD9VI|5.0|Known more for his visual appeal along with intriguing stories, director/writer/producer Darren Aronofsky shows a different, and perhaps better, side of his mastery in storytelling.<br /><br />I first became aware of Aronofsky after seeing his impressive Requiem for a Dream back in 2000. Engulfed in that film's unique visual telling, I moved on six years later to see The Fountain. Extraordinary in just about every way, especially the special effects and how he integrated them into the plot, I then went out and tried to find everything I could by this unique man. What I found was very little. A few minor productions prior to 2000, Aronofsky is an enigma; he's not out there making a movie every eight months like some directors.<br /><br />So when I heard praise being heaped upon THE WRESTLER, it was with great surprise that I found out Aronofsky was both producer and director. I wasn't surprised because it was him, but because the story just didn't sound like something he'd do. I mean, where's the visual appeal in the story of a washed-up pro wrestler? Time for me to eat some crow...<br /><br />The visual appeal isn't there but doesn't need to be. This is a myopic view that focuses its entire lens on that of one man, and does it so powerfully, with such an amazing story, that fans of such things as Rocky, Raging Bull and Brian's Song would be proud to rank it among their favorite sports-related films of all time; it's in my top five.<br /><br />Much of the excitement has been directed at returning film star Mickey Rourke. Returning, you ask? Where had he been? Strangely appropriate, Rourke had taken a hiatus from acting and returned to one of his earlier loves: boxing. From 1991 to 1995, Rourke had become a professional boxer and won a string of matches. But he also received some crushing facial injuries that required reconstructive surgery. These injuries are still noticeable in The Wrestler, but they also give the filming of Rourke's face a unique appeal since we're talking about that of a spiraling down wrestler who's failing body can't keep up.<br /><br />Wearing hearing aids, reading glasses, and having to work at a supermarket in order to make ends meet, Randy `The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) is discovering what lay ahead for him, a previously successful wrestler with a fan following that's dying off ...kind of like himself.<br /><br />Beside `The Ram' is a stripper who's also on her downward swing. Getting older and nudged aside by younger, prettier strippers, Cassidy (Marissa Tomei, Wild Hogs) spurns The Ram's romantic advances. She still feels like she's got some stripper time left in her, even though the clientele where she works seems to say different. The power with which Tomei pulls her battered, sex-object body around only to learn that she needs something more than a pole to dance around is incredible to watch. But can Cassidy learn that The Ram's love for her is something she needs before it's too late? This is where the crux of the story really pulls the viewer in and holds us to the very, very end.<br /><br />The side story of The Ram's estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood, Across the Universe) also adds a very human quality to the main character, and gives us more of the in-depth character analysis so many films lack. It also reinforced The Ram's loneliness in a world where aging sports figures learn of their early mistakes, and that trying to make amends often results in old habits cropping up and destroying any such possibilities.<br /><br />Finally, I have to mention the gritty film style that Aronofsky chose for The Wrestler. Hand held camera's and grainy looking film stock all added to a years-gone-by feel that was very appropriate. It also saved a ton of cash. In fact, The Wrestler cost only $7 million to make but has, apparently, made over $70 million as of this writing. The shocking fact for me is not that it's made back ten times what it cost to make, but that Aronofsky did it without any significant special effects like he used in The Fountain (cost = $35 million to make), proving that this director has the potential to make just about any film, under any circumstances, with minimal expenditures. Although this information may not be terribly interesting to movie-goers, I find this extremely admirable considering the multi-gazillion dollar films that get greenlit and then flop at the box office.<br /><br />Aronofsky is the man. And he's got a resume to be proud of, too. And The Wrestler should rank high on his list. It should rank high on yours, too. See it for Rourke's performance. Enjoy it because Aronofsky did a fabulous job.= $35 million to make), proving that this director has the potential to make just about any film, under any circumstances, with minimal expenditures.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|My wife and I loved the movie with the exception of one very important detail, there were several scenes in the movie that contained very bad language.  Without going into detail, it is sad that the people that made this movie decided to use bad language to emphasize points in the movie where a simple word of alarm would have sufficed.  I mean, come on!!!!  It seems that this movie was primarily directed to the younger audience, so why is their bad language?  Because of this, we have decided not to purchase this movie.  Why?  Because I can't watch it with our children in the room and it is sad.  This movie had some very interesting ideas in it and it was ruined by a little bad language that was not needed.      Just a warning to those parents out there that want to monitor what their children are watching.

B000003N7K|5.0|What else can be said about this album, it is superb. Coltrane is not sideman, he is second voice as someone else stated. He plays perhaps more understated than on some others, but there is no mistaking it is his horn and some of his best ballad work. Hartman's voice is the perfect match to Coltrane's tenor sax. Even if you are not a jazz fan, you should own this album. Great rythm section great song choices, it just doesn't get any better than this.
B002VECMAE|2.0|\\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" was disappointing because I expected more outright laughs.  The premise of psychics fighting in the military sounded funny and inviting, but delivered a loud \\"thud\\" in interest with the barely followable surrealistic schemes.  Ewan McGregor plays journalist/reporter Bob Wilton who becomes involved and fascinated by a unbelievable story of the military using psychics to fight the enemy in Iraq.  He meets Lynn Cassady (George Clooney) who is going to the Iraq battlefront.  Lynn claims to be a Jedi fighter (warrior monk) and sees something in Bob that connects.  They both leave the safe zone and go out to confront the enemy using psychic powers.  Bob also wants to write a groundbreaking scoop of a story.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges plays the military trainer of the Jedi's - he is a former hippie flower child who works with the Army to develop \\"Jedi-Students\\" innate psychic powers.  There is a fine cast in this movie (Kevin Spacey and Rebecca Mader co-star), but the jokes fail and the slapstick is scattered.<br /><br />Overall the satire of American foreign policy was strained.

0066214122|3.0|I had only read one other Crichton novel, Sphere, which I did not enjoy very much, but I thought I'd give MC another chance. While I enjoyed Prey much more, it was far from thrilling. It was entertaining and chock full of well-researched info, but the snails pace was a downer. Jacks adventures in house hubbying was not why I was reading the book. Also, his ignorance of his wifes behavior was totally unbelievable. It was clear what was going on to the reader, but no matter how burdened Jack was by his domestic demands, he could surely have put two and two together. I overlooked this recurring flaw and pressed on, and was relieved as the plot eventually picked up some steam and ended well. The main thing I got from this book is that I will never read Crichton again. I'll just watch the movies.

From ancient clay I IOU  (\\"I owe you\\") tablets to modern credit default swaps, hedge funds and quantitative trading - the book covers it all. The author is a great at story teller, skillfully combining historic persons and events with economic evolution. He also fixes a few common economic misbelief's, especially the phrase \\"safe as houses\\" gets bombarded as he thoroughly demonstrates that from both a current and historic point of view, purchasing a house is very far from a safe one way bet to richness. In short a delightful and well written \\"armchair overview\\" of financial history. Highly recommended.

0393072231|4.0|The Big Short is very well written. Readers of Michael Lewis's many previous books will not be surprised by this. Every Lewis book I have read is well written and interesting. I particularly recommend [[ASIN:0393324818 Moneyball]]. He is the best non-fiction narrative author writing now.    A lot has been written about the 2008 financial crisis and even more said. Most of that focuses on blaming the banks and government for the problem. Much less time has been spent explaining the events. The Big Short seeks to explain the event by describing some peculiar people who saw the problems and were able to profit from them.    Lewis was able to find people who not only anticipated the crash, but figured out how to make money from it. They are all interesting characters. They would have to be some sort of misfit to bet against the biggest and most powerful financial institutions and to go against the conventional wisdom.    The Big Short makes clear that the whole securitized mortgage business was an unregulated free for all. The instruments being traded were entirely the creation of the banks selling them. All of the information about them was in the hands of the banks or whoever created the instrument. This is a recipe for disaster.    Lewis's attempts to explain the financial crises through his characters does not entirely work. The pace slows in the middle and the end is not quite satisfying. Despite these flaws The Big Short is the best written most entertaining book on financial crisis I have read.

A chime and number are played whenever a file is referred to.<br /><br />I ripped all 14 discs to MP3 and then burned that onto two CD-Rs, and used that in my car for the drive.  Worked great.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Dawkins' work, you will certainly enjoy this book.  He barely covers religion at all, and instead focuses on the evidence for evolution.  He talks about how carbon dating works, and is verified against a half-dozen other methods.  He talks about fossils, natural selection, gene mutation, and more -- and since multiple chapters are dedicated to each concept you really get a good understanding of how all this stuff works.
B00275EGWY|2.0|This movie is a series of vignettes without much of a plot.  The main character is opaque, which is fine, but not for a movie which is character driven.  Also, I found some of the action cliched.  My husband and I were left thinking \\"this is what all the fuss was about??\\"  Honestly, there were times when I was a little bored.
030745455X|5.0|If Larsson had not passed away, he would now be on my list of favorite writers. After these first two books in his thriller trilogy, I have become really fond of the 95 pound, 4ft 11, weird genius,super hacker girl with the unbeatable spirit, and am really glad there is a third book. Like the first book this one has long slow sections with excruciating detail that you are tempted to think the editor left in only out of respect for the dead  BUT the exciting parts made it worth while for me. Actually, the fact that everytime my eyes began glazing over they were suddenly forced wide open, probably enhanced the effect of these interspersed exciting passages. The big thing here for me, however, was the further character development of the spunky little heroine, who now is shown to also have a heart - maybe. This is the book in which \\"All the Evil\\" is finally exlained. We almost lost our little heroine near the end, and it is still touch and go on the last page. On the book 3.<br /><br />I almost forgot, our heroine also solved Fermi's famous math problem in her head on the way to confront her father and brother in a fight to the death - but we were not told her solution - on to Book 3!

0553584537|5.0|Wow!  Lisa Gardner is one fantastic suspense writer.  I would recommend her novels to everyone.  We are led down a winding path of mystery, murder and mayhem, but never knowing for sure who is behind the diabolical events.<br /><br />Great work, as usual.<br /><br />Irene
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|Porcupine Tree has drastically changed their style since \\"Lightbulb Sun\\".  Heavier guitar, more melody in the vocals, songs that sound like there was a lot of effort put into them.  If you thought the last three albums were great as I do (\\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\", \\"Deadwing\\", and \\"In Absentia\\"), this will be a disappointment.  This is a two disc set -the first disc with a series of tracks, some long some short, named \\"The Incident\\".  The second disc is comprised of four not-so-special songs.  I think the first disc, \\"The Incident\\", is annoying because of its short tracks designed to make up one big performance.  I think of this album as a series of incomplete thoughts.  Steven Wilson had a few good ideas, but it seems as he never followed them through.  I like the songs that sound like full songs (too bad there's only three or four of them); the songs on the second disc aren't worth talking about.<br /><br />If you're new to Porcupine Tree, get an album like \\"Deadwing\\", \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\", or \\"In Absentia\\" -those are their best.  Maybe the next album will be better.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is a classic album as good or better than any Dylan.  It is a shame Rodriguez was not recognized in his own country (USA).  Fortunately he was a mega-star in South Africa and Australia (unbeknownst to him - buy the CD and you'll read the story!) so his music prevailed!
0525950079|3.0|As an author myself (The Q-ube), its always fascinating to read a great novel like World Without End.  The first book Of Follet, The Pillars of the Earth has been one of my all-time favorite book, and i was curious to see if the sequel was just as entertaining. My concern was totally unnecessary. As in the first book everything is in there, love greed, politics, and ambition, the book stands alone, there is no need to read the first novel!

1401219268|1.0|The premise is interesting: If superheroes were real, what kind of personalities would they have? That is, what kind of neuroses/psychoses/emotional instabilities would trouble them? Unfortunately that premise is not enough to hold the reader's attention over 12 very dense issues. A big problem I had with Watchmen was the making up of excuses the characters deployed to justify their behavior. They are so self-absorbed and obsessed with their troubled pasts that they can't move on. I understand some people are like this, but no effort is made on behalf of the characters by the writer to stop wallowing in self-pity and better themselves.<br /><br />Another problem I had was the lack of a plot. Something is wrong when you spend more time developing the back story than the present-day plot. No sooner is a character revealed or introduced than we are treated to a gratuitous personal history. Some characters flash back to the SAME EVENT so we can see it from multiple points of view--this would be fine if the event were something worth flashing back to, but it's not.<br /><br />The entire plot turns on the hysteria of an approaching nuclear war between the USA and USSR. This key development isn't really charted through the novel, only catalyzed by a single development early on and built up by blaring newspaper headlines, screaming television newscasters, and fatalistic grumblings of main characters and strangers alike...but no real development.<br /><br />Finally, there's too much garbage in the middle of the novel. About two full issues' worth are wasted on a newspaper vendor talking to himself about the impending war and some black kid reading a comic about a pirate. These pages are meant to be \\"literary\\" and \\"insightful,\\" but they are completely irrelevant and a waste of time, as are the literary excerpts of various essays and novels by and about the main characters. Later the disappeared author of the comic is mentioned as being involved in the final plot twist. It's a completely meaningless connection because it has no bearing whatsoever on the final outcome.<br /><br />Then when it FINALLY starts getting good and the characters face each other in a showdown...IT ENDS. That's it. You are left completely unfulfilled. All the pseudointellectual, existential musings amount to nothing...that is, nothing more sophisticated than what you heard said between two college kids after an Intro to Philosophy course.completely meaningless connection because it has no bearing whatsoever on the final outcome.<br /><br />Then when it FINALLY starts getting good and the characters face each other in a showdown...IT ENDS.

0060765488|5.0|My mother first read this book to me when I was about six years old, and since then I must have read it at least a dozen times.  The story of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy's journey through a seemingly uninteresting wardrobe into a magical land is appealing to any child (or adult) who enjoys the possibilities of make-believe.
B001TOD92C|4.0|In the film, a wrestler, Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson has been in the wrestling world for twenty years. Being in the twilight of his career, Randy's health is deteriorating as his substance abuse and reckless lifestyle has caught up to him. He drinks regularly, abuses steroids, and habits a particular strip club to meet up with a stripper named Cassidy. After he suffers a heart attack, and is subsequently warned by his doctor to quit wrestling, Randy has some soul searching to do. He reevaluates his life, and tries to correct several aspects: he wants to take his relationship with Cassidy a bit more serious and hopes to marry; he tries to reconnect with his daughter, who barely knows who he is; he tries to keep his spirits up despite the many struggles he encounters.     Once Randy's world--wrestling--is taken from him, he struggles. He takes a job in a meat deli to try to pay the bills but this is a tough transition. He meets and tries to reconcile with his daughter, but there is time that he can't get back, and the awkwardness of lost time makes it hard to work things out. He can't work things out with Cassidy because she can't get serious about their relationship. Doing what most would want to do in this situation, Randy makes an attempt to return to the thing he loves most. Knowing that it has been twenty years since his match with his rival, Ayatollah- he realizes that this must a perfect time to make a quick return to the ring. However, how will things turn out now being that he has some health concerns?     What I love about this film is the reality and humanness it portrays. Steering from prototypes, The Wrestler shows the raw, ugly side of human failings, but also the redemption that people try to gain when they see the errors of their ways. Like many films, The Wrestler could have portrayed its characters in \\"cut and dry\\" ways; instead, they depict Randy as a character with many flaws, yet with an awareness of these flaws. There is a \\"disgusting\\" side to him,yet there is a human side. He tries to become a better person. As the film progresses, he realizes that time may be working against him. Let's just say that the ending is definitely open-ended: you can judge what happens to Randy on your own. Was it an ultimate euphoric moment, or a tragic ending?     The Wrestler also is unique in that it is an introspective look into the world of \\"staged\\" wrestling. There is a camaraderie and bonding that the wrestlers almost seem to have when preparing for a match.     On a personal note, The Wrestler evoked nostalgic memories of big hair metal bands and wrestling before it became some huge conglomerate. I didn't feel guilty for listening and enjoying Cinderella, Poison or Ratt. I haven't heard \\"Round and Round\\" so many times since high school or MTVs Video Fights.     The Wrestler got some attention at the Academy Awards, and, I think, with good reason. Mickey Rourke does a fantastic job with his role, even though some may accuse him of \\"just being himself.\\" The Wrestler is one of those sleeper kind of films that got steam and made a run against some of the big films of last year.     This is a solid film, and very spirited, even amid the real rawness depicted in the main characters' lives.
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|In 2004, a little-known band called Keane from East Sussex released an album that included some of the most melodic and powerful songs of the past decade.  Since the release of `Hopes & Fears,' the band has had two other album releases, both of which reached the top of the charts in the UK.  Sadly, however, many fans have been disappointed by their last two releases because they've been straying from the powerful alternative rock they started with back in 2004 and have moved to, what some call, an \\"80s pop\\"-style sound.<br /><br />In 2010, the band teamed up with funk emcee Tigarah and Somali rapper K'NAAN (who has also skyrocketed to fame after his song `Wavin' Flag' was chosen as the theme for the 2010 FIFA World Cup) for the new release of the EP entitled `Night Train.'  To give a fair assessment, I will break the album down by song before giving a full view of it.<br /><br />1) `House Lights' - The opening track is an instrumental intro with some mild beats over haunted house-sounding tweaks.  It will sound familiar to those who have seen them live, but it's merely an intro track.<br /><br />2) `Back in Time' - As the first full track of the album, `Back in Time' is a solid opening.  It has some reasonable synthesized music, but it's Chaplin's vocals that make it better than average.<br /><br />3) `Stop for a Minute' (feat. K'NAAN) - It's hard for me to be a truly unbiased listener on this song (along with the upcoming `Looking Back') because K'NAAN is one of my favourite artists working right now.  However, I will admit that some fans may not be a fan of the hip hop twist, but the song is truly great.  The beat & music are fantastic, and the vocals are a perfect match.  While Chaplin & K'NAAN are far from similar, their voices do have a nice balance that works for the song.<br /><br />4) `Clear Skies' - This is a happy little track with some reasonable vocals, but overly repetitive and unimaginative music to back them up.  Ultimately forgettable, but not completely without merit, I suppose.<br /><br />5) `Ishin Denshin (You've Got To Help Yourself)' (feat. Tigarah) - This is probably my least favourite song on the album, mainly because it, well, is just a pretty bad song.  It sounds like it should be on a really annoying `80s TV commercial.  The music & the lyrics are both very repetitive and unimpressive.  The accompanying vocals from Tigarah are in Japanese and, to be honest, kind of sound like a creepy doll should be singing them.  Probably one of my least favourite songs from the band to date.<br /><br />6) `Your Love' - I'm kind of in the middle about this track.  The music has that annoying 80s sound, as if Foreigner or Air Supply should be performing them.  The lyrics & vocals save it from being totally bad, but it's still rather unimpressive.<br /><br />7) `Looking Back' (feat. K'NAAN) - Making a couple of references to `Rocky' including a laced-in track with `Eye of the Tiger,' not even K'NAAN could save this song.  It's cheesy and forgettable and will only continue the fans' disappoint<br /><br />8) `My Shadow' - Of all the songs on the album, this will probably be the one desired by most fans, even though `Stop for a Minute' may actually be a better song.  Regardless, it's got some fantastic vocals and a solid track behind them.  Not the best Keane has to ofer, but a fine way to end the album.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />Overall, the album is far more disappointing than it is impressive.  It has a couple of solid tracks in `My Shadow' and `Stop for a Minute,' but the album is not very good overall.  If you're looking to download a couple of MP3s, check out these two, and maybe `Back in Time.'  The rest are simply uninspired and unimpressive.<br /><br />Final Verdict: 4/10.<br /><br />-AP3-tely without merit, I suppose.<br /><br />5) `Ishin Denshin (You've Got To Help Yourself)' (feat.

0385341008|5.0|This story unwinds as a series of letters. I read the first three or four and had no reference to the names being discussed; therefore, I almost quit reading, but that's not my nature so I continued. Shortly, after a couple of chapters, the characters became clearer. Through the letters we get to know Juliet, an author with a little writers' block, the year after the end of World War II. A chance letter from a Guernsey Island fan leads to Juliet becoming enamored with the people of the island of Guernsey and their stories about the German occupation of the island during World War II.<br /><br />The islanders' stories are simple day-to-day survival stories. I found myself beginning to love these people, just as Juliet did. The letters and stories of the hardships these people endured during the war were powerful in their simplicity and insight. As a result of the letters, Juliet eventually visits Guernsey and finds a whole new life.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this book. Oh, for a summer in Guernsey!
B001XRLWPQ|1.0|We tried twice to watch this show.  The first time we got through 2 episodes and just couldn't take it anymore.  After several months and reading the rave reviews, we tried again.  We got through 4 shows this time.  We found the daughter is by far the most interesting character.  The mother has some merits.  The rest is simply bad acting and bad writing.  For example in the 4th or 5th episode the bad guy comes into the room blazing.  Our fine detective is on the phone to her office.  What do you hear in the background as the heros are ducking and diving...\\"call 911.\\"<br /><br />We gave up after the lame poker sub-plot.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|This collection is worth every penny that I spent on it.  The packaging is great, I loved the little summary at the beginning of every episode, and the index that came with it was very helpful.
B000002MG1|5.0|I'll admit that I was obsessed with this album in high school and so it's very positively nostalgic (thanks for hipping me to it, Ethan), but it still holds up.  The whole album has a definitive feel - very mellow, with the occasional sprinkle of harder-edged politicism (\\"Ignoreland\\"), and has always reminded me of an alternating mix of a hot summer night and a freezing winter night in front of a roaring fireplace in the woods.<br /><br />It was around this time when I realized that once they got onto a major label, R.E.M. has released a great album every other album.  \\"Green\\" - amazing.  \\"Out of Time\\" - bleah.  \\"Automatic\\" - my favorite.  \\"Monster\\" - ick.  \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\" - awesome.  \\"Up\\" - worthless.  It's kinda weird, actually.
0743550927|1.0|If I could give this book a minus-5 star rating, I would. I absolutely HATED it!! and I didn't even get past the 6th disk... with 6 more to go, no less!! After listening to hour after hour of pain, poverty, hunger, filth, and misery, to say \\"I'm enjoying the experience\\" would be a lie. In my opinion, some books just should not be written, like Stephen King's _Misery_, for example, or Nevada Barr's _Hard Truth, and I think this is one of those. Based on this book alone, I'll never read or listen to another Frank McCourt book as long as I live.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|Sade's performance is beautiful, but the music and lyrics on this CD are soooooooooooooo sad.  It tugs at all the hidden places where nearly forgotten sadness is tucked away.

1401323820|4.0|I enjoy the TV show and the book is well written. My only wish is they would just come out and tell me who wrote the book. It is a classic case for the chicken and the egg problem.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|This is a fun movie . . . my son and I were enthralled throughout.  Love getting the two-disc edition . . . lets us watch anywhere in the house.  Really looking forward to Iron Man 2.    Amazon, as usual, shipped quick and sent exactly what we expected!
B00005JPSM|4.0|\\"No Reservations\\"; was a cute film, but it is a slow starting movie. It has some good acting but I think it might have been that somebody could not agree on what part of the story to focus on. If you watch for just entertainment and paid only five dollars for it, I say go for it. It has moments that are very good towards the end.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Absolutely outstanding movie . . .  it does so well mixing the animation with the real life, you lose the delineation between the two.  I heard so much hype around this movie that I was a little sceptical, but it's now one of my favorites.    NOTE:  My home theater is 106\\" of HD, with great surround sound.  I'm sure this has a little to do with how amazing my children and I found the experience.  ;)    Amazon, as usual, shipped it quick and it was exactly as expected.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|\\"Avatar\\"; was not the movie for me; however I bought it for my husband and he loved it. He thought it had a great message. I feel asleep during it, I hate Sci-fi. This is a long film and if you are younger and like seeing blue people you'll love it. I understand that there are big fans of Avatar and my husband is one, he think everyone should watch it.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|For the serious classical music listener who wants to hear excellent contemporary music, it is both beautiful and haunting.... I highly recommend it!
B00003CY6M|5.0|\\"Serendipity\\"; was a very good film with very little left out. The acting was very well done and the story-line is John Cusacks best type. (In my opinion he is good in anything.)  Ms Beckinsale and Mr Cusack play of each other well. I love the supporting cast too. This is a feel good film that teaches waiting for the right person is a good thing.
B001PO53IO|5.0|The prequel universe always had its own appeal and potential, if overshadowed by the film implementations themselves. If having any flaws, The Clone Wars lacks in the cerebral and favors action, which is actually quite a positive change over the precursor works. It is also a positive change to see the Jedi Knights and Masters of this period developed more fully and placed into more action scenarios, again a great contrast to their drier applications of the past.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Great Quality Picture and Sound<br />2) Decent Special Features<br />3) Fresh and Fun Style<br />4) Good development of weapons, ships, and concepts of the period<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Dialogue often bland<br />2) Reaches for the \\"Reset Button\\" too often<br />3) The global plot and plots of given episodes do not seem to have coherency. The Republic seems to have controlling victories almost every time in the episodes themselves, but is said to be losing ground overall. This becomes strange and almost disorienting after a dozen or so episodes.<br />4)Enemies often come off to more weak and incompetent than probably intended.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. We can all sit down and watch it and the kids are glued to the screen from the first minute until they roll the credits. A wonderful addition to our collection.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|It was an awesome experience watching this in 3D at the movies so I bought the bluray/DVD version and I am still amazed. I watched it three times and counting.  Cannot wait for the next movie. Definitely another franchise to happen.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This isn't your run of the mill hip-hop album. It's packed with meaningful and knowledgeable lyrics, mostly about Africa. It's a very uplifting album, just what hip-hop needs in 2010.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Apalloosa, is a top class western, with a great cast.starring Ed Harris, Viggo Mortenson,  and Jeremy Irons, they   were tough, god fearing lawman, not Jeremy Irons, he was a murdering cad, and Renee Zellweger, playing a single women in the old west, who plays the piano and comforts whoever is available to get along. The movie has everything, a bit of High Noon, Last Train From Gun Hill and some Indians, thrown in.    I received the dvd in quick time, thankyou Amazon.- Arthur C
B003M8LL6E|5.0|I've watched this episode four times already!!!  Great writing and creativity.  The entire episode pays homage to the loving and loyal relationship between Sam and Dean.

0195067142|5.0|How do you explain the unexplainable?  In \\"With The Old Breed\\"  Eugene Sledge goes well beyond any expectation a reader might have about not just the experience of combat but its effects on the men who were duty bound to participate.  Having known several WW II combat veterans, I now understand the origin of the common quality they all possessed; one I never could identify but that markedly set them apart: uncommon courage.  Each horrific experience Mr. Sledge recalls caused me to ask myself, \\"How did he do that?\\" and to say, sometimes aloud, \\"I couldn't have done that.\\"  Ultimately I regretted that Mr. Sledge and his comrades-in-arms faced such horrors; it was senseless, but I am ever so thankful to him and all the others who were willing to do it.  The other regret the book caused me was that I had not ever taken the time to thank the men I knew who had faced these dangers and made these sacrifices.  I wish I had because without their courage my life could not have been.  You will feel the same.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|1.  Since the blue people weren't using the Unobtainium for anything, why didn't the humans just ask for it?    2.  Where did the blue people get the giant guns fit to scale in the last scene (when the earthlings left the planet) that were the same size as them? They were using earthman sized guns in the war.    3.  Wasn't it weird to see Sigourney Weaver in a movie with those same Robocop/robot things she used in Alien?    I could go on and on.
0891419063|5.0|I read this book about six moths prior to the HBO series \\"The Pacific\\" that is partially based on this book. While \\"The Pacific\\" was very good in my opinion, it does not do justice to WTOB by Sledge.<br /> This has things about what Sledge and his fellow Marines went through on Peleliu and Okinawa that will make anyone shudder at the horror that war really is.<br />This book WILL absolutely send shivers down your spine...
B0039SFKSW|5.0|I think this album is so great. The songwriting is tight, Steve Howe is in fine form as always, and Wetton's vocals have aged remarkably well.    \\"I Believe\\" and \\"Finger on the Trigger\\" are up there with the best Asia hits from back in the day. There is no doubt that this album is a little softer that their previous work, but the tunes are better, and that more than makes up for it.    Perhaps John Payne logged in on here and is submitting these negative reviews. Other than that, I can't see why anyone could not get something from listening to this album. It's one of the band's best.
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|Kempff's renditions are in stride with Beethoven's marvelous fusion of emotion and intellect. Even deviations from other great interpreters' tempi in a few places emerge as rational and right upon reflection. A fantastic bargain.
B00371QQ2U|4.0|Content / Quality of Movie: ***** (wish it went higher)<br />Presentation: *** (see below)<br /><br />If you are reading this you likely have already seen Apollo 13, perhaps many times, and are looking for information on the Blu-Ray release (and may be tired of wading through reviews of the DVD version - Amazon really should separate DVD and Blu-Ray reviews but that is another rant for another day). See next paragraph for the technical details but I must first sing the praises of this wonderful film. This has always been one of my favorites. Ron Howard's direction is near-perfect and the cast is terrific. The movie does a wonderful job of almost moving the viewer back in time to when the events of that ill-fated mission occurred. As one of the characters notes this really was NASA's finest hour and this movie puts you squarely in the middle of it - both in that fragile ship out in space and on the ground in mission control. This is one of those films that after watching it you expect to turn on the TV and see updates about the ongoing mission - it is that immersive. My favorite extra feature is the commentary track by the director. I don't often watch a whole movie through with commentary track on but this one is well worth it, offering insights into Howard's direction style which meshed perfectly with the subject matter of this film. Almost all the actors in the movie got to know the people they were portraying and Howard was open to changes in dialogue to add authenticity to the production. This I think allowed the actors to really immerse themselves in their roles and that additional measure of commitment shows through in every scene. Can you imagine Hitchcock (also one of my favorites) directing this film? His style would not have been nearly as effective as Ron's, though there might well have been more intrigue and perhaps one or two of the mission control people would have gone missing. Come to think of it, I wouldn't mind seeing that version at all, either. Anyway, digital special effects are also very well done but were not allowed to detract from the story. I am amazed that it was possible to find so many varied angles to allow the cramped command and lunar modules to at once be confining but not claustrophobic - a really wonderful bit of cinematography. All in all, in my opinion one of the best films made in the last 50 years - heck, one of the best ever.<br /><br />Now about the presentation. Picture and sound quality to me were fantastic (though I have never seen the HD-DVD version which another reviewer feels was better.) Extra features include the above-mentioned director's narration which is terrific. The movie played well (eventually) on my Sony player - and there's the rub as they say. I was amazed at how long the load process was, at least a couple minutes then the question of what language to select, a couple more minutes then the question of whether or not I want to post comments on it to my Facebook site or some such - NO I JUST WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE ALREADY!! When the menu screen finally arrives over on the right is an animated ad for a current release - so that is obviously what was taking so long to load. I shudder to think how long it would have taken over a DSL or (gulp) a dial-up connection. I do hope they remedy this with a future release without so much wait time but in the end it was a \\"small price to pay\\" to watch this great film.al special effects are also very well done but were not allowed to detract from the story. I am amazed that it was possible to find so many varied angles to allow the cramped command and lunar modules to at once be confining but not claustrophobic - a really wonderful bit of cinematography. All in all, in my opinion one of the best films made in the last 50 years - heck, one of the best ever.    Now about the presentation.

B002VPE1B6|4.0|I hadn't gotten a chance to see Avatar in theaters, so I was excited to see it on Bluray. The visuals for this movie were AMAZING. One of the best looking movies I've seen. The story was pretty good, but nothing that blows your mind. The \\"political\\" undertones are pretty obvious, even for those not already aware of them, and it may seem sort of \\"preachy\\" to some viewers, but it doesn't beat you over the head and make you feel guilty. The visuals are what make this such a great film. Make sure you're buying it on Bluray and watching it in 1080p, otherwise you're missing out!     Be aware that this disc has NO special features (I think they've done a good job making sure people are aware of that) because they used all the space on the disc to give the best picture and sound possible. There is no 3D version of this film currently available, but it should be released sometime in 2011 (that's what they're saying now, anyway). If you're wanting to watch this in 3D, you may want to hold off!
B000MXPE7O|2.0|What do you get when you combine some of Hollywood's best talent?  In the case of The Good Shepherd, you get a really boring film with a multitude of problems.  With multiple confusing flashbacks, a myriad of characters whom we never get to know in any depth, and more than 2 and 1/2 hours of watching Matt Damon look really, really serious to the accompaniment of really, really dreary background music, you end up with a perfect cure for insomnia.  Not once did I care about any of the characters, which is critical to the success of this film.  They all seemed to be moving underwater, which is a good analogy to describe the pace of the film.  Intellectually, I got the point of what the characters did, why they did it, and the gut-wrenching nature of their actions, but it never hit me in the gut.  Had HBO done this as a 10 to 12 hours mini-series, I believe it would have worked wonderfully because they could have fleshed out the characters.
0061649708|4.0|Coraline, as a film, has much in common with typical Tim Burton films, from the gothic look and feel right down to the stop-motion animation.  The only thing that's missing is Johnny Depp. And yet this is not a Burton film, adding something fresh to the genre: a girl-power journey into darkness and the unknown.<br /><br />Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning), frequently confused with Caroline, is an 11-year-old girl on the cusp of becoming a teenager.  She has her foot in both worlds: the imaginary dreamland that young children inhabit and the sarcastic exasperation of a preteen who believes her parents are embarrassing and stupid.<br /><br />The film takes these two elements and transposes them, blurring the two together in the same way an preadolescent must - choosing what parts of her childhood she wants to keep and sacrificing the less important parts for the sake of increasingly adult responsibilities. To Coraline her mother Mel (Teri Hatcher) is just a rude shrew, not a woman who is juggling the financial future of the family (Mel's the editor of her husband's future catalog on gardening) with the pain of a recent car accident.  Charlie's (John Hodgman), Coraline's father, is a lovable goofus, completely uncool and with eyes only for his computer screen.  Worst of all, Coraline's new home is musty, old, and therefore boring.<br /><br />But there are wonders to behold, for those brave enough to explore them.  The neighbors are all lovable eccentrics, from the former burlesque actresses Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Forcible (Dawn French) who stuff their dead dogs to the possibly insane former gymnast Mr. Bobinsky who trains mice to the local boy Caroline's age named Wybie (Robert Bailey, Jr.) who is part steampunk inventor, part garrulous nit.  And of course there's the cat (Keith David) who seems to know more than he lets on.<br /><br />There's a secret, you see, in the house.  A terrible secret that would give most children nightmares.  Stealing children's hearts and minds is The Beldam, a doppelganger who slowly breaches the waking world from the dreamlands by crafting a perfect universe for tweens...that just happens to involve stuffed simulacrums of everyone you hold dear.  It's up to Coraline to make a choice: live in the fairytale world of childhood or face up to her adult responsibilities, the same responsibilities her parents face every day.<br /><br />This charming little film has a lot in common with H.P. Lovecraft's The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath.  In both stories there is a dreamland inhabited by a deceptive being (The Beldam/Nyarlathotep) and in both stories cats are privy to ancient knowledge and more capable than \\"normal\\" cats.  Whereas Randolph Carter glimpses a city and becomes obsessed with returning to it, Caroline glimpses a happier life that meets all of her superficial needs.  Both protagonists are at first drawn into the web of deception and then, with the help of their cat allies, reject it.  In the end, both characters discover that there's really no place like home.<br /><br />Cthulhu Mythos fans, kids at heart, and kids who are about to become adults will all enjoy it.  Not for the little ones, the faint of heart (or eyes) or those who believe that a door's just a door.ppelganger who slowly breaches the waking world from the dreamlands by crafting a perfect universe for tweens...that just happens to involve stuffed simulacrums of everyone you hold dear.

B00003CXRM|5.0|FUNNY AS THEY GET. SOGGY BOTTOM BOYS ARE GREAT. BIG DAN, GEORGE CLOONEY, AND THE COEN BROTHERS MAKE THIS A SUPER FUNNY MOVIE. NOT TO GOOD FOR CHILDREN, BUT GOOD STORY OF THE TIMES.
0307454541|1.0|I am part Swedish. When I heard all the buzz about this book by the Swedish author Stieg Larsson, I was enthusiastically rooting for its posthumous literary success. However, as I made my way through the novel, I felt as if I were dying myself. The prose is so egregious, the characters so cardboard-cutout and humorless, and the plot so weighed down by exposition, that it left me baffled as to all the positive blurbs that adorn the deckle edged work. Did these reviewers even read the book, or were they paid off by the marketing machine? Who knows? Who cares? Who will dare to unravel the mystery?<br /><br />I must give kudos to the publisher and the rest of the team who have made this and the other books in the series international bestsellers, especially after the unfortunate death of the author. To catapult any fiction to the top<br />of the charts is quite an accomplishment. But when the original writer is no longer working behind the scenes, it makes it that much more astonishing.<br /><br />That said, I must get on with my honest review, and the stunning fact that this vapid text could be dressed up and hyped up so much so as to get people to fork over their hard-earned money and be happy that they did so. Like others here on Amazon have already stated, at first I thought the problem might be the translation. However, there are serious errors that go beyond mere translation. The narrative is laden with a constant bombardment of trivial information that detracts from the story. For instance, there is the odd repetition of mundane, technical references:<br /><br />\\"After discussion with her mother they had agreed to give Pernilla an iPod, an MP3 player hardly bigger than a matchbox which could store her huge CD collection\\" (74).<br /><br />\\"Malm had worked in PhotoShop, and it took a moment to notice that the building was floating in air\\" (101).<br /><br />\\"At lunchtime Salander booted up her iBook and opened Eudora to write an email...To be on the safe side, she ran the message through her PGP encryption programme\\" (104).<br /><br />\\"He wanted to know whether the connection could handle ADSL and was told that it would be possible by way of a relay in Hedeby, and that it would take several days\\" (139).<br /><br />\\"The family was so extensive that he was forced to create a database in his iBook. He used the NotePad programme [...], one of those full-value products that two men at the Royal Technical College had created and distributed as shareware for a pittance on the Internet\\" (168).<br /><br />I appreciate technology as much as the next person. But if it doesn't add to the narrative, the characters, or enhance the reading experience in some way, it becomes mud.<br /><br />The story also degenerates into frequent references to the weather (as if in one's in a boring conversation and all this is all that's left to discuss):<br /><br />\\"The thermometer outside the window said 5 degrees F, and he couldn't remember ever feeling so cold as after that walk...\\" (138).<br /><br />\\"The temperature had dropped to -1 degrees F\\" (140).<br /><br />\\"He had several miserable days in the middle of the month when the termperature dropped to -35 degrees F\\" (184).<br /><br />\\"Then the weather changed and the temperature rose steadily to a balmy 14 degrees F\\" (185).<br /><br />\\"The thermometer showed 6 below zero\\" (141).<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I have only managed to muck my way to page 202. Perhaps the rise and fall in temperature will have some vital link to the plot. Perhaps the characters will come alive. I will be sure to let you know if I manage to survive until the end of the book. I am hoping that somehow, miraculously, the novel will redeem itself.

B003JYOEYM|4.0|Sure, the main setting, Plum Island, is pretty absurd--but whatever. The island isn't meant to be real, it's meant to be allegorical, a microcosm of the current American social landscape. Two sides share a home, culture and more values than they'd like to admit, but can't muster an ounce of respect towards each other because of ideological differences (and more than a little bit of hate born out of \\"us vs. them\\" tradition); both patriarchs are corrupt, charismatic, stubborn and, every once a while, each one is right. A nice balance is struck between humor, commentary and gore. The main group of characters are outsiders who make their way to the island, four ex-National Guardsmen and a rogue teenager. The individual characters aren't really delved into (we never even learn the teen's name), but I found the dynamics between the characters interesting enough to watch it more than once during my 48 hour rental.<br /><br />I do think it got a bit disjointed in the last 20 minutes or so, as if important character scenes were edited out in the midst of the mayhem. I'm looking forward to the Deluxe DVD and, hopefully, a few deleted scenes.
B0037W68F4|5.0|People considering buyign this album must note that it is not like the other MGMT albums: it is much better. The band leaves radio friendly land and enters a place where albums matter more than singles, and music matters more than image. The band still sound the same, it's just their song writing has gotten a bit more classic rock influenced. They romp through a Rick Wright style early Pink Floyd jam on \\"Siberian Breaks\\" and go a little 'I am the Walrus' at the end of \\"Flash Delirium\\". They even sing about both Dan Dreacy and Brian Eno...    It's well worth the money and if you don't like it the first few spins keep playing it, it grows and grows.. for people who rate this lower than 3 stars, they obviously haven't taste so don't worry about them..
B000F3UAFC|5.0|I just finished reading the Oscar Wilde play, after seeing the movie. I must disagree with the reviewers who feel that Helen Hunt was wrong for the part, and that this is NOT a good movie. In the book, her only discretion was having a child at the expense of her Upper Class lover, and then being categorized as a second class woman by High Society. What she did, in not revealing the secret of the play is VERY effective. It brings a tear to the eye. Don't try to turn her into a prostitute crashing into the Upper Class. This play was not the romp of \\"Earnest\\". In my opinion, Wilde closely identified with the character because of his \\"notorious\\" homosexual relationship with Lord Douglas. Is it his best play? NO. Is the movie good, in 2010? YES! It actually has more \\"Wildean\\": quips than the drawing room saga he wrote. The costumes are gorgeous, as is the cast, and Wilde was obsessed with detailing the exact fashions, even fabrics the characters in his plays wear.
193413712X|5.0|\\"Several months ago, I heard the results of this year's Pulitzer Prize winners. Paul Harding and his first novel \\"Tinkers\\" was an anomaly. It immediately got my attention. First novel. Published by a small independent press Bellevue Literary Press in 2008, the publishing company only began in 2006. Wow. I ordered the book, but it was not available. No stores had it. It was limited to a few copies here and there. I was fortunate, my copy of \\"Tinkers\\" arrived from Amazon one week after it was announced that \\"Tinkers\\" had won the Pulitzer Prize. Many of my teacher friends simply could not get it, and it would not be available for nearly a month. And this was the novel that won the Pulitzer Prize. Second wow. Not since John Kennedy Toole's \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" published in 1980, which also won the Pulitzer Prize, eleven years after the author committed suicide, has a book not only won the Pulitzer, but has also garnered so much attention.<br /><br />And deservedly so. \\"Tinkers\\" is remarkable. It is a quiet gem buried in the ruff of popular and high profile literary books marketed by millions of dollars by their large publishing houses. The old axiom \\"Cream rises to the top\\" has never been truer.<br /><br />\\"Tinkers\\" is poetry. It is memoir. It is the multiple point-of-view, anecdotal remembrances of a man who is dying, George Washington Crosby. His memory of his father Howard, a Tinkerer, his grandfather, and the timeless events that imprinted the footprints of their lives in an odd, real way upon passing time through nature, through philosophical musings, through the mutations and metamorphoses which all things undergo as they pass through time, as they(we) become a clock's or timepiece components. And in that, there is continuity, of time, of father to son, of nature to nature to metal to machine and all back to nature. What keeps echoing in my head, as I write this review, are two references from T.S. Elliot, one from \\"The Wasteland\\"... \\"breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing memory and desire.\\" The second lines from Eliot's \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\"... \\"In the room the women come and go talking of Michelangelo.\\" The Eliot references are significant because of Eliot's use language in his poetry, and emphasis on memory as time passes.<br /><br />\\"Tinkers\\" is a profoundly interesting novel. It reveals in the silences created by its language, by its anecdotes as Howard, a traveling Tinkerer, survives, observes, and participates in harsh nature, in a world that we have long forgotten, a world that has magic in the silence deep in the forest, embedded deep under the ripples of a pond, or in the infinity of nature's timepiece.<br /><br />This is a novel that lives in language and remembrance, in fantasy, the letting a world of comfort to a world of cold gears and mechanisms that record time. I have not enjoyed a book such as this for a long, long time. I believe that \\"Tinkers\\" will be remembered as one of the great Pulitzer classics, if people ironically take the time and quiet necessary to just to read it, to ponder its underneath language and silence. A silence that will probably happen to each one of us the last few hours of our life when we are dying.<br /><br />--John M.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|this box set is a must have for all beatle fans. the merits of mono vs stereo were discussed in my review for the stereo box, but these mixes have to be heard and enjoyed even if in some cases the stereo mixes are superior in sound quality - this box just brings you back to the 60's. this is how they were first heard by the fans and how the beatles wanted them to sound on am radio. in some cases the songs just sound punchier/rockier and on some you miss the stereo glory but this is how most people heard them in the day so for the sheer historical feeling of going back in time these mixes serve their purpose well. the packaging is beautiful and i feel a nicer touch than the digipacks of the stereo collection but they leave you clamouring for the full size album covers or the beatles box of vision - which will be my next purchase after i recover from the hole in my pocket created by these essential box sets. i haven't stopped listening to these discs since i got them months ago and thoroughly recommend them to anyone who love not only the beatles but music in general.
B001EO748M|5.0|There is very little not to like about \\"The Tudors\\" second season.  The storyline is engrossing and well-told.  I had an unusual advantage over most viewers: as an American (albeit of English descent on both sides) I knew very little about the life and times of Henry VIII.  (The schools here do not cover him more than to say that he broke with Roman Catholicism over the issue of divorce.)  Accordingly, I was shocked at the fate of Anne Boleyn.  I was afraid that this period of English history would prove to be a bore.  Not at all.  King Henry VIII is a fascinating personality and political study, well presented here.  This season kindled an interest on my part in this period of English history, and while the series no doubt takes liberties with history, as television always does, nonetheless this series appears to be substantively correct in its presentation.<br /><br />Probably the main fallacy of this series is simply how good-looking everyone is, but that's show-biz.  The casting of this series is impeccable in my view, the sets are fantastic, and the storytelling is rivetting.  This one will leave the viewer anxious to watch Season Three of The Tudors.  Highly recommended.  RJB.

1892005034|5.0|This book helped me see that judging and blaming is not a recipe for happiness. An open exchange of feelings and needs is. This book could help nearly all humans find the peace to stay compassionate in the most trying of circumstances by changing the way we hear words. Insults aren't insults. They are a way people communicate needs when they are highly disconnected from their feelings. I found this book to be very beautiful and I would hope everyone gets a chance to read it.

B001AII4RM|5.0|This movie is a thrilling retelling of an old epic poem! The CGI is extremely strong and the voice acting drives the story! I would have to call it a cinematic achievement in CGI!<br /><br />It is the story of a king and his kingdom terrorized by a demon named Grendel. Beowulf comes from across the sea to slay this monster, unaware of the strange connection of the demon to the king. Upon doing so, it's mother takes revenge on Beowulf's men and eyes him to give her a new son. It is a tale of vanity and the corruption of power. It is about the rise, fall and the redemption of a man!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Amazing and beautiful. CGI explodes on the screen with sharp and vibrant pictures. The audio was good as well. All the special features are ported over from the DVD with enhanced BD content. FINAL THOUGHTS: UPGRADE WORTHY! A MUST OWN.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|Being a fan of the original TV series and sci-fi movies in general, this latest Star Trek, of the many to have come down the pike since 1979, is flat-out the worst Star Trek film of them all. In fact, it's embarresingly bad.  If one likes sci-fi movies that written and directed with a 14 yr. old boy in mind, then you will, indeed, love this piece of white trash!    Dare I say, this is one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made. The first 15 minutes of this loser speaks volumes-Capt. Kirk, is now, apparently, a bad boy rabel-rouser. Anyway, he's seen going really, really fast in a 20th century motorcycle, listening to a 20th century heavy metal song in a 23rd century world. I kid you not. And it goes downhill from there.  But, whadda except from one of the most over-rated directors, J.J. Abrams, in the last 20 years! With the possible exception of Micheal Bay.    I checked this piece of crapola out at my library for free, with an open mind, hoping for the best, and possibly buying it in the future. It was not even worth seeing it for free, that's how bad it is.    Stick to the earlier Star Trek movies, their 100% better than this Jr. High school silliness.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|Just released not too long ago, the Iron Man sequel unleashes awesome soundtracks from the one and only, AC/DC. Before I bought this item, I wanted to check the songs from the artists other albums to see if there were better offers. Some were, some weren't. If you're looking for the songs on itunes or other places, you might as well buy the album. I say this because the ones I found on itunes are only re-sung by other artists and make it sound, in my opinion, very crappy. This Iron Man 2 soundtrack is the one for those of you who are seeking AC/DC's most popular and most listened songs. They include: \\"Thunderstruck\\", \\"Have a Drink on Me\\", \\"TNT\\", \\" \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Highway to Hell\\", and more. I would have bought this on amazon, but I bought at Walmart instead because one: low price and two: I didn't want to wait. Right now, I'm excited that I have the album and will enjoy in my itunes.<br /><br />Again for those of you who are seeking the most popular songs by AC/DC, this is the one. Take my word on it.

The real world operates on deadlines. Rent and mortgage payments are due. Bill payments are due. When you're running out of gas and have no money to pay for more, you don't have forever to wait. And the chapter on health is even more BS. If the Secret really existed and worked, you wouldn't get sick in the first place.    The one saving grace of this book is the condition in which I received it. The book arrived quickly and in great condition for a used product. A couple edges had been folded down for reference, but it was in good shape otherwise. I even remember it smelling nice, which is rare for books, especially used ones. Thank you to a wonderful Amazon seller!
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I don't want to give to much away but this is based off of a short story, \\"Do Androids dream of electronic Sheep?\\" The store is amazing and the cast is effervescent. All in all, if you love Sci-fi, you'll love this.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|This movie is a classic horror flick that spawned sequels and great movie acting, (Courtesy of Angus the Tall Man, Reggie B., and others. The movie takes place in the late 7O's and takes you on a journey on a young boy who discovers quite a bit(more than he bargned for) at a funeral parlor at a friend's funeral. The Tall man notices the young boy being very inquesitive at what he is doing around the parlor and then takes after him. The young boy gets help from his brother and Reggie to stop this maniacal demon from terroizing the neighborhood. This movie has some pretty cool scenes of Reggie jammin' guitar with his friend and scenes of the Dodge Challenger (Which appeared in Phantasm II.) If you like 70's horror flick's with many scary moment's, This movie is for YOU!! I didn't regret it.
B00076ZZ9I|2.0|I'm very dissappointed with this dualdisc, unfortunately this dualdisc is only a CD side and a DVD-Video side, I thought it would be a DVD-AUDIO side with high resolution audio and it's not, it has standard, compressed, lossy dolby digital audio in 5.1 channels, what's the point?, music is good, im just reviewing this dualdisc edition which doesn't really add any good to the standard CD version which i already have! so it makes this a waste of money.
B001NOAJVW|2.0|I possibly installed this incorrectly, but the mirror detached halfway through my ride and rested on my ear.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|You ever notice how almost all of Tarantino's scenes end with violence, the threat of violence, or with someone dying? Im no psychologist but I am very observant, Its as if he is trying to kill some part of his subconscious off or maybe its symptomatic of his inability to see the world in a mature adult way. Instead what we the viewers get is a black or white, no subtext, no gray area, incomplete character motivations. I also felt this movie ran longer tahan necessary (Tarantino is getting more hedonistic and excessive as he goes along, no?). There are however several really good scenes (more in way of acting and directing) in this film but mostly I would just rather watch the movies this movie borrowed from and are superior to. WW2 films like Dirty Dozen, A bridge to Far, Kelly's Heroes, A Bridge over the River Kwai, Patton, Tora! Tora! Tora! Well, you get it...
B00007K02F|3.0|I am an confessed Jane Eyre Jane Austin Junkie.  I have all of the version of this story.  This is a good one, but not my favorite one.  However, I wanted it to fill out my collection.     I have yet to see a bad one.  I need to get a copy of the Orson Wells version. When I get a moment I will go on line and look for it.    Thanks.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Ok. I wanted to write a more detailed review. But, geez, I just don't want to stop the DVD! (that should tell you something!)    WDNY just released Rachel Brice's latest piece, Serpentine. It's a 2-DVD set, divided into a drill/yoga section and a dance/choreography section. I received an advance copy as I review DVDs for several different places and cannot emphasize enough just how good this one is. I'd say it's hands down her best DVD yet as it finally has what I know I've wanted to see for so long - a comprehensive overview of her own unique signature style. The other DVDs were great (one is a historic gem that has the baseline material and moves that are the building blocks for tribal fusion; the other is a bible for tribal style arms), but both seemed to lack that unique quality of Rachely goodness - her fluid technique, nifty combos, and dance mechanics.     Well, if you want to learn her signature style, it's all here - from the yoga she uses to prepare her body to the drills for strengthening to the actual movements arranged in not one but two sample choreographies. You can read the info on exactly *what* it has (the descriptions on amazon, the back of the DVD case, etc will give you the lowdown), but I can tell you from viewing it that the quality is excellent and really well done. WDNY brings in their specialty of creating an easy to follow format, presented in several variations that will allow you to choose how you want to practice, which is a very nice touch. My favorite part? Drills of course. Overall, I'd say that the drills alone on here are excellent and fairly unique in terms of building up strength for traveling (I really enjoyed that section) and footwork as well as tribal fusion style shimmy drill. Every Rachel workshop I've attended (and I've had the pleasure of going to about 5 or so) have featured yoga and drills with a delicious focus on technique and you'll find that in this DVD.  I like to think of it as a Rachel Brice workshop in a box - an excellent DVD that follows her in-class teaching format exactly.    So the first DVD is drills and yoga. But, beyond that, there's an entire second DVD that includes two choreographies, each of which is broken down and explained, along with Rachel performing each individual choreography in full costume (don't worry there are two *additional* performances too so you can get your Rachel fix). The breakdowns assume you have knowledge of tribal fusion and basic bellydance movements - this portion of the DVD is definitely not for beginners. The combos are presented clearly, but quickly, so you will need to make sure that you know the movements as not all of the individual moves are broken down. Again, this will not be an issue if you have a good working knowledge of the dance. At times, it is pretty challenging (something along the lines of \\"now you're on relevee...and traveling back with this foot pattern/arabic. and let's layer the arabic on. and then when you're comfortable with that, here are the arms and the 3/4 shimmy on the up to go with it...whew!). But often the layers are presented in pieces, so you can work with what you *can* do before adding on the extra pieces. The nice thing is that the setup facilitates you learning Rachel's more complex combinations - the combos are broken down, and there's a \\"practice loop\\" section for you to jam out to. One choreography offering is fast and cheeky, and one is slow and slinky, so you're really getting the best of both worlds. And, in the tradition of WDNY DVDs packing in as much material as possible, there are two smaller classes on the second DVD, a yoga for backbends (FINALLY!) and a lecture class.     Overall, a great DVD (but you probably expected that). If you're into tribal fusion style in general, this is definitely one to pick up. I know, I know - lately there have been lots of other DVDs on the market now that will give you wonderful material as far as combos and movements, but I promise you that this is THEone to own if you're looking for Rachel/the Indigo technique and dance form. And a good yoga practice for bellydancers. And some excellent drills. You get the idea ;)    You will like this DVD if:  * You would like to improve your bellydance practice by adding in yoga and drills (these will benefit dancers of any style)  * You are interested in refining and perfecting tribal fusion technique  * You are interested in improving dance footwork, leg strength, isolation, and shimmies  * You would like to learn some new tribal fusion choreographies and/or combinations  * You're a huge Rachel Brice/the Indigo fan :)    Again, DVD 1 recommended for dancers of all levels, DVD 2 for those who are intermediate or higher level
1584282584|5.0|This is a great book for opening your eyes to the possibilities of using on-camera flash for much better people pictures.  I've read the McNally books (which are excellent) and attended one of Joe's seminars - so I'm a convert to off camera flash techniques whenever possible.   But you don't always have the time or room to set up strobes off camera.  Although weddings and portraits are in the title I would apply these techniques to any people photography situation, indoors or outdoors.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|It won't take long before you stop seeing the Special Effects used to create this great movie and replace your focus, and interest, with the characters and their consummate perfection in facial expressions and body language. I consider the Avatar a must see!
B000784WMW|5.0|This is the most complete version of the story.  It is almost four hours long and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester plays a very passionate interpretation of the character.

B00371QQ2U|5.0|Now, I've seen Apollo 13 a million times.  BUT, this Blu-ray version brings so much clarity and added drama to an already fantastic movie.  If Jim Lovell would have seen Earth from this Blu-ray view, there would have been no way he would have said, \\"Houston, we have a problem!\\"  Fantastic performance by Tom Hanks and his colleagues.  GREAT VERSION of this movie.  Don't waste your money on the \\"regular\\" version.  Blu-ray all the way!
0307454541|5.0|This book has it all...murder, thinly veiled love story, police mystery...and it's in Sweeden.  Even though I've only been to Stockholm on a cruise ship, this book really did take me back.  Somehow I can't picture this taking place on Cape Cod or Hilton Head or anywhere in the US.  Every time I thought the plot was going in one direction something new turned up and kept me in \\"page turning\\" mode.  To say anymore might be a spoiler but this book is truly a \\"must read.\\"
B003A02W0I|4.0|This book starts out pretty dry and does not really get going until around the middle of the book. like most of Dan Browns books the story is fairly choppy to keep the reader guessing but the more you find out about the plot, the more it pulls you in. Some of the scenes are a little over dramatic, but not too over the top.

B001RQ0SJO|5.0|I wasn't sure I liked Fur and Gold all that much, but this album makes Bat For Lashes my favorite female artist.  It's a six out of five.  The songs all flow together with a cohesive and psychedelic production aesthetic that is like being sang to by the king's supernatural daughter inside of a mountain of treasure.  Or like flying high above civilization in winged armor ala \\"Brazil!\\".    It also sounds like the dreams of a previous generation, and has a theatrical \\"Heavy Metal\\" rock-opera of vibe at times, all the while retaining nice rhythms that are smart and appropriate, and often dance-able.  Daniel is a perfect single, with its own kind of melancholy recollections reaching beyond the general theme of the album.  This album could entertain a broad audience, so long as they have some patience with it.  All around great work!
B0020TS5LK|2.0|First of all, I would definitely wait for a proper US release as this blu ray is not correctly framed.  As for the movie itself, I have always found it to be a bit on the overrated side.  Blade himself is a well realized character, but the villains, particularly Deacon Frost are just uninteresting and rather non menacing.  Never once did I feel that Blade was ever in danger of being defeated by any of the antagonists.  They just come across as a bunch of spoiled yuppies who like to party.  Deacon Frost never comes across as menacing at all.  The whole nonsensical plot about lining up the pure blood original vampires in a circle so that Frost could transform into some silly Blood God is just not engaging enough and to be honest, never really pays off in the end.  Frost becomes this apparent blood God and transforms into,,,well nothing really.  He just becomes more agile. Blade defeats him by injecting him with weaponized needles developed by his female sidekick who herself was an annoying character smartly dropped by Del Toro in the much superior sequel.  Stephen Norrington's direction was a little flat as well.  No where near the atmosphere and visual tour de force that would come in the sequel.  In summation, the movie is decent enough with some well choreographed fight scenes and a well realized protagonist.  But the plot falls short as the villains are just not interesting or menacing.
B001DX98XI|5.0|I read this book while staying is the beautiful camp fallujah Iraq, when I was 20 years old. My brain may have been basically dissolved by the heat but I have to say that I fairly enjoyed this book more than any other Dan Brown book. I realize now that I may have a different opinion of the plot than most people. If you are an expert on counter terrorism and a have degree in theoretical binomial variable code breaking, then yes this book is not for you but if you are an average person who enjoys reading about conspiracy, I assure you , that this book is right for you. The book basically fallows two agents who work for the NSA and are trying to solve a murder on the worlds best coder who says he has a code that is imposable to break. These two soon find out that there is much more going on than they thought. The book takes some sharp turns at the end and will keep you guessing. Do yourself a favor and do not analyze ever statement about the NSA to see if it is true. Just read the book if it where true.

B001ED7C58|5.0|I loved the soundtrack, although it would be nice to sample the songs before you buy the music.  However, the music goes great with the scenes in the movie.
B000OT6V00|2.0|Hellboy is a well directed and visually impressive film.  My problems with it lie in the antagonist.  He just isn't interesting.  He is evil for the pure sake of being evil.  Most of the creatures that Hellboy battles with are strange looking octopus creatures.  It's hard to connect to the battles when the enemies just aren't engaging enough.  They seem like rejects from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  And the final battle consists of Hellboy fighting a large cgi octopus.  The best villains are those that don't believe they are evil but feel that they are justified in their actions.  They also need to be organic in my opinion.  The sequel, The Golden Army is much better in that the villain feels his actions are for the benefit of the world that he occupies.  Hellboy is a decent movie, but for me personally, it doesn't hold up to repeat viewings.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|I am a big movie buff, and Sunset Boulevard is my all time favorite movie. Every scene, every line spoken, every costume worn, every musical note is 100% perfect. Had 'Sunset Boulevard' and 'All About Eve' not been nominated at the Academy Awards in the same year they never would have canceled each other out. Both pictures would have gone home with a boatload of awards instead of the few each got. To say Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is one of the all time greatest female roles goes without saying, but I just said it. So buy this movie, now! No movie collection is complete without it.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and it is still just as funny as the first time I saw it 11 years ago.  It is also just as relevant, even though the technology world has changed a lot since then.  Ron Livingston is perfectly cast as the main character who just \\"loses it\\" in a very hilarious way.  Much of the dialogue has made it's way into mainstream pop culture - \\"where's my red stapler?\\", \\"that was the last straw\\", \\"I have to meet with the Bob's\\", \\"I'm gonna need you to...\\", etc.  It is quite profane and some people may not appreciate this, but I think it is one of the BEST comedies to come out of the 90's, period!  See this movie and have a laugh at how utterly ridiculous working in \\"Corporate America\\" has become over the last 30 years.
0452295548|4.0|I thought the information regarding brain function and strokes was very good and could be most helpful to anyone wishing to learn more about how the brain works.  I felt that it helped give me insight into behavioral changes when someone experiences a stroke or other brain injury as well as in cognitive decline.  I think that certain sections of the book should be required reading for medical workers who deal with stroke patients.<br /><br />The parts of the book that deal with the author's feelings of nirvana and peaceful oneness with the universe got overly repetitive for me and it was almost hard to finish the book as it moved into a sappy, indulgent, self-help lesson in finding inner peace.

I am glad I gave him another chance, because I enjoyed this book through and through. (Slight Spoiler ahead)........<br /><br />I was a bit dissapointed with the ending, a little predicitable, a little cliche, but I enjoyed the ride getting there.
1400049628|5.0|I really loved this book. It is written as a practical manual on what you need to do when a Zombie outbreak happens. The author takes as fact that Zombie outbreaks happen and matter of factly explains what you need to do to prepare yourself. It covers the history of outbreaks, characteristics and abilities of a Zombie, and the different levels of outbreaks.<br /><br />The Zombies here are the old school original Zombies from Night of the Living Dead, which I have always preferred.<br />This book has gotten me excited about Zombies and has led me to Max Brooks other Book  [[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]] which I also loved.
B0039TD7RC|2.0|The sound is too bright. Hard to listen to with high-end speakers or good headphones. Lots of detail -- individual instruments can be heard clearly -- but bassy, rolled-off speakers or earbuds are a must. Not recommended for good ears or good equipment.

B0036B8MXC|5.0|Wow, what a great show!  It blends everything you want in a series:  action, good acting, great visuals, drama, romance, violence.  It is almost a hybrid of Rome, 300, Gladiator and Braveheart.      I was a little turned off at the first episode, but I continued to watch.... and i do not regret it.  This show turned out to be very good.  I had to watch all the epsidoes in just a few nights.  Starz has done very good with this show.      If you liked Rome, Gladiator, 300 and anything like that, then you will love this show.
0743277465|5.0|Interesting that this book is called \\"The Art Of Learning\\".  It's about so much more.  Or is it that learning spans  so much more than we think it does?  Did I say \\"think\\"?  This book definitely makes you think.  So it takes a while to read.  You go through a page or two, then you put it down with that faraway look because once again, Josh got your brain going.<br /><br />It's been a year or so since I've last looked at this book, and purposely, I won't go and pick it up to refer to it.  Let me tell you one of the many things that have so powerfully stayed with me in the last 12 months.  After all, that's what a really good book does: it'll keep speaking to you, whether it's handy or not.<br /><br />There is a story when Josh was at a chess tournament and one of his rivals kept surreptitiously and viciously kicking him just at the wrong moment in order to distract him.  Josh lost that round of the tournament but he used it as an opportunity to learn.  He realized that he was more distracted by his own thoughts (\\"I can't believe he's doing this!\\"  \\"How unethical!\\"  \\"How come no-one is doing anything about this?!\\") than by his rival's actions.  Josh then went on to systematically train himself to become inured to such distractions.  His willingness to take complete and utter responsibility for (and therefore control of) his reactions has made a tremendous and lasting impression on me, so much so that since I have told countless clients and friends about it.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|This is the Stones at their peak! Thank you Keith and Mick for going to the vaults to find the best \\"new\\" rock and roll heard in more than 30 years.  The disc of unreleased tracks alone is worth the purchase price.  Plundered My Soul, even with some 2010 overdubs on guitar and vocals, still captures the essence of the grittiest Stones record ever made.  Close your eyes and listen, and you just might find yourself whisked away to Keith's basement in 1971 for a true rock experience.  Pick this one up immediately.
0385493622|5.0|Fermat's Enigma - The story of a riddle that confounded the world's greatest minds for 358 years is science history book written by Simon Singh. Being a PhD graduate from Cambridge, Simon Singh has written this book with so much simplicity that even a person without any mathematical background can appreciate the content. This book is one of its kind as it addresses only one theorem from the start to end. It narrates the struggles Andrew Wiles had to undergo before proving the theorem completely in 1995. This book also gives an account of other mathematicians who were involved.<br /><br />Fermat's last theorem is nothing but an extension of the Pythogoras theorem. Fermat claimed that there are no whole number (non-zero) solution (x,y,z) for the equation<br /><br />for n>2 upto n=infinity. Fermat was a mischievous mathematician who rarely gave complete proof for his theorems. He, therefore, claimed that he has a complete complete for this theorem and died before disclosing the solution. The race for proving this theorem started soon after.<br /><br />This book starts from around 500BC when Pythogorean brotherhood headed by Pythogoras were the front runners in the mathematics. They formed a close community and did not let any of their inventions to the society. Singh has nicely illustrated the incident where Pythogoras executed his own student for proving that there were irrational numbers. Pythogorean brotherhood get eventually destroyed by another student who had been ignored citing his incompetence.<br /><br />This book has few more very interesting events like how Taniyama committed suicide before proving his own conjecture which would have eventually proved Fermat's last theorem. Also, there is an interesting account of Wolfskehl whose life was saved by Fermat's last theorem and the award instituted by him for the person who would solve Fermat's last theorem. Further, the book lucidly explains the complexity of the theorem itself and the various failure attempts in proving it.<br /><br />The most stunning part of the book is related to Andrew Wiles, the Princeton Professor, who secludes himself from the research community and conferences to focus on achieving his childhood dream, i.e. to prove Fermat's last theorem. The logical reasoning as explained in the book which Wiles took in order to prove the theorem would appeal even to people who have limited exposure to rigorous mathematics.<br /><br />The turmoils and pressures he faced after 1993 when it was found by reviewers that there was a small gap in his initial proof are really well narrated. All the key persons involved in the proof apart from Wiles like Nick Katz, Shimura, Ken Ribet, Richard Taylor and others explain the steps taken in their own words. This makes the book even more accessible and credible. The book concludes by giving an account of how Wiles finally releases his paper with the complete proof of Fermat's last theorem in 1995.<br /><br />On the whole, I loved reading every page of this book. I just completed reading this amazing book on a classical theorem. Simon Singh is an amazing writer and keeps the reader engrossed throughout. This book is highly recommended and is a must read for anyone interested in learning about a great mathematical theorem and its proof. Even people with just high school mathematics knowledge would love this book. I am already into reading Simon Singh's other books: The Code Book and Big Bang.ng part of the book is related to Andrew Wiles, the Princeton Professor, who secludes himself from the research community and conferences to focus on achieving his childhood dream, i.e. to prove Fermat's last theorem.

B00005N5RM|4.0|A massive, formless, shape-shifting creature is devouring everything in sight. No, it's not Kirstie Alley, it's The Blob!<br /><br />In this 1988 update of the [[ASIN:B00004W3HE Steve McQueen semi-classic]], \\"The Blob,\\" the titular character descends on a small Colorado town to infringe on its residents' favorite past-time of trying to get some on the first date. A pretty but tough cheerleader (Shawnee Smith of \\"[[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]]\\" fame) joins forces with a rebel (Kevin Dillon) without a cause (or apparently a hair-stylist with taste) in an attempt to save the town from the gelatinous blubber while the government has different plans altogether.<br /><br />Director Chuck Russell and writer Frank Darabont, hot off of the heels of their success with \\"[[ASIN:0780630866 A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors]],\\" hit another home-run with their jazzed up improvement on an original. Sure, it's b-movie material, but it knows it, and the outrageous special effects and disgustingly decadent death scenes are the real stars at hand. While a handful of effects have not aged well (most noticeably during the finale) they only serve to add to the charm of the film. This is a true 80's horror classic, from the not-so-subtle<br />jabs at its own genre to the gruesome mullets that out-gross The Blob itself. From front to back, \\"The Blob\\" is pure fun that is easy to get<br />sucked into.<br /><br />Now, how about a Special Edition release?

B00028HBKC|1.0|...so, of course, people love it.    I was raised a Catholic (\\"until\\", as George Carlin said, \\"I reached 'the age of reason'\\"), so I know the landscape. But as a free-thinking human being, I cannot for the life of me understand the cult of personality around this heinous piece of celluloid.    I suspected, from everything I'd heard about it, that I would hate it - but I finally gave in and rented it long after it had been on DVD. I still feel, to this day, that Mel Gibson sinned against me and hope that God forgives him and the people who made this trash profitable.    Sorry, but I would not worship a diety based on how much physical punishment he puts his human son through - which, come to think of it, sort of makes The Passion of the Christ a less fun version of [[ASIN:B002ZD3V10 Clash of the Titans (Keepcase)]]. Christ is not an epic mythological figure because he knows how to take a beating. (That would make him [[ASIN:B0006GAO5Y Rocky]].)    The best cinematic version of the Bible story is and probably will always be [[ASIN:B0027E6OPW The Last Temptation of Christ]], which is, of course, universally reviled amongst the evangelistic community. Unfortunately, that book ([[ASIN:068485256X The Last Temptation of Christ]]) and movie require a subtlety and appreciation of the human condition far beyond their capacity. It should be the considered the fullest, most reverent telling of Christ's life, not Mel Gibson's heresy.    But unlike Mel Gibson, I haven't been married twice, fathering children with two women who are no longer my wives, or cursed out Jews or made lascivious comments during a DUI. (EDIT: This was written before his second round of clownishness, with the crazy racist voicemails and the beating the mother of his child and whatnot.) He, and the people who love this movie, are clearly more morally upstanding than I.

B00004SAAX|5.0|All recordings are ADD, which means all the recordings have been digitally re-mastered.  The recordings from the late 1950's sound as good as the ones from the 1970's.  At the end of  each piece you can hear the reverberations of the singing pipes, as if we are in the church listening, feeling the vibrations from the music.<br /><br />I am no Bach expert, Walcha IMO does an amazing job of playing.<br /><br />These 12 CD's of incredible organ music increases my amazement of Bach, a must for everyone, especially all Bach lovers.  A very calming experience in our pico-second world.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This is truly a great movie to watch on Blu-Ray. The story may be a Pocahontas rip-off, but the visual effects are more than enough to justify it.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I didn't like this score, i just LOVED it !!!!! It's one of the most beautiful score i've heard. It goes so well with the movie, and it brings the magic of the film in your iPod !
193413712X|5.0|After reading this book, I actually looked at the world in an entirely different way.  Indeed, Paul Harding has taken deconstructionism, dream state, multiple lives, and poetry to new levels of comprehension.  This novel pierced my soul over and over with its picture of life and death as intertwined.
0823023494|5.0|Fantastic book! It discussed all sort of design techniques which made sense that I hadn't considered before. I highly recommend it for people that want to put a little character into their artwork.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|We ordered Avatar, the two-disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo.  It was absolutely fantastic.  The color was unbelievable.  I would definitely recommend it to everyone and buying it through Amazon.com.  The service is excellent!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|It's a plot that has been used many times, \\"Dances With Wolves\\" stands out as well as \\"Pocahontas\\", but the graphics are state of the art.  I thought I would get tired of the CGI, but to be honest, after 10-15 minutes I forgot about it.  That's how good the graphics are.  I never saw Avatar in the theater so I couldn't compare the experience to my Blu-Ray but I was very impressed none the less.  Outside of being able to guess the plot and every turn within 1/2 hour I loved the movie and look forward to Cameron's next effort.
B0001DMPVI|4.0|Repertoire REPUK 1022 (2004)  Again, Repertoire has done an excellent job with their remaster and restoration of this classic psychedelic-era Animals collection. The sound is bright and punchy without being excessively heavy and loud - you'll want to play this one!      This second true step into the psychodelic explorations of Eric Burdon and the Animals (the first being Winds Of Change) is indeed a \\"strange trip\\" which wanders through topical tunes, blues, rock, and some radio hits. Songs like \\"Closer To The Truth\\" one could definitely call `head music' and is reflective of much of the music of the time (such as that of the Airplane). There are also roaming instrumentals like \\"We Love You Lil\\" which serve as links that connect the album together. \\"Sky Pilot\\" is by far the staple of the album. This tune became hugely popular with and still holds a special place for soldiers who experienced Vietnam first hand.  Eric and his Animals had already become quite popular with those serving in Vietnam with earlier tunes such as \\"We Gotta Get Out Of This Place,\\" and hearing \\"Sky Pilot\\" again clearly brings back a certain sentiment. The truly psychedelic and iconic \\"All Is One\\" nicely wraps up the original album and conveys Eric's peace-and-brotherhood mood during this stage of his career - and life. The bonus tracks are also a nice addition and round out the CD.    As many Animals' fans know, their recordings in the post-Mickie Most production era suffered from poor production values and often were very poorly engineered. One of the best features of this remaster is that much of the poor quality of the original tapes has been overcome. Of particular note is the classic mentioned above, \\"Sky Pilot.\\" Fans will surely remember the generally poor sound quality of the original recording - particularly in Eric's intro vocal - with no real improvement on subsequent re-issues. Here, the song lives again and has been restored about as well as I believe it can be. (Gone, however, is that original tremolo/echo effect from Eric's vocal on the line, \\"How high can you fly?\\"). The quality of the sound holds throughout this CD remaster. (A note for the purists and collectors out there: the single versions of \\"Sky Pilot\\" included as bonus tracks are not the US versions. The A and B side versions included in this package are 4:22 and 3:02, respectively. The US versions are 2:55 and 4:30, respectively).    On the whole, this album is indeed a \\"strange trip\\" through the blues-meets-psychodelia brand of music that occurred during the late sixties, and the style and energy of this disc clearly capture the period. While the two tunes not principally sung by Eric Burdon do not contribute much to the overall collection, they do help maintain the continuity and mood. Taking the whole package into consideration, I would give this remaster `two thumbs up' and would definitely recommend it - particularly to fans of the later stage of the Animals.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Loved the movie in the theater 3D IMAX and couldn't wait to buy it in Blu Ray.
0393072231|4.0|Mr Lewis is a gifted networker, interviewer, and story teller.  This book is wider in focus than was Liars Poker and the reader must admire the timely effort entailed in writing it.  By featuring illustrative anecdotes about a memorable characters among the short sellers, the narrative is far more lively, although like life it bounces back and forth a bit much.      What prevented me from rating it 5 stars were two things:  (1) the insistence that no one in 2005-2006 saw the housing bubble about to collapse and (2) his virtual ignoring of the GSE (Fannnie & Freddie, etc.) roles in the debacle.    Regarding (1) -- Angelo Mozilo was quoted several times in Wall Street Journal during 2006 that housing prices would decline 50%.  The problem was that individual investors who belived him -- the readers of this book -- had no way to profit from that insight other than to short home BUILDER stocks.  This owners of hedge fund shares were one thing, but only a few insiders who managed a few funds could employ tactics to short CDOs.  That said, it is fascinating to discover how they did it.    Regarding (2) there are one or two passing references to the GSEs, as if one of Lewis' editors insisted they be at least mentioned.  Government meddling is avoided altogether and culprits like AIG are positioned as the true miscreants. To get a better feel for the nefarious role of government in the housing crisis requires reading The End of Wall Street, a contemporaneous book by Roger Lowenstein.  The two books complement each other in that sense.     Lastly, Lewis does an exemplary job revealing why Moodys and the other rating agencies failed utterly.  Maybe I would rate the book 4 1/2 stars if that were allowed.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This blu ray/DVD combo was worth getting. I did not have the upgrade for my blu ray yet, watched on DVD. Great movie. Once upgraded the blu ray, wow what a difference. The colors were no where near the DVD. Excellant film in blu ray, really makes you feel as if you are there in the forest with the characters.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie was the best Movie I had seen in a long time I watched it in 3D and 2D both were great Highly recommend 3D if you get the chance.     Hope they are going too make a part two         Thank you
B00011CZRE|3.0|I should have responded to the seller; but the dvd doesn't play correctly. It plays to about half way through and then stops.
B001HN69AY|4.0|According to a number of creation mythologies, the world is maintained by a group of people singing a song over and over. The world is maintained in the mind of a single person and sung into existence. In this case that person is Dr Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) living (originally) in Tibet. Old Nick show up an silences the various singers by making their mouths disappear. Dr Parnassus goes on, unperturbed, imagining the world into existence. (How do you know it isn't?)<br /><br />The concepts in this movie are nothing less than brilliant, especially in the light of so much Hollywood mindless trash. It stands beside Terry Gilliam's other masterpieces, \\"Brazil\\", \\"The 12 Monkeys\\", \\"Time Bandits\\"  and of course all of his work with Monty Python's Flying Circus<br /><br />Every time the weasely Heath Ledger goes into the mirror, into Dr Parnassus mind, he changes. He also changes from Johnny Depp to Colin Farrell to Jude Law, like peeling an onion.  Old Nick is well played by Tom Waits presenting sensual, carnal, greedy or selfish temptations to people in a contest with Dr Parnassus to see who can the most capture souls. There is the door on the left and the door on the right for them to choose...The continued existence of the world is dependent on who wins the wager. Valentina (Lily Cole) is beautiful, sexy. Verne Troyer (Mini-Me) has some thought provoking commentaries to Dr Parnassus.  If one is thoughtful, or has a soul, they will find the metaphysics of this movie very interesting. If they don't, they probably won't get it (or probably any other Gilliam movies)...<br /><br />Heath Ledger's last good movie. Much better than the last Batman farce.<br /><br />No car chases or shoot outs will be found in this movie.<br /><br />By the way, the special effects inside Dr Parnassus mind are really richly imaginative, not unlike those in \\"Lovely Bones\\".
0061020680|5.0|I fondly got to know more about Death in this one. A skeleton figure wearing hooded- robe, and eye sockets filled with blue flames. Oh, he was funny and adorable in some ways. Here, he was like a grandfather whom in his old age suddenly got the urge for a change. He wanted to learn more about human's ordinary life. So, Death hired an apprentice, a boy named Mort. Once he thought Mort could do his work, Death took a holiday.    Death then tried fishing, dancing, gambling, and drink, allegedly four of human life's greatest pleasure. But he failed to grasp the fun in any of it. Finally, after he visited a job broker, he got a new job he could enjoy, cooking. There were so many hilarious moments during his experiencing human's activities and job interviewed. (\\"It would seem that you have no useful skill or talent whatsoever. Have you thought of going into teaching?\\" Death's face was a mask of terror. Well, it was always a mask of terror, but this time he meant it to be).     Meanwhile, during his adventure, Mort, Ysabel his daughter and Albert his servant tried crazily to manage the world's balance. Everyday there were sand clocks to set and souls to be ushered into the next world. After sometime, Albert performed a rite to summon Death back. Death was still wearing an apron and holding a small kitten when this summon happened, so he wasn't amused! (\\"Why did you have to spoil it all?\\")    But at the end, it ended well. Death was back to doing his job, and Mort deciding to live a mortal life with Ysabel.     When human's behavior, thoughts, emotions, were played through Death's thoughts, it does look absurd. Mr. Pratchett is a genius. He got me thinking more seriously about humanity now, but I still feel satisfied and humored by his writing. A good read and highly entertaining!
B0039SFKSW|4.0|Those of us that remember the music scene in the early 80's remember Asia rolling off a string of power pop hits with great frequency.  Lead vocalist/bassist John Wetton has said, \\"Asia is an English prog-rock band with a pop edge, always has been, and hopefully always will be. Accessible, melodic, anthemic songs with great playing, luxuriating in a bed of lush orchestration, with lyrics that strike a sympathetic chord in even the most cynical heart.\\"  That description is very accurate as to what you will find on their latest recording, \\"Omega\\".    The album kicks off with 'Finger On The Trigger'.  As others have already noted this song was previously released on the Wetton/Downes album [[ASIN:B001D25MUC Icon II - Rubicon]].  On that recording it's not as muscular or rocking as it here with Steve Howe's guitar work leading it off.  Has that classic Asia sound and a good choice to kick off the recording.    \\"Through My Veins\\" is a Wetton/Howe collaboration that is a more laid back song.  Solid tune with haunting lyrics.    \\"Holy War\\" gives drummer Carl Palmer a bit of a workout during the bridge as he hammers away under the textured music before kicking in the final chorus.  A very catchy song melody wise even though it concerns the 'killing for God' mentality that has existed throughout the ages as justification for war.    \\"Ever Yours\\" is back to being more laid back.  The shortest song on the disc, shows off Wetton's warm voice in this love song.    \\"Listen Children\\" is back to being more upbeat.  The chorus is a joyous celebration of music and dancing and also opens into a bit of prog rock territory allowing Howe to add a few riffs over cascading keyboards.  A very listenable pop oriented song.    \\"End Of The World\\" starts off heavy before the lyrics describe terrible conditions. The chorus is one of optimism and faith being able to get a person through everything going on around them.  Once again, Steve Howe gets to add his quick fingered runs during the bridge.Another strong song.    \\"Light The Way\\" is another Howe/Wetton collaboration that starts out with a synth line that sounds right out of the 80's.  Great catchy chorus about how sometimes you have to let go of what has happened in the past in order to find your way.    \\"Emily\\" is the most fun song on the recording to me.  Wetton's pleading vocals to the woman of his dreams to stop ignoring him and give him a chance.  The last verse puts a spin on the song that had me laughing out loud.    \\"I'm Still The Same\\" is a song about love gone bad.  The layered vocals remind me of a Beach Boys song for some reason as it fades out.    \\"There Was A Time\\" showcases Wetton's singing.  At times warm and at times emotionally raw and pleading. Another song about loss of love, this one is lyrically the most heartfelt regarding the emotions of the loss.    \\"I Believe\\" is another classic sounding Asia song about getting through every day regardless of the roadblocks laid out before you.  The chorus is another singalong with the layered textured vocals.    \\"Dont Wanna Lose You Now\\" is an odd song to close the recording on.  Personally, I would have closed with 'I Believe' as a more upbeat and catchy number.  'Lose You Now' is a more laid back tune about the emotional strength gained from love.  Wetton's voice sounds good again and turns it into another song to sing along with.    Overall impressions is that Omega is a more cohesive recording then their last recording, Phoenix, was.  Every song on Omega has that pop music feel to it, without being constrained to the normal pop song structure. All of the tunes are catchy with their melodies and the upbeat tunes are very well done. I find these songs growing more and more on me and I enjoy it more then Phoenix, which I did like for the most part. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because there was just a few too many of the laid back songs for my personal taste, but it is a solid 4 - 4.5 from me. If you enjoy pop/rock well done and thought out instead of just three chord angst, you really should consider this recording.
0312539525|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is a long-time writer, politican, bon vivant and ex-con.  George Mallory was a member of the early British expeditions to Everest who was MIA from 1924 accident near the summit until a search party found his icy earthly remains in 1999.  Mallory was one the best known men of his generation, a loving husband, dedicated teacher, soldier and adventurer, whose exploits captured the world's imagination in those halcyon days between the wars.    In this fictionalized account, Archer follows Mallory from his youth to his demise and beyond.  The book opens with a striking and interest-grabbing account of the discovery of Mallory's remains.  Archer has not set out to write an historical account.  Others have criticized him for interjecting fiction and unknowable facts (did our protangonist reach the summit) and for being loose with history.  None of that matters to me; I am sure others have transcribed every iota of known data into their boring treatises of those days.    Archer shows his gallantry in telling us what really happened on that fateful day, based upon his interpretation of the facts. For my money I think he is right but the real issue is as Sir Edmund Hillary was quick to remind us, can the attempt be considered a success if you dont return to accolades and late night television appearances.     Mallory was a giant and a leader, one of the last of his generation, who executed faithfully his duties to God, family, king, and college. We wont see his successor.  Read this book, dont let facts stand in the way of a great story about a great man.
B001PO53IO|1.0|Good lord this show looks and sounds absolutely amazing. Really Stunning. Unfortunately, the story doesn't make sense and the characters have no depth and aren't interesting. If you need a lightsaber cutting up some really annoying robot armies, then by all means proceed. But you have been warned.
B002JCSWVG|5.0|It is seldom that my attention is captured in such a way, as it was when I saw INVICTUS! Having `lived' the experience, the account was perfectly accurate in every way possible and I extend my admiration to the `actual' characters, the `actors', the talented performers who recorded the Soundtrack. Being African by nativity, I `got it' on every emotional level and this morning, I have the song 9,000 Days engrained in my mind. I watched the film `on demand' but it is too precious an account for me to not own forever, and I shall order the Blu-ray version to keep. You should too! It is a touching testament to the evolution of my country - South Africa - under the leadership of one of the greatest men of all time, Nelson R.

B000P0J0AG|5.0|Heat is a long yet beautifully and at the same time intricately plot mixed movie(which I don't appreciate for other movies this one YES). Michael Mann Did a Good Job unlike on The Insider and Later Miami Vice. Anyhow,De Niro And Pacino are great. (Unlike a later collabo which did not work for me) The Action is great,the vehicles,Corvette*sparsely in there*,Camaros*base models*,A Peterbilt,and other vehicles! Val Kilmer is surprisingly good,jon voigt as well, all the actors, it is a great cast and great action and story throughout the movie.One of the Best Movies out there.
B003AO1SVS|4.0|This album is NOT like Thickfreakness or any of the other early Black keys albums.  It is NOT full of raw, high energy, guitar driven songs.  \\"Brothers\\" is a more complex and layered album.  Bass and drums drive most of the songs and the guitars seem to be pushed to the background along with keys to fill the songs out.  This makes it sound mellow and that is why I didn't care for it when I first heard it.  None of the songs stand out or are as heavy as \\"Your touch\\"  or \\"10 a.m. automatic\\".  However, I continued to listen to it and I started to like it more and more.  It took a while to grow on me, kind of like a Wilco or Radiohead album.  You hear something different each time and start to like songs different reasons, not just because they have a great riff.
B0035WTE2U|1.0|I'm not the sort to run out and buy a soundtrack after hearing it once but IronMan 2 grabbed me in the watching. I even to the effort to notice the title of the Stark Expo theme, \\"Make Room for Tomorrow Today\\".        Which is NOT on the soundtrack.       The Disneyesque expo theme was cool in setting a tone and the incidental music heightened the experience.        I Love mood intensifiers like Batman Begins \\"Molusus\\" which IM2 had in spades. DC/Warner Bro.s did it right. But then the DareDevil sound track was good.        This cd is a cheap rip-off.  I wanted the IM2 soundtrack not an AC/DC ego-stroke, but what should i expect from a Disney run Marvel.        I DO NOT RECOMMEND this CD.        I feel like the center-piece of a gang-bang.  Marvel, Disney and AC/DC all owe me flowers and candy. Especially Marvel, since the have done so much better before.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Outstanding Lego product.  My seven year old saved for over a year to buy this himself.  It is worth every penny and for him every \\"little\\" toy and sweet he couldn't buy while saving for this.  After reading other reviews, I decided to keep a long to see how many hours it would take for him to complete this set.  The grand total was 18 hours over a 4 day period.  The only help received was separating the pieces once a bag was opened, the time to do that is counted in those 18 hours.  He found the directional booklet (which is HUGE) easy to follow.  The piece itself is amazing, the level of detail, the amount of places in which to re-enact movie scenes, the number of minifigs, makes this Lego at their very best.  My son says he'd buy it again if he didn't have it.  Truly worth the amount it costs.  I would HIGHLY recommend this to any Lego, Star Wars fan or collector.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Melodic, inspirational, creative...from start to finish! I'm a tough critic. Many artist have let me down, relasing a hot single - but not this album. Please buy - you won't be sorry! Knowledgeable and very beautiful - I love it!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I am a huge Orlando fan. This story was great. I didn't think I would like it and watched the dvd with my husband reluctantly. We had borrowed it and I lived it soo much I bought the bluray version. This one not only had way better graphics but also included scenes that weren't in the dvd version that really added to the storyline. I loved it!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I couldn't wait for this to be out on DVD. It was beautiful but I wanted to see more years of their lives and the 9 children. Too bad. Maybe a sequel will be made.
B0009IW9DE|5.0|This recording in my humble opinion is Mellencamp at his finest. A woven fabric of Americana. From cuts like We are the People, and Down and Out in Paradise, to Empty hands, John tells the story of everyday people out here in Middle America trying to get by and make it through their daily lives. An eclectic musical mix with violin, banjo, dobro, harmonica, and other non-traditional rock instruments woven together in a tight musical feast for your ears. Absolutely a must have if you are a Mellencamp fan.
B002A48826|4.0|I acquired The Stranger with no background knowledge of the book or the author. Although at times it is apparent that the book wasn't written originally in English, noticeable mainly through lack of sentence variation, The Stranger is very interesting and tells an intriguing story. A must-read for all Camus fans!
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Simply put..this is one of the best music albums regardless of genre over the past 15 years.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|This cd shows Natalie Merchant to be the musical genius she really is! The content is rich and varied. I really have enjoyed it!
B00361DR4Q|5.0|Beautifully presented with excellent sound and superior colour and imagery.   The Sub Titles short and concise so as to properly follow the story line without loosing visual contact.  Music superb as always.  Will be getting more of these Operas as we do not have an Opera House in Tampa.
0891419063|5.0|Eugene was a true American hero and patriot. In his book, Eugene provides a firsthand account of what it was like to be on Peleliu and Okinawa, nothing like I have ever read before. He had a baptism in fire and lived to tell future generations about his World War II experiences. He came from a unique generation, a generation that put it all on the line for me, my family and future generations. It is because of men like Eugene, we are the recipients of inherited freedom.

B001PPLJJ0|5.0|KATE WINSLET - she has never made a bad movie.  She is the classic British actor, well trained who can portray any type of  person.  Other favourites of mine are \\"THE HOLIDAY\\" and \\"ENIGMA\\".  The latter is a well done British WW11 story about breaking the German Codes.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is not a guy flick nor a chick flick. Both can enjoy watching it. This is a right vs. wrong, action / adventure, love / commitment, trust / betrayal, heartbreaking / humorous film.  Avatar played with every emotion I have. I laughed and cried got angry then cheered. I really enjoyed this film.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day was originally a punk band. Dookie,Insomniac, and Nimrod were great albums vocally and instrumentally. This is good for me cuz for the most part I hate punk music. Besides MC5 and The Stooges I don't respect the genre. I listen to just about everything except for Top 40 pop and pop country. But this punk crap along with the white man's version of gangsta rap called hate metal is some immature art. But back to the point of this particular album. Green Day obviously is making sum political points with this cut but they need to stop hating on America as do a lot of other artists (unfortunately artists I respect musically). These guys have been made filthy rich by their fans and the monetary system laid in place by our government and the world. Honestly if they were going to be true to their punk dogma they would probably be a different sort of creature. My overall feeling towards the group is that something just isn't right with them and I wish people wouldn't give them as much credit cuz the dudes really don't deserve it.

1416955070|4.0|City of Bones is an amazingly well-crafted world of Shadowhunters (demon killers), demons and halfbreeds (vampires, werewolves, warlocks, etc.) living amongst humans. Huge twists and impossible to foresee revelations matched with an excellent supernatural story line, vivid description and thrilling action make City of Bones a marvelous series starter.<br /><br />There was a subtle, yet undeniable message about race relations in City of Bones. Evil shadowhunter Valentine planned long ago to kill all of the halfbreeds in order to keep humanity pure and much his attitude is reminiscent of Adolf Hitler. In present time, you see Clary trying to decide for herself if the halfbreeds are in fact lesser beings.<br /><br />The characters are fleshed out nicely, with various unique traits. I absolutely love that not all the characters in City of Bones are strictly heterosexual and the point is made without involving anything sexual in nature. Sexuality is a huge factor in teenage lives and while I felt the closeted aspect was unfortunate, it lent credence to character actions. I have high hopes of this being expanded on further in future books.<br /><br />I wasn't a huge fan of the weird friendship/unrequited love/inappropriate triangle between Simon, Clary and Jace. Actually, it was downright uncomfortable, but it was different and very emotionally striking.<br /><br />City of Bones is a creative and captivating novel that could be complete all on its own, but I'm very glad that it's the beginning of a series. Cassandra Clare has a wonderfully creative edge which is proven completely in this book. I won't be waiting long to read City of Ashes.

B000W1V5VU|4.0|4.3 stars<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable this one was. Nobody takes it too seriously, yet there's a lot of quality here, both in the easy humor and interplay of the cast, and in the occasionally spectacular cinematography by Soderbergh. Even the script is quite good.<br /><br />What isn't good is the transfer to both dvd and blu-ray. I watched the dvd and was amazed at how washed out and grainy it was, so I rented the BD, and it was no better. The only positive is that the crappy transfer saturates the colors even more than they already are, and it suits Soderbergh's splashy, neon vision of Vegas quite well.<br /><br />The real star here is the camera, and it's used to perfection, sweeping down gleaming hallways and floating over the very nicely CGI'ed Bank Hotel. SS has become a very sharp director, getting fine performances from all his actors while framing them, the town, and its cheesy architecture in a style reminiscent of both the best noir and '70s crime flicks. The music echoes it all and Ocean's 13 becomes quite a pleasure to watch if you're a fan of either of those genres.<br /><br />You need to turn off your logic filter, though, as the plot has endless holes, but none of this is meant to be taken too seriously. Pacino gets this and turns in a very funny performance in its own edgy way. Ditto for Barkin. In fact, everybody in the movie is fun to watch, and Pitt and Clooney make a truly great team. You can imagine the fun these guys all had shooting this in Vegas and it shows up on screen. There are plenty of laughs to go around and it's all a breezy good time.<br /><br />Pure fluff, but very entertaining fluff done with technical brilliance, O13 is well worth seeing if you like any of these actors, great cinematography, Vegas, and crime capers in general. Even the weak transfer is easy to let go of; it adds its own grainy color and in some ways fits in just fine.

B0029LHWFO|4.0|I bought my copy of Dreams from My Father in late July 2008, a few short months before the svelte campaign of Barack Obama came to a triumphant end mere miles from my apartment in Lakeview, on Chicago's North Side. Swept up in the euphoria of not just his historic run, but the entire 2008 Presidential campaign, I wasn't able to find time to down Mr. Obama's 1995 memoir.<br /><br /> Instead, I read his book more than a year into our country's first African-American President, after historic (for better or worse) health care reform, squabbles over Wall Street, and true concerns about our nation's place in the world. It is extremely difficult, regardless of your political disposition, to discern how Mr. Obama has changed our country and its image, both of itself and in the rest of the world.<br /><br /> I don't pretend to know how our current leader has changed the world. But I can say with some confidence that reading this book, written before Mr. Obama joined the public circus that is American politics, allows a reader an unfiltered view of the formative years of an important American. Learning about Mr. Obama's internal struggles to find his place in American society, his ambivalent feelings towards \\"whiteness,\\" and his personal frailties, I have a much better appreciation for the way he runs our country.<br /><br /> Dreams suggests a man better equipped, from multiple perspectives, to lead a diverse and changing country like ours, than anyone. Mr. Obama's time running around Indonesia as a young child, learning what it means to be a man from men not his father, gave him a view into what it means to work hard for one's spoils, even if those spoils are minimal. His school days in Hawaii, his growing self-realization and growing anger towards racism he sees even in the melting pot of Hawaii, didn't prepare him for what he would soon witness in Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago. (Maybe I'm biased--I myself have lived in these three cities Obama called home.)<br /><br /> We see Mr. Obama's wild side at Occidental in Los Angeles; he convinces us that he puts that part of his life behind him and gets serious in New York. His time in Chicago prepares him for a lifetime of activism, organization, and overcoming tough odds. Most moving of all is Mr. Obama's journey to Kenya, the land of his ancestors, the place in which much of his family remain. It's clear that returning to the land of his distant father is an emotionally wrenching experience for a man most view as beyond emotion, instead calm and calculated. At \\"home,\\" he finds a family thrilled to see him. He finds a family both united and torn apart by the legacy of a brilliant but selfish and self-righteous father.<br /><br /> It is rare that we get such a frank and intimate view into the formative stages of such a public figure's life. We are lucky that Obama's rise to the editor of the Harvard Law Review piqued someone's interest in the life of this unique and articulate American. I now know well just why Mr. Obama makes his decisions so carefully. His life is one of nuance, of complication, of ambiguity, of shades of gray.de at Occidental in Los Angeles; he convinces us that he puts that part of his life behind him and gets serious in New York.

B000WYCF6Q|4.0|I've struggled with finding a mirror over the years, and never found one that does quite what I want it to do. My conclusion is that none ever will, but this one comes close. I have traditional road bars with bar end shifters, and I'm able to clip this reflector at the front end of the bottom straight section of the bars (a bit below the brakes). This seems to keep them out of the way of both the brakes and the shifters.    The mirror's slightly convex shape gives you the \\"objects in mirror are closer than they appear\\" effect, which also means objects are smaller and thus harder to see. But if you don't have the convex shape, you get less viewing area, so this is a trade off I'm willing to live with.    When I'm riding on the side of the bars (between the brake hoods and the level center section of the bars), I cannot see the mirror, so sometimes I can't use it. This means I use it less, so I'm not getting in the habit of using the mirror and just keep looking over my shoulder (which, in some cases, is good because you let drivers know you are thinking of moving in that direction).    Bottom line for me: the flexibility of this mirror (you can put it just about anywhere on your bars) makes it a good choice. It's not too pricey, so go ahead and buy one and see if it works for you.

B002IM49IW|1.0|Let start out saying that Freaks is one of the best horror films ever made. It was disturbing, creepy, and raunchy in a way no other film made during that time was. Tod Browning, fresh off of Dracula, delivers another chilling horror movie. Now, on to the DVD. This is by far one of the worst DVD's to a film I have ever had, and the fact that there was an enhanced version of the film for cheaper on Amazon infuriates me to no end. This DVD has a terrible presentation of the film. The picture quality is crap, and so is the sound. You can barely hear what anyone is saying, which would be OK if they put subtitles, because I'm a person who doesn't really hear that well. They don't have subtitles, and the sound and picture is chopped and butchered to Hell and back. It's a rare feat to actually make a movie way less scary than it already is, but this DVD does it. Because of the fuzzy picture grain and inaudible sound, they took a movie that was disturbing and scary and made it a laughable mess. Get another DVD of this film, avoid this DVD AT All COSTS

B002HWRYJE|4.0|The original Star Trek concept melded problem solving effort with any action used to make the story more palatable.  The action was a sidetrack to the elements of achieving the mission.    In this movie, the merging of problem solving with action tends to lean heavily in the direction of the action.  Many will find that to be a great addition to the Star Trek mythos.  I, personally, do not prefer it.  Star Trek has been ridden with much that is meaningless ever since Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.  Even The Wrath of Khan focuses too much on action and too little on problem solving, though the Kobiashi Maru scenario is developed very well in that film.    Having said all of that, I go on to say that I loved this Star Trek movie for many reasons.  First, it is just fun as everything to watch it.  So much is going on in it that you have to pay attention to everything.  Some of the reality altering ideas really develop for us a viewer's struggle to understand it all.  Despite being a very fast paced movie it is also surprisingly and inventively simple.    Now, the problems I mentioned as existing in this film are forgiven for a good reason, though I will dock it one star.  This movie certainly did something unique: it broke the convention of all the old Star Trek ideas and yet maintained the nature of the famous Star Trek characters.  Zachary Quinto is great at doing Spock, and the fellow playing Kirk manages to do what this really intends: satire.  This is a satire of all things Star Trek and the satire is layered in such a way so that while it makes fun of the idea it at the same time does honor to it.  This film, despite getting a lot of rave reviews, will probably never be considered for the true artistry within it.    But, have a look at this.  I am sure that if you love action, you'll love Star Trek.

B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I love me some Doctor Who, and the specials are awesome. Each special has a slightly different feel, running the gamut from deeply personal to fun and action-packed to scary to all of the above plus epic. That said, if you're not already a Whovian, I wouldn't start with these. I'd suggest starting either with Series 1, featuring Christopher Eccleston, or series 5, the current one, wherein Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Steven Moffat have taken over, and are doing a brilliant job. Then go back and watch S1, because the Ninth Doc is wonderful.    The box art is rather nice, with lots of Daves on it. Each episode and its special features are on one disc, making five discs in all. Each story has its own custom DVD menu; the End of Time's is the Immortality Gate, for instance, while Planet of the Dead uses the double-decker bus. Each episode's corresponding episode of Doctor Who Confidential is on the disc with it. David Tennant's video diaries are also included, which is lovely, except that the end made me cry, since it details everything that happened as he was leaving, and it's pretty obvious he has a huge emotional attachment to the show. *sniffle* There's also commentary on each episode. My favorite is the commentary on Part 2 of the End of Time, because John Simm is really amusing. They've also included footage from when Doctor Who went to Comic-Con 09, including the (in)famous John Barrowman/David Tennant kiss. There are more special features, I just can't think what they are right now and I don't have time to go and check.    Basically, if you're a Who fan, you need these. They're good fun, so what more could you ask for? And also, they're Ten's final stories. You have to have them. You do.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Craig Horner, Bruce Spence, Craig Parker, and Bridget Regan, and a beautiful drop dead gorgeous girl who adds to make 4 heros traveling together playing Kara.  (ALL and I mean ALL the women are beautiful)  This is a must buy, the second season ends today and I hope they do a third season.  I took one reviewer's advice and wrote in to SYFY to pick it up and air it longer.  Look at the first 17 people who wrote in, it is like the series \\"CHUCK\\" you cannot miss and all the reviews, all 5 stars.  Both series you can't miss on watching and have nothing to loose because they are so good you do not waiste your time as it is fun and enjoyable.  I am surprised by all the huge amounts of strong women on the show and the \\"WAY\\" they have them on screen in costume, effects, and ever growing complex relationships in their lives, especially the relationship between the Seeker and HIS brother, also the Seeker and ZED!!!!!  NOT very many shows display this unique form and writing in the fact that they have dominatrix type women VS confessor \\"White Knight in female form\\" type ( and all good fighting especially with the female fighters), and then the evil sisters of the dark, a rouge sorceress Nikki, a wizards training center slowing time down in \\"The world of the old,\\" plus all the total cast. Set in NEW ZEALAND at this time for filming like the series Xena and Lord of the Rings, with spectacular views makes you want to go there.  Special effects are very good. Equally are the male hero and antagonist actors posing situations of (LIGHT AND DARK) even showing the Underworld again, and secret hidden places the Creator made. Many guest stars like Jolene Blalock (Star Trek Enterprise and Stargate) add to the interest of visual entertainment and stimulation as situations arise.  I am getting this for teen age niece and nephew so it is still kid friendly and fun, they just do it in such a surprising way and wrap it all together making it VERY VERY interesting for adults and children!!!!  If they do not renew it I will be Disappointed.  They tie the finale up well leaving it in a good way with the Stone of Tears and the broken vale between the world of the living and the dead (like pagan myth in Greek and Norse), but remembering this is created from Terry Goodkind's books and this series encouraged me to actually go out and read them. With little time as a full time worker, an engineering college student plus modeling contracts that says quite a bit as I am busy much of the time the writing... (it reminds me of good writing like Terry Brooks in the Shannara series as it is a long series of many books and quite good.)

B002ZG98VE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie--lots of action and excellent performances by Russell Crowe (Robin), as well as Cate Blanchette (Lady Marian), Max Von Sydow (Daddy Loxley), William Hurt (Court Chancellor), and Mark Strong (Godfrey).  Based on how the movie ends, a part 2 could easily follow, but understand that this movie stands on its own as it is.  Most of you already know the basic story of Robin Hood.<br /><br />It is turn-of-the-12th Century England.  The law of the land is oppressive to the people.  They are poor and hungry and overtaxed already from the long wars.  Beloved King Richard has been away in the Crusades for the last 10 years and is now making his way back to England.  It is 1199 and he is fighting his final battle in France.  Back in London, Richard's younger brother John is having a good old time being a spoiled nasty little creep. In France, Philip is plotting with Godfrey to kill Richard on his way back.  (Godfrey is like a double agent in a James Bond movie.  He is pretending to work for John but is really in cahoots with Philip.)<br /><br />Robin of Loxley and King Richard are good friends and fighting side-by-side.  Robin Longstride/later known as Robin Hood (Russell Crowe) is also fighting with the same group, but not a friend of the King's.  When Richard appears to have been killed in the battle and Robert/Robin Loxley is ambushed by French bandits (hired by Geoffrey), Robin Hood comes upon the remnants of the ambush.  Loxley asks Hood to take his sword back to his dad in Nottingham.  Robin Hood also assumes his identity and travels back as Loxley, joined by 3 friends/fighting companions (one being Little John).  Thinking that Richard is dead, Momma crowns her remaining son as king, the arrogant John and let's just say that John is NOT a people person.<br /><br />Friar Tuck is a cute little round friar who is also a Bee-Keeper and makes some kind of moonshine with the honey.  Daddy Loxley owns 5000 acres of land.  He is blind so his daughter-in-law, Lady Marian, takes care of him and helps with the land.  (Daddy Loxley is played by Max Von Sydow, one of my absolutely favorite actors.  I guess Max must be 80 something by now.)  Daddy Loxley takes a liking to Robin and asks him to stay.  Meanwhile, Godfrey and the French army are murdering and burning everywhere they go, in the name of King John.<br /><br />It is an excellent movie and full of action and beautiful scenery.  Although the credits did not say where it was filmed, during the moving they were indicating the scenery was between France and England.  The movie is a Marine's dream, full of hand-to-hand combat.  The movie also takes place before Robin Hood was declared an outlaw, providing the events that led up to the legend, that's why I think there will be a part 2.<br /><br />Enjoyable movie, lots of action, and time passed by quickly.s care of him and helps with the land.

B000244FDW|4.0|I've always liked Elizabeth in this version A LOT. She's bright, attractive and appealing. Job well done by Elizabeth Garvie. As for the family, this version's Jane is quite pretty which is important to the story. The 1995 Jane was not attractive enough to be the family beauty. I enjoyed plain Mary with her attempts to get attention and Mrs. Bennet with her nerves was just right. The emphasis in 1980 is internal with little outdoor scenery and activity like the later version, but it's more in tune with Austen's book. Most of the action is indoors and sedate, not out in the countryside. I also thought pompous Mr. Collins with his gawky moves and snide Caroline Bingley were excellent.   My one quibble with this version is the stiff, rather boring portrayal of Mr. Darcy. And that's a failing since he is supposed to become Elizabeth's perfect match. It's hard to understand how Elizabeth could be attracted to him at all other than he \\"saved\\" her sister. He shows so little emotion, even after he's changed, it's tough to root for them to get together.   I have 3 other versions, but this is my favorite Elizabeth.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|This is an unremarkable movie that reverts to the old, \\"I-hate-you-but-circumstances-require-that-I-pretend-to-love-you\\" romantic comedy plot line we've seen in dozens of movies through the years. The only update that adds interest is that Sandra Bullock is allowed to be over a decade older than Ryan Reynolds without any excuses, or God help, cougar references. Sixty-year-old actors have been romancing 22-year-old actresses on film with no mention of the extreme age gap since the medium began. For once we see those roles swapped without anyone raising an eyebrow. It seems like social progress even if the movie itself is stuck in the good ol' days.
0451531116|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.d herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others).

B00337KM2S|3.0|I get the movie but I don't get the gushing critical praise and the slew of award nominations. It's a good movie. It's nice to see a studio film that feels small-- basically a three character play only with big scenery. I guess what resonated with critics and the film peers who nominate awards contenders is the idea that American society is encouraging us to pull away from each other-- that human isolation is becoming the norm.  Maybe that's because movie critics and showbiz insiders get to fly around a lot and are constantly uprooted-- maybe blissfully so. They may look at me as I go to the same workplace day after day then come back to my little home in the suburbs and consider it the ideal of social stability and support.  But golly, they sure don't opt for it, even though they can. On the other hand, the rest of us can't try their lifestyles even though we may dream. This movie might represent those people as they look at my grass like its greener. They want us to experience their solitary pain. This movie just doesn't emotionally touch the same nerve for me that it does for them.    Not that I don't buy into the film's thesis as I look at my city sprawling away from the notion of community. There does seem to be more disconnection and isolation than ever before. Right now, I am nose-down in a computer when I could be lunching with friends, or taking a daylight walk and interacting with neighbors who are doing the same. However, this movie almost made being anti-social seem like an elegant, viable life-choice. You wouldn't want to give up your Ritz-Carlton VIP card just for having a few relationships, would you? If I had one, I'm not sure I would.

B001QERPDO|5.0|The Script's eponymous debut album breaks down many barriers which were probably built around this band: mainly, the assumption that their one-hit-wonder song, \\"Breakeven\\", is where it starts and where it ends for them. However, it has been years since I've seen a band so successfully break out of it's shell and... well, go way beyond just breaking even.<br /><br />The album features an electrifying mix of pop, rock, rap, and electronic influences. It is very easy to distinguish one song from another because they are so diverse, yet the album as a whole is unified and doesn't feel jumbled. Note: I use the word \\"rap\\" as a style of fast-paced singing... think Jason Mraz, not 50 Cent.<br /><br />Here is a track-for-track breakdown review.<br />1. We Cry (10/10) - A fast-paced account of modern day society and it's demands, very moving. [1st single]<br />2. Before The Worst (8/10) - Catchy, yet more generic pop/rock song. Nice hook and bridge.<br />3. Talk You Down (9/10) - Starts out slow and picks up fast, this song is quite a ride. Relationship troubles, etc. - will be stuck in your head! [4th single]<br />4. The Man Who Can't Be Moved (10/10) - Lyrically intelligent, very relatable song and a much softer rock sound. [2nd single]<br />5. Breakeven (9/10) - Fun, nice pace, very catchy. Understandably the band's most successful single. [3rd single]<br />6. Rusty Halo [8/10] - Not my favorite, this is an oddball in the mix but a nice change in style from tracks 4 and 5. Has a better aftertaste.<br />7. The End Where I Begin (10/10) - Self-explanatory. A very melodic, beautiful song. Song changes mid-way, overall great balance of ambience and rap.<br />8. Fall For Anything (8/10) - Fast-paced rap/rock, catchy but feels more like a formula song. Still good.<br />9. If You See Kay (9/10) - Undeniable word being spelled out (eff you see kay)... awkward if not. Anyway, this song is great and one of the album's best.<br />10. I'm Yours (10/10) - Very emotional; brings out the best in the singer's voice. Great romance rock, DO NOT listen to this if you have recently had a break-up, some kind of family tragedy, or if you are doing anything where intense emotions would be involved (unless you want to cry).<br />11. Anybody There (10/10) - Great choice in a finale, a nice song to balance the feel after \\"I'm yours\\". Upbeat, fast-paced, The Script has made a solid finale.<br /><br />Overall (10/10) - A very diverse mix of sounds and styles, there are songs to wake up to, songs to fall asleep to, and songs to play throughout your day. The Script is an album you'll hold onto for a long time, and a band which you'll be looking for music from again in a few years.listen to this if you have recently had a break-up, some kind of family tragedy, or if you are doing anything where intense emotions would be involved (unless you want to cry).  11.

This is another flic where Damon is using his celebrity status to pan America and Bush. When are you left wingers going to move on - especially you DAMON?  I and many other vets have lost all respect for this Damon guy because he shows his contempt for this country to put a story like this on the screen because their are always people that will really believe it. Give it a rest.  If this war was all about oil why aren't the gas prices down instead of going up?  I and many more will never see another Damon movie again.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I took a chance on this odd ball. Miss Janelle Monae is quite striking to look at. Her sense of style and beauty got me curious about her without ever hearing her. I was thinking here might be yet another flash card diva wannabe or a real diva with real chops. In this case, the latter would be correct. Monae has got the \\"IT\\" factor. These days so few really do have \\"IT\\". Her music is an impressive listening experience. I hear lots of rock influence, James Bond movie theme influence and a dash of pop soul to boot. Massive studio production on this one. I hope she is as good live. Her voice soars in and around various styles of music. Is she amplified? For sure. But, I love how the tricks work for her anyway. The artwork for this project is equally imaginative. Looks classic with its' cover art deco homage to Metropolis. Diddy & Co. did good this time out in presenting an artist of multiple abilities. Miss Monae might be small potatoes now, but, I predict she is gonna be big! The 25 yr old diva in training is already blowing up with her current single \\"Tightrope\\" produced by OutKast's Big Boi.
0674032810|5.0|On the Origin of Species is one of the most elegant scientific books ever published, but reading Darwin with James Costa's annotations adds further to the pleasure -- and the understanding. Costa's notes make Darwin come alive for lay people, teachers and scientists. After all, Darwin was writing for an audience from 150 years ago; Costa takes us back to that era to show how Darwin smartly addressed the issues and concerns of that day, not only for his scientific colleagues, but for the general reading population. The extraordinary efforts behind Darwin's narrative is revealed by Costa:  for example, a single sentence on how long a seed can stay alive and float -- important in understanding the capacity of plants to reach remote islands -- required months of study by Darwin.    This information on floating seeds is one of many in James Costa's notes requiring the insights of a modern biologist -- which is what Costa is.  And here is a difference from most of the books written about Darwin, which were usually penned by historians of science: they have described in great detail the social context of Darwin's work, but ultimately what Darwin wrote grew in importance because of how it survived scientific scrutiny.  Costa shows us that story.      Still, Darwin was just like any other scientist, trying to understand nature as best he could, with the limited information available in his day. Costa also points out the weaknesses in Darwin's arguments, showing how the science of evolution has progressed since 1859.  It's this unending growth and maturity, and not any dependence on \\"the word\\" of any great historical figure, that gives science its power to send men to the moon or unravel the secrets of the gene and the origin of species.    The introduction and coda sections of this book spell out how Darwin intended to develop his logical arguments; it turns out he didn't live long enough to see all the steps through. Yet throughout the Origin, as James Costa shows us, Darwin's passionate belief in the prospects for unravelling life's great story shines through everything.
0385341008|5.0|I picked up this book knowing absolutely nothing about it and was quickly drawn in by the charm of the letter writers. I recently finished reading Winds of War and War of Remembrance (Herman Wouk) so I was still in the WWII frame of mind. Imagine an English island occupied by the Germans, completely cut off from the rest of the world for five years. How did they survive it? I never heard of Guernsey Island before, and now I want to go there more than anywhere else.<br /><br />It is amazing how a collection of letters can weave such a magical story. It is almost impossible to summarize the \\"plot\\", but these are some of the most memorable characters you will ever meet.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|It is amazing how realistic the movie is.  The blend of animation and reality is seamless.  Astonishing that the intelligence and creativity exists to make it.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Very nice to have both the Blue Ray and DVD in one package.  Arrived in good condition a day sooner that expected.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|Finally, I can have both copies under one packaging.  Now I am able to allow the kids to watch the movie at home on the blu-ray player and also when they're strapped in their seats in the mini-van when we go for longer excursions.  And considering that Disney standardizes all their prices, this is a great price deal.  Paying $20 for each disc seemed a bit of a rip off considering I'm buying the same movie twice.
1595141979|4.0|I couldn't believe everything that happened in this book. You know how most people say \\"it was so good that I couldn't put it down?\\" Well, this book was so good that i COULDN'T put it down. . . Not only does Rose have more problems with Victor Dashcove to sort through, but she's also having problems with her sanity. Moreover, she starts wondering if she's making the right choice by becoming a guarding because she will have to sacrifice her happiness to get what she \\"wants\\". Next, you have the whole thing with Dimitry. . . you think rose is finally going to get her happy ending and that maybe, just maybe, the book's ending will be happy for once. Don't be fooled. It's the most unhappy ending in the world! It's so hard to give a spoilter free review for this book because so many things happen and most of it is based on the same thing. I think that this book, all in all, was the best one in the series, but i might have changed some things. Thanks for reading! :) Don't hesitate to read this book, you will regret it if you wait.
B0036EBARO|4.0|As far as I am concerned, they've done it again. The title track, \\"Head First\\" is my favorite on the album- an absolutely beautifully constructed heady ride. I cannot wait for re-mixes of this. \\"Voicething\\" is different and euphoric. \\"Rocket\\" grows on me the more I listen to it, but also, as with a lot of Goldfrapp's music, the re-mixes take the great melody and turn it into an addictive pleasure-filled experience, perfect for late night rides in your car, or in a pounding club. I always recommend the EP's for additional listening pleasure. If you're a fair weather \\"Strict Machine\\" fan, you might not be into this retro-80's flashback collection, but for me, it's pure sweetness.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Two men have made this film what it is.  Tom Ford, the director and designer, and Colin Firth, the actor heretofore almost known exclusively as Jane Austen's or Helen Fielding's Darcy. Fifteen years later, he is finally able to break the Darcy mold constricting him, breaking out as a gay, bereaved lover, a professor from the UK who teaches in 1962 California. His longtime lover and companion of sixteen years was killed in a car accident.  He is excluded from all but a phone call in the grieving process. Stuck with grieving and mourning alone, he verges from the suicidal to the reawakening.  It is a wonderful characterization, nuanced with every layer one could hope for in cinema. Ford's artistic sensibility invades every frame.  There is an extremely tactile, lush, visual beauty to the whole film coupled with an artist's way of seeing.  This obviously is coming to us from the designer inside Ford.  It too gives the film another whole layer and thus a much more varied palette for Firth's acting. I can only hope Firth and Ford collaborate again.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00081U6EG|5.0|Strat pack is all I expected.  Great performances at a great price that I can watch and share over and over again.  Thanks  5 stars
B002UJIY70|4.0|I saw the movie in theaters and loved it and it is even better on Blu-ray! The movie is about two killers that are in Hawaii. There are 3 sets of couples and any of them could be the killer. You don't know who the killer is until over half way into the movie, then it has a flashback of everything that happened. It is a little boring until it gets to that part though. Then the movie starts getting a lot of action with twists and turns. The movie looks great on Blu-ray with just a few scenes with grain. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of special features. There is only one and it is an alternate ending. It is a little different than the ending of the movie, but I was hoping for more. All of the deleted scenes are included in the director's cut I guess which is also on this disc. The director's cut offers more backstory and makes the movie ten minutes longer. Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a thriller.
B0012GMV58|5.0|Welcome finds Carlos Santana at the very top of his magnificent musical/spiritual vision - one that blended jazz, rock, latin into one inimitable, unique language. Sadly, it also marked the last time he would climb these heights.     Released in November 1973, the Santana band had been through a few key line-up changes. Gone were Gregg Rolie, Neal Schon and percussionist Mingo Lewis and in came keyboardists Tom Coster, Richard Kermode, percussionist Armando Peraza and vocalists Leon Thomas, Wendy Haas and - for one song - Return to Forever's Flora Purim. The album also benefits from the participation of John McLaughlin on the majestic Flame-Sky.    From the glorious beginning of Going Home to the last notes of John Coltrane's Welcome, the music here is diverse, full of richly textured elements coming from either the guitar/keyboards or the wall of sounds achieved by the percussionists and the extraordinary Michael Shrieve. The fact everything seems to be a-flowing only serves to leave one wondering about the incredible musicianship those guys could put forth.    This reissue of Welcome is welcoming indeed and definitely worth picking up. Besides sounding unbelievably great, it comes with a decent booklet bearing full credits and insightful liner notes - a clear improvement upon its original cd release. And most of all, the addition of the excellent album outtake Mantra as a bonus track just makes it even more perfect - an infectious Miles-influenced drums and bass groove with eerie voices chanting which will leave you begging for more.
0307593525|5.0|I purchased this item because I wanted to learn some basics of soups and sauces.  I have been cooking for years and I still have picked up wonderful tips and suggestions from this set of books.  I have made several of the recipes including the Coq Au Vin, which turned out perfectly.  Some of the timing for the vegetables seem long, but remember this book was written before many of the modern equipment was invented, so use your best judgement on cooking times.  My stove and oven tend to run hot, so I cut vegetable cooking time down by a couple of minutes.  I use a ceramic cooktop, so not able to adjust heat as easily as a gas stove.  I recommend this product for anyone wishing to advance their cooking skills.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|\\"Avatar\\" is full of themes from the past (Man vs. Machine, Corporate America vs. Grassroot Interests and Romeo and Juliet). James Cameron uses \\"Avatar\\" as a means of integrating messages through breath taking cinematography.  Where many companies use \\"product integration\\" as a form of advertisement, Cameron uses \\"Political Integration\\" to advertise a salient message.    The most philosophically profound part of \\"Avatar\\" is when the hero is praying to God to deliver a victory to the \\"Blue people,\\" and the heroine tells him that the \\"Great Mother (God) does not take sides; she only protects the balance of life.\\"   This one statement reflects a truism of the real world and breaks the religious dogma of contemporary society. But, just as Cameron makes this critical proclamation, he recoils and backs up, pandering to the idea that good always triumphs over evil.  \\"Avatar\\" works because it does not \\"insist on itself.\\" Rather, it plays to the subconscious aspirations of most people by not upsetting the apple cart or being contrary.    For the sake of the formulaic Hollywood script of happy endings and the need for humans to avoid the ugliness of reality, \\"Avatar\\" is a hope-filled movie that suspends reality in two regards: 1. Advanced animation allows fantasy to appear real and 2. The story line asks viewers to accept a world where economic development and corporate interests can be overtaken by the proletariat. Whether this last statement is true and feasible is debatable.     Overall, \\"Avatar\\" is an entertaining movie although it panders to the low brow of society in hopes of moving the emotion without touching the psyche.

0307454541|2.0|After watching so many people reading Millennium Trilogy in the Paris metro for more than a year, I decided--while in New York--to buy the first volume of Stieg Larson's [[ASIN:B0015DROBO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] to check whether or not it was worth the hype. The book is definitely gripping: I started it yesterday late afternoon, read it till midnight and finished it tonight! I am nonetheless not completely impressed by the novel, nor do I understand the fundamental reason for its success (more than a million copies sold in France, where the three novels were apparently translated in 2006-2007, much earlier than in the US). The central mystery plot is a classical \\"huis-clos\\", with a murder being committed in a closed place with no obvious murderer and no corpse to show, the solution being rather predictable (because of the flowers) and anti-climactic. Some elements of the financial plot are highly unrealistic, like the school failure Lisbeth Salander speaking Oxford English and perfect German, and breaking in a few minutes into any computer of an off-shore bank account, or the major villain Wennerstr&ouml;m keeping all the informations about his criminal activities on a single hard-drive. The side inquiry about an unsuspected serial killer is more interesting (for a while) but again not very innovative compared with the rather large current literature on serial killers and female detectives (like Sara Paresky's [[ASIN:0399155937 V.I. Warshawski novels]]).... This is particularly striking since I read the book in English rather than in French and I did not find much differences in the style and more globally in the setting between The Girl with the dragon tattoo and current American detective stories like Paresky's or Comwell's [[ASIN:0399156399 Scarpetta novels]]. (Of course, some Swedish specificities pop up from time to time, but it could almost take place in northern Maine!) In that regard, the criticism of the Swedish social-liberal model is much more present in the older series by Maj Sj&ouml;wall and Per Wahl&ouml;&ouml;, e.g. [[ASIN:0307390500 The Laughing Policeman]]... At last, and in connection with the previous point, while the character of the autistic and unlikely investigator Lisbeth Salander is a fairly interesting creation, her vigilante attitude of implementing her own justice does not really fit within the moral higher grounds of her associate Mikael Blomkvist. Nor with the author's left-wing and non-violent positions. Nor with the feminist values of the Swedish society. Similarly, the brand name-dropping, especially for Apple products, is a bit at odds with the author's ideological principles. To be completely honest about this book, I must add that I will most likely read the two other volumes of the Millennium Trilogy when they appear in paperback, because they still make for an enjoyable one afternoon read but, again, nothing to rank it as the [Swedish [detective [techno-killer]]] novel of the century!nt in the older series by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, e.g. [[ASIN:0307390500 The Laughing Policeman]]...

1591843162|3.0|Seth Godin has mastered the skill of articulating and popularizing new business/productivity memes and getting it out there for the public to chew and mull on for months.  His latest book, \\"Linchpin\\" does that yet again by introducing the notion that to stay competitive and at the top of your workplace hierarchy no longer can we coast by on merely performing your day to day job as expected but rather becoming the 'linchpin' the person who brings passion and calculated risk taking that elevate their mundane duties into art.  All in all the message is simple and compelling and Godin does a great job of explaining the basic notions and principles on why its in your best interest of self preservation in the workforce to heed his advice.  As per Godin's style, the writing is easily digestible making for a rather quick read even at 244 pages.  What I would have liked more of, however, was more attention given to real-world case examples to strengthen his arguments and to better understand his principles in practice.  Godin scatters a few examples here and there but doesn't dig deeper into many of them.  If Godin's premise intrigues you this book is certainly worth your while.
B00005R24K|4.0|We thought this movie was pretty good for a low-budget horror flick.  It's really, REALLY scary!  The gore alone will give you nightmares.  There a lot of great suspense, too.  We've watched this one ten times.  The problem is sometimes the suspense is just dumb.  Let's say you're a hot young girl who happens not to be wearing pants.  You're alone in a spooky cabin and you here a noise.  What do you do?  You open the door, then walk into the dark forest all by yourself going \\"Is anybody there?\\" for like five miles until you're totally lost and then the evil possessed trees grab you and rape you violently.  Duh.  That's not scary, that's just duh.  Duh duh duh duh duh duh.  Bruce Campbell is freakin AWESOME, though, and overall I've gotta say this is solid zombie fare.

0783227434|5.0|\\"Shop smart! Shop... S-Mart.\\"  I think this movie is THE MOST ENTIRELY AWESOME ZOMBIE SPOOF FILM EVER MADE!  Ever!!!  We must have watched it 30 times.  I mean, Bruce Campbell is great looking but he's also a pretty good actor and he's definitely a great action star.  \\"Who wants some!  Huh?\\"  There are fight scenes and surprises and screaming gore in Army like nothing else in any other horror film, not even the Return series, which are hilarious and great but not quite as fun as this one.  So I'll leave you with one thought here.  \\"Yeah, I could have stayed in the past.  I could have even been King.  But my place is here.  Hail to the King, baby.\\"  YES!!!!!
B0012GMW3Y|5.0|There were hundreds of pale [[ASIN:B000002UAU Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] xeroxes after the Beatles brought brought out that album, and the notion that all things in rock were possible, in 1967. But only a band as great as the Byrds could properly ride on the fabs coat tails.<br /><br />And in a way, Nortorious Byrd Brother's is even more the surprise. The Beatles had been experimenting and expanding their reference frame from day one, and had added octane to the process on Revolver. The Byrds were the best American folk rock bands, and literally invented the concept of open breeze rock, based on a sharp chime guitar sound, and aural economy.<br /><br />Yet here is the album, full bore with diversity and maximum sound. \\"Artifical Energy,\\" is full royal horns that is head to head with the best chamber rock. It is also, almost, funky.\\"Goin' Back\\" is lush balladry for FM radio.  The eletro lab of \\"Draft Morning\\" deals with Vietnam, while Crosby's \\"Tribal Gathering,\\" with its bullet circular riff has the drive of rock and the challenging edge of jazz. Even a bonus track here, a moog experiment, shows how big the Byrds' ambition was beyond folk rock.<br /><br />It never happened, as rock went back to the roots, and the Byrds tore down musical and cultural lines with Rock and Roll's first pure country album,  [[ASIN:B000002AHB Sweetheart of the Rodeo]], a suicide move for any rock band in 1968, and one of the most brilliant coups in the music, ever.

B001J4E1D8|5.0|Tess of the d'Urbervilles one of the greatest love stories ever written, possibly surpassing Romeo and Juliette.     In Romeo and Juliette, the battle lines were well drawn, the Capulets against the Montagues, and Romeo and Juliette caught in the middle.     But, with Tess of the d'Urbevilles the battle lines are murky, they change, lovers against the world, lovers against each other, family against lovers, etc., etc.     This is a messy, complicated, wondrous mini-series in which you may think the protagonists, Tess and Angel, got what they deserved, but at the same time, no one deserves what they endured.     All of the leading actors were breathtakingly gorgeous. So if the mini-series goes a bit slow for you at times, you'll at least have eye candy to hold you over until the more dramatic scenes arrive, but there are very few slow spots. The tension is there from beginning to end.     Ignorance, discrimination and betrayal fuel this mini-series, but redemption, atonement and tears bring it to its tragic conclusion.     Enjoy and have your tissues at hand, you will need them.

B00012BSHG|5.0|My son has a sensory processing disorder.  We use this giant pool as a ball pit!  The bottom is inflatable, so it is AMAZING fun to bounce on!  The kids stand on the edge of the pool and jump in!  They climb up the side and jump in too!  We have filled the pool/pit with over 200 balls!  It is a big hit when his little buddies come over!  They all giggle and squeal with delight!  This keeps them occupied forever!  We did invest in a Disney cars ball pit, but he outgrew it when he turned 16mo and the dang thing was just not strong enough and would develop holes here and there.  So we purchased this pool instead and use as a ball pit and it is AWESOME! And at 30 some dollars it is way less expensive than any larger ball pit such as the LITTLE TYKES BOUNCER or the destructible INTEX BOUNCER.      HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

B002ZCY7PU|4.0|Having enjoyed the first two seasons of Chuck, I was concerned the writers would run out of original story ideas during season three. Though this seemed to happen during the first half of the season - drama between Chuck and Sarah is emphasized too heavily, lending several episodes a \\"haven't we seen this before\\" air - the third season is overall a lot of fun. Casey and Morgan in particular go through some interesting character development, which limits the annoyance of episodes when it's difficult not to hate the show's namesake.<br /><br />As with the first two seasons, season three contains plenty of exciting action and well-executed humor. There are some disappointing episodes, but if you enjoyed the first and second seasons of Chuck I would definitely recommend season three!

B00005BJXC|5.0|With the market pretty much flooded with documentaries on Pearl Harbor, I thought this would just rehash what many others had already done. Not to mention that there really isn't much new to add to what's already been known or seen on this subject. Along comes this release which covers the political, military and social conditions of both USA and Japan deeply yet not to the point of boredom. There was also a clip shown here that I hadn't seen before showing Battleship Row after the attack that was an interesting surprise.   The documentary is itself only about 2 hours with the extras clocking in at about 1. Those too are quite interesting. No credit is given I believe it's Dale Reed doing the narration, whose style I have always enjoyed.    If you're looking for an informative production on this subject, I would rate this one highly for consideration.

Because you begin to immediately reflect on what you have just read.

1416562591|5.0|Probably the most unusual and consistent experience I had reading White Tiger by Aravind Adiga was people engaging me when they noticed the title of the book I was reading. The comments always went something like \\"Isn't that a wonderful book?\\" I responded affirmatively because the plot was quite captivating and the content was surely of interest to me. I am not sure, however, that the Man Booker Prize this the book captured was totally deserved. The story is about a poor Indian peasant, Balram Halwai, a laborer from a small village finding a way to make it in the big city, in this case, Bangalore. He goes to work for one of powerful figures in his birth village, is treated decently (as a servant) and becomes a driver for the corrupt and controlling overlord, not an insignificant achievement.<br /><br />  Eventually, the protagonist decides he wishes to jump to the upper classes himself and that leads to quite a few interesting plot twists. There is an element of magical realism, a little bit of Bollywood drama, and a tad of social analysis all woven together toward a most unusual and unexpected climax. The writing is rather good throughout this book and one certainly can identify with characters seeking to move up a notch in the highly confined social setting in which the story takes place. It is no easy task making a place for oneself in the India described in these pages and a little playing with the edges of reality by Adiga is quite forgivable. I personally enjoy reading about and trying to understand contemporary India so my interest did not wane at all reading about the central character and his efforts to overcome his fate. The imaginative technique used to carry the story along was quite inventive and effective.<br /><br />Stanley C. Diamond, Author of What's an American Doing Here?: Reflectionsl on Travel in the Third World.

B00138CZAQ|2.0|I was never very impressed with this album. Gloria Estefan's voice is soft and laid back, pretty, and best suited for easy listening classics, like the ones sung by Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Vikki Carr and Eydie Gorme. Although she's Cuban, her singing isn't well-suited for Cuban music. Sorry Gloria, you'd sound better singing something smoother, calmer, where the listener isn't expecting a fiery, deeply passionate performance. Fire, that's it, that's what's missing in her voice.<br /><br />Cuban music = fire, passion. Mi Tierra = a brook.

B000000W5L|2.0|With much respect to the album (among my favorites) and without causing any offense to those who like the sound of the reissued disc---the sound is not so much to my liking. Heavily compressed, just like the other 2009 Stones remasters. I have done back-to-back comparisons of the 1994 Virgin remaster and this one with good equipment. The dynamics have been squeezed out, and I found myself reaching for the volume knob to turn the 2010 disc *down*--which is a real travesty for such a good-time rock record. Perhaps due to the compression and EQ choices, there seems to be a tad more detail, with more emphasis on the mid-range (this does bring out Mick's vocals quite well, as others have said), but to my ears, the sound is harsh and fatiguing and a tad lifeless. I do wish this album would have been treated as lovingly as the 2002 ABKO re-issues, which are mind-blowingly good. I cannot comment on the bonus tracks just yet.
B0037NCQEK|4.0|This is the fourth episode in the HBO adaptation of the popular Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels (the first episode is [[ASIN:B0037MNKDC Strange Love]], see my review there for the content description).<br /><br />This was a very good episode that likely was the one to finally \\"hooked\\" me on the series. As the body count starts to rise, and suspicion falling again on Jason (Sookie's brother), Sookie starts to look deeper into the vampire world.<br /><br />This series is not for everyone and definitely not for younger viewers!<br /><br />CFH

B0030T1NAO|5.0|I'm 44 yrs old, and I'm absolutely  drawn into this TV series.  Walt and Jesse are the classic baby boomer versus Gen X'ers.   The acting, casting, and writing is amazing.  The many twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Several times I've said, no way!  I can't believe that just happened.  Very edgy stuff.  I like the way the episodes are layered where they stand on their own, but have flashbacks and build upon earlier episodes. Very subtle hints are dropped along the way that make you want to go back and review the previous episodes.   This series has a Miami-vice like style and the music and preludes at the beginning are haunting especially the Negro y Azul episode.  The whole thing just works and keeps you hooked wanting to see what happens next.   The BluRay transfer has a bit of grain, but very sharp and contrast is good.  The extras and behind the scenes stuff is cool.  The only glitch I came across is that on Season 2 disc 3, it prompts you to insert disc 2 for some of the xtras. Doh!   This series is, like, the bomb, dude.  Like totally church and true that. A real keeper.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|It was okay; I read the book first and liked it better, but after watching this film the first time and waiting a while, I appreciated it more. I didn't like the character of Lord Melbourne and wonder how inaccurate much of his portrayal is. It did make me think about how corrupt politics are, though! Generally, this is an entertaining and enjoyable film and perhaps not to be taken TOO seriously.

B001S86J1C|4.0|This movie is an 80's classic. Great comedy mixed with a great cast. The Hi-Def transfer to Blu-ray is also a significant improvement over the DVD releases. The only missing ommission is the Commentary track that exists on the DVD version. Had I known this I wouldn't have bought the Blu-ray and held out for a re-release WITH the commentary. Either way, it's a great disc that does have some good extras on it.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie was spectacular!  I will watch over and over.  The effects are incredible. My husband and I both enjoyed the movie and we didn't have the 3D but it was still a wonderfully produced movie.  We're hoping for a sequel!
0486407217|4.0|I like how easy it is to draw out the patterns. The instructions are very basic (more detail might be needed for the less experienced like me). The only thing that bothered me is that I wanted some victorian bustle dresses. All these patterns are from the 1890s. Many have the big sleeves, which I am not fond of. I did find some dresses I want to make though. Also, I wish the yardage was given.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This was a great movie in the theaters, but the home version is just as good minus the 3D effects. Great sound quality and good imaging. I watch it over and over and see something different every time. Good morals for the children showing them how we must have a respect for nature and people who are different than us. Some violence with the destruction of the planet's forest hunting for precious material. Not for small children. Adults will love it.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I was very pleased to find the movie that I enjoyed so much in theaters available in this format, and especially on sale. The Blu-ray and DVD combo is great so there is no worry about having the correct format for a device and the slim, simple, and effecting way it was packaged worked wonderfully. Both disk look and sound great, so no complaints here!
B001NXDSLG|3.0|I just received my new super deluxe Blu-ray 40th Anniversary edition of this film.  The packaging is really nice.  But as for the video quality, I wish I had read more of the reviews here before I put down my money for this set.  It is definitely not high definition.  None of is is better than DVD video quality, and much of it looks no better than VHS.  If I had it to do over again, I'd get the DVD for the same video quality at a cheaper price.  Another thing to note:  the Amazon web page I was just at, says the aspect ratio is 1.77:1.  Not true.  This is more like 2.35.  There are black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.  That in itself is no big deal, as many pictures are shown in 2.35 aspect ration.  But it is misleading to say otherwise.  Anyway, save your money and go with the DVD set, or just stick with your old VHS.
B00005V9IL|4.0|A submarine with nuclear warheads sinks.  The closest people that could possibly rescue any survivors are the crew of a deep water oil rig.  The Navy sends over three SEALs to assist in the rescue.<br /><br />But a hurricane on the surface tears at the support ships, and tragedy erupts when a huge crane breaks off a tender ship and drags the underwater rig perilously close to a deep water trench.  The rig is leaking, and the oxygen supply is limited.<br /><br />And one of the SEALs begins to show the effects of nitrogen narcosis.  He begins to get paranoid that the Russians are going to capture the warheads.<br /><br />And then there are the mysterious lights, and water columns, and... submersibles? surrounding the stricken rig.<br /><br />The interactions and tensions of the crew (particularly between Ed Harris and Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are a real highlight.  They seem so real!  And Ed Harris' \\"purple hand\\" is an interesting symbol throughout of his marriage.  And the strategy for escape from the leaking submersible, to get back to the rig, is so racking!<br /><br />Michael Biehn, as the delusional/psychotic SEAL diver, is another great actor in this film... believable, scary, and capable.<br /><br />The Abyss counts as a sci-fi flick, because of the presence of aliens.  Honestly, I'm not sure they were even needed to make this a worthy film.  But there they are, and their ability to negate decompression sickness at the end was a bit underwhelming.<br /><br />Still, this was an exciting undersea adventure!
B0033EHL7U|5.0|I was hestitant to buy this album because I`m not really a huge fan of their S/T and \\"Screw It\\" albums, I always thought they were kinda weak compaired to other albums of the time. However my interest in this record was triggered by the fact that they got Robert Marcello on guitar, the same guy that was responsible for one of 2008`s greatest releases together with Frank Vestry [[ASIN:B0014GUA90 Marcello Vestry]] a truly amazing album and probably a future cult classic of the genre that proved that Robert can shred with the best of them. That and the fact that they got their original singer, Ted Poley, back in the lineup made me curious (even though he did sing on the aforementioned albums). So I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and now that I`ve listened to this album over and over I find that it keeps surprising me, I still discover a lot of songs that grow on me after I`ve played them again and again. And after all, isn`t that the best kind of album? The one where you uncover gems after listening to it time after time? When I first heard this album I thought there were only two or three memorable songs but now I know there`s a lot more. Still there are some of these songs that i don`t find as good as the others like \\"Beatiful Regret\\" and \\"Fugitive\\".<br />However that`s not to say that these songs are not good, they`re just not AS good as the rest of these songs.<br />Needless to say that all these songs are performed extremely well in every aspect from the great vocals to the neat guitars, the rocksolid foundation built by the bass and drums and the hum-friendly keyboard lines.<br /><br />Keep on keeping on:)<br />Cause this release is really THAT good.
0671688782|5.0|Holding Time is a valuable and fresh addition to the genre of childrearing help. Not only is it a first-hand account of Martha Welsh's own experince and practice of the method with her own son, but an endearing account and intimate aquantainance with them personally.<br /><br />I think Martha Welsh ranks with Maria Montessori in discovering the hidden needs and a precious resource in every child.<br /><br />I, too, have used this practice with my son, not as therapy for a problem, but to enrich our relationship. At 14, he's still a devoted and affectionate boy who is a delight to raise.<br /><br />In my work with young children, I see many who could directly benefit from Holding, and some who despirately need it. So I often recommend Holding Time to parents.
1400052173|4.0|I found this book to be well researched and well written. Ms. Skloot takes a subject that could be boring, cell culturing, and makes it interesting. She writes the scientific stuff in a way that is easy to understand. I also liked reading about Henrietta Lack's background and about her family.Before this book I had no idea such a thing as He La cells existed.
6305841861|5.0|One of the funniest movies of all time.  So many great and fun moments are packed into this movie. The hand and chainsaw moments are hilarious!  The redneck Jake strong-arming everyone is killer funny. Lots of over-the-top gory action. You'll be laughing from start to finish.  Great to watch with a group of friends.  That will guarantee a fun night!  Can't miss with this movie.
B00005JKMQ|5.0|Movie was good.  Will Smith did a pretty good portrayal of Muhammed Ali.  However, he didn't walk like Ali. He should have been taught the way Ali walked. But that aside, I still enjoyed the movie.  Thank you.

B00005UKE0|5.0|I am glad to have found this CD. I have the album and wanted it on CD. Shipping was fast and it was in good condition. The only problems is when I play it on media player and the song titles on disk two come up in chinese or japanese with no way of changing it.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Although it takes an extremely long time for the Blu-Ray disc to be read and then for the playback to start, once it does, the HD visual detail is just amazing. I will admit had I realized that this was a combo set I would not have purchased it, as I only needed the Blu-Ray and not the DVD. However, I am still very satisfied with this combo-cd purchase.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I enjoyed bits and pieces of this mini-series and from my readings of E.B. Sledge and historians of the Pacific battles I thought it accurately portrayed the combat experiences of the Marines in that theater.  I found the brief strategic overviews narrarated by Hanks before each episode to be helpful, and I thought the combat scenes and the portrayal of the Marines' misery was well done, but on the whole I found the mini-series unsettling in a number of ways and I don't think I'd watch it again.    Most importantly, I feel the format of the series was disconnected.  In attempting to weave together the stories of three Marines who weren't necessarily fighting shoulder-to-shoulder, we get glimpses of each Marine and are then moved on to the next one.  The effect this had on me was such that I'd begin to care about one of them but would then be quickly shifted away to the next one.  So I found I really didn't care about any of the characters until E.B. Sledge heads off to combat, which is several episodes in.  Since I'd read his excellent book I'd already had an interest in seeing his story played out on screen, but when the story moved from Sledge and back to the States for a Basilone episode I found myself a little annoyed.  (To be fair the creators were moving through episodes chronologically so by default something like this is bound to happen, but in my opinion it did more to hurt the flow than help it.)    Compounding this I felt a number of the episodes really slowed the tempo of the series down (e.g., the leave in Australia episode, the Leckie convalescing episode, and most of the Basilone falling in love episode).  Here again we'd be thrust into one situation (intense combat) then rapidly shifted to an entirely different one (frolicking with Australian women), or vice versa.  I understand that the creators wanted to portray the experiences of these specific men, but just as I started to really feel cohesion amongst the fighting men in the jungles or beaches, we'd be thrown back into these individualized stories, which, again, I had trouble caring about.  Additionally, I think this format led to stilted dialogue since the characters themselves could never really find their groove within the series.  I often found myself tuning out of conversations because I just wasn't invested.    If one were to insist on comparing this series with 'Band of Brothers' I would say that 'The Pacific' lacked the cohesion of that series - mainly for the reason that in 'Band of Brothers' we followed one unit from the beginning of their war to the end of their war, which was geographically confined to a relatively small Europe; whereas in 'The Pacific' we more followed individual men across locations which were often separated by thousands of miles of ocean.  This geographic separation coupled with the constantly shifting protagonists/backdrops really threw me for a loop.    Finally, I am no wilting flower but parts of the series were about as grim as war movies get.  This is by no means a knock on the series - as I believe these scenes were accurately portrayed as the men wrote them - but it added to my general sense of discomfort.  I have only sympathy for the men who were asked to fight in those horrendous conditions, and to see this fighting portrayed on screen was powerful indeed.  I'm glad the creators undertook this effort to honor these men, and I'm glad I watched the series once to gain an appreciation of the veterans who fought in the Pacific; but mostly because of the cohesion issues mentioned above I'm not sure I'd want to view the series again.
B002XTBEDI|3.0|This sequel to the original \\"Cranford\\"screams -hastily put together and suffers from the sort of sequel problems we have seen in so many movies over the years. As previous writers have commented, storylines are weak and at times quite silly, too many new characters -none very interesting. Still, anything with Judi Dench and her staunch band of women cant be all bad and young Alex Edel is a real star in the making and has a more mature and important role here. But if they were going to return, more time should have been spent on  script.

B000002GVO|5.0|The Eagles have never been able to top Hotel California.  The record was a diamond(ten times platinum) seller, a Grammy Award winner, and the first--and so far only--Eagles album to produce two #1 pop hits:  \\"New Kid In Town\\" and the title track \\"Hotel California\\" were this record's #1 hits.  The album was also the first Eagles record to feature Joe Walsh as a member along with Don Henley, Don Felder, Glenn Frey and Randy Meisner.  Joe, who replaced Bernie Leadon, is brilliant on both guitar and keyboard, and this record features some excellent work by him on both instruments.  Though I think Desperado is the Eagles' best overall record, Hotel California comes awfully close.<br /><br />Quick synopsis of the title track:  A guy driving in the desert finds a place to spend the night.  He's not sure where he is(\\"This could be heaven or...hell,\\" Don Henley sings).  He gets a warm greeting from his hosts(\\"Welcome to the Hotel California\\") and orders wine, only to be told, \\"We haven't had that spirit here since 1969.\\"  In the end, our hero discovers that Hotel California is not what he thinks it is and tries to escape, but the night clerk tells him, \\"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\\"  And then Don Felder and Joe Walsh chime in with their dueling lead guitars.  \\"Hotel California\\" to this day remains a classic, with its great story and awesome musicianship.  \\"New Kid In Town\\", the other #1 hit off this album, is a throwback to the Eagles' early country-rock days, with Glenn Frey singing lead and Don Felder's lead guitar sounding a little mellower than it does on \\"Hotel California\\".  \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\", Hotel California's third hit song and the only Eagles hit song featuring Joe Walsh as a co-writer, is self-explanatory.  \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\", with Joe getting in some great guitar licks, is a perfect description of the fast-paced, drug-and-booze-laced Southern California lifestyle:  \\"They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills\\" and \\"Life in the fast lane surely makes you lose your mind,\\" sings Don Henley.  \\"Wasted Time\\" is a tender ballad about lost love, life on the street, and the passage of time.  The \\"Wasted Time\\" reprise leads into \\"Victim Of Love\\", another rocker featuring Joe's terrific lead guitar work.  Joe, whose biggest non-Eagles hits--\\"Funk #49\\", \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Life's Been Good\\", and \\"All Night Long\\"--were all rockers, contributes a great ballad, \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\", to Hotel California.  Randy Meisner's career as an Eagle ended with this album; he left the Eagles in '77, a year after Hotel California's original release.  Randy's contribution to the record, \\"Try And Love Again\\", doesn't quite match up to his best Eagles songs:  \\"Certain Kind Of Fool\\", \\"Too Many Hands\\" and the hit \\"Take It To The Limit\\".  Still, it's a pretty solid number.  \\"The Last Resort\\" tells about the massive migration to Southern California in the '50s and '60s, and Don Henley even gets in a jab at the religious hypocrisy he saw going on:  \\"You can see them there on Sunday morning/Stand up and sing about what it's like up there/They called it paradise and I don't know why/You call someplace paradise/Kiss it goodbye.\\"<br /><br />With Hotel California, I think the Eagles reached their peak.  Although the album is a brilliant record, with Joe Walsh's ascension the band became dominated by two members:  Joe and Don Henley.  The band's earlier records were a team effort, but on Hotel California, Don H. sings lead on most of the tracks, and Joe plays guitar and/or keyboard on nearly all the songs.  Those two guys, Joe and Don H., are great singers and musicians, but their practically dominating the vocals and musicianship made the Eagles less of a team.  Still, Hotel California is the Eagles' high point.  Even with the records they've released since reuniting after a long hiatus--Hell Freezes Over and Long Road Out Of Eden--the Eagles haven't topped Hotel California.pills\\" and \\"Life in the fast lane surely makes you lose your mind,\\" sings Don Henley.  \\"Wasted Time\\" is a tender ballad about lost love, life on the street, and the passage of time.

B002DYKP88|5.0|I love this movie.  This one of the best foreign films I've seen.  Touches my heart, great story, and great cast.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Although she mostly associates herself with punk/goth friends she is like a stray cat never allowing people to close to her life. During the course of the book both characters are forced to work together to solve the mystery disappearance of sixteen year old Harriet Vangar who was last seen at a family gathering 30 years ago. During the course of the novel other tragic events shape Blomkvist and Salander's lives which eventually sets up the plot for the next two books in the series. I am not a fan of crime/mystery or financial novels however Larsson does a great job in incorporating all theses facets without making the story dull. I urge all new readers to read the book it will take time but after you have read the book once read it again and you will appreciate the beauty that this story is and the new tales that will are told in the next set of books of this series. Before I started reading Stieg Larson's infamous Millennium series \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" I started with its second book the \\"The Girl that played with Fire\\" upon reading the first 50 pages I was so captivated with the novels main protagonists Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomvkist that I stopped reading the book and decided to read the first novel and I am extremely happy with my choice. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is an excellent work of literature where the author pens the dramatic events of the Vangar Tragedy and brilliantly introduces Lisbeth and Mikael two characters with different ideas and behaviors. Mikael Blomkvist instantly charms the reader with his wit, brilliance, and of course prowess with the ladies. Lisbeth Salander on the other hand is a social misfit and can best described as brilliant computer hacker with a terrible taste in music and wardrobe.
0805083367|5.0|This book was purchased for my three year old greatgrandson.  When he came to see us the first thing he asked for was read Baby Bear.  So I got him his own copy.  He still loves it, as did his older cousin. She is four and I have a picture of her with her cousin on her lap reading (memory) Baby Bear to him. I think it maintains it's appeal for the older children (four years) because they can memorize it and feel like they are reading themselves. This is a great book for two to four year olds and appeals to both boys and girls.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|This is a classic case of don`t believe everything you see on film! While Moore is right to lay into the corporations, I don`t believe he knows what capitalism is: that it`s not an idea, but a system of society that has evolved in history. But what really and finally made me turn off with revulsion was his sickening praise of Salk the vivisector and blender of monkeys` kidneys. The viewer is left with the notion that Salk was a sainted and selfless benefactor of humanity and that vivisection, instead of being part and parcel of the exploitative capitalist system (claiming easy government money for its perpetrators: patents or not!) is a worthwhile, beneficial and useful activity! Sod the monkeys, and any other animals who need be \\"sacrificed\\"! The truth about the polio vaccine is given in Hans Ruesch`s SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENT, but Moore hasn`t researched this, and neither will his viewers bother to, and are thus left none the wiser. Highly irresponsible and callous!    [[ASIN:0961001607 Slaughter of the innocent]]
141041986X|1.0|When my librarian suggested this book to me, I was immediately suspicious of the plot. And 'The Hunger Games' was, just as I'd thought, a bad attempt at copying Koushun Takami's 'Battle Royale' and William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies,' to some extent. Though a number of reviewers have already pointed this out, I thought it necessary to add my voice to those of the outraged... This book does not deserve its 5-Star originality reviews! Read the aforementioned two books instead; they'll leave you with deeper impressions!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Unlike many new Black Keys fans I was not turned on to this band from their last album Attack and Release rather I was almost turned away. I first heard them in 'Rubber Factory' and consider their debut album to be gospel. I'm a hard core blues rock fan so the unnedded bells and whistles added on by Danger Mouse left me with a sour taste in my mouth two years ago.    Luckily, what I hoped for in their next album 'Brothers' has happened, and then some, alot some. TBK aside from one song got away from Danger Mouse and got back to producing their own songs. This album starts with a beat and falsetto voice that I've never heard from these guys before but it works beautifully and it hooks you into the album immediately. The next few songs are all great riff work from Auerbach accumulating with She's Long Gone. A fuzzy and properly named instrumental 'Black Mud' caps what I see as the first 3rd of the album.      In the middle of the album the audience gets a taste of TBKs side projects of late. R&B beats and blues lyrics are in perfect unison on 'Ten Cen Pistol'. My personal favorite 'Sinister Kid' features two slide guitar pieces, nice back up vocals, and fun lyrics.      Finally TBK finshes their album off with great song writing. 'Unknown Brother' has me singing along and thinking about the lyrics everytime I hear it. 'These Days' is typical slow but heavy TBK. Mixed in between the two songs is TBK's best cover work since Chulahoma with 'Never Gonna Give You Up'.       After listening to this album several times I believe TBK deserves major major props for this album. It's funky blues, R&B, and soul all mixed together with some nasty blues guitar. I love it!
B001NLKT60|3.0|Girl with a Dragon Tattoo was my favorite book of 2009 so it is fair to say that this book had a lot to live up to.  Unfortunately, I do not think The Girl who Played with Fire met the same standard of excellence.<br />In the 2nd installment to the Millenium Trilogy notable characters from the first book (Lisbeth, Mikael, Erika, etc.) combine with a slew new characters introduced in this book to create a story that ultimately has WAY too many characters.  There wasn't a single time when I picked up this book that I didn't have to back track quite a bit to remind myself who was who.  It got old and what made it even more difficult was the fact that a lot of new characters were indistinguishable in personality and back story but everyone had a particularly difficult Swedish name.  (An occasional \\"Lars Nelson\\" would've been a welcome reprieve in the memory game)<br />The other problem is that this book has a lot of lose ends that go unaddressed as well as side stories that ultimately lead to nothing.  What I loved about the first book is that every single component to the story, no matter how far fetched, had some level of closure by the end.  The same level of satisfaction was not to be found here.  In fact, the ending is so abrupt I thought my kindle had broken or not downloaded the rest of the story.  Very strange.<br />Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars<br />Suggested With: Pen, Paper, and Patience.
B002VWONB2|5.0|The Hollywood studio system has been much maligned. Stanley Kubrick moved to England to evade it and Robert Altman totally ignored it. But as Roger Ebert points out in his excellent commentary, Casablanca shows what that system could accomplish. Warner Brothers was cranking out a new film every week in 1941. Casablanca was filmed on a Hollywood back lot, but the presence of so many Europeans in Hollywood fleeing the Nazis who appear in Casablanca makes the film look like it was filmed in North Africa.<br />Michael Curtiz was the director of the film, but Ebert points out that the producer Hal B. Wallis was responsible for the final product. Script revisions came out daily. Ingrid Bergman was unable to shoot new scenes because her hair had been cut for her next Warner Brothers film.<br />Somehow Wallis and his team came up with a masterpiece.

While I disagree with some of his methods (e.g. leverage), and recognize that the era when he was doing some of his activies really matter, this book belongs on the shelf of those who want to improve their financial postion.
0385335997|5.0|This, like Dragonfly in Amber the second book, was fantastic. It continued a great storyline and provided plenty of action and adventure, and that ever steady romance between Jamie and Claire.<br /><br />A larger book, it covers quite a bit of ground in the story of Jamie and Claire's relationship.  It starts where Dragonfly in Amber leaves off, with Claire still in the 20th century with her daughter Brianna.  They are searching through the history books to see what became of Jamie Fraser, Claire's husband from the 18th century.  When at last they find him, Claire must make the decision on whether she will go back in time to seek him out, or stay in the present with her daughter.<br /><br />Persuaded by her daughter to go to him.  She prepares for her journey back in time and once again steps through the stones.  Back in the past, she rather quickly finds Jamie and starts on a whole series of misfortunes and adventures starting with the burning down of Jamie's print shop and an unsuccessful smuggling attempt to bring in alcohol.  Forced to flee the city, they return to Jamie's home in Lallybroch.<br /><br />Lallybroch isn't too peaceful however, as Claire learns that in her 20 year absence, Jamie has married again.  And not only has he married, but it was to a woman who tried to kill her in the first book.  A settlement is reached and Jamie, not having the funds to pay off Laoghaire (the 2nd wife) takes his young nephew to obtain some jewels that are buried off the coast.  However, before his nephew Ian can get back to them, he is abducted by pirates.<br /><br />Because of this, and a promise to Jamie's sister to keep her son safe, they head for the Caribbean.  Beset by the British Navy and many other foes, reaching the Caribbean is not easy for them and they are separated numerous times along the way.  When they finally reach the islands it still stays dangerous in their quest to save Ian.<br /><br />Like the other books, this one is mainly written from Claire's point of view.  It retains the rich descriptions and wordiness that Gabaldon is known for but the length of the book does not detract from the enjoyability of it.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that we are reintroduced to a character that was presumably dead in the first novel, but has come back and changed drastically.  While Gabaldon gives a plausible explanation to this change, it still seems out of place and a bit unbelievable.<br /><br />The 3rd book in the series, Voyager, is a great read.  However, the first two books should be read before it; this is not a stand-alone read.<br /><br />Voyager<br />Copyright 1994<br />870 pagesriptions and wordiness that Gabaldon is known for but the length of the book does not detract from the enjoyability of it.

B000FC11A6|5.0|A great work of modern literature by a great modern writer. Neal Stephenson is able to create a submersive universe not far from our own. His books are a thinking geeks dream come true. Intricately woven modern drama linking the past, present and perhaps the future. Cryptonomicon sweeps us through time from World War 2 science and fighting through the modern, international reach of commerce of the internet. Intriguing, spellbinding and all to plausible. Neal Stephenson's works are a treat for the intellect; engaging, thought provoking and emmensely entertaning. Once you read Cryptonomicon you will need to read everything else Neal Stephenson has and will write!
B002QH2NUA|4.0|Paul McCartney, as always at his best. Sound is terrific, images excellent, many songs not included in previous DVD (Memory almost Full an Fireman songs). It´s a must for every Macca fans, specially those who wants only full performance and not back stages, fans or documentary material. This is the main difference between GENYC an previous releases: full concert, and no additional stuff.  Even without that, you can feell the magic in the audience. Only a monster artists like Paul is capable to deliver.
B002ZG99D6|5.0|I personally thought the movie was well done by all the cast.  It comes out on dvd August 17th!
B003AO1SVS|2.0|I rarely write reviews, but this was warranted. I'm disappointed in this album. Very.    I've been a Black Keys fan for years. The raw energy of their music is amazing.  All albums up to the 1/2 half of 'Attack & Release' are fantastic (the 'Release' half, not so much).  I was really hoping for a high-intensity rebound of the dour sound of the last record.  Boy, what a let down.    Brothers should be called Red Headed Step Brothers or something.  Pat's drumming could easily be replaced by a drum machine. The tracks are uninspired and just don't have the riffs or emotion that make previous albums so powerful.    This record sounds tired and dull.  If this was their debut album, their fan base would be MUCH different than it is today. If you're a big fan of the early work, where two guys grind out massive raw blues sound on a basement 4 track, you're better off skipping this and buying an album by The Blackwater Fever.    Rant over...
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband. I really had no intentions of watching it as the previews did not really give me any interest. He convinced me to watch it with him, and boy I am glad I did. This truly is an amazing movie and I am hoping they make another. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|A lot of people are going to debate back and forth about this finale, the final year and whether or not it turns this elaborate performance piece into a show worth it's place in the history of great storytelling or a complete waste of time.  Were enough questions answered?  Did we find out everything we need to know?  Why was Walt so important?  Where did the Dharma pallets keep coming from?  Who was Libbie's husband and how did he die?  Why was she in the mental institution?    Who cares?  Although the mysteries were tantalizing, Lost wasn't merely a show about devises and red herrings.  It was about people.  The Variables.  How they affect us and how they change everything that we thought our life should be.  It was about destiny and free will and how the two are not exclusive.  It's about how a world is only worth saving if there is love within it.  Though the story is told through Jack Shephard's rise, fall and redemption, it is truly a tale of community.  And it is only with that community that we are really able to transcend ourselves too an enlightenment none of us could ever know alone.  It is only with each other that Jack and Locke become one full man.  With each other Sawyer and Juliet are able to lower their armor.  Hurley and Ben protect the island.  Claire and Kate raise Aaron.  The characters and their enlightenment was the focus of the writers, actors and all involved.  That is what made Lost great.  That is what made the mysteries so compelling.  And that Is why i will often revisit this show.  It was a gift.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is the best ever next to Star Wars which is pretty darn awsome. Who would have ever thought about this? Riordan has an imagination just like George Lucas ( the inventor of Star Wars) that is a fountain of creativity.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Janelle Monáe is a name known by few, but not for long.  The ArchAndroid is an unbelievably solid album, not one of the 18 tracks are used as a \\"filler\\" track.  Monáe explores r&b, soul, funk, pop and rock with a fresh and unique take.  To say The ArchAndroid is a good album is an understatement.  This will surely become a classic.

0312370849|4.0|\\"Sarah's Key,\\" by Tatiana de Rosnay, is the heartrending fictional account of a disgraceful episode in French history.  In July of 1942, more than six thousand French policemen who were in league with their Nazi occupiers, rounded up 13,152 Jews (including over four thousand children) and brought them to the V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver (an indoor stadium where bicycle races had once taken place) before sending them off first to local camps and later to Auschwitz to be gassed. \\"In the end, France sent nearly eighty thousand Jews to the death camps.\\"  One of the detainees brought to the V&eacute;lodrome with her parents is ten-year-old Sarah Starzynski, a bright and sensitive little girl who, before she learns the bitter truth, consoles herself with the fantasy that her family will go home shortly.  She has a very important reason for wanting to get back to Paris as quickly as possible.  However, as the days pass with no indication that her captors will set her free, Sarah becomes increasingly desperate to escape.<br /><br />In 2002, Julia Jarmond (the first person narrator), is forty-five.  She is an American from Massachusetts who lives in Paris with her \\"impossibly attractive\\" but aggressive and controlling husband, forty-seven year old Bertrand T&eacute;zac, and their precocious eleven-year-old daughter, Zoe.  Julia is assigned to write about the sixtieth anniversary of the 1942 tragedy for a weekly magazine \\"Seine Scenes.\\"  Although she has lived in France for twenty-five years, fifteen of those married to Bertrand, Julia had known very little about the tragic fate of the French Jews.  She is sickened to learn that non-Jewish men and women, who had once been the friends and neighbors of the Jews, either looked the other way or enthusiastically collaborated with their Nazi occupiers.  Later, Jarmond discovers a personal link with the Starzynski family that will change her life profoundly.  As Julia says, \\"It awakened a vulnerability within me, triggered something deep, unspoken, that haunted me....\\"<br /><br />The brief and starkly written chapters in which Sarah narrates her experiences are excruciatingly painful.  Rosnay depicts an innocent child's confusion and terror when she suspects that she and her fellow Jews are being sent to their deaths.  Rosnay is less successful when she describes Julia's inner torment and conflicts with her husband.  Bertrand is a stock character--a self-absorbed and arrogant bully whom it is all too easy to loathe.  In fact, it is difficult to understand why Julia has put up with him all of these years.  As the book progresses, the author introduces other unlikely plot twists that enable her to hammer home her theme repeatedly.  Bertrand smugly declares, \\"Nobody cares anymore.  Nobody remembers.\\"  He is wrong.  The descendants of the millions of Jews who died in France and across Europe as well as righteous people of all religions and races most certainly do care and  remember.  \\"Sarah's Key\\" is moving and enlightening, but it would have been even more effective had the story been more a bit more subtle, understated, and nuanced.me....\\"    The brief and starkly written chapters in which Sarah narrates her experiences are excruciatingly painful.

B00005JKC3|5.0|I have seen both the Eric Bana and the Edward Norton \\"Hulks,\\" and I like both, but I like the Bana version better.    The Bana version is darker, slower, more psychological, and the computer graphics (the backgrounds, fades, etc., but not the Hulk himself) are very psychedelic and very interesting.    The Bana version ends where the Norton version begins.    The general in Bana is a much more complex and interesting character, and so is the Connelly character (Liv Tyler in Norton).    In both, the graphics of the super-heroes are LAME.    But I don't care.    I would rather see a movie with an interesting plot and interesting characters than an interesting CG giant.    I will say for the Norton version, however, that the long sequences at the beginning, in Brazil, are by far the best part of that one.

0307387151|3.0|At first, I was very intrigued by this book.  Briony was an interesting character, which initially drew me in.  One of my favorite parts was when Briony was so angry with Lola and the twins, she imagines she is in a different world where she rules all.  That is what I love the most about Briony! She fantasizes many events in this novel, which make it even more interesting to read!  I also enjoyed the part after Briony's birthday party. She tells the reader that Robbie and Cecilia never ended up together.  It throws a twist of the novel I never expected.  I really love when the author does that and I thought Ian McEwan did a great job of that!    Although when reading Part II: Robbie's point of view in the war, I was bored. I usually read before I go to bed, so when I would read this novel I would have a hard time of not falling asleep.  The only parts I liked in Part II were when he mentioned Cecilia. An example would be when he remembers their first meeting after his years in prison.  Also when Cecilia writes to him that she will wait for him and she loves him.  That makes Robbie want to live.  The love between Cecilia and Robbie was pretty amusing, but overall Part II was not.      I did like the book.  I just wish the middle would have been more fascinating to read.  I was expecting Cecilia and Robbie's love connection to be told a little bit more.  I'm a sucker for romance novels.    NW   AP Lit 3A
