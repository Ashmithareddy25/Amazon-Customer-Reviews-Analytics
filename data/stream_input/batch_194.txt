B00005LOUP|5.0|This is a wonderfully made movie. The town of Whoville is amazing. It looks like it came right out of the book. I really loved the way they gave background on how the Grinch became the way he is. Baby Grinch is adorable. This movie is also geered for the young as well as old-everyone will enjoy it.
B00003CY0V|3.0|This movie started great with a scene that I felt was better than &quot;bullet time&quot; from The Matrix but slowly went bad from there. I wanted to like it, I really did but Jackman as the hacker wasn't realistic and Berry was just cute eye candy. Rent this movie for the opening sequence (even better than motorcycle scene from The One)and the alternate endings but save your money for the sequel of The Matrix, The Matrix: Reloaded, due out May 2003.
B00005QCVT|5.0|I could say a lot about this film, but I'm going to keep it as short as possible.<BR>This film leapt straight into my top 3 films of all time the first time I saw it.<BR>There are parts of it that were almost hard to watch, and I did so with a sensation that I'd feel better when it was all over, without actually wanting it to be over.<BR>There is no doubt in my mind that Ellen Burstyn should have walked away with the Oscar (Best Actress). She gave possibly THE best acting performance I have had the pleasure to see.<br />Watch this movie. You will find yourself thinking about it for days afterwards.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira has done it again! This CD rocks. The songs are a mixture of all kinds of music. It is so cool. The lyrics are written so well, the music is great for dancing. It is a really great CD. I reccomend it to everyone.
B00003CXFG|1.0|Oh dear, what can I say about this. If you want completely derivative and contrived plots coupled with predictable script and story, then this is the film for you. <BR>Imagine the scene - a ship crashes on a planet, which is dark only once in 22 years. Guess when they crash, yup - the day before it all gets dark. <BR>Also - there are nasty aliens which are all predators, and apparently no other life (so what do the predators live on before the tasty humans turn up). The aliens only come out to play in the dark, by the way.<BR>To top it all off, once it goes dark, the humans have a psychotic criminal, who just happens to be getting transported on their ship. And guess what - he can see in the dark. Now wasn't that lucky. <BR>Predictable, poorly acted and the script gave me the impression that the 'actors' were making it up as they went along at times. A few special effects does not a sci-fi movie make. I wish someone would tell the film-makers.
B00005QK3W|4.0|In a nutshell: a truly great album: one that will only get better with age. I don't believe what's happened, 'cos on Driving Rain Paul really gets the blues! <br />Buy it and be one of the ones who know :) <br />First off, I am not a long-time fan. I actually stopped buying P. McC's music a very long time ago (even though, as a bass guitarist, I've always respected his playing!) The Beatles are one of my favourite bands, and I liked some of Paul's early post-Beatle stuff. The things he did with Elvis Costello are very good. I even count seeing him in 1976 as a great concert memory. But his albums--all of them, even the ones I endure for sentimental reasons like RAM--just haven't been that good as albums. <br />There *have* been songs here and there that had flashes of brilliance--but even those were mostly unfinished, musically speaking. On the whole, the album songs were mostly filler.<br />Even as I write this I know this is too broad generalization of 30 years of music--there's a good compilation CD or two in there, for sure. Let's just say, however, that Paul hasn't lived up to being, well, Paul McCartney, and that a host of other bands (like Oasis or even Green Day) has taken the Beatles' pop legacy a lot farther than Sir Paul. <br />The only reason, in fact, that I bought Driving Rain was that I'd heard Run Devil Run, Paul's most recent album, and a good one, too. But that album was covers of well-loved songs. Well-performed? Sure they were--surprisingly well, in fact! The original tunes were pretty weak, though.  <br />But Run Devil Run had a sound, a feel about it, that was the opposite of McCartney's other albums. It really did rock! So--with a sense of throwing my money away--I bought Driving Rain out of curiosity more than anything else. <br />I listened to it more than a few times, and I really couldn't believe it--this is a great album! Not mediocre, not middling, and definitely not a typical McCartney album! <br />The songs--most of which are deeply rooted in the blues and jazz--go right back to the roots of pop. Perhaps that's why a lot of McCartney's fans here have been upset with the improvisation, vocal rawness and repetition on this album; he hasn't done that since the Beatles (remember &quot;She's A Woman&quot;?) And no, &quot;Monkberry Moon Delight&quot; doesn't count as Blues. Listen to Paul's howl in  &quot;Lonely Road&quot;--really most of the song, fortunately--and you'll hear the difference from &quot;No More Lonely Nights&quot;!<br />In any case, we all know *how* Paul got the blues; but the man's genius really takes hold here. He takes the sad songs and makes them better. <br />Are there losers on this album? One, in particular, &quot;Spinning on Axis&quot; doesn't work for me at all, and I'm not completely sold on &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, which is pretty lightweight--though its simple lyrics and Beatle-esque production don't bother me. <br />The other songs *aren't* Beatle- inspired (despite a few deliberate musical &quot;quotes&quot;), and aren't recognizable as post-Beatle McCartney stuff either. As others have pointed out, though, the Beatles' legacy shines at long last in Paul's overdue return as virtuoso bass guitarist and vocalist. And wonder of wonders: the songs aren't fluffy here either--even when you think they're going to be. And even though there's an intentionally weird lyric here and there, more often than not the lyrics here *do* make a rough poetic sense. Not always, but then a lot of pop lyrics don't make sense apart from music, and there's no embarrassing Wing-y things like, well, anything from Wings. You pick :)<br />Even the songs that should be sappy aren't. Listen again to &quot;I Do&quot;, which really tells about the transience of love, and the permanence of love lost. Bittersweet, not sickly sweet. And &quot;Riding to Jaipur&quot; might be Harrison-inspired, but McCartney went to India too, you know; the song actually sounds more like XTC than Harrison. It's a great pop composition in an Indian vein, instead of being an Indian song with pop pretensions. <br />Most of the rest of the songs are terrific, except for Freedom, which doesn't really belong here. Not that it isn't catchy (one play and you're good for a week:) ), or uplifting, or honestly meaningful. But Freedom is also appropriately different, in a  simpler, more stately groove than the rest of the songs. <br />The rest? They really are more complex and emotionally darker than Freedom, too. Even &quot;Heather's&quot; exuberance, and the simple relief in &quot;Back in the Sunshine Again&quot; have their double impulses--let alone &quot;Lonely Road&quot; or &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot;, which speak directly about personal loss. <br />But even in these songs, it's the blues / jazz influence / improvisation that really makes them exuberant standouts from most of McCartney's solo catalog. &quot;Your Way&quot; is a true gem of a song--almost perfect in the interplay of harmony and rhythm--and McCartney makes that one seem simple. Wow. <br />So: 11 great songs out of 15! If you liked Venus and Mars, or Flowers in the Dirt, or Flaming Pie, or if you think that &quot;My Love&quot; is the apogee of McCartney's solo career, you probably won't like Driving Rain. <br />But if you like well-crafted pop; if, say, you've been listening to Weezer lately, you should definitely give this a spin.
0679879269|4.0|It was so sad. ..  i must admit. I was moved to tears at the last scenes of this book. It was a thrilling read but I thought that the series was getting a little boring towards the end. Perhaps I was out of the mood because it had been such a long time since I had read the previous two books. Neverhteless, it was a good read. Some parts seemed to drag on forever. But hey if you have read the first two books... definately definately finish off the series and find out the conclusion. Well written.
0671027344|5.0|This is my favorite book. It's really awesome, so read it, NOW! That's all that must be said.
B00005Q4GA|3.0|While this movie wasn't the most horrible movie I've ever seen, the plotline was pretty weak in my opinion. I don't think that the characters were properly developed. All that was focused upon for the most part was making this movie hot and thrilling with fight scenes and jumping music. Angelina Jolie is running around everywhere with little skimpy outfits and she has a constant &quot;I'm so sexy&quot; look on her face while she's running around with her guns and hanging from chandeliers. Really don't see this movie unless you are into the new trend of 'Girl kick butt' movies that Hollywood seems to be producing nowadays.
B00004Z400|5.0|This is a very nice cd... a bit softer than their other stuff, but really good to listen to if you're upset about something. Knife Prty is one of my favorite songs, and Passenger is good too. I STRONGLY recommend buying this cd.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Once again, John Williams has written a wonderful soundtrack to a popular movie, reminiscent of the days of Jaws and Back to the Future. The prologue isn't as catchy as the themes of E.T. or Superman, but it still fits the mysterious theme of Harry Potter. Later in the soundtrack (especially in the &quot;Quidditch Match&quot; composition), the music gets a little happier, and some even reminded me of Star Wars. There is a nice (and somewhat dissonant) violin solo in the 5th track, during Harry's exploration of Diagon Alley. There are many other soundtracks that make this one somewhat obscure, but it should sell very well given that it is for a very popular movie.<BR>After I saw the movie, I wasn't particularly entertained by the actual movie (being long and tedious), but listened to the Williams soundtrack in the movie intently. If you like this group of compositions, all of the other John Williams pieces I mentioned should also please you.
0553296981|5.0|I have read Anne Frank six times and it gets better each time I read it.  It's such a great story and the fact that it's the real diary of a girl makes it even more amazing.  Anne was a talented girl and alot of girls could probably relate to the things Anne writes about like her first love, ever-changing crushes, and her family.  I would recommend this book to anyone old enough to understand it's depth and meaning....have fun reading the best book ever!
B00000063U|5.0|This album is not perfect...but I don't know how much closer you can get!  This one goes up there with &quot;Sandy&quot; (Sandy Denny) and &quot;Bryter Later&quot; (Nick Drake).  It ranges from being somber and depressing to upbeat and dark.  My favorites?  &quot;I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight&quot;, &quot;End of the Rainbow&quot;, and &quot;The Great Valerio&quot;.  The last two songs (which are the final two on the album) alone are worth the price of admission.<br />A serious warning: this is DEPRESSING music.  This album could definitely be used as the huddle-in-the-corner-for-a-few-hours-because-I-don't-see-any-purpose-in-anything soundtrack.  It is not lush (despite Linda's beautiful vocals), but has a stripped-away power and beauty of its own.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Excellent CD. There are 14 strong tracks (including the Bonus &quot;Freedom&quot;). The only weak ones are in the middle, namely<BR>Your Way and Spinning on an Axis.<br />McCartney still has what it takes to be a rocker. It is a shame that radio station DJs do not adequately appreciate what he has to offer. Except for the TV ad and the AC station that just happens to play From a Lover to a Friend, the only way that someone who has not kept up with The Maestro's works will hear of this release will be either by listening to or reading well-detailed reviews.<br />It is arguably his best work since Venus and Mars. A good blend of tracks, ranging from acoustic numbers to electric guitar moments reminiscent of the late 1960s and early 1970s to the soulful piano tunes that have been McCartney's trademark for so long. <br />Though it is highly doubtful that it will go so high up the Billboard charts as Britney or Michael, even though it deserves to, I think that sales will be progressive enough over the long run that McCartney will soon hang yet another set of Gold and Platinum albums on his wall.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This is the first &quot;new&quot; CD have heard in a long time. Great CD!
B000005ALP|3.0|Now I will admit, as much as I love Mr.E, this cd was a bit of a snore. But with songs like Novacaine for the soul, susan's house and your lucky day in hell. It's something that deffinetly needs to be in your collection.
0393317552|3.0|This would be a better book, if it weren't long and repetitious. For example, Part 4, which is a fourth of the book, repeats everything that has already been said in the previous parts. And what is the point of having all those photographs of people?
0385505833|5.0|Grisham set the scenario that goes through our heads when the spirit of Christmas goes out the window during the big rush.  A cruise would be the easy way out!  Full of comedy yet heartwarming.  A refreshing change from his courtroom dramas.
B00005LOUQ|4.0|I took my children to this movie the first day it came out and absolutely loved it. Not only for the film itself but also for hearing my three daughters giggling throughout the show. When it was released on DVD we immediately went out and bought it. For the past two days they must have watched it a dozen times.<br />What makes this film stand out is Jim Carrey. Now mind you, I am not a big Jim Carrey fan. With the exception of the Truman Show I find his movies to be dumb and repetitive. So I was a little concerned about this as being just another vehicle for Carrey to be himself. This movie works because his portrayal of the Grinch fits his humor and also makes you forget he's the one playing him. The plot is loosely based on the great Dr. Suess book but very embellished. For instance there is a flashback scene that explains who the Grinch is and how he became the way he is. The scenery is great, the make-up superb, and the humor extremely funny. My favorite scene is the hodrod sled taking off.<br />I would recommend this to any family looking for a great holiday flick.
1567184855|5.0|For years I've dabbled with, &quot;New Age&quot; ideas, but I never found the answers to my questions about life, karma, and suffering.  I turned away from all new age, and new thought thinking when my young child developed a serious, and life-threatening illness.  I couldn't find anything in the, &quot;New Age&quot; literature that answered my questions of, &quot;Why?&quot;  <br />Having my adult life consumed by illness, I could no longer sanctimously talk about, &quot;karma&quot;, and &quot;lessons&quot; that I needed to learn.  Most importantly, I couldn't swallow that my child wasn't a, &quot;victim&quot;, and that because of something he did in another life, he, &quot;earned&quot; this illness through the laws of karma.  <br />I stopped reading, and listenting to anyone who preached, &quot;no one is a victim&quot;.  I knew my son was a victim, and I knew that I was a victim.  I didn't apprecite hearing that God wouldn't give me more than I could handle, and I didn't appreciate hearing that, &quot;we were working through karmic issues.&quot;<br />And so I floundered for years, closed off, and unable to receive the nurishing sustenance that religion, and spirituality has to give.  Then I read, &quot;Journey of Souls&quot;, by Michael Newton.  In this one book, I received the framework of human life, that made sense to me.  I finally understood clearly, if not completely the purpose of my son's birth, his illness, our struggle, and the gifts that we have in fact received as a result of it.  I came to understand the nature of God, love, compassion, illness, suffering, life, death, and karma.  <br />I no longer struggle trying to understand Good and Evil.  I no longer feel scorched by the suffering I see, but can not stop.  I no longer feel betrayed by my own suffering.  The gifts I received by Michael Newton's first work, &quot;Journey of Souls&quot;, have supplied me with a peace I was not able to find anywhere else.<br />I am very grateful to be alive at this time in history, when through the click of a mouse I was able to order through Amazon a book that sounded, &quot;interesting&quot;, but that in fact, so profoundly changed my life, that I see everything in a new, and different light.<br />If you struggle like I did with the anomalies in religious teaching that ask you to, &quot;take on faith&quot;, what it can not answer, you may enjoy reading a book that is not afraid to supply you with the answers you haven't been able to find anywhere else.
B00005O5JV|2.0|You ever watch one of them movies that you feel that you are just plain stupider for watching?  That it had no point, it was a waist of your time, and just killed good brain cells?  That was my opinion of this &quot;comedy&quot;.  I didn't even crack a smile once.  This was a &quot;comedy&quot; correct?  It wasn't a comedy. A comedy makes you smile,laugh, feel merry.  Personally, I did not get any of those feelings from the movie.  If you like slapdash comedies that should have went straight to video, then this is for you.  However, if you want something with a little more depth... Try something else.
B00005QK3W|3.0|A breakdown of McCartney's new album, in an easy list format:<br />1. Great basslines.<BR> The last time Paul played such aggressive, melodic and driving basslines like this, the Beatles were doing Sgt. Pepper. <BR>2. Weak, weak lyrics.<BR> People have used this space to compare this album to Abbey Road. To do so would be doing a great disservice to the music Paul wrote with the Beatles and even with Wings. On \\"Rain\\", the lyrics are vague, childish, and half hearted; perhaps the result of a supposedly rushed recording process. For God's sakes Paul, allow someone to critique your work before you put out on the market to millions of people who will plunk down $(...) to hear a former Beatle. Listen to \\"Driving Rain\\", \\"Tiny Bubble\\", \\"Spinning on an Axis\\", \\"Sunshine Again\\", and \\"Freedom\\" and see if you can find any genius.<BR>3. Good ol' fashioned ballads.<BR> On previous albums, the ballads haven't always been the highlights. But in this case, they are the only ones. \\"Your Way\\" could've been a White Album track; \\"Your Loving Flame\\" is almost a 90's \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\". \\"I Do\\" has Wings written all over it. These songs are the glue holding the album together. <BR>4. A new sound?<BR> Several times, Paul attempts an alternative sound on his songs. \\"She's Given Up Talking\\" has a creepy, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" quality to it. Some weird lyric choices here as well. \\"Spinning on an Axis\\" contains hip hop vocal stylings...but Paul sounds like he's trying, desperately, in these new surroundings. Sorry, but the man's better off with Jeff Lynne.<BR>5. The Lost Voice.<BR> This pains me the most, but Paul is unable to hit the high notes on this album. The strength and vitality in Paul's voice on 'Flaming Pie' and 'Flowers in the Dirt' is completely gone here. Again, maybe the rushed recording process hurt him here. Maybe he thought off key vocals sounded \\"fresh\\" and unkept in a cool way. Maybe he should have hired someone who could've told that this album needed work. <BR>6. So is Paul done?Is the inevitable Ringo-Paul reunion tour all that he has left to offer us? I sincerely hope not. It was only four years ago that he was making music with substance and clarity. Perhaps with a bit more focus and less false bravado, we will have a Grammy winner in another four years.
0060278234|4.0|A while ago, I was browsing my city library's (woefully pathetic) fantasy section and stumbled across Sabriel.  I read it and thought it was wonderful.  A few days ago, I was in the library and picked up Lirael.  I was certainly not dissapointed by Sabriel's sequel.  If anything, I liked it even more.  However, it had been a while since I had read Sabriel, and the plot of Sabriel was a little fuzzy.  I recommend reading Sabriel and reading Lirael right after it--trust me, the money will be well spent.<br />This is not your typical fantasy of sword-swinging heroes and mages muttering spells.  Garth NIx has created a new and unique world of fantasy that has little in common with many other major fantasy series(Tolkien, Jordan, etc. and so forth)  Here is the world of the Old Kingdom, with it's good, orderly Charter Magic pitted against the evil Free Magic of the Necromancers.  Juxtaposed with the Old Kingdom is the land to it's south, past a wall, in which no one believes in the magic.  Most of the story, however, takes place in the Old Kingdom.  The story picks up years after Sabriel ends, and tells the story of Prince Sameth(Sabriel's son), an evil Necromancer named Hedge, and mostly, of Lirael, only daughter of the Clayr who is not gifted with the ability to see into the future.  With the help of her only friend the Disreputable Dog, who I found to be one of the most amusing characters, Lirael has to come to terms with the fact she will never have the ability to See into the future, discover the secret of her parentage, and discover her own destiny, all in time to help Prince Sameth save the kingdom.  This was a delightful read, and one I couldn't put down.  I was quite dissapointed when I turned the last page and it said To be continued in Abhorsen.  So, I hope Garth Nix hurries up and finishes Abhorsen, because I can't wait to read it and find out what happens!
B00005M989|2.0|Submitted for your perusal, a list of songs NOT included on this &quot;VERY BEST&quot; compilation:  &quot;CONTROVERSY,&quot; &quot;DIRTY MIND,&quot; &quot;I FEEL 4 U,&quot; &quot;WHEN U WERE MINE,&quot; &quot;SOFT AND WET,&quot; &quot;DELIRIOUS,&quot; &quot;TAKE ME WITH U,&quot; &quot;POP LIFE,&quot; &quot;MOUNTAINS,&quot; &quot;IF I WAS YOUR LOVER,&quot; &quot;BATDANCE,&quot; &quot;7,&quot; &quot;THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD.&quot; Fortunately, one can opt for &quot;THE HITS/B-SIDES&quot; (1993). Maybe this was released as a mere refresher course. But one cannot properly honor Prince's nearly-25-year carreer without AT LEAST issuing a double-disc. This should have been titled, &quot;PRINCE -- A SAMPLER.&quot;

B000001F45|4.0|Ende 1972 waren Kaufhof und Montanus nach Erscheinen der heiß erwarteten LP in der Musikabteilung mit mehreren Hundert Covers des Werkes bepflastert, um darauf hinzuweisen, daß es endlich da ist.<br />Es war wirklich schwierig, für &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot; (eine der besten Platten der Sechziger und Siebziger) einen würdigen Nachfolger zu finden, so weit reichte der kreative Schatten des kommerziell ungemein erfolgreichen Werkes mit seiner wundervollen Covergestaltung von Roger Dean. &quot;Magicians Birthday&quot; war nicht schlecht, es gab viele Vorbestellungen. Das Werk zeigt wieder, daß Uriah Heep eigentlich keine Hardrock-Gruppe wie Black Sabbath war. <br />&quot;Blindeye&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Echoes in the Dark&quot; sind wundervolle Balladen und gehören zu der Gruppe besten Kompositionen. &quot;Spider Woman&quot; war eine superschnelle Heavy-Nummer, die allerdings etwas den beginnenden langsamen Verlust der farbenträchtigen Magie der Gruppe spiegelte, ähnlich &quot;Sweet Lorrain&quot;, etwas effekthascherisch. Das Titelstück &quot;Magicians Birthday&quot; ist der typische lange Song, der bisher jede LP der Gruppe abschloß. Nicht schlecht (besonders die vielschichtigen Vocals), aber die farbenschillernde Psychedelia von &quot;The Spell&quot; oder würdevolle Melancholie &quot;Salisbury&quot; (meiner Meinung die beste - unterbewertete -Synthese von Klassik und Pop der Siebziger) spürte man hier nicht mehr. Auch die Innencover-Fotos sind hier effekthascheriger als die unaufdringlichen Fotos auf &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot;.<br />An Uriah Heep kann man das Ende einer Epoche emotional nachempfinden. 1973 änderte sich vieles: Die Wirtschaft bekam eine Krise, die Sechsziger waren offiziell mit der Ölkrise zu Ende, die Jugendzeitschriften wurden in Bild und Schrift oberflächlicher, die Kommerzialisierung von Sexualität sorgte für eine unsensiblere Wahrnehmung seiner Umwelt, etc. Und Uriah Heep kamen aus der Mode. Genug abgeschweift.<br />Im ganzen gesehen ist die CD aber anschaffenswert, alleine wegen den wunderbaren Balladen und der Außencovergestaltung von Roger Dean in Rot und Blau. Von Uriah Heep gehören in die Sammlung &quot;Look At Yourself&quot;, &quot;Salisbury&quot; (!), &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot; und als letzte diese. Was Uriah Heep damals für den deutschen Musikgeschmack der jugendlichen und Heranwachsenden bedeutete, kann man heute schwer mit seinem Gefühl nachvollziehen. Ich freute mich kürzlich, als ein 18-jähriges Mädchen mit langen blonden Haaren &quot;Salisbury&quot; als ihre absolute Lieblingsplatte bezeichnete. <br />1970 bis 72 haben Uriah Heep der Jugend eine schöne eindringliche - softe wie bleischwere - Keyboard-Musik geschenkt, danach - hätten sie sich aufgelöst und etwas anderes gemacht - sie wären dennoch unvergessen. Sie trafen den Nerv des deutschen Musikempfindens, das das Zarte, Klassische wie auch das Schwere, Dramatische und Laute liebt.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This probably Shakira's best album ever. I love it. The only problem is Ojos Asi. In Spanish it is great but when you translate it into english, Look Out! Some things are better left in their native tongue.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Well I don't think that I can really add much more than what has efectively been said by so many prior to me.  The only reason I am giving this film 3 out of 5 stars is for Angelina's performance as Lara Croft.  I understand that she worked extreemly hard to for this part. And I don't mean just physically, she has the English accent down cold as is the mannerism of a British  aristocrat.  I was originally livid when I heard the part went to her.  I wanted it to go to Catherine-Zeta Jones. Apart from the fact that Angelina was a yank. I was none too impressed with her wanton eccentricities which were reported on  in the press.  Lara was supposed to be a lady but as far as I was concerned Angelina was the exact opposite.  But as I read more about her and when I saw the film I thought that she gave it an adequate performance.<br />  That being said.  It really is hard to rate Jolie effectively because the movie was absolute trash. A non-sensical plot and poor story line. I spent years looking forward to the movie release of Tomb Raider and could scarcely believe that this dreck was all the film makers could come up with.  If I had not been given a warning about the poor quality of the film I may just have walked out on it.<br />  This movie is suitable for hard core Angelina Jolie fans, or perhaps Tomb Raider fans who may want to add this to your collection.  Otherwise I can not in all honesty recommend you plunking down your hard earned cash to buy this.
6305736650|5.0|Not only is this film the greatest Hollywood movie ever made, it is also the most quotable. The credit should surely go the Epstein brothers, whose incomparably witty script included some of the greatest lines in English language cinema. Their stock in trade was classic chutzpah, and it is amazing how much of their dialogue has entered the popular vocabulary. (For copious examples, check out the Quotes &amp; Trivia on this page.)<br />There is little I wish to add to the 200 (!) other reviews on this site, except to say that as a black and white photographer I was enthralled by the luminous quality in nearly every scene of this movie. Light and shadow have never been used more effectively, and greatly complement the sense of melodrama and romance.<br />The word &quot;classic&quot; has been ridiculously overworked, but Casablanca deserves the highest accolades for its excellence in every aspect: its script, performances, cinemaphotography, direction, music..., in short, the movie is a staggering achievement.<br />The image on the DVD is flawless, and I found the accompanying documentary very informative.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|Shrek is a great movie - very funny! The extra scenes on this DVD are interesting and entertaining. If you're looking for a fun movie (one that you'll enjoy as much as the kids), this is a great choice.<br />However, note that many of the 'extra features' are for Windows only - they aren't available on DVD players or on Macintosh. Also, if you want to see all the extra scenes, you'll need to  repeatedly backtrack through the same navigational screens - it gets VERY tedious.<br />I certainly recommend the video, but I think the producers have done a poor job with the DVD, and the packaging and advertising are quite deceptive.  Ideally, more features should be available with standard DVD players - and it should certainly be clear on the package that they are not!

0440178002|5.0|I can honestly say that this is the best book i've ever read.  James Clavell did an unbelievably great job at taking you to 17th century Japan and explaining the culture.  One thing that surprised me was that it was over a thousand pages long and yet not one page was boring wheras most authors who try to write long books just get long-winded.  this book was long because the author actually had a lot to say, not just because he liked filling up pages.  this is a great book and i'd reccomend it to anyone.

Powered by Mr. Krank's spreadsheet analysis from last season, this couple is determined to skip all the gifts, the decorating, the tree, etc.  To what lengths will their neighbors go to try and press this scrooge couple into the annual frenzy!  A hilarious camaraderie ensues with characters so real, I am sure they walked out of Neighborhood USA and onto these 177 pages. The true spirit of the season, the spirit of giving and love, has the final say in Grisham's first Christmas novel.  I plan to read this book every year just before the holiday frenzy begins, to remind me, I wouldnt skip the madness for anything!
B000002MY3|4.0|Alanis Morrisette is a very controversial artist. Either you like her or you don't. Admitedly, her vocal style is very different to many artists (some would say it was downright bad). I happen to disagree. Her voice gets an A, coz she can control it really well. Her lyrics get an A - they have both a subtle meaning and suit the songs well. However the music is pretty average and simplistic, which some people like, but I don't. So, getting down to this album - there are definitely some excellent tracks. I particularly enjoyed All I Really Want, Right Through You and Ironic (even though it had nothing to do with irony!). Some tracks aren't quite as good and Perfect gives me a headache occaissionally. So what's the verdict? If you love Alanis unconditionally - buy the album. If you think you like Alanis, but the album. If you're not sure, check out some of the tracks before you buy it. If you don't like her...well, why are you reading this review?
0385505833|5.0|As much fun as Skipping Christmas is to read, it's even more fun to read the second time!  Knowing what happens just sharpened my enjoyment of the book's beginning.  I look forward to rereading this book every Christmas.<br />I also hope that a movie will be made of it.  Luther Krank is an inspired comic character.  He and his wife, Nora, will remind you of Jackie Gleason and Alice Meadows in The Honeymooners.  In his younger days, Jack Lemmon would have been perfect for the part of Luther.<br />Like all great Christmas tales, this one teaches new dimensions of the real spirit of Christmas while taking aim at the humbug that tends to grow up around the edges in our celebration of this important Christian holiday.<br />Is Christmas just for the children?  Or is it for the child in all of us?<br />How do you know when you've had a wonderful Christmas?  How can you prepare to have a better one?  Reading this book will undoubtedly give you some good ideas of where old habits need to be amended, and better ways of celebrating begun.
B000002UJQ|4.0|Two words: Achtung Baby.  This is where all the inspiration comes from.  Hey OKC is a great album, it just pales in comparison to U2's brainchild.  I prefer to listen to the real thing.  Oh yeah, and it really does remind me of &quot;1984.&quot;
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink shows that you can not label her music and she brought fire with this CD. You can tell this CD is very personal. WOW
B00005QK3W|5.0|\\"Driving Rain\\"  has left me wondering how in the world he still can do what he does. I actually thought he was used up vocally and drained down to his final good song two albums ago and that was a tough reality for me, because I've been a fan since 1964 at the age of 13. His vocals sound like he's 30 years old again. The title track, \\"Driving Rain\\", is so simple, but magically turns in to an up tempo rocker only the way Paul can do it with \\"Excellent Simplicity\\". There's not a new and exciting chord progression or a song with profound lyrics, but it's Paul doing what he does better then anyone else... taking something simple and turning it in to magic. Kind of like making a silk purse out of a sow's ear.<br />\\"I do\\" and \\"Flaming Love\\" are two ballads, that I haven't yet decided which one I like better. They are both comparable to some his earlier beautiful ballads like \\"My Love\\" and \\"Junk\\".<br />He even treats us to a little of his \\"Monkberry Moon Delight / I'm Down\\" type vocals on \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" (Paul can even scream in tune). I can't say I like every track on the CD, but I do like at least 8 or 9 of them. There aren't very many other bands or artists today that I can say that about.
B00003CXXI|5.0|this is an awesome movie with lots of laughs. it's great because they don't swear in it, but they do fit in &quot;inside jokes&quot; for the older kids in your family. A 17-year old and a 6-year old can enjoy this movie together! I loved it so much
B000002UB3|5.0|No Beatles collection is complete without this album.
B00005OM4N|2.0|I only listened to the samples...but just from listening to them I can hardly stand to listen to 30 seconds of some of these songs.  There are only about 3-4 good songs.  Those would be \\"Slave\\", \\"Overprotected\\" \\"NAGNYAW\\", & \\"Cinderella\\" The rest are awful!  I was turned off just by \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\"  It cannot even be compared to the original!  It's so bad.  She sounds like her nose is plugged!  But then again she does in about half of her songs.  She seriously needs to learn how to SING and get rid of that funky \\"techno\\" stuff that makes her voice sound even more (...).  Just my opinion.  I usually like any music, but this is just awful.  I liked \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops\\" but each time she gets worse.  This is definitely not her best work.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I don't know why so many dis-like this film, sure it's not perfect but it's not bad either. I was a bit disapointed but not enough to hate it. The only bad things about it is that there's no character build-up what so ever. Jah-Jah is annoying, Anakin is too cheerful to believe he becomes Darth Vader. When he gets told he'll be a Jedi he says....&quot;Yipee!!&quot;. How's this for an idea for the special special edition. When Vader becomes good again, he finds his inner child, takes off the mask and yells yippee!!.<br />  It's way too slow in the middle that when it finally got to the pod race I was almost sleeping in the theater. Plus Anakin blowing up a ship and being a hero like Luke in &quot;A New Hope&quot; doesn't really work. Obi-Wan is so cool too and is better than Luke yet a little kid has more lines and more screen time. What made this film good for me was the visuals, the Pod Race, Darth Maul and the light saber duel at the end. Some fans didn't like Ewoks so much that they didn't like Return of the Jedi. Jah-Jah is so annoying in Episode 1 that he makes you wish Ewoks were in it instead.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback has a unique style and the song &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is one of the best songs ever written. I highly recommend this song not just to teenagerrs but to everyon else!! I love NICKELBACK!!!
B00004WG2F|5.0|This is a magnificent film but one that can only be appreciated by those who know the true beauty of Montana like scenery and those who are not scared to appreciate their emotions and what they bring out. Its an intriguing tale of a family who make their homestead in Montana and each of their travels through life centered on Tristan(Pitt) and the patriarch(Hopkins).<br />It makes me long for the outdoor life and simple living that may still be there to be had. Any person who is not cold inside or who has disdain for the ills of society or regimented society itself will be drawn into this world and will not easily escape.<br />If you identify with tristan's story then try the razors edge another film that I get reminded of when I think of tristan's story, a search for the real meaning of our existence.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Riveting, spacious, and majestic, Howard Shore's efforts for the soundtrack of Lord of the Rings is one of the finest movie scores ever recorded.  From deep pounding thrusts, an intrinsic return chord, choirs using the languages that Tolkien created, Enya singing in the Elven language, everything from massive strokes on a musical canvass to the finest detail of instrumentals, Shore has completed an outstanding opus. What more could one ask? Well, maybe Enya's song &quot;May it Be&quot;, will be the first song over the end credits to win an oscar.  They have captured and distilled magic here.
B00003CY0V|4.0|I really enjoyed this film although I must admit it is pretty silly. It's still a hip and cool film though with great action, fun lines, good performances and a lot of scenes with tension. Just don't try to understand it. Travolta is great in it although the film hardly saved his career after BattleField Earth, he still might as well do Look Who's Talking 4. Hugh Jackman I see going places after this though, took a wrong turn with &quot;Someone Like You&quot; but I still see something there. Reminds me of a young Clint Eastwood actually.
B00003CXTF|3.0|Honestly, one of the only reasons I saw this film was to see Ben Affleck. Like Titanic, this film is predictable in that you know the ending before the movie begins. Aside from the fact that my movie going experience was ruined by a man whose cell phone rang continually throughout the entire movie, I thought it was &quot;okay.&quot; The thing that bothered me about this movie was that it &quot;Armageddon&quot;-ized an event that shaped America's history for the past 60 years. The attack scenes were wonderful, but the plot and love scenes were predictable and unimaginative. If only for the special effects, I give this film a three out of five stars. &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot; was definitely a more accurate portrayal of this event, and left a bigger mark in my mind
B00005Q66T|4.0|Because of the lack of &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;You´ll see&quot;, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot; and any new song like in The Immaculate Collection, this GHV2 has reached the title of almost perfect, but, anyway, some songs rescue the sensation of being listening one of the most sexy and intelligent women on hearth.<br />She did it again.....opppsss sorry Britney, Cristina, Mariah Carey, etc... but MADONNA IS THE BEST OF THE BEST. A nice collection for everyone.
B00005QK3W|4.0|So many people over the years have criticized Paul McCartney for his soft, melodic love songs.  Well on his new cd &quot;Driving RAin&quot; Macca proves he can rock with the best of them (but was there ever any doubt).  From &quot;Lonely Road&quot; to &quot;Freedom&quot;, Paul proves again he hasn't lost his gift for rich melodies and delicious arrangements.  His voice is still so strong and soars through the 16 tracks with revitalized energy.  Highlights are the lead off track &quot;Lonely Road&quot;, the hauntingly beautiful &quot;From a Lover to a friend&quot;, &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot; (love the beginning of this one---an absolute favorite for me), &quot;Your Way&quot; (simple bass driven ode to new found love--lovely), &quot;Heather&quot; (I dare you to get this melody out of your head!)&amp; &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; (Classic McCartney, piano driven ballad).  There are some lesser tracks on here that prevent me from giving this cd 5 stars but none of the songs are clunkers...they just aren't as fleshed out as the others and would have perhaps benifitted from a bit more polishing.  One of the interesting things about this cd is I kept expecting to hear Linda's voice in there somewhere...how sad that she is gone now and yet she is still so present in McCartney's music...You can almost hear her background vocals..supporting Paul as she had always done.  All in all I love this cd...Loved it from the first listen and each subsequent time I revisit it I discover new layers in these songs (Pau's bass playing is exceptional).  If this is any indication where Paul is going with his music...I'm thrilled to be a long for the ride...Well done Paul!!!
B000002C1W|5.0|(...) A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON was the first Floyd album after MEDDLE that I did NOT buy. When it was released, I had been deeply immersed in classical music, mostly the late Romantics, for about five years. I had been very disappointed with THE FINAL CUT, and I had thought that I had just outgrown \\"art\\" rock for real art.<br />God do I regret that decision! It was more than a decade, as middle age nostalgia was setting in, before I started listening to Pink Floyd again and gave this CD a chance. I played it every day for months, then shelved it, then brought it out for more months of daily play.<br />In short: I love this CD.<br />First, I love its oft-maligned \\"sound\\": rich, layered, grand, symphonic, but always in very good taste.<br />Second, I love the warmth and subtlety of David Gilmour's voice, always the the voice of Pink Floyd for me. In no other recording does he use it so expressively.<br />Third, and most importantly, there are wonderful songs here: \\"Signs of Life\\" is a meditative instrumental opening. \\"Learning to Fly\\" is sublime in its combination of loping, heavy, earthbound music and with soaring voices and a wonderful melody in the chorus; it did not make much of an initial impression, but on the second listening I was hooked; \\"The Dogs of War\\" is surging, shattering blues, with a coiled rattlesnake tenseness, biting lyrics, and magnificent guitar and sax solos. It is the \\"Money\\" of MOMENTARY LAPSE. \\"One Slip\\" is a richly layered uptempo song with a melody that slowly insinuates itself until one is hooked. \\"On the Turning Away\\" is my very favorite. The melody is instantly catchy, instantly moving, and very, very English. Even though I do not share the sentiments of the lyrics, I cannot resist their beauty. And the guitar solo is one of Gilmour's greatest ever, up there with his greatest on \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" \\"Yet Another Movie\\"/\\"Round and Around\\" is another mesmerizing track with evocative, melancholy lyrics and searing guitar. This is night music, music with an interstellar spaciousness. \\"A New Machine\\" parts 1 and 2 is weak, but mercifully brief, framing \\"Terminal Frost,\\" which is one of Pink Floyd's very best instumental tracks: incredibly tight, incredibly slick, with a beautiful melody that is alternately soaring and wistful. The final track, \\"Sorrow,\\" is a truly grand finale, a song about regretting lost youth and lost innocence, both of the individual facing death and of civilization cut off from nature, paved over, fenced in, and drowning in its own pollution--moral, cultural, and industrial.<br />This is grownup music, and I am glad that I finally grew into it.ht music, music with an interstellar spaciousness. \\"A New Machine\\" parts 1 and 2 is weak, but mercifully brief, framing \\"Terminal Frost,\\" which is one of Pink Floyd's very best instumental tracks: incredibly tight, incredibly slick, with a beautiful melody that is alternately soaring and wistful.

0689835604|5.0|I bought this book for my son last Christmas when he was 8 months old.  He was thrilled as he lifted each of the flaps to find what was inside.  It taught him to name some of his body parts espcially his belly button.  Even at 20 months he will still bring this book to me or sit alone and read it. I loved the illustrations and even drew reference to it to calm him when he  took his first bubble bath.
B000005DQR|5.0|This album absolutely floored me the first time I heard it.  I happened upon it at a local record store in one of the listening booths and decided to give it a listen.  I had never heard of DJ Shadow up to that point but my whole world changed the moment I put on those headphones and pressed play.  It begins with an introduction that sounds like your ordinary dialogue sampled intros found in many hip hop records, but right after the sampled voice says, &quot;producing...&quot; in floods a piano that sounds more classical than jazzy or funky, the drums kick in and the journey begins.  There's an atmosphere to this album (all the great ones do).  You can just feel it.  Sometimes the air is thick and foggy, sometimes your head feels cluttered, and sometimes you just sit back, relax, and take it all in.  This album has been in my collection for a long time and it still to this day amazes me and is constantly in my cd player.  I've heard people say this is a hip hop record, or trip hop, blah, blah, blah.   Catergorization of music gets pretty tiresome, but if I were to categorize this album I'd put it under &quot;great music&quot;, because that's what it is.  It's simply great music.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira is one of those movies that you never forget. The images are extremely powerful and graphic, so that they stick with you long after the movie is over. Despite its sometimes-confusing plot line, this movie is a wonderfully written, chilling look into the future, and into humanity as a whole. The movie more or less centers around a teenage biker gang in Neo-Tokyo, thirty-years after World War III. The main characters, Kaneda and Tetsuo, are two childhood friends who are constantly in competition with each other (Tetsuo being the weaker, taunted one.) Regardless, Tetsuo still looks up to Kaneda. As the introduction moves out of the chase scene, an interesting encounter with an odd looking child (who awakens the physic abilities lying dormant within Tetsuo's mind) truly begins the movie. <br />The animation quality in this movie is almost enough of a reason to buy it. The detail is incredible, umparalled even by Disney?s standards. No one background or setting is used twice, and the environment is in constant change, be it blinking lights or a person exiting a random building. Oddly enough, the Bladerunner-esque buildings throughout the movie also help to establish the feeling of urgency, and the sensation of teetering on the edge of something great, something that we cannot possibly understand. The characters also move in a realistic, smooth motion, something that is missing from many anime television shows, like Pokemon or Digimon.<br />The music in this movie is also an aspect that really stands out, with a sound all its own. With this new DVD cleanup, you can hear every bell, whistle and drum beat. It sounds more Japanese than most animes out there, and that is not a bad thing. Every single song fits the actions incredibly well, from the haunting Requiem at the end, to the oddly infectious Japanese drums in Kaneda, heard during the motorcycle chase scene and credits of the movie. Hats off to Shoji Yamashiro. <br />The voice acting is good, but not great. I feel that the original dubbing job used voice actors much better suited to their animated counterparts. For example, Kaneda's original voice actor fit his attitude well, as his voice had the same inflection and as a teenage boy's does. The new voice actor, however, sounds like an adult trying to speak like a teenager. Tetsuo?s voice sometimes sounds a little off too, as the inflection in his words do not always coincide with the action on screen There is no mention of the original script or dub however, but there is a small interview with the English voice actors of Kaneda, Tetsuo, and Kei. <br />The extras on this DVD are excellent, with detailed information on how the music was created, the voice actors of both the English and Japanese scripts, and it also holds about 4,500 stills from the movie and the entire movie's storyboard. The menus are easy to follow and understand, and contain colorful backgrounds with music-sound bites from the movie.<br />Overall, this DVD is a must have for any Sci-fi or animation fan. It shows the best of what anime has to offer. You will never forget the magnificent story, or the unforgettable characters that make this movie a classic, inside and outside of anime.<br />Remember though, this movie is NOT for young children and the squeamish. If your child is under the age of fifteen, or if you do not like the sight of blood and body parts, the movie is probably not for you.
B00005A1PR|4.0|a little to minimal to really be considered a great album.  The chords, melodies, lyrics, and arrangements are all pleasing but quite often lack the bite and emotional intensity for me to rate this as a 5 star disc.  And believe me there are plenty of minimalist aritists who I love like Roberta Flack and Sade just to name two.  But there's something missing here.  Despite Ms Aries fine voice and numerous powerful and thought provoking cuts on this disc.  <br />But she's an artist who i'll definitely look forward to hearing from in the future.
B000003S0I|5.0|I am just going to say that this is one of my top 5 <BR>albums of all time, I have worn three vinyl copies out!<BR>A good listen on headphones as well, as the mix (particularly <BR>the percussion) takes full advantage of stereophonic sound.<BR>This music has the inevitability found only in those rare and precious recordings that are simply perfect.
B00005Q4GA|2.0|Unfortunately, the movie does not.   I didn't much care for Lara Croft.   She seems to be somewhat of a rich spoiled girl who always gets her way no matter what.   Like I said, Joile looks great, but her character so lifeless.  You never get a sense a fear or aguish in Lara.   Absolutely emotionless.  <br />Also there is really no originally in this movie. It borrows heavily from INDIANA JONES series as well as Ray Harryhausen's THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD. (Both feature a six-armed kali that comes to life).<br />Joile is a great actress and I truly hope that she won't be making a whole series of Lara Croft movies in the future.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I must begin by commenting on the stupidity that the majority of you have displayed in your writing and grammar skills.  I would be ashamed to post a review filled with repetitive &quot;likes&quot;, misspelled words, and fragment-laden paragraphs.  I've begun to question whether or not any of you have taken English classes.<BR>  Now about Pearl Harbor...a lot of people have bashed the movie because of the supposed love triangle.  First of all, to be realistic, in times during war, situations like the one between Rafe, Evelynn, and Danny are very likely to happen.  Recently, sales in wedding dresses and rings have sky-rocketed.  Why? Because soldiers feel the need to have someone waiting for them when they come back from fighting.  Women want to wait for them.  More and more people have realized that life is short, and they want to live it to the fullest.  I'm sure that among the veterans of Pearl Harbor there are stories that are even more dramatic than the one depicted in the movie Pearl Harbor.  Second, I think that the love story was very well placed in the movie, because it helps you to identify with the characters, and enables you to bond with them which makes the war scenes more heart-wrenching and more passionate for the viewer.<BR>  The war scenes are very well filmed, and the special effects are amazing.  Ben Affleck is a talented actor and is incredibly supported by Beckinsale and Hartnett.  I appreciated the fact that even though Affleck is the biggest name among the three, Beckinsale and Hartnett get the same amount of screen time.  <BR>  To compare Pearl Harbor to Titanic is one of the most idiotic comments I have ever heard in my entire life.  I see nothing but contrast in the two stories.  The Japanese were a much more formidable opponent than an iceberg.  I don't remember seeing the iceberg rise out of the water and ram itself into the ship.  The Titanic ran into it.  The Japanese intentionally attacked Pearl Harbor.  <BR>  There was virtually no love triangle in Titanic, Jack had no competition.  The directors of Pearl Harbor chose not to have an hour long sex scene, and another hour long scene with a girl naked, and I respect that. I'm sorry, but Titanic does not even hold a candle to Pearl Harbor.  I see no resemblance between the two films other than the length and the historical backround.  So where was the comparison??  Please elaborate, I would really like to know.  (I find myself capable of using the word &quot;like&quot; correctly.) <BR>  All in all, I consider Pearl Harbor one of the best movies ever made, and I think all Americans should see it.  I saw it three times and it greatly influenced me each time.  For those of you who haven't seen the movie and love history, and decent romance, this is the movie for you.

6305311463|4.0|Armageddon, I thought, was one of my top 10's of 1998. It has it all, a superb cast, a great story, superb special effects, and without a doub the best sound editing to date. With a cast of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Will Patton, Liv Tyler, <BR>Peter Stormare, Michael Clark Duncan Jr, Owen Wilson, and of course, Billy Bob Thorton.<br />The movie is about a meteor the size of Texas is on a collision course with the earth. Now the fate of the world rests in the hands of an oil drilling team, to go into outerspace, and drill a hole, drop a nuke and get out of there.<br />With Aerosmith's hit song &quot;I Don't Want To Miss A Thang&quot;, you wont want to miss Armageddon!<br />DVD Special Features Included:<br />* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<BR>* Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen, Dolby<BR>* Theatrical trailer(s), TV spot(s)<BR>* Michael Bay's gag reel<BR>* Deleted scenes, compiled by Michael Bay<BR>* Storyboards and production design drawings<BR>* Analysis of the special effects by visual effects supervisors Richard Hoover, Pat McClung and Hoyt Yeatman<BR>* Music video &quot;I Don't Want to Miss a Thing&quot; by Aerosmith, plus interviews with the band<BR>* Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)<BR>* Number of discs: 2
B00005AX79|5.0|Video Anthology is great.  The &quot;Born In The U.S.A.&quot; videos bring back fond memories of Bruce's leap into the world of video making (and corny acting as well), as well as my trying to catch the latest ones on MTV.<br />The only negativity I have is that I seem to recall that the promo video for Rosalita included Bruce introducing the E Street Band during the instrumental break, whereas this version edits that part out.  Still the promo shows a taste of the energy of what Bruce was like live.<br />It does get a little weak after the &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; videos but recovers nicely by &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;.  <br />All in all a great addition to a Springsteen fan's collection.
B00003Q43A|5.0|Independence Day is one great film. I saw it in theaters and could'nt believe my eyes. It's truly authentic and has more special effects than any other movie, with the exception of \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Armageddon\\". The film has a superb cast, with Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A Fox, and Bill Pullman. The film grossed #9 of the highest grossing movies of all-time. Bringing in an estimated $306,169,255! That's not including video and dvd sales, which probably added another billion on top of that!<br />The film is about aliens trying to take over out planet, and how the world unites as one, to try to fend off the aliens. With some of the greatest special effects, a great cast, and even better, refreshing storyline, this film will remain with everyone forever. (...)
B00003CXDD|1.0|I can understand if you think of this positively in terms of &quot;family entertainment&quot;.  There are so few good movies, and even fewer that are appropriate for kids.  That's where my understanding stops.  If you've been sitting alongside your kids as they watch Pokemon, then this movie may seem positively Shakespearian by comparison.  If you're looking for movies that are good for the whole family, rent &quot;Babe&quot; or &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; or &quot;Shrek&quot;, but for chrissakes, don't put yourself through this ordeal.  Let the kids watch, just don't be near when this is underway.<br />The beauty of the fantasy and sci-fi stuff I loved as a kid was that my tastes were so bad that it all seemed good, with the exception of Battlestar Galatica, which even to me as a second-grader seemed a little shoddy.  When you grow older, you see these things again, and laugh.  Perhaps the problem is that I saw this movie when I was in high school, expecting more.  If this movie was as good as everyone else here said it was, it would still hold water, even at that age. Most of the stuff in these genres is done badly.  This movie is an example of that.  <br />One of the other reviewers said they never met anyone who disliked this film; you've just heard from one.  A dwarf hero is a fine idea, an atypical protagonist. But must we have one who whines and moans throughout the whole flick?  George Lucas gave himself away here; that he no longer knew how to tell a good story (for another example of this, see &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;). Ron Howard has had his hits and misses, and this one's a miss.
B00004U8JV|2.0|The second addition in the Jurassic Park Trilogy is The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Yeah it does have a cool title, making you think that they come up with some sort of other kind of story to go with the original. But No! They have to come up with the exact same story line. Why? To make money. This film is mostly stupid, exactly like the original, which shows sequels can make money and still (be bad)! Very few have lived up to their predacessor. (Few of which are The Godfather Part 2, American Pie 2, Rush Hour 2, & Austin Powers 2). Not to mention all that took a nose dive into stupidity, (E.G: A Nightmare on Elm Street, Urban Legends: Final Cut, and of course Halloween III: Season of the Witch).<br />The film is about the rich scientist again, who this time thinks he can controll the dinosaurs, and keep them from killing and destroying everyone and everything! Only this time Sam Neil don't return, (and that was a smart move), along with Laura Dern. But Jeff Goldblum returns, (and you seen his career take a nose dive), eh? Anyways the same thing happens in the first that happens in the second, and it's not that good. The kids will probably like it, but parents will more than likely hate it.<br />Give thumbs down to JP2!<br />DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDED:<br />&#8226; Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<BR>&#8226; Color, Closed-captioned, DTS Surround Sound, Widescreen<BR>&#8226; Production notes<BR>&#8226; Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)

I was addament to change my ways and because of this I actually bought the Four Agreements. It thought me basic things that boosted my self esteem and made me even smile. I'd recomend this book to anyone.

1559408898|5.0|Although Paul Verhoeven has made some fine films (Soldier Of Orange, Turkish Delight) and some not so fine films (Showgirls), Robocop has always been one of my favorite of his. And if you're as big a fan of this film as I am, then do yourself a favor and pick up the DVD from the Criterion label which has a host of special features (unrated director's cut, a cool commentary track from Verhoeven and crew, film-to-storyboard comparison, storyboards, essay on the making of, theatrical trailers, and liner notes to boot) that is lacking on the MGM label (a theatrical trailer) though their disc is widescreen anamorphic, whereas this disc isn't. But do it fast because as of this writing Criterion has deleted this title! Criterion DVDs are more expensive but they are well worth it (I'm definitely and proudly &quot;biased&quot; towards the Criterion label). Buy it today!!!<br />Peace.
B00004U8JU|5.0|You really can't say enough about Jurassic Park. This first film was above superb! But they did horribly with the second film. I mean it made a lot of money, but did'nt make a lot of sense. The reason it held the single grossing record of a 3-day movie premiere (which WAS the record until Harry Potter came out (...), was the kids wanted to see it. Above all the third was so-so. It had great action scenes, but not a thick plot with it. However the first is original, and totally unprediactable.<br />The film is about a rich scientist who offer a couple of paleontologist three years more research on there project if they will just come and visit his \\"amusement park\\". They agree and off they head for \\"Jurassic Park\\". They finally get landed and they find out the park had REAL dinosaurs. But the rich scientist needs the aproval of the paleontologists (played by Laura Dern & Sam Neil), and another scientist (played by Jeff Goldblum). A storm then hits Jurassic Park, and with the help of the son of the owner, the electricy gets shut off. They then realize the mistake they made, when the dinosaurs cause havoc all of the \\"amusement park\\".<br />This film is one of my favorites and I think that any parent will love it as much as your kid will. This dvd is a great addition to any dvd library.<br />DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDED:<br />&#8226; Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<BR>&#8226; Color, Closed-captioned, DTS Surround Sound, Widescreen<BR>&#8226; Production notes<BR>&#8226; Documentary<BR>&#8226; Industrial Light & Magic Dinosaur Encyclopedia<BR>&#8226; Theatrical Trailers for JP, Lost World, and JP3<BR>&#8226; Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)

B000059TPN|3.0|This film The Rock was too overhyped, and the fact that it had so little action, made for an ok movie, but you expect more, no matter how many people tell you diffrently. The acting is ok, but the Academy Award Nomination for Sean Connery was ludacrous. And well this is the worst Nicholas Cage movie out. (With exception of Guarding Tess).<br />The film The Rock is about a retired army veteran (Ed Harris) who wants compensation for a group of soldiers who werent even acknowledeged after loosing their life in the line of war. So he hijacks some nuclear weapons and takes over Alcatrez. Now San Fransisco's only hope is with an man (Sean Connery) who is still doing life in prison after he escaped Alcatrez, and his help is needed to sneak into the prison and with the help of a nuclear scientist (Nicholas Cage), they must take out the nuclear missiles.<br />The features lacks action, and well the acting is less than tolerable.

First of all                              1)-I'm a slave for you-Great song everytime I listen to it , it just seems to get hotter. Neptunes do a great job in producing tha jam, Britneys voice is sexy and seductive,and her vocals just stand out.                                                2)-Overprotected-Standout song, not one of my favorites, but an amazing display of vocals. great production by max martin.     3)-Lonely-Oh my god I can't say that this isn't a great beat it's Rodney Jerkins who produced this track and britney pulls it off once again.                                                4)-I'm not a girl, not yet a woman-Nice ballad and I think every cd needs one. standout vocals from brit.                       5)-Boys-My favorite song on the whole album, once again Neptunes make a hot production on this track. Britney pulls it off she a hip hop/pop image.                                           6,7,&amp; 8)-Great tracks and remakes,and great productions.      9,10,&amp; 11)-could pass on them but they make a cd complete.     12)-What it's like to be me-Great track Justin and Wade just blow my mind with talent,and Britney's vocals once again are just off tha hook.
0140186409|1.0|Sorry Mr. Steinbeck. I didn't like this one. I had to read this book for my AP English class. Now you may think, since I am a teenager, I think all classics are bad. NOT TRUE. I read a lot of plays (I LOVE the Glass Menagerie) and I've just started Allen Ginsberg's autobio. However, I HATE HATE HATE this book!<br />Let me tell you why. First of all, these poor people have SUCH BAD LUCK. I mean, you'd think that at least one good thing would happen to them within the entire novel. Not so. I mean, if this book were just a hundred pages longer, all of them would be dead. Also, Steinbeck managed to kill off the two best characters in the entire book: Grandma and Grandpa, while Rose of Sharon, possibly the most annoying character I have ever read about, remains alive and whining till the dreadful end. Also, Steinbeck uses a lot of sexual references that are kind of weird and not very enjoyable. For example, he talks about the tractors &quot;raping&quot; the land. Lastly, you'd think Steinbeck is an insane guy or something because whenever something gross happens he really gets into describing it somewhat graphically. He spends a good amount of the book describing, in great detail, a pig eating a baby, cleaning a dead rabbit, and a dead dog squashed flat on the ground.
630587493X|5.0|This movie is based upon a novelette of the same name by Isaac Asimov, later expanded to book length as The Positronic Man in collaboration with Robert Silverberg. As a story, it took both the Hugo and Nebula awards. As a movie, perhaps it should have taken at least a few of the Academy awards.<br />Andrew the robot is first introduced as a household handyman into the Martin family. Stiff, lacking in appreciation of idiomatic English or social graces, and to some extent feared and detested by some members of the family, he is the embodiment of the perfect machine butler. But even in the early stages of this film, intimations of its social and philosophical messages appear, even while you're laughing. The incident where one of the daughters orders Andrew to jump out the window is both hilarious and a pointed bite about the reaction of children to things they think threaten them. It is also a good illustration of the Three Laws of Robotics (which Asimov formulated as far back as 1939) in action, Laws which constrain Andrew in ways both obvious and subtle.<br />From this early point there is slow, carefully calculated development of Andrew from pure machine into something that has creative desires, that learns to care, and be cared about, for and by the family members, to a useful, money making employee, to a near person with a desire for freedom, and finally to a thinking, articulate, and lovable person whose greatest desire is to experience all it means to be human.<br />Robin Williams turns in a bravura performance here. Even in the early stages, when he is totally encased in his robot suit and incapable of showing any expression, he manages to make Andrew distinct and understandable. Later,  given more free rein, Williams irrepressible talent for the dead-pan one-liner comes to the fore, making devastating satirical points about money, freedom, love, death,  prejudice against any who 'look' different, and many other subjects. Science fiction is a very good vehicle for satire, and Williams makes the most of it here. While the supporting actors/actresses are very good, Williams clearly steals the show.<br />Makeup and special effects are well done, especially the various 'appearances' that Andrew takes on at various stages and the looks at his inner organs. The musical score, however, is only mediocre, though at least it doesn't get in the way of the film.<br />But more than anything else, this is a movie that explores just what it is to be human. Each stage of Andrew's development tries to capture one more aspect of being human, and his continuous striving towards that ultimate goal will eventually capture the viewer's heart.for satire, and Williams makes the most of it here.

B00003CXXJ|1.0|While the hype was high about this movie based on the comments from my kids, friends etc., I found the movie to be pure pedestrian drivel.  Snippets of fairy tales, music that gen Xer's can identify with does not make a movie creative in the least.  Would I watch this again -- NO!  I believe that the Toy story movie in comparison was far superior.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd's new compilation may be the fullest realisation of post-modern art yet to hit the world of rock music. <br />The essence of the post-modern or \\"po-mo\\" movement in the arts is that it doesn't know quite what it is, but it knows what it likes. It's the sort of art that gets created when art-critics get fed up with being critics and start trying to be artists in their own right. They decide on the sort of statement they want to make, then they pick over their own favourite influences extracting a bit here and a bit there to fit the statement. In fact all rock'n'rollers young enough to have grooved on Elvis (Presley, not Costello) are into this to some extent. The point is that placing familiar elements in a new context should bring out new truths in service of the artists own agenda. Some would say that the further he distances himself from the spirit of the original works, the more likely he is to say something fresh.<br />At its worst, this can just be music-by-numbers, a jigsaw or patchwork of influences without any real message. This happened a lot in the 1990's with Brit-pop, Grunge and so on. Anybody who was around in the 60's or 70's went through half the nineties muttering things like \\"The whole bl**dy album sounds like `I Am The Walrus'\\". Nevertheless it can make great art: think of how Bruce took elements of Elvis, Dylan, Jagger and garage punk, and created a complete musical vision for the last quarter of the 20th century. Less obviously but just as significantly, some of the most inspiring acts of recent decades (e.g. Clapton, Santana, R.E.M.) have owed their flair to the humility and reverence with which they have meshed together different musical idioms. <br />The weird thing about \\"Echoes\\" is that the Floyd never openly declared or traded on their influences. They were simply themselves. To the extent that they had major influences, these were mostly outside rock - in the fields of avant-garde (Cage, Stockhausen), late romantic tone poets (e.g. Bartok), music hall and nursery rhyme. And ultimately the Floyd's best work, right through from \\"Piper\\" to \\"Bell\\", was pure accessible pop. What made it deep was all the disturbing sonic and lyrical undercurrents. Above all they were sincere. They wrote their lyrics from the heart and aired their joys and sorrows as a band in public. In other words, no band could have been further removed from the cold, calculating, distanced, ironic world of post-modernism.<br />AND YET here are the Floyd now, seeming brazenly to reinvent themselves, to distance themselves from their own creative muse. The approach for \\"Echoes\\" seems to have been almost calculatedly to place their most famous songs in a (some have said jarringly) different context. And by taking bits out of seamless concept albums and reintegrating them more or less seamlessly into new surroundings, they are (intentionally or not) making a new, distanced statement. \\"This is what we  were....look how we did this.....see the effect we were aiming for here....see how we changed....\\"  People think they are buying a greatest hits collection - I'm not sure that's what this is about. Half the statement of the original albums was in an album-length flow of ideas. Change that, and you change the meaning. <br />So supposing this theory is right. Then how, in a project like this, would you go about providing the shock of the unexpected that was always an essential part of listening to the Floyd? With the many excited new listeners this package has attracted, it's easy. But how do you continue to jar the perceptions of people who have been listening to some of these tracks every day for 30 years? How do you provide the \\"cognitive dissonance\\", the shock to the listener's world-view, the disturbing element that made their original work so...disturbing. Simple! <br />(1) You leave out a couple of landmark songs that your greatest fans would expect to find in there (e.g. Careful With That Axe Eugene).<BR>(2) You chuck in a couple of historical curiosities (e.g. When The Tigers Broke Free).<BR>(3) You play the odd mixing trick with tracks whose every tick is ingrained in many people's subconscious (e.g. the echoing repeats at the end of Us And Them). <BR>(4) Finally, and most importantly, you calculatedly and ironically and post-modernly take a couple of tracks that are your real icons, that people would regard any interference with as tantamount to sacrilege (principally Echoes itself), and . . . . . you chop bits out. <br />Would this theory imply that the concept album is dead? Hardly! People are assuming that the chopping out was little more than an accident, to make room for a couple more tracks. I think the chopped-out bits may be the central conceptual flourish of a new concept album - perhaps the most radical concept album of the band's career. So what is the concept? What could be more post-modern, more brazenly self-referential (possibly to the point of narcissism) than a concept album based on the life of (possibly) the greatest band in the world, made by themselves, entirely through the arrangement of their own archives, without a scrap of editorial connecting tissue?<br />This is all speculation, make up your own mind. One alternative is that a recording company executive thought it would simply boost his bonus to get out the scissors and push another greatest hits collection onto the market. But you don't really believe that, do you?<br />To my own surprise, I think the new album works. It contains most of the Floyd's best tracks and a few others, superbly remastered and at an appealing price. Over time, the new sequencing may even start to take root and yield connections that were not there in the original setting.
0452282152|4.0|This is a story about a fictional girl named Griet and her interactions with the factual Johannes Vermeer.  Have you ever looked at a painting or a picture and imagined a whole life for the person or people in the scene?  That's pretty much what Tracy Chavalier does with this novel.  She brings to life the the girl in one Vermeer's paintings.<br />The character she creates is a beautiful wide-eyed innocent girl who matures into womanhood under the roof of Johannes Vermeer.  This girl becomes his assistant and his artistic muse.  Chavalier does a great job in describing the sensuality of Griet.  There are scenes in the novel that send chills all through me.  Chavalier has the talent of turning a simple touch into the most intense experience imaginable.<br />My only complaint would be that I felt that there were times where Chavalier should have given us more insight into her characters. By her lack of doing this, I didn't find myself as emotionally invested in some of Griet's story altering events.<br />Overall, it was a good book.  I didn't want to put it down.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek has got to be one of the funniest films that i have ever seen.  From the start you are taken into an obscure world full of well known characters and adult themed humour.  This film appeals to people of all ages as, it has the cute characters ans colour fot the youngsters and the hidden meanings for the adults.  Mike Myers is fantastic as Shrek who is a green troll who everyone thinks is a savage beast, when in fact he is just a lonely guy who longs for someone to love himm, for who he is and not what he is.  (this is where Cameron Diaz's character comes in)  I could go on forever telling you the story of this film, but i recommend that just go out and buy it as you have probably heard of it.  A must have and a great christmas present

I immediate made it my personal mission to pick up a 8MB Memory Card and I did not regret it. despite some disbelief it does hold a great deal of game saves and is quite easy to use in transfering data between cards and saving from PS2 games quite quickly. The Memory Card is a buy that is really worth it and I would rather buy this than a third party Memory Card that may crap out on me. SO I decided that this would be my best option and I still do think it is a great piece of hardware I bought.

My favourite tracks are Hero (huge commercial sucess), I Will Survive, Maybe, One Night Stand and If The World Crashes.  Enrique has shown that he didnt cash in of the craze, and in fact he is a top artist that can sing and perform just as well as anyone else in the music business

B000003C4K|5.0|This is in my top 5 favourite thrash-metal albums of all time. Metallica's Kill 'em All and the debut Doomsday For The Deceiver from Flotsam and Jetsom are a close 2nd with Slayer's South of Heaven and Torment in Fire by Sacrifice scoring points. Amazing vocals, head-banging guitar's and no song is too short or too long. Just perfect. I have this album on cassette recorded from a co-worker from 1990. I've been looking high and low for it at home with no luck. I can't believe Amazon has it.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I just recently have begun delving into the wide world of Music. I heard Gorillaz first, by seeing Clint Eastwood on MTV. I was so impressed I went out and bought the CD. Gorillaz is a unique sound unto their own. Almost all of their songs are worth listening to more than once. They are a cross of techno, hip hop, rock, etc. Notable songs are &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, &quot;19-2000&quot;, &quot;Sound Check (Gravity)&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;, and &quot;Left Hand Suzuki Method&quot;. If you are interested in weird, electronic music than this is the CD for you.
B000002518|5.0|This is without question the most criminally overlooked album in Saint Bobs canon. The way he transmutes the generic Western outlaw tale into an extended mystical poem about the world-weary souls longing to return to God, without ever betraying the spirit of the original story, is quite astonishing. And as with all of the Masters best works, the music is the quintessence of soulful ethnicity. A wonderful testament to the bottomless spiritual depths of the greatest artist of our times.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Yes! Yes! Yes! <BR>We love it! And putting the movie on both discs was a great idea :) Funny, funky, irreverent movie, well worth it. But if you can't stand a little potty humor, this isn't the movie for you.

It's a funny, easy-reading book that is compared to as a modern \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"  Like A Painted House, he's skipped courtroom thrillers.  I hope he does it again.  Will be looking forward to The Summons, his probable return to the courtroom.

B00005OWEG|5.0|Although &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; is only 49 minutes longer than the original theatrical release, the net effect is to create a very different movie--far more eerie and moody than the original, more connected to the demons driving the characters (and Coppola and the cast, per &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot;).  The result is a film that may be truer to what Coppola experienced and felt during the more than two years he spent making &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; than the one he released to theaters. The quality of this DVD is supremo, the video and audio surpass even the earlier DVD.  As for the extra scenes, they're a mixed bunch: Every bit of extra with Duvall is wonderful.  This was one of his greatest roles, and the additional stuff extends the inspired madness that made his scenes so riveting. Ditto the extra dialog with &quot;Larry&quot; Fishburne, which gave him more character. The scene where they steal Duval's surfboard (and when his coptors come looking for them) humanizes Sheen and establishes comradeship in a way that was missing earlier, and makes a net improvement. The scene with the stranded Playboy bunnies was completely superfluous, and the dialog those poor gals got stuck with was ridiculous and banal.  That one was a flop. The French plantation sequence is hard to figure.  The opening and closing were richly atmospheric, adding to the unreality of the planters' situation. and enhancing the overall mood of anachronism and weirdness.  The dinner was a jumble. The extra Brando footage was actually good, because the longest part (where he reads Time Magazine to Sheen) made him look and sound more like a soldier, less like a beached whale on mescaline.  Sorry they chose to eliminate the final airstrike when the credits rolled (forever).<BR>The critics weren't ready for the original &quot;Apocalypse,&quot; and I think this version would have been a critical and box office disaster if it had been the initial theatrical release.  As a &quot;redux&quot;it's a welcome artistic enhancement, an emotionally and intellectually exhilirating way to look deeper inside one of the all-time greatest films.
0515127485|5.0|I dont normally submit reviews, but felt I had to defend this book against a paltry 5 star rating.  It successfully combines the best features of an historical novel and a thriller  - I was absorbed totally in the sombre atmosphere of the book - a real &quot;must read&quot; that I've recommended to all my friends and family.<br />I prefer it to &quot;fatherland&quot; personally!<br />The ending is excellent - brings the threads all together
B00003CX5P|4.0|Everyone talks about how the deleted scenes are so wonderful, the problem, they remain deleted.  Usually there's a cut and paste option, as with the new Die Hard releases.  You won't find that here.  Perhaps in the next release it will be.  As for the story line.... Lucas is brilliant.  Sure it was a little kiddish, but they will age with the film just like the rest of us did with the origional trilogy, think about it.  A new hope looked like a one time shot, so he couldn't take the kid route.  It's a trilogy, this was only Part I.  My guess is that Part III will be pretty rockin, Part II will have to be better or Part III will never be made. The next films greatness will remain to be seen, but I can see where Lucas is headed.
B000002MP2|5.0|A couple of my friends really liked punk and alternative, and I was into pop awhile ago. They convinced me to start listening to a different radio station and gave my friend this CD for her birthday. From the little that I heard my friend play it, I decided to get the CD. Wow, am I glad I got it! Every song on this album is really cool. My favorite would be &quot;Longview&quot;. I wouldn't really suggest it for people who don't want to hear lots of cussing, because this album has a couple of songs with lots of it. Now, I don't like pop anymore (and I'm so glad). Heck, I don't know, maybe some teenie boppers would like Greenday.  Anyways, I think this CD is way better than their new stuff, they are swaying toward more pop now. So, I really suggest that you buy this album, or at least borrow your friend's!
B00005ATQC|5.0|The film is about a man struggling with his homosexuality or impotence and the impact it has on his wife. Huh? First, Kubrick chose Cruise and Kidman and he was not unaware of the rumors. Then he pits Cruise in all the typical hetero-male fantasies: 2 beautiful women at once, lolita, hooker, someone else's wife, necrophelia and in each case there is a \\"reason\\" why Cruise cannot \\"perform\\". People complain that there is no sexual chemistry between Cruise and Kidman- but there is not supposed to be. And the strange heterosexual world of the orgy is foreign to Cruise b/c he does not have the password- but there of course is no password except to be male. Finally, he is forced to take off his \\"mask\\" at the party and reveal who he really is. He could not even pass in the environment where everyone was getting it on. He is literally made an outcast/ thrown out. The young boys on the street recognize it and call him names and he is cruised in the West Village by an older guy. Even Alan Cummings with his hyperactive Gaydar comes onto him. Cruise hides behind his \\"i am a doctor\\", or \\"i am faithful to my wife\\" but all not credible somehow. They have 1 kid and will not have more which seems perfunctary. Kidman literally goes crazy b/c she realizes her husband is not jealous of her. Why should he be? She is a beautiful and intelligent wife but he is not attracted to her. Who ditches their beautiful wife at a party with rich predators? He \\"trusts\\" her. His jealousy and dream is about the Captain and not her. Nor is he ever turned on by his naked female patients- b/c of \\"loyalty to his wife.\\" Watch the movie again with this lens and you will be shocked at what you see. Kubrick tricked Cruise and Kidman into doing this movie b/c it attests to a sham marraige with the central character dealing with his own impotence or homosexuality. Their dangerous psychodrama is hidden in beautiful halls and clothes and decorum of civilized society...but it is dangerous nevertheless. He is assaulted by all the \\"real\\" men around him, the business man who goes after his wife- Kidman is turned on by him in a way that she is never turned on by Cruise, - the host of the party who does his woman in the bathroom, his band friend who has fathered 5 kids (proof of his manhood), even the Chinese business man in drag gets it up for Lolita but Cruise gets it up for no-one. Gates, long corridors, mansions are classic Kubrick/Freudian symbols for the mystery and inaccessability of the female body/crevices- and Cruise is locked out and/or lost because he lacks natures maps and keys. It is up to other people to let him in. \\"I am a/the doctor- let me in\\" \\"I am a friend of hers/his- let me in\\" \\"I will pay you- let me in.\\" He is always asking to be \\"buzzed in\\"/\\"let in\\" temporarily. He is always outside the gate/door. Just like the discordant notes- that hauntingly plunks throughout the film but calls attention to itself because it does not quite fit or blend into the film- so too Cruise does not fit the life he has constructed for himself. This film will rise in importance over time- a masterpiece- that neither the critics nor the stars nor the public understood. I urge you all to see this movie again.ed by all the \\"real\\" men around him, the business man who goes after his wife- Kidman is turned on by him in a way that she is never turned on by Cruise, - the host of the party who does his woman in the bathroom, his band friend who has fathered 5 kids (proof of his manhood), even the Chinese business man in drag gets it up for Lolita but Cruise gets it up for no-one. Gates, long corridors, mansions are classic Kubrick/Freudian symbols for the mystery and inaccessability of the female body/crevices- and Cruise is locked out and/or lost because he lacks natures maps and keys. It is up to other people to let him in. \\"I am a/the doctor- let me in\\" \\"I am a friend of hers/his- let me in\\" \\"I will pay you- let me in.\\" He is always asking to be \\"buzzed in\\"/\\"let in\\" temporarily. He is always outside the gate/door. Just like the discordant notes- that hauntingly plunks throughout the film but calls attention to itself because it does not quite fit or blend into the film- so too Cruise does not fit the life he has constructed for himself. This film will rise in importance over time- a masterpiece- that neither the critics nor the stars nor the public understood. I urge you all to see this movie again.
0385505833|2.0|Yes, Virginia, it does end happily, sort of, but Skipping Christmas is smug, cynical, repetative and derivative, all wrapped up in one easy to wrap package, just like a lump of coal.<br />The characters aren't particularly sympathetic--they aren't even truly awful like Scrooge--they just sort of whine and complain.<br />Some of the points are good, but we already knew that, and the pseudo-redemption at the last is too little, too late. Skip this book.
B00005OWEG|1.0|The original Apocalypse was a dark classic, this new version just flat out sucks. The new scenes take away from the flow of the story (and are sooooooooo boring and unnecessary) - especially unbelieveable is that in this new bad version almost half of the group of army gentlemen have romantic encounters w/ playboy playmates!  Ugh!  Like that really happened to any of the real soldiers that served in Viet Nam.  Skip this one and buy the original version instead.  Apocalypse Redux is as stinky as Godfather III.
0553812173|3.0|According to the press info this is Erikson's first published book and to a certain extent it shows.  The dialogue seems a bit forced (although this improves later on). And there's a large cast of characters that didn't seem very well differentiated to me- too many similar names and descriptions.<br />Having said this, there are some very interesting ideas here- Warrens are very original.  Some of the army organisation reminded me of vietnam-era stuff (especially the dragonflies) which was refreshing.  The world building is on an epic scale.  Plenty of people have compared this book to the George RR Martin series.  I would align it more towards David Gemmel's territory.<br />For a first book this is pretty good.  I watch with interest...
0767849493|5.0|Kevin Smith fans, rejoice!  If &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; left you cold because it was too serious, you will be pleased to know that Smith returns to his formula in this movie and only shows you whats funny.  Bring your sense of humor as Smith pokes fun at religion in every concievable way.  I don't recomend you eat while watching this film however, as things more gross than Ben Affleck will be making an appearance.  Buy this film, and maybe extra copies so you can loan it out to your friends.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Okay let me get this out of the way, all you people talking about how anti-human this movie is, know what your talking about before you even think that. The movie sends no such message, it's a mythological story it's almost like this anime is teaching us a lesson: Don't mistreat nature. I don't know, that doesn't sound anti-human at ALL. Second of all, I read a couple of reviews that say it's too violent, well, it's rated PG 13, so to the people who show their 7 year-olds this movie and say it's too violent-- well read the rating and make sure your child is mature enough to watch this movie. This movie did not disgust me at ALL. Sure the boars do look ugly, but that's to show how one-sided they are. Now on to the review.<BR>Animation: Superb<BR>Dubbing: No anime's dubbing is too good, but this one is pretty nice<BR>Plot: Here is the movie's strong point <BR>Creativity: Definitely <BR>There are tons of reviews that tell the story, so I'll skip it. The animation as I said is superb from the character's facial expressions to their body language it's all done masterfully. The backgrounds are as impressive from the smallest leaf to the largest river they're all done in incredible detail. The movie is definitely creative, there are little glowing clicking beings (I forget what they're called), also the NightWalker is a most fascinating creature. With the plot, you might think it's over, but then BAM something changes. Also, what some call the \\"boring\\" parts are to build the characters, plot, and frequently give hints on what's going to happen next. As I said earlier, I think it leaves us wondering why we're doing what we are doing to the environment. The dubbing, well, it isn't necessarily bad, but let's face it no anime's dubbing is particularly memorable. So, all in all this is an Anime classic please, do yourself a favor and watch Princess Mononoke.

It's an incredibly humorous twist to what many of us have as as a Christmas memory.  If you don't find this funny, get a humor transplant.
0671799320|5.0|A very interesting and masterly account of the oil Industry, right from the its humble origins in Western Pennsylvania where Col. Drake drilled the first oil well in 1859, to 1990 and Saddam Hussein's invasion of Europe. Mr. Yergin combines the remarkable story-telling style of Gibbon (Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire) with the intensely factual and rigorous analysis style of Paul Keneddy (Rise and Fall of Great POwers). The result is a book which you shall like, irrespective of whether your interest is in stories or in the economics or in the politics of oil.<BR>An understanding of Oil and its Strategic Significance as a natural resource have driven the foreign policy of all major powers all through the 20th century.<BR>This book also offers insights into the Psyche of the oil producing nations and the factors governing their policy. The experiences of Oil companies in other nations and the issues faced by them (Nationalization etc.) offer lessons to be learnt for any multi national company intent on doing business across borders.
B00004T0P1|5.0|Wow! I've never seen the movie or even heard about it since a couple of days back when I stumbled over it here at Amazon. I read the reviews and listened to the clips; that was all I needed to make the decision to buy it. I popped it into my CD-player and when hearing &quot;The egg travels&quot; something remarkable happened: I got goosebumps! And that, my friend, is something that don't happen very often to me when listening to music. This phenomenon kept appearing throughout the entire score, never have I enjoyed a score so much. <br />It's a ride spanning all facets of the human psyche.<br />If you liked the score from Dragonheart by Randy Edelman you can rest assured that you will enjoy this score too.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Their music is so sweet. I swear when I was listening to some songs I couldn't believe that we have such soft and touchable songs in the world we live. I own all three CDs for Secret Garden plus their DVD, they're all very beautiful and I'm so glad I have them all. Listen to the samples and if you like it then buy it without thinking. If you like Yanni, Enya, or Enigma then you'll love this music. You won't believe how beautiful the music is until you hear it your self. I can't wait for their new CD.
B00005Q45W|5.0|A culmination of all that has gone before, this album distills the essence of Leonard Cohen to a remarkably fine, almost unbearably taut, lovely and exhilarating sound demanding to be heard lying in bed, in the dark, with your arms wrapped around someone you love.  The sparse musical accompaniment and background singing serves to elegantly highlight the ever deeper, starker, bass enunciations of Mr. Cohen and gives this album a hauntingly wonderful presence that should be recognized in the musical world for what it is:  the best damn thing to come out in quite some time.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek was the funniest movie of the year. With the great cast of Mike Meyers, Eddie Murfey, Cameron Diaz, John Withgow, and other great, hesterical voices, this movie was sure to make it to the top.But no one knew for sure just how funny it was  going to be until they actually saw it. Jokes are secretly placed in the movie for not only children but adults too. From big ugly ogers, to pinoccio, this movie will get the whole family laughing from beginning to end. They added new, funny features to the video that werent in the movie, which is more of a reason why the video was 10 times better than the movie! I totally recomend this movie for EVERYONE!
B00005LC1H|5.0|The superb quality of the writing and performances in this British comedy masterpiece is well documented in many places, so I will limit my review to the technical qualities of this DVD: Fawlty Towers - Complete Series.<br />The content extras are great, including a few interviews, and the very entertaining short about the real Torquay and the eccentric innkeeper who inspired Cleese to develop the Fawlty Towers series (written together with Connie Booth, of course).<br />I've had FT on video for many years. Six months ago I moved into a large loft and installed a front-projection home theater. My screen is 162&quot; diagonal (13.5'), which is just huge. It's incredible for enjoying high quality DVDs but the much lower quality limitations of VHS (low scan lines) makes most tapes very unsatisfying to watch on such a large screen system. (I have since set about replacing most of my favorite VHS tapes with DVDs, as available. And this brings me to the much anticipated release of Fawlty Towers on DVD.)<br />I have encountered some DVD releases of television productions (1970's to 1990's) which were very disappointing in video quality. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the superior quality of DVD over VHS, since Fawlty Towers is from 1975-1979. But apparently the great popularity of this series in Britain led to outstanding preservation of high quality tape masters.<br />I was surprised to see such high resolution and detail, great color rendition (for a TV production), and totally stable imaging (no shifts, jumps, skips, blips, etc).<br />Considering its 1970's origin and that FT was produced for television, I would rate the video quality of this DVD at 10/10. I am extremely pleased, it's almost as good as film, and is absolutely at the top of its class when compared to virtually any other DVD releases of television programs from 10 years ago (or older). It's even better than a lot of poorly mastered DVDs of modern theatrical releases. They did an outstanding job digitizing FT from very high quality master tapes.<br />With the sharpness and detail, aficionados of FT will enjoy seeing subtleties in the character's clothing, the wallpaper, titles on books &amp; magazines, times on clocks, and the intricate detail of all the sets and furnishings. And all of this detail will be new to you, since it was never possible on VHS. It's fascinating to enjoy these many nuances!!<br />I've loved Fawlty Towers for more than 10 years. And this superb DVD couldn't be better. Now I can admire this comedic tour-de-farce for decades to come.<br />Now if someone would just release &quot;The Rise &amp; Fall of Reginald Perrin&quot; in an equally well-mastered DVD set, my dreams would be one step closer to fulfillment. (And make that all 21 episodes please, not just the first two seasons). By the way, if you haven't discovered &quot;Reginald Perrin&quot;, starring Leonard Rossiter (also of &quot;Rising Damp&quot;), try to get a copy ... I think it's also a britcom masterpiece.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Many have commented on the religious tone of this LP, but this LP I believe goes beyond the black and white of what one man believes. This LP \\"The Rainbow Children\\", shows the road we all must take is the road to understanding our Higher Power and so ourselves, no matter what religious domaination we follow. Yes, we have as Prince fans have grown accustom to the sexual tones of his music from old, but just as all of us must do in thickness of time...we must grow. I highly recommend this LP not only to the average Prince fan but to all people on the journey to personal enlightment and for those that just enjoy the funk!:) - Zeinabau
B0000026DJ|4.0|This Cd was my first contact with Midnight Oil. I know they've been around for many years, but it's just that I'm more into heavy rock than pop rock. But this Cd is marvellous written, simple guitar/bass/drums and straighforwarded vocals. I liked it very much.

B000002KHH|2.0|I'ma  huge Sabbath fan. I know, I know this album is considered a mark in the hystory of metal, etc, etc. But I just can't prefer it to Sabbath's debut or MASTER OF REALITY. The production here sounds without life, I don't know, something is not right here, even containing the classics. Of all Sabbath stuff with Ozzy, this is the second I listen less ( after Technical Ecstasy).
B00000J8EK|1.0|My mother's washing machine and dryer make the same sounds. Turn on the buzzing laundry room overhead light and the snapping and popping of Uncle Paul's insect zapper and BABY WE GOT A DEAD CERT!! Their music is pure dreck!
B000003N7G|5.0|When I got this album I was a fairly cocky &quot;guitar nerd&quot; type who loved imitating the likes of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. A friend told me that John Coltrane had been an influence on Jimi Hendrix, who had of course been a big influence on my heroes. Well, I have to say this music did it for me in a big way. It helped me to see that technique did not necessarily have to lead to aimless flaunting and big, bad hairdo's (the all too obvious problem with most instrumental rock). Still, the beauty of the album took a while to grow on me. I was cocky enough to mistake &quot;out&quot; notes for bad notes. I simply thought the guy didn't know his scales. Still, I liked it. It had soul and it wasn't afraid to take itself seriously. In fact A Love Supreme would easily top any poll regarding &quot;serious soulfulness&quot; in a jazz recording. The lesson, I guess, is that great music is not created to be deconstructed, but rather to be enjoyed. Let this album wash through you (not over) and you'll feel some very nice effects.
0002171856|5.0|It is an excellent book with lots of advices and with colourful pictures in dangerous plants and animals. It is so comprehensive, gives info surviving techniques from car accident, camping to disasters.
B000002699|5.0|It may be the beginning of Miles' largely annoying foray into electric funkrock, but In a Silent Way is sweet and lyrical with the best of em. I love this album's ability to train my most scattered thoughts and bring me back to earth following a long day or night.
1577311523|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's message isn't new. His book is meant to point us toward enlightenment, <BR>and thus his teachings aren't much different than that of Buddhism.

B000002LRX|5.0|Faith No More have exactly two albums worth listening to. But when it rains it pours. Along with The Real Thing, Angel Dust set a template that later funk/metal acts should have studied a lot more closely. This album is bursting with inspiration like a science experiment gone wonderfully wrong. You may feel these guys have all the good intentions of a pack of starving pihrannas, and you'd be right, but for all their bad intentions, you can't help feeling good after hearing RV and Land of Sunshine. I've had to buy 4 copies of this one over the years, but I'd do it again. These guys may be cynical, but they're not cheap.
B00003CXXI|1.0|I don't understand why everyone thinks this is such a charming movie.  The message is subtle, but very potentially damaging, especially to little girls-- AND boys.  It says an ugly person can have love, but only with another ugly person.  Or, put another way, if you are attractive and fall in love with someone who's ugly, it will make you ugly by association.  How much more powerful, positive (and, yes subversive, which is why they didn't write it this way) it would have been if the girl would have stayed pretty but lived happily ever after with Shrek anyway!  Try explaining that to your kids!  Or, if a pretty MAN had fallen in love and lived happily ever after with a homely WOMAN with disgusting personal habits!  Here's another subtle aspect of the movie that sent a very negative message.  When the princess was pretty, she was saucy and self-confident.  During her homely, overweight spells, she became shy and awkward.  Not only her looks, but her personality changed, as well.  It's definitely not okay by Hollywood's standards to be a saucy, self-confident, homely and overweight gal, and this movie sends that message big-time.  What is so strange is that so many Americans lap this stuff up without question, and seemed to think the movie was saying looks are not important.  Has popular culture rendered them that brain-dead?
B000002UVX|5.0|Um, I like this album cuz it's cool and the songs are really meaningful and noone plays guitar as good as Jimi. Also, this is the album that helped bring rock and R&amp;B together. Nevermind the incredible guitar solos on machine gun, what about the content?! Jimi knew how to recite poetry on the guitar as well as Beethoven with the orchestra. It's totally epic. This album is as essential to rock as anything by the Beatles and as essential to R&amp;B/soul as anything by Marvin Gaye. But mostly it's cool and has really good songs. And Stuff.
B000000XB9|5.0|What can I say?. Creedence Clearwate Revival are rock and roll gods. This 20 song collection has the best of the best all put together. One rocking ride from start to finish. Many people have called this southern fried rock band the 'Backwoods Beatles'. They couldn't be more correct. Lead singer and writer John Fogerty is a genius. He was the master at crafting hook filled rock songs. &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, &quot;Born On The Bayou&quot;, &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; and others are pure rock and roll classics. There are other tracks on here that were hits, but not as well known or as often played. Those songs being &quot;Commotion&quot;, &quot;Sweet Hitchhiker&quot;, <BR>&quot;Hey Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Lodi&quot;. Fogerty's voice had a very distinct wail to it. You instantly knew who it was when they started singing. His guitar playing is nothing short of brilliant, Yet, he never gets the credit for it that he deserves. There's even a nice remake of Marvin Gaye's &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot;. I think Marvin would be pleased. Volume 2 of hits is great as well, but does not feature as much essential material. This album is for rock and roll lovers. Because this is, pure and simple, real rock and roll. A band with great music to be treasured for years and years to come.
B000005JA8|5.0|That is a poem that showed up on my fridge one morning following a very raucous party. I thought it was so appropriate to my mood that I kind of adopted it as a motto. Beefheart is music for people who think ugly is peachy. If you like fart jokes and think Blink 182 is too damn squeaky clean, this may be your man. The captain is wild, romantic, scatological and deep. He's also very ugly.
B000002AH7|2.0|No es ni cerca la mejor interpretacion de Davis y es por lejos la peor colaboracion que tuvo con Evans.
B000002552|5.0|Some people say this is a classic, most say they never heard of it. This album is full of surrealist wit that's actually witty. It has songs like Please Mrs. Henry, that any drunk can relate to. It is as good as Blonde on Blonde and more user friendly than Highway 61. It comes off as Dylan's most earnest recording. And it's pretty cheap. YOU should get it!
B00005NWM3|2.0|After rushing out to buy Silver Side Up,and listening to it, I asked one question: Can I take it back? To bad I can't. The radio hit \\"How you remind me\\" is a good song, over played, but a good song. How stupid of me to think that a band these days would actually put out a through and through good record. NickelBack certainly didn't. <BR>If you want to know what the CD sounds like here's what you do: listen to the first track and set it in repeat, no need to listen to the whole album because all the songs are the same. Better yet listen to Creed on a hangover, there really isn't a difference between the two band musical styles. <BR>NickelBack seems to think that since they have found the formula for a decent song that we wont notice that they cant do anything else but whine and be depressed. Not to mention that all songs start out with a guitar solo, then come the drums...oh and here comes the base. They sing with angst of hard childhoods and of lost love, all while trying to make a marketable product. I think we've all heard it before. <BR>To NickleBack: Life can't be that bad, you're selling millions of records! Suck it up and move on, get some therapy or at least some anti-depressants. Any one who buy's this CD will need the same thing  once they've realized that they've wasted (their money).
6305910103|5.0|Indeed, it is one of the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies of all that tells a good story with a very perfect villain! This sequel to the &quot;Space Seed&quot; episode is a perfect vehicle for bringing back Khan(brilliantly played by Ricardo Montalban) to take his revenge on Admiral Kirk(William Shatner: the man!), and the crew of the starship Enterprise! Having been left on the planet Ceti Alpha V by Captain Kirk, Khan is accidently discovered by a federation starship! Soon Khan takes control of the ship, and a very powerful weapon called Genesis, for his plan to finish off  Kirk once and for all. With time running out, it's up to our federation heroes to save the universe! Fast paced, and action-packed, it's a must for any &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan!!!
B00005RFQ5|3.0|I bought THE RAINBOW CHILDREN the day it came out. While I will admit it is a departure, and he is expanding musically, I have to say I am very disapointed with this album. He's moved into another spiritual phase, much like 1988's LOVESEXY, but he misses the mark in my opinion. A newly reformed Jehovah's Witness, the album is filled with spiritual and religious songs, as well as political beliefs and so forth. Good for him, but musically this album disapoints me. I like the jazzyness and soulfulness of the album, but I feel so many things distract from the music. First those spoken verses in the deep voice, almost some sort of biblical voice or meaning, they really bug me and detract from the music. I'd prefer just to hear the songs, not a spoken intro (which only occurs on some songs, but enough to bother me). He's moved into a new genre, which is good that he's expanding his wings, but I feel like only his fans that love almost all of his work will like this one, I feel he's alienated a whole group of fans with THE RAINBOW CHILDREN. I'll pass on this one, I'm on my way to return it for a refund, but hopefully you will enjoy it, but I would suggest pre-listening to it before purchase. I'm glad he's talking about controversial issues once again, but I feel disapointed overall with this album. Not for everyone, but I'm sure there are people that will love this album because its so diverse and unlike anything else, it's just not for me.
B000059HGY|5.0|\\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" is a classic Pear Harbor epic.  The film meticulously recreates the stunning attack on the U.S. pacific fleet by the Japanese on the day of December 5, 1941.

0688156819|5.0|This is my favourit book of all times. Last year I asked for it for Christmas and was so happy when I recieved it. It is pure brilliance. While empathizing with the tragic characters in the book you can also laugh(if you like dark humour) I loved this book so much, I memorized almost every single poem in it. I reccomend it for anyone that has a twisted sense of humour.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I am 47 years old. My college-student daughter played &quot;Make Yourself&quot; for me. She said I wasn't supposed to like it. Now she's mad at me because I LOVE it. And now that I bought &quot;Morning View&quot;, she's even madder. Says old people like me will spoil her favorite band. The problem is - this is great stuff ! Incubus has got to be the most talented bunch of guys since the Beatles (okay, I dated myself there...) The lyrics are incredible, and the music is incredible too. I listen to everything from opera to country, but I've never heard anything like some of the tracks (&quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Aqueous Transmisson&quot;) on this CD.  And &quot;Blood in My Mouth&quot; has lyrics worthy of Shakespeare.  If I could only figure out what &quot;Just a Phase&quot; is about, it might be my favorite of all...
B00004T9UF|5.0|The marshall mathers LP was one of the best cds Ive ever purchased. The controversy was in fact well deserved, but Eminem is a truly good artist, to anyone who likes the rap genre.Especially, hardcore rap, even though he's now mainstream. His lyrics are dazzling, putting him right up there with many of the best rappers. The only people who dislike this album are poeple who take things too seriously or have no clue what true talent is. If you like Jay-Z,Dr dre, ja rule, nelly, Missy Elliot, scar face, D12, bubba sparxx, and other underground and mainstream rap artists eminem is a must have.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|This is Prince's first album since reclaiming his old name. Aside from three tired sounding songs (the work pt.1, 1+1+1 is 3 and the everlasting now) that are throwbacks from his sound of the eighties, there is little here that evokes the memories of the rock 'n' blues &quot;God&quot; of yesteryears. That might indeed be a blessing in disguise. <BR>Prince has long been in need of a serious revision of his sound for the last five years. He is one of the great song writers and musicians of our time. This means that there are always elements of genius in his work (She loves me 4 me, last December and family name),but it has also meant that he's arrogantly stubborn. This album suffers from Prince trying too hard to force feed his new religious thought down our hears (rainbow children, the everlasting now) with some long boring sub-standard songs. Narration throughout the album is delivered by a deep anonying voice which makes you wonder if anyone in the studio ever criticises Prince. Religion is not new to Prince ablums, he just need to present it in a less &quot;old testiment&quot; way.<BR>Next time out I suggest he hires a co-producer, pays-off Larry Graham and rights songs about everyday events and &quot;everyday people&quot;. If this is the &quot;Dawn&quot; then someone needs a strong cup of coffee!
B00003CX5P|3.0|If this had been the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie to hit theaters 20 years ago, I'm confident that it would have been a flop, there wouldn't have been a part 2 or 3, and there wouldn't now be, 20+ years later, a Star Wars legacy with millions of fans world-wide. If asked to stand on its own, this movie just crumbles under own weight. The acting is abysmal, the dialog isn't much better, and though the plot has a lot going for it, it falls completely flat under Lucas's bad direction. The spark of magic George had when he directed Episode 4 is pretty much absent from this production. I don't mean to be offensive, but for a great many of us this movie was a HUGE letdown, and it simply does not stand on its own merits. <br />The DVD on the otherhand is a pretty impressive production. It is loaded with all sorts high-quality extras including a great &quot;making of&quot; documentary, deleted scenes, commentary, and much more. Though I dislike the movie, I feel that the DVD is worth owning simply because of the weath of interesting information available in these extras.
0395645662|5.0|I have read this book over and over agian because it will never be old.  I read this book in the sixth grade and after we read it i knew i had to get my own copy.  It was so good that used to be all i read until i read Lois Lowery's Gathering Blue.  In my opinion everyone should own this book.  It is the best book i have read and own. I recomend it to anyone.

B00005LOUP|5.0|Pretty much all of us know the classic Dr. Seuss story about the Grinch, a somewhat green meanie, who wants to stop Christmas from coming to his local neighbor's, the Who's.  Ron Howard's film version starring rubber faceman Jim Carrey simply takes that story and adds a bit more to it (to fill the extra hour and twenty minutes of running time as opposed to the original cartoon version's 25 minutes).  I for one love the backstory that was created.  I always wondered why did the Grinch hate the Who's so much.  What made him hate Christmas?  These questions are answered quite well with some well imagined backstory of the Grinch as a child who actually grew up among the Who's, only to be ridiculed and made fun of for his strange appearence and unique behavior.  It seems that the Green one became interested in a young girl that another boy liked (and who ultimately would later became the Mayor of Whoville).  The film evens goes on to have Cindy Lou Who (who's given a bigger part in the film) question her family's values of what Christmas is really about...presents?...buying stuff?..is that's all it's about?..she wonders.  It is she who realizes the good in the Grinch and crusades for him to be head chairmeister at one of the Who celebrations.  I'm not sure what other people were really expecting, but this is pretty much what I thought the movie should and would be like.  The sets and costumes are amazing..very Seussian!  And Jim Carrey?...Well, I personally believe that Jim is great in everything he does and doesn't recieve enough credibilty by critics and certain moviegoers mainly because of where he came from (i.e. comedy and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, the film that made him a star).  I think critics that gave the film a bad review missed the whole point and probably need to watch fewer films 'cause they're obviously burntout!  All I can say is the fans have spoken, which is why, despite lukewarm reviews, the film went on to become a huge hit and success back in November of 2000!  I will still of course watch the cartoon version, but this version will also find plenty of time in my DVD player as well!<br />My only gripe with the DVD is that certain special features are too short or missing.  The &quot;Spotlight on Location&quot; is barely over 7 minutes long.  There are about 5 such featurettes included on the DVD that run between 4 to 10 minutes long.  With such an interesting story like &quot;The Grinch&quot;, a 60 minute or longer documentary should've been made to really take us inside not just the filming process, but the world of Seuss and Whoville as well.  The other disappointment is there is no audio commentary included.  I had almost expected one from director Ron Howard, who had always done one for previous Universal Pictures Collector's Edition DVDs (Apollo 13 &amp; EDtv).  I really wanted to know more about just how stressful it was on Jim Carrey to wear the Grinch costume.  From interviews I've seen by Howard on Late Nite talk shows, Carrey became so tortured that he ripped the mask off his face and walked off the set.  He was in the makeup chair everyday for 92 days straight.  They had to get a Navy Seal team leader to instruct Carrey on ways of dealing with torture just so he could finish the shoot (no joke).  This kind of story deserves much more insight, which is why I'm so disappointed that no commentary is available on the disc.  So whenever people say Jim Carrey wasn't good as The Grinch, I scoff and say, &quot;he went through torture to make that movie!&quot;  Some people are just hard to please.  But don't let it ruin your Holiday Spirit!  Add &quot;The Grinch&quot; to your collection today.  And catch the special sneak preview trailer of E.T. The Extraterrestrial on this DVD (just before the movie begins), coming only to theaters in March 2002, with added footage, new special effects shots and more!<br />The Grinch - It's not easy being green.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Howard Shore's score for FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is quite simply the best film score since 1993's SCHINDLER'S LIST.  I stand by that.<br />It's a moving, powerful operatic piece of work, the sort John Williams used to do but not anymore.  I am maniacal about all things LOTR, but I can give my honest assessment of this score separate from Tolkien's work, and I can say that this score is phenomenally great and will be remembered at Oscar time.<br />The best tracks, &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, &quot;The Bridge At Khazad Dum&quot; and &quot;The Breaking Of The Fellowship&quot; are amazing.  The dark choir for &quot;Bridge&quot; is ominous, and the themes of the Fellowship and for Frodo resonate with beauty and magic. <br />I can't hype this wonderful CD enough.  It is magic.
B00005OWIU|4.0|I felt like I had a &quot;deja-vu&quot; experience--the soundtrack reminded me of the &quot;Home Alone&quot; soundtrack. I checked it out, and, sure enough, John Williams also did the soundtrack for &quot;Home Alone&quot;.  I still enjoyed it, however; it was perfectly suited to the movie.
B000002JSP|5.0|A lot of people know the story behind this album:  Jimmy Page was in a heroin craze, Robert Plant had recently lost a son.  In spite of all the hardships, the quality of their work did not suffer, it just altered slightly.  Led Zeppelin are often thought of as guitar based.  Here, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones takes the reins and shows us what he's got.  The result is an excellent album which is highly underrated.<br />Though Jimmy Page was addicted to heroin, neither his guitar playing nor the production of the album suffered at all.  There is just more keyboard than there was before.  In Through the Out Door kicks off with &quot;In The Evening,&quot; which starts off with Jimmy Page bowing his guitar, making interesting sounds.  There is also an excellent guitar solo.  Next is &quot;South Bound Saurez,&quot; one of two tracks in the Led Zeppelin catalogue not credited to Jimmy Page as a writer, except for the drum solo &quot;Bonzo's Montreux,&quot; which is found on Coda.  Credited to John Paul Jones and Robert Plant, the song is upbeat and catchy, and features another excellent Jimmy Page solo.  The single from the album, &quot;Fool In The Rain,&quot; follows, a catchy song, one of Zep's most singable tracks.  Surprisingly, this song is not featured on any of LZ's compilations, except for the 4CD set.  I know lots of people who enjoy this song.  Next, the band takes a stab at rockabilly, with the awesome, catchy, upbeat &quot;Hot Dog.&quot;  The track features excellent piano work from JPJ and a fab Page solo.  The song that follows gives listeners of the time a taste of what music would sound like in the eighties.  &quot;Carouselambra&quot; features synth-pop sounds from the keyboards, a song ahead of its time.  The next two songs are absolutely beautiful, and are alone worth the price of the album.  &quot;All My Love&quot; was a staple on AOR radio stations, which features beautiful keyboard work from JPJ, including what could easily be the best keyboardsolo of all time.  Page's guitar work on this song isn't as stand-out as on other tracks, but still excellent.  Closing the album is the lush, beautiful, mellow &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl,&quot; a slow bluesy track in 3/4 time.  These last two songs have been known to take me to a state beyond the unconciousness, lost in the beauty of it all.<br />Though some Zeppelin fans do not like this album, it is actually very good if you give it a chance.  I would not recommend starting off with this album, but definitely to hardcore Zeppelin fans.  Some of you may not like it much at first, but give it a chance, you will not be disappointed.
0385505833|1.0|I am not a big John Grisham fan to begin with, but thought I would give this one a try because it wasn't his usual legal focus.  What a waste of time and money!  This book was dull, dull, dull.  Grisham should definetly stick to legal writing.  He has no business trying to write a &quot;cute&quot; Christmas story.
0553583182|5.0|This book is about positive affirmation. It is easy to find an affirmation for any problem you have. The Table of Contents is so specific it is like an index. Like most books you have to weed through the rhetoric and style, but there is very valuable information here. I will always keep my dog-eared, highlighted, margin written in copy. This book gave me hope when I needed it most. Continue to believe in yourself! Good Luck.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I was excited to see it and even bought it, my duaghter thought it was good and, well she is 4 so there you have it! I thought Angelina looked great but the character was very dull, not mysterious. We just kept waiting for it to have some content. Some okay action scenes but no Indiana Jones quality.
B00004W52U|5.0|If you haven't heard this album, you've pretty much missed the entire backing behind the revival of punk and ska. However, you have come across it on your searches, so, you get points there... Op Ivy is filled with all the elements that made the older punk rockers so great: Fast-paced Music, Poetic Lyrics and a general sense of Unadulterated Fun. This album comes, by me, highly recommended... for you.
B00004WIDR|1.0|This film gets one star only because there isn't an option for 0 stars!The first jurassic park was exceptional,good acting,well written!But this!Very poor acting,lousy action sequences and more plot holes than you can shake a stick at!Spielberg should have stuck with the novel instead of releasing this dino excrement!
B00005OM4N|5.0|I have all 3 of Britney's albums and I only liked a handful of songs on the first two.  Since this album came out, I haven't taken it out of my CD player.  It is an upbeat album, with only one slow song.  My favorites are &quot;Slave 4 You&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot;.  The only song I don't care for is her remake of &quot;I Love Rock 'n Roll&quot;, and the song &quot;Let Me Be&quot; is just ok.  I personally think a lot of the songs on this album remind me a lot of something that Janet Jackson would do.  Britney, please keep it up!!!
B00005O5JV|4.0|Legally Blonde is about a girl who gets dumped by her boyfriend. He says it's because she's not serious enough. The girl decides to become serious and goes to Hardford Law School, where she knows he will be attending. She forms herself into a great lawyer, and decides that if he didn;t want her for who she was then, then he can't have her for who she is now.
6303014100|5.0|This is an outstanding film. Based upon Michael Shaara's Pulitzer prize winning book, \\"The Killer Angels\\", it tells the story of the battle at Gettysburg, which took place over the first three days of July in 1863. For the most part, the film  examines that pivotal battle, one of the bloodiest of the war, from the perspective of the commanders who were calling the shots (no pun intended).<br /><br />The viewer will be enthralled by the film's recreation of the battle at Gettysburg, which examines some of the militairy stratagems employed and the reasons for them. It attempts to explain how it was that over fifty thousand (50,000) men lay dead or injured at its conclusion. It also recreates one of the most amazing routs in history, when Union Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, defying the odds, held off the Confederates at Little Round Top, part of the high ground that the Union needed to retain at Gettysburg. Chamberlain, who was not a professional soldier but a professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, ultimately received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor and success in holding the Confederacy at bay at Little Round Top. Jeff Daniels, who plays the role of Chamberlain, is superlative.<br /><br />The rest of the star studded cast is likewise marvelous. Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee, Richard Jordan as General Lewis Armistead, and Stephen Lang as General Pickett, in particular, all deserve a standing ovation, as does Jeff Daniels. This is a film that attempts to be historically accurate, and it succeeds brilliantly. It does not glamorize war, but shows it in all its heartbreaking reality. It even depicts General Pickett's audacious charge, which saw the loss of an entire division of Confederate soldiers. This is a film entirely about the men who took part in the battle at Gettysburg and the outcome that set the course for the country we know today. Kudos to director Robert F. Maxwell, who directed this film. It is simply a magnificent movie. Bravo!s simply a magnificent movie. Bravo!
B00005LOUS|5.0|This was a great movie about an evil green dude named the Grinch who lives on top of Mount Crumpit with his dog Max. Max seems to be the only one the Grinch tollerates, and follows him everywhere. The Grinch and Max together experience lots together. You'll definately see this in the movie.

B00004YW6I|5.0|This is definitely one to own. As one of my top 5 Cd's ever, I highly recommend this one. I noticed that it's a great Cd to play on a dreary day and a great Cd to play on a sunny day.
0525457585|5.0|It is difficult to find words equal to the task of praising this novel. I first received it as a gift when I was thirteen. I have read it two or three times a year since then, and I am now thirty. Ende uses the adventures of a fat, nerdy little kid launched into an imaginary world of fantasy to expose the mysteries at the heart of the human soul. Although a simple and action-packed tale you could read to a child of nine or ten at bedtime, this story is in fact an intricate and elegant allegory about the nature of life, love, divine inspiration, the written word and the joy and dangers of reading. It is a book that exalts the soul and has enriched my life immeasurably. You will not regret reading it.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I am not going to go into plot detail and everything else that you may already know about the Godfather movies.<br />What I will tell you is that you owe it yourself, if you have a DVD player, to get this collection. If you don't have a DVD player this collection is worth getting one just so you can watch it. If you have never seen them like myself until I got this collection, it is definitely worth buying. If you don't want to buy it, but put it on your Christmas list, make it the one thing you want most!<br />The movies of course are spectacular, but the bonus material disk shows auditions for the parts, by actors you cannot believe it is awesome! <br />If you have been looking for a reason to buy a DVD player, here it is, want to own a great collection, here it is! What are you waiting for?
0451169514|5.0|This is my first Stephen King book I read.  This book is full of unforgetable scenes.  It will make you laugh, cry, and urinate.  Overall it showed me a new  perspective toward life.  A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.
0871137380|5.0|I think that the book is simply outstanding and could hardly put it down once I got started. The writing of the combat scenes and especially the information the author provided on the background of the many of the Rangers reminded me of the men that I served with and thus made them vividly real for me. As I read about each of these men, I found myself looking toward the end of the book and hoping that this guy or that guy made it. I highly recommend this book.

B000002JSV|5.0|They say trust the art and not the artist but it's impossible not to agree with Angus Yong when he cites Powerage as his band's greatest studio album.  Powerage is AC/DC at their most raw and bluesy, yet it's also  the most ambitious, diverse and emotionally rich record they ever put out.  Basically it has everything:  in Riff Raff, an epic paean to rock `n roll that eclipses even Let Their Be Rock, in Up To My Neck and Rock `n Roll Damnation hook-laden pop-boogie to rival Whole Lotta Rose...plus songs of an altogether darker hue like Gone Shootin' and What's Next To The Moon, the latter featuring Bon Scott's uncharacteristically poignant meditation on domestic violence.  Elsewhere Sin City pulses sinisterly with carnal glee,  Kicked In The Teeth screams with inarticulate desperation and heartbreak while Downpayment Blues sees Scott mine a rich vein in black humour and social commentary, again, hardly qualities one associates with the great man's lyrics.  Powerage bore testimony to AC/DC at their most urgent, incendiary and unpredictable, and it was an album they would never equal.
B000006TRV|5.0|this is the best recording of anything ever.
B00003CXA2|5.0|If you want to feel that life is worth living altough you may not have everything on your side, you need to watch this movie. <BR>A movie that is based on the heart of a man who is not very smart, but his lack of intelligence makes him a happy, giving, and honest man.<BR>Outstanding perfomance by Tom Hanks, who has become one of the best actors on Hollywood and one of my favorites actors. <BR>Anyway the whole cast was excellent. Actors such as Sally Field, Gary Sinise, ect are great as well as the movie director Robert Zemeckis.<BR>Excellent movie. Five thumbs up altough i only have two

6302969352|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; has never been surpassed and never will.  The plot is a simple, yet interesting: Residents of a village are basically under the control of bandits who come to the village every year to take their keep.  So one year, the villagers decide they are fed up with this annual practice.  Sometime later, a man (Toshiro Mifune) helps save a child from a madman.  This man turns out to be a Samurai.  He and others find six more Samurai to train the villagers and help fight against the bandits.  <BR>      Throughout the first tape, all the groundwork of the film is laid out very smoothly and it's easy to follow.  The second tape mainly focuses on the campaign against the bandits.  The way that campaign is fought is very impressive.  It really takes the element of medievil strategy to the above and beyond.  There is a great scene near the end of the film in which the bandits try to charge to the front gate.  An opening is left open, one enemy is let in and then the rest of them are closed off  by ambushing villagers from the sides of the gap.  The cinematography in this film is breathtaking, and not just for its time.  One scene early on in which one of the future seven samurai is dueling with a cocky fencer.  It uses slow motion, slight angled panning,(something that must have inspired the Matrix) to create quite a thrilling few seconds.  Dialogue, though subtitled, is not the least bit corny.  But in the midst of the simple plot, there a few of substories.<BR>     &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; has all the good stuff put into it: War, Strategy, Romance, Humor, Action, and Honor...<BR>      Anyone who likes even one the attributes I listed above must buy this.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I'll admit it - I love pop music!  This cd is definitely her best and makes you want to get up on your feet and move to the music! A worthly addition to any pop collection.  Having said that, some of the lyrics are too mature for younger listeners.
0385505833|1.0|I was looking for a book that would help with the Christmas spirit outside of the material aspects we get hung up on. Maybe the end of this book does that, but the majority of the book is just plain boring. So they decide to skip Christmas. Fine. But it just drags on, and on.<br />Best to just skip the time it takes to read this book and go for a walk in the woods and think about what Christmas means to you.
B000007MVU|4.0|What a surprise THIS was when I first bought in over 25 years ago!  Still in high school in the mid-70's, Ringo's SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY served as a wonderful and quirky introduction to what until then had been my DAD's kind of music.  And did it grow on me!  John, Paul &amp; George may have done better music overall, but Ringo remains my favorite Beatle.  I think it's just the warmth of his personality-- which comes across in so many of the numbers here.  My faves include &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;, &quot;Whispering Grass&quot;, &quot;I'm a Fool To Care&quot;, &quot;Dream&quot;, and the absolutely gorgeous &quot;Let The Rest Of The World Go By&quot;.  Some of the arrangements are just TOO strange for my tastes, even now (particularly &quot;Have I Told You Lately That I Love You&quot;-- it's not quite a &quot;Spike Jones&quot;, but it's going that way) and some songs I just don't care much for whoever does them (even Chicago's &quot;Night &amp; Day&quot; didn't grab me, though their Big Band album is a huge fave of mine).  The biggest surprise here over time must be &quot;Blue Turning Grey Over You&quot;.  Anyone wanting to know the definition of the phrase &quot;Over The Top&quot; should put this on.  LOUD!  BLARING!  OUTRAGEOUS!  I laughed myself silly the first dozen or so times I played it... but one day I realized it'd wedged itself in my psyche and wouldn't go!  Now it's one of my favorites on the album.<br />Yep-- before Karen Carpenter, Linda Ronstadt, etc. there was Ringo.  I believe only Cher tried tackling standards before him, but he put her efforts to SHAME in this instance.  Not for everybody, but for many-- highly recommended!
6305603847|4.0|If all you are expecting is to get the movie in a high quality format, with no comprimizes listing to the audio, this DVD won't disappoint.  Don't expect much more, though.<br />Additional features are only mildly interesting, and listening to interviews with Roger Waters interesting but not really enlightening.<br />Listening to the &quot;Directors&quot; audio track is disappointing, as the director isn't on it.  It is just Roger Waters and the animator, who, as it seems, weren't involved enough to have any interesting incites.  Conversations break down in to unrelated tangents about the cycle of child abuse and safety of public parks, punctuated by the occational &quot;oh, hold on.  This is the part I did.&quot;  Ultimately, having the film nararated by two people that haven't watched the film in 20 years was perhaps not the best idea.<br />Again, I believe that the film is a masterpiece, but the supporting content isn't up to snuff.  Maybe they should have waited a couple of more years until everybody involved in the production was on speaking terms again.
0761957553|5.0|One of the things I admire about people is their ability to recognize others who share similar interests and talents and to give credit where credit is due. In the preface to his book Andy Field cites other authors who have written books about SPSS and stastical theory. I have bought those books and they are well worth the price.<BR>This book is an excellent introduction<BR>to both SPSS and statistics. The book is written with a light, humorous style. It has a lot of examples of statistical analysis. It is obvious that the author has an excellent grasp of SPSS and statistics. It contains a very useful bibliography on statistics and SPSS. There is also a CD ROM included. The book is very well organized and has high quality screen prints of SPSS windows and dialogue boxes. It is one of the best software manuals I have ever purchased. It is well worth the price. If you don't purchase any other book on SPSS, purchase this one
B000002HPV|4.0|A brief summation of &quot;Homogenic&quot; is hard to achieve, as undoubtedly all of Bjork's work as a musician normally is. Released amid tabloid furore as Bjork attacked news reporters after long flights to Asia and famously dated British jungle-music beatmaster Goldie, whom she thanks on this album, it was given a mixed reception from critics. Gone was the saucy optimism of &quot;Debut&quot; and the affable schizophrenia of &quot;Post&quot; and here was a new Bjork, hardened and crystalised; and the end result is an album that is both uncompromising and vulnerable, beautifully executed with its titular voice more emotionally charged than ever.<br />Bjork's beats and basslines on &quot;Homogenic&quot; have become harder and less polished, many unflinching in their aural assault, whilst her utilisation of orchestral arrangements has become even more crushingly romantic than before. The mixing of these two elements is what binds all of &quot;Homogenic's&quot; songs together, often beginning with one element before transforming into the other and to finally find transcendence in a juxtaposing of both. The subject matter has changed dramatically in terms of &quot;Homogenic&quot; and its predecessors, with Bjork no longer singing about the joys of sex or the intoxicating anxiety of loving relationships, but more about being cheated by those closest to you and the mourning of a relationship long since dead. Haunting examples include &quot;Unravel&quot;, a slow number with a killer organ solo at its end; &quot;Bachelorette&quot;, the album's power ballad with Bjork pulling out all of the stops alongside a swooningly wonderful arrangement courtest of Eumir Deodato, the man who brought you the strings behind &quot;Post's&quot; &quot;Hyperballad&quot; and &quot;Isobel&quot;. &quot;5 Years&quot;, an embittered stormer of a song that begins harshedly and never lets up, with Bjork giving Alanis Morissette more than a run for her money in terms of the unabashed angst and hurt in her voice; and &quot;Immature&quot;, a recovery after &quot;5 Years&quot; with a delirious Bjork confusedly professing anger and frustration amid a flurry of resuscitation-machine style noises.<br />There is room for rays of light through Bjork's uncompromising melodrama though. There's &quot;Joga&quot;, a thank you to her best friend and 'in-heart member', is so skilfully put together Missy Elliott sampled it for a remix of her hip-hop anthem &quot;Hit Em Wit Da Hee&quot;; &quot;Alarm Call&quot;, the album's pop song with Bjork announcing her love for the world (it's telling though that it's the only song on the album with a swear word); and the closing &quot;All Is Full Of Love&quot;, with Bjork as heartwrenchingly optimistic as on any of her other songs ably supported by synths and shimmers. A standout for sheer power, also, is &quot;Pluto&quot;, a sort-of demonstration of how Bjork would sound if she was to spontaneously combust (let's hope not).<br />&quot;Homogenic's&quot; title has a few underlying meanings to it, mainly that it is the first studio album that Bjork mostly produced herself, with the aids of LFO's Mark Bell and &quot;I Miss You's&quot; mastermind Howie Bernstein, another 'in-heart member'. The finsihed product presents an independently fierce young woman, equally enchanting and frightening in her emotional simplicity. Not only that, but you can dance to it too! A rocky, formidable journey that will reap mass benefits afterwards.
6304712936|5.0|This movie has 80's gusto and irreverence written all over it.From the obnoxious star as spectacle that defined the 80's rock and roll icon to the revisionism and modern audience pandering,this may be too dated and factually liberal to go down as a masterpiece.It is a fun movie,however.From the scatological humor of Mozart(the one characteristic of Mozart the movie got right)to Salieri's flashbacks as told to a priest in an insane asylum, there is plenty here to hold interest.The operatic sequences were slow moving but necessary for coherence and texturing.The circa 1790-91 scenery and set designs,clothes and hair stylings are very impressive and quite amusing in and of themselves.But the glorious music is what makes the movie.From the excerpts of the Requiem,the Serenades,the clarinet concerto and the Romance of the piano concerto that closes the movie,it is enough to make you go out and find recordings of Mozart's music.I never paid any mind to Mozart or the classical composers before I saw this film.But it opened up a great new world and I have since listened to the greater part of Mozart's catalogue(along with Bach and many others).Even if you know all about Wolfgang Amadeus you cannot go wrong with this movie.It may not be a masterwork,but it is well worth knowing.
0316286443|5.0|Back several years ago I wanted to get the &quot;Making Faces&quot; book when it first came out but missed out.  This time around I made sure that I got it.  From what I could remember, this book was similar to its predecessor, but an updated version.  It was good in showing visual step-by-steps, as well as before and after photos.  The models ranged from pre-teen to older women, men, Asian-Americans, Caucasians, and African-American - and they didn't ALL have perfect skin either!  <br />The only things I would have wished for were complete step-by-steps and some more &quot;everyday&quot; model makeovers, with skin problems ranging from unevenness to blotchiness, and from mild acne to severe acne-prone skin.  It would truly have been an impressive feat to see that!  Of course, I really looked forward to the section where he turned people into other celebrities, very impressive work indeed.  <br />I suppose this was more of a glamour-type of book rather than an amateur's makeup how-to book, but if you have any bit of experience, even if it's just about once a month (which is the case for me), it's really easy to catch on and eventually you'll be able to emulate the images like the ones in this book.
B000002J09|5.0|I wonder how many would be bands started or just called it quits because of this album.Every song is an example of how to craft a work of music.&quot;Stairway&quot; may be a bit overplayed by now but its greatness will live on for generations to come.&quot;When the levee breaks&quot; may be one of the most underrated songs ever written.From Bonham's atomic drumming to the amazing harmonica blowing of Plant this is one mean,cool track.The drum intro has been lifted countless times by rappers and by dj's.As always,Page came up with terrific guitar riffs and solos.Examples A&amp;B:&quot;Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;Black Dog&quot;.The best song on the album may be &quot;The battle of evermore&quot;.Here is a great case of Zep's ability to do a mythological-folky type song that spawned a whole generation of cheesy metal bands with funny makeup and silly stageshows.It's not Zeppelins fault a bunch of hacks followed them!The most impressive thing about their music is its boldness.They continually took risks and succeeded where every other band would have failed.Aside from the occasional whine of a castrato and some lyrics that were better left out or thought over more thoroughly, there is nothing to fault Zeppelin for.This is probably the best album in the history of rock and roll.The Stones were great, but even their best albums have filler.And the Beatles are so overrated it's a joke.Floyd's &quot;Wish you were here&quot; comes close,and the Metallica with Cliff Burton albums are worthy contenders,but no record has yet topped this masterpiece.
B00003CWN2|4.0|This review contains spoilers.<br />This indie movie pushed Hilary Swank into the limelight.  Thankfully she proves that she is a lot better than 'The Karate Kid 2' and 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' (the movie) might suggest.  Her fantastic performance is surprisingly unsentimental and in this immensely moving.  There are few actresses that could take on this role but Swank is perfect, and a lot better than Annette Bening was in 'American Beauty' (finally, it's nice to see the award going to the right person).  The fact that this was based on a real-life case makes it all the more poignant.<br />The basic plot is of a young lady called Teena Brandon struggling with her sexuality, and so dresses as a male under the pseudonym Brandon.  Her subsequent love affair with Lara (Chloe Sevigny) and tense meetings with her family make for difficult viewing.<br />Admitedly, at the start the movie is intriguing but a little slow-moving.  However, after the poignant affair between Brandon and his/her love Lara, it becomes entirely mesmerising.  All the way through though, you're nervous because of Brandon's inevitable discovery.  The rape scenes at the end are thankfully completely non-exploitive whilst certainly not lacking in horrifying drama.  The fact that this betrayal is carried out by Brandon's supposed friends makes it all the more terrible.<br />This isn't a movie that you'll want to watch again but it will definitely affect you greatly.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Beware!This is maybe the loudest movie ever made,and certainly one of the worst.Considering how ear-splitting this film is I'm left wondering how in the world anyone sat through it when it was playing in the theater.But on to the horror of the content,or lack thereof.This movie is one in an ever growing and dreary parade of content free &quot;blockbusters&quot; that emphasize perpetual action,minimal dialogue and above all,special effects.Mere escapism for the viewing audience and big business for the growing monster that are the new breed of corporate swallowed movie studios.Movies like &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;,&quot;Scream&quot; and the neverending sequels to likeminded movies are nothing but a means to sell merchandise and toys at burger kings and mcdonalds the world over.The lowest common denominator is what these movies appeal to;that,and the adolescent audience that doesn't know a good movie from a turkey anyway.It appears the days of  intelligent action movies are over.I guess they are not profitable enough.About the only use to be found for this disc is as a drink coaster,albeit an expensive one.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|I loved the animated Grinch ever since I was a kid and was wondering how they were going to turn a perfect little 20 minute story into a movie. Well, they didn't. It isn't a movie. It is an abysmal bore. Like so many others before, Flintstones,shudder, rocky and bullwinkle, ugggggh. now the grinch. I actually turned it off halfway through. It was that bad. I never turn off a flick if there is anything even remotely interesting or there is any thread of compassion for any of the characters. I am by no means high brow. I love the stooges, both the ones supporting iggy and the black and white ones. I even like Jim Carrey in some but not all of his movies. This just plain sucked. avoid this lemon at all costs.
0375703764|5.0|There are more than two hundred reviews here at Amazon on this book, many of them quite detailed, so I will only add a few minor comments.  First, the plot reminded me of the classic Lovecraft short story called &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot;, which also dwells on the universal childhood fantasy of discovering a parallel universe under the basement of one's home (see also &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; by C.S.Lewis). Of course, what sets &quot;House of Leaves&quot; apart is its very original form, with many levels of text and literally dozens of narrators, ranging from the main characters which are also narrative voices (Zampan&ograve; and Johnny Truant), to short one-time commentaries from fictitious &quot;sources&quot;. Johnny's story is a very sad one and in my opinion it reveals the central theme of HoL: loss, or lack: lack of love, of life, of meaning. Near the end of the book, there is a very funny passage in which many real authors and personalities comment on the &quot;Navidson Record&quot; and I think that Danielewski is here paying tribute to his main influences. One of them is Douglas Hofstadter, and anyone who has read &quot;G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach&quot; knows about his penchant for codes, hidden texts, acronyms and the like. In HoL hidden messages also abound, sometimes encoded in the first letters of the words in a sentence. I have a guess, still only an unproven hypothesis, that there is a hidden message in every sentence where the word &quot;house&quot; appears (always in blue), or at least in those where the word &quot;house&quot; is a little shifted up or down (pay attention to this). I think that the author hints at it when he reveals the &quot;Thamyris&quot; transcription. If you have read HoL and think that my theory is right, please e-mail me. If you have not read it, what are you waiting for?! It is a walk on the wild side of literature.
6304493681|5.0|Top Dog my friends, i your into manga then this is a MUST see cos its simply great..the setting is something we have all seen before but i think it makes it better...it doent have the big eyes and the childish view about it which is another great thing about it...good action with guns and everything but the computer aided visuals are just great and make it seen more alive and not soo flat...FINAL THOUGHTS...a must see...great plot...great action all round...you'd be mad to miss it...email me on your thoughts..
B00005JKHP|4.0|I have to admit I was a little disappointed. There seems to have been dialogue removed that only makes some scenes more awkward.  For instance, right after the transporter accident Kirk asks Starfleet if they have them....but now there is no response from Starfleet and Kirk continues by telling Starfleet where to reach their families (as if someone was listening).  Next, the moment when Kirk and McCoy are talking in Kirks quarters and Uhura interupts to let them know that a ship is approaching and seems to be coming along side.  However in this version there is no signal to kirk, but he orders the computer to activate his viewscreen anyway (as if he had ESP) and to make matters worse the editing starts Uhura's dialogue halfway into her converstion.  The last problem I noticed is way Kirk calls the Enterprise from V'ger and asks the crew to pull up any data on NASA/Voyager 6.  The problem is that Kirks request is cutoff the moment the view changes to Uhura and the crew listening to him and then the scene followed up with Decker agreeing that that must be what V'ger wants (well what was it...Kirk doesn't get a chance to say because its on the editing room floor).  The result is a awkward pause just when the crew seems to be listening intently to nothing!  Don't get me wrong,  I love most of the re-editing and new CG effects but this missing dialogue really hurt this DVD and it didn't save anything on running time of the movie.  This probably because the scenes in question just go on without it and we are just left with these strange moments of silence.  Please let me know that I'm not going crazy and that it's also obvious to you also.
B00000JPH5|5.0|My first experience with The Labyrinth was when I was pretty young, but from the first viewing I fell in love with the complete mastery of it all. Being a self-confessed daydreamer and visitor of my own fantasy worlds, the concepts of the movies characters, sets, and soundtrack didn't disappoint.<br />From the first moment we meet Sarah we identify with her dreams and her frustrations, and she carries us through her journey to rescue her baby brother she unwittingly banished to a goblin world. Along the way we meet up with characters who, although faulted, become part of a righteous group fighting the unreal challenges to overcome the King (an impressive David Bowie), and their own personality faults.<br />I have watched this movie whenever I feel a bit down with the world, and the film's escapism is the thing that helps me to look at the world with a new point of view. I'm 19 now, but I still watch The Labyrinth and thoroughly enjoy every moment.
0385505833|5.0|This was an excellent novella.  I am not normally a Grisham fan so this was a very delightful quick read.  A great book not just for the holidays but year round.  If after you finished reading this and you don't appreciate the people in your life more, read it again!
B00005R2M3|2.0|Shakira's English debut is rather disappointing.  I love her Spanish albums, but this one is definitely missing the qualities that made me a real fan of her music.  Her incredible voice is really restrained on this album (with a couple of exceptions.)  Shakira is at her best when her voice is the central focus, not a bunch of overproduced noise.  Also, her lyrics are poor at best and made be actually laugh a couple of times.  I realize that English is not her native language, but come on - she needs to do a little better.  I am not even going to start on the blonde look.  Let me just say that I really miss the Shakira from &quot;Donde estan los ladrones?&quot;  I haven't given up on her by any means, but I really hope that her next album sounds a lot more like her previous work.
B00000DGUG|4.0|After the hugely successful &quot;Jagged Little Pill,&quot; Alanis brings out her sophmore release in 98, &quot;Suppossed Former Infactuation Junkie&quot; with the desire to not just please her fans but to please herself as well. After endless touring she begun a battle within herself - questioning whether or not singing was what she really wanted to pursue for the rest of her life. She could have stopped when she was on top but instead decided to stick the gut. I am so tired of everyone bickering about how this album is a failure for Alanis Morissette. In her debut album she gripes and complains too much while here she blesses the listener with a much more conciliatory approach, though still a bit disturbed. She also seems to feel more comfortable in her skin, seeing that instead of dressing the &quot;grunge look&quot; she appears nearly naked in her video for Thank U as well as the CD's disk cover. And instead of infusing pure rock elements she also experiments more on ambient and electronic sounds, giving her the rightful niche of Pop Rock... Probably the most obvious restrain on a softer advance is on track #6, That I Would Be Good, which features a delicately touched piano and her take on the flute and harmonica. And despite her often flat and off-keyed notes it somehow adds more beauty to the otherwise monotonous song... Other favorites include the more synthesized and programmed tracks such as Baba, Front Row, The Couch, Can't Not, I Was Hoping, One, Would Not Come, and Joining You. I did give this 4-stars, though, just because songs like Unsent and Your Congratulations bore me to tears. I still find this required listening, though, and suggest that once her forthcoming album, &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; comes out that you see her on tour. I actually just recently had the opportunity to catch her live and be one of the first to hear exclusive songs from that album, and let me tell you - they sound incredible.
B00005Q66T|3.0|A Cd of Madonna's best 90s work?  But I thought \\"Ray of Light\\" had already been released?  Oh, its a singles collection.  (...) this doesn't bode well.  The conventional wisdom is that Madonna hit something of a fallow period during the time covered by this album.  Does anybody actually remember \\"I'll Remember\\"?  Another slice of \\"American Pie\\", anyone?  No, thanks, I'd rather vomit.  Looking back over this collection, though, perhaps it is time for a reappraisal.  \\"Take a Bow\\", which seemed so dull at the time, appears as an intelligent, if somewhat glossy, ballad.  \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" remains the magnificent feelgood track it always was.  \\"Human Nature\\" still sparkles like the kitchen-knife-in-the-back Madge presumably meant it to be, and then, moving on, we're treated to \\"Ray of Light\\", \\"Drowned World\\" and \\"The Power of Goodbye\\".  The tracks from Madonna's recent, overrated, album \\"Music\\" show that she's still as capable of knocking out bandwagonesque nonsense as she is of turning out a F!I!N!E! B!A!N!G!I!N! C!H!O!O!N! but, thankfully we're spared the worst.  The absence of \\"This Used to Be My Playground\\"; \\"Hanky Panky\\" and the terminally dire \\"Bad Girl\\" show that whoever compiled this has the good grace to admit that mistakes have been made.<br />The Immaculate Collection 2?  Sorry, not by a long-shot.  Give me \\"Borderline\\", \\"Like a Prayer\\" or \\"Cherish\\" any day.  But its not as bad as it might have been.  It aint immaculate, but its certainly the work of a very talented human.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Here's a song by song review:<br />1) Missundaztood - an upbeat pop tune with a Nelly Furtado feel. Catchy and energetic. A+<br />2) Don't let me get me - the most rock influenced song on the album, it kinda brings back mid 90's pop punk rock. The guitars are strong.<br />3) Just like a Pill - Another catchy pop hit with rock influence. This can easy be the next single, its upbeat and infectious <br />4) Get the party started - Disco pop. Has a weird 70's vibe and also has some urban groove to it. If Madonna worked with a hip hop producer, it would sound like this<br />5) Respect - She raps in this!!! She even says in the beginng of the song, &quot;This my rap song, uh!&quot; LOL she sounds good on here, her voice is strong. Upbeat and catchy with a beatbox in the background.<br />6) 18 wheeler - Extremely catchy song, if it werent for the guitars and percussion I would call this a dance song. It has a nice strong messege too<br />7) Family portrait - I like the melody and the beat. The lyrics are out of this world, kinda shocking<br />8) Misery with Steven Tyler - awesome freaking awesome!!! I seriously love this song. Steve and Pinks voices blend like a fine soup. It sounds great and could belong in your father's classic 60's rock collection<br />9) Dear diary - Indie rock mixed with pop. Like the whispery chorus. Nice song<br />10) Eventually - A soul R&amp;B ballad. Pink sings very loud and clear, with a lot of power. When my mom heard this, she said &quot;God, she has a beautiful voice&quot;<br />11) Lonely girl - It's good. Linda perry appears on it. Very rock sounding, great guitar opening<br />12) Numb - Love it, so much feminine attitude. Yeah it does kinda sound Fiona Apple or Alanis like. But Pink puts her own spin on it. Love the lyric &quot;No sleep, no sex, for you from your ex-girlfriend, you made me numb&quot;<br />13) Gone to California - Love it!!!! Nice soul ballad. Could use a little kickstart like a melody or drums, but it's great<br />14) My vietnam - If you like pop rock then you'll die for this. Awesome lyrics
B00003BDXG|5.0|In Oliver Stone's ambitious and graphic social commentary &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; he gives the audience a visually stunning look into the swirling madness of a society that is controlled and condemned by the tabloid media.  At the centre of the whirlwind of violence and mutilation are the young lovers Mickey and Mallory Knox (played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis), whose love of each other and love of carnage takes them on a murderous adventure spurning everything that tries to stop them.  The media, personified by the sleazy and sensationally slimy Wayne Gayle (vividly portrayed by Robert Downey Jr.), pushes Mickey and Mallory on, encouraging their onslaught of death for ratings thus showing the meretricious nature of the media.  The film makes the statement that the media has given rise to the depraved nature of our society and is partially, if not completely to blame for the violent and emotionally detached state that we find ourselves in.  The violence in the film is a reminder that for fifty years we have given the responsibility of raising our children over to the T.V. (the media) in higher and higher doses and have failed to question the media's negative values and morals where the more violent and the graphic the program, the more viewers it will receive and therefore the more money that will be made.  As Oliver Stone says in the introduction to the directors cut, the 150 cuts that were made to the theatrical version have been restored, returning a further sense of chaos and impacting the audience with the full meaning of the intended message.  I believe that this film should be seen by people who have an open mind and are capable of seeing things on a deeper level (reading between the lines), and are capable of appreciating art, which is what this film is.  &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; is a masterpiece representing our society and the monstrous media that controls it.
B00005R2M3|5.0|OMG!!! If you have to get one CD, make it this one! I didn't think that this CD would be so good when I got it! Not much to say other than that...now, go out and get it! I think you will be happy when you do! She has a great voice!
B00001OH7U|5.0|Station to Station.<br />TVC 15.<br />Stay.<br />Those are my three favorite tracks from this six track Cd and all are included on the Christiane F. soundtrack. I highly recommend considering that option.<br />The versions of Station to Station and Stay on the soundtrack are even better than the ones on this disc.<br />And along with great Station to Station tracks you get three great Heroes tracks, one from Low, and two from Lodger.<br />However, if you do get this, you get &quot;Golden Years&quot; and a song I used to love &quot;Wild is the Wind&quot;.<br />You could get both. I have both but Christiane F. I prefer.
B00003CXRP|3.0|I know that the movie wants to get the point across that Tom Hanks is stuck on an island and needs to be rescued, but he spends half the movie just sitting on the beach waiting.  The movie would have only been an hour if they took out the 'waiting' parts.  The waiting calls for a viewers boredom that further spreads to uninterested-ness.  Overall: Good plot but too long for my taste.

B00005Q66T|1.0|Sad as it is, I'm really mad that Madonna decided to Remove the line in her song Human Nature.  Anyone who knows this song will notice that a certain line is missing in the chorus.  It's well done, but it's really isn't right to edit music like that.  Madonna wants to change her image, but I haven't seen that change yet.  She acts and looks the same to me.
0345413377|5.0|The riveting conclusion to Pullman's Dark Materials series, this fast-paced, riveting, novel did not disappoint. This novel describes the final struggle of Lyra, Will, and a plethora of other characters, to topple the iniquitous regime and restore normalcy to all the worlds. <br />Character development was excellent, giving each individual unique and powerful characteristics, and having each individual make believable decisions based on these characteristics. <br />The plot was very thorough, and though it was evidently much more complex then the preceding two novels in the series, it could be viewed on many levels. The novel contains a level on which it could be read as a simple fantasy story, or as an in depth theological study. In either sense, the story contains a certain sense of self-seriousness making it all the more believable. <br />I have noticed a lot of rants that label the novel anti-Christian and immoral. This is simply not true. Though there is a clear, opinionated perspective on religion, it is ridiculous to infer that Pullman is attempting to brainwash the reader. When reading fiction, fantasy fiction no less, one must set aside one's own religious or moral code, and enjoy the story, since it is just that: a story. After all, it is possible to enjoy something without it reflecting one's own opinion (though after reading some of the narrow-minded reviews here, I may retract that statement at some point). Although I am only 15 years old, I have been exposed to a wide variety of religions and cultures, and understand that rather than shunning and tabooing something that you disagree with on any scale, you should simply maintain your own opinion and realize that a wide variety of opinions and beliefs is what makes mankind so intelligent and diverse. <br />Which is more than can be said for certain reviews I've read from parents fearing that their children are being brainwashed. If one is secure enough with their own beliefs, then they shouldn't be afraid of such beautiful and thought-provoking prose. <br />Read this book, regardless of culture, race, religion, or any other label. Read this book for pure enjoyment, to be swept away in the mystical fantasy of daemons, and armored bears, and witches, and angels. Or read this book to open your mind and perspectives. Either way, you shall have walked away still imbued in such a heart-wrenchingly beautiful tale. I know I did.
B000000QFV|5.0|This cd caught my attention a few years ago when a friend gave it to me.  I was like many narrow minded people and couldn't accept a Sabbath without Ozzy.  But as I listened to the cd I began to realize how tight of a sound it was.  Everything is solid on this album especialy the singing of Tony Martin, the most underrated lead man for Sabbath.  You cant compare this album to classics like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath because it just doesnt.  You have to compare this album to quality.  The quality is just as good as any Ozzy or Dio era albums.  The album deserves at least a listen to one song.  Highlights are Anno Mundi and Valhalla.
B00005RFAI|2.0|I loved her first cd,with the R&amp;B feeing through out the album.This one is different. it is mostly rock based and some of the songs didn't really fit the album nor her style. i know she is trying different directions in music but this is not pink. &quot;Can't take me home&quot; album has more emotions rather than all that junk britney stuff.
B00005176F|5.0|If you have recognized BLUR for the last 10 years,of course you can not miss this one! If you never hear about this super England band,you should give it a try! I promise you won't regret!
0679746048|5.0|I am 13, yet already threatened with in-patient care.  I am diagnosed Pathological Liar--like Georgina in the movie--, clinically depressed, and I fantasize too often of suicide.  I would never have the courage to push down though; I find suicide stupid, and for the weak, but I have much compassion for those who truly consider it, and I'm there if they need a shoulder to lean on--or, more often, cry on.  <br />Anyway, back to the book.  She wrote this reflecting on how she was in the \\"hospital\\" when she was 18.  No criticism should be said about this book; this book is merely opinions and essays.  If you don't like it then fine, dont read it; but don't whine about not liking because you want other people to not read it, for you feel it's a waste of time.  <br />Susanna Kaysen is one of the best, if not THE best, authors I know of; and I am quite a reader.  She expresses her emotions in ways that I've never seen in anyone... anything.  Five stars go to this well deserving book about life on the not-so-glamorous side, the life many must face.
B00005OWIU|5.0|The first thing that comes to mind when listening to this soundtrack is how fitting it is.  There is magic and mystery in this music (though reminiscent of a few of his other soundtracks).  I was very impressed with how well the music fit the movie -- Williams enjoyed himself.  Very good.
B00005RG6B|5.0|This is a brilliant piece of work from one of the most alternative and outstanding hard rock bands - Queensryche. The album &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot; (which was released in 1988), was a classic concept album and phenomenal not merely for the band itself but also in rock history. &quot;Video Mindcrime&quot; (which was released in 1989) was an excellent piece of storytelling putting the songs and music into visual image. &quot;Operation Livecrime&quot; was a further step ahead to put the story into live performance. <BR>I bought the box set way back in 1991 which made up of a Vhs cassette, a booklet about the story behind the album and a CD. The moment I saw the DVD on display inside a shop last week, I just did not hesitate to buy it. And now, here we are, &quot;Operation Livecrime&quot; in DVD eventually. <BR>The performance itself was immaculate. Every single member of the band did their respective part perfectly. They played every single song in the album. The partnership of Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton in guitar playing was second to none and irreplaceable but also one which supposedly every fan of the band would sadly miss. By no means I am playing down the role of Kelly Gray (who replaced Chris), himself being an outstanding guitarist on his own merits, however there is unfortunately something missing in the standard of performance (particularly live performance) of the band following the departure of Chris who had made such a huge contribution to the development of the band.There is no question about that.<BR>There is however one aspect which I sadly noticed from the song &quot;Suite Sister Mary&quot;. It seems that the vocal portion of Pamela Moore was recorded beforehand, that is she did not seem to have sung her lines live. I hope I am wrong. <BR>In all, this DVD is definitely a must for every die hard Queensryche fan and serious fan of rock music. Just go ahead and buy it. Believe me, it is worth every single cent.
B00005NTP2|5.0|People, you have got to try this. The best song they ever wrote is on here, but never got any attention because the record company and managers (...) the band royally. If you love melodic rock, you have to have this in your collection. For \\"Girl From Lebanon\\" if nothing else. The next best track (to me) is \\"Seventh Sign\\", inspired by the movie of the same name. If you're a long time fan of the band, scream loud for them to re-unite. If you're not a long time fan, this disc WILL change your mind.
B0000542DH|5.0|One of the previous reviewers commented that he felt &quot;numb&quot; and &quot;stunned&quot;.<BR> <BR>I would slightly rephrase that as a change in how you view the world. <br />I rememember many years ago as a (English) biker going to see &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and coming out from the cinema ducking and diving in a paranoid reaction.<br />This did it the other way. now our viewpoint was on the other side of the guns and (however) reluctantly our sympathies are with the two &quot;heroes&quot;. <br />This is not bad, we should try to understand. this does not mean that we accept all actions as right but we can start to understand them. <br />We all have monsterous things inside us, some of us bring it out.<br />The great thing about this film is that it presented a pair of MONSTERS and gave us some way of understanding them.<br />This is not to say that the appropriate action to a monster is to crush it. You may sympathise or even understand, but it must not be allowed to do more damage.<br />PS. Ok I know the heroes in Easy Rider were not exactly &quot;Mr Clean&quot; either however in the US of that time it's probably OK in terms of image.<br />After all I think John Wayn is the only hero who rode off into the sunset with a prostitute
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's latest album is so great! It totally shows how she has grown as a musician and person.  The music is so great to listen to, and there's such a variety on the album!
B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard's 1987 release Hysteria is their best album ever.  It is also one of THE best single records to have come out of the 80's.  &quot;Hysteria&quot; exemplifies pop metal (my favorite sub genre) at its very best.  Each and every single song is a classic, whether they be hits or not.  This was the first album I ever bought of Def Leppard.  I bought it when I was fifteen years old and to this day, it remains one of my favorite albums ever.  If you don't own this record already, make a wise decision as the other 170 or so reviewers did, and take our advice--buy this album.<br />Peace, bros.
B00003CXTG|2.0|My, work (the Navy) paid for a group of us to go see this movie, and I still wanted my money and three hours of my life back.  If you are looking for a accurate depiction of the accounts of and after Pearl Harbor search elsewhere, in movies like Tora! Tora! Tora! and Midway.  The only way to make this movie better and perhaps go by a lot faster would to cut out all the lame romance in it.  This is not Titanic for Michael Bay, this is Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (appologies to those fans of the afore mentioned movie)  Cut the romance, which would bring the movie to not only a watchable 2 hour length, but also a much more accurate and fast paced movie, and if you are going to introduce so many characters to us in a movie, at least take longer than five seconds to do so.  If Mr. Bay had used that hour that he trashed for romance and put it into character development, this movie would have been much better, it's a history, not a comic book, treat it with a bit more respect, real history doesn't need to have sub-plot after sub-plot.  The turth is always more interesting than fiction.  For the effects, that's about all that saved this movie from beeing a total downside movie.  The attack on Pearl Harbor was depicted very well, and very accurate.  Other than the last 45 min of the movie, just speed through it.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Approach this collection as more of a compilation than a &quot;best of&quot; or &quot;hits&quot;.  With any band that has a history as long  as Floyd's, it becomes almost impossible to summarize it at all, let alone in 2 discs. So once you get past what songs may have been left out and any other preferences or technical issues like the production into continuous tracks and such, you'll realize that what is here is put together perfectly.<br />I do not normally buy discs that mostly contain songs I already have, but I'm glad I made an exception here. (Of course, getting PF's &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, When the Tigers broke free is a big bonus)   If you're a long time Floyd fan like I am, these discs will take you places if you're ready to go or not. Every aspect of the bands career as well as some songs that showcase individual talents are touched on here. This is a real track record of what THE BAND that launched psychedelia  has accomplished and contributed.<br />The song order, booklet, layout and artwork all continue the same imagery and concepts presented over the decades. And how appropriate to open and close with Barret compositions but to have both off of &quot;Pipers&quot;.  I guess that's the only sad part, it makes me miss Syd.
1567184855|2.0|I am just finishing this book and unfortunately I bought his other book &quot;Destiny of Souls&quot;! If I knew what this dude claims that he knows I'd be screaming it from a rooftop!!  He claims that souls pick their human bodies and also can preselect their occupation and location.<BR>I HARDLY chose my human body!  I have &quot;Central pain&quot;  there is no painkillers for central pain!!!  I had to move from a freezing climate to a desert climate, WHY would I pick a human body that would develop central pain and require me to move if I knew these things would happen?  Also he claimed that you could pick parents with money if you wanted, I picked poor parents and an alcoholic father on purpose?  I think not!<BR>Save your money, I still believe in reincarnation, he didn't kill that   but there are better books on the subject!
B00000JYGX|5.0|This two cd set of the French recording of Notre Dame de Paris is one of the most beautiful cds in my collection.  Anyone with a love for moving music will enjoy this cd, whether or not he or she can understand French.  The sweeping melodies and incredible voices of all the singers transport the listener into their magical world.  The message of humanity and compassion is delivered in a fantastic way.  Be warned, once you hear Notre Dame de Paris in French, the English version will no longer sound as beautiful.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I've been dying to see this movie ever since I first saw the previews. When my sister bought the dvd, my mom and I borrowed it and sat down to watch it. In the beginning, it was a bit boring, too much girlie stuff going on, but it got better. Victor Garber did an especially good job acting in this film, he made me want to kill him, when in Titanic, I loved him. Reese has proved that she can play just about any role and the story is touching. It proves that you can be blonde and do anything in the world that you want to.
0380730367|5.0|Every time I think I know where Lehane is headed,he veers off in a completely opposite direction. I should just sit back and trust I'm in the hands of a master thriller writer.First off if you haven't read any Lehane and are interested in The Kenzie/Gennaro series I'd suggest starting at the begining with A Drink Before The War&quot;. All the books are capable of standing on their own, but the characters do go through some major changes along the way, and previous books are mentioned in the later ones which could give something away. In their fifth book Patrick begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding a seemingly put together and sweet woman who takes a naked dive to her death off a building. Again he employs more twists than a crazy straw creating a frenzy of tension that will have you racing towards the end. Thrillers don't get any better than this.Can't wait for the next one!
B00005RFQ5|3.0|An interesting album that you need to hear more than once to enjoy.  I'm digging on a few of the tracks, and trying to grasp the overall idea of the artist, but it's no easy task.  It's often unpredictable, sometimes fascinating, sometimes flat. There is little or no subtlety in the lyricism, as Prince delivers messages of God in a very direct way( unlike the more friendly and witty Love Sexy episode ), but the subtlety is found rather in the detailed finish of the music, which may be easy to overlook. Unfortunately, the tunes hardly jump out at me, and some of the funk sounds derivative ie: 1+1+1+3, mimics Erotic City, in my opinion_ but Prince can do whatever he wants.  There's more guitar playing than on recent albums, and that nice, but you won't find much Pop ( it's no Gold Experience), and, like myself, you may find this album difficult to enjoy. But don't give up, try it a few times and see what happens :)
B00005NW02|5.0|Many fans awaited this album with a single question in mind:Can SoaD possibly make an album better than their first?  Well, the answer has become blazingly clear-YES! From the first jolting chord of &quot;Prison Song&quot; to the final whisper of &quot;Aerials&quot; it is quite obvious that you aren't dealing with a mere rock band, but a musical force to be reckoned with.  So many young bands suffer the &quot;sophomore curse&quot; when it comes to following up a breathtaking debut, but SoaD has managed to outdo themselves and what a pleasure it is to listen to.  Always the consummate showman, vocalist/lyricist, Serj Tankian is definately the biggest standout of the group.  His voice has matured quite a bit since the first album, and this transformation is very apparent.  His dynamic range can only be described as awe-inspiring.  He infuses his lyrics with such emotion that the words take on a life of their own.  I have read quite a few reviews that dismiss his unusual lyrics a simply psycho babble, but this could not be further from the truth.  There tends to be a fair amount of symbolism in SoaD's lyrics.  If you simply take the words at face value all the time, of course some of it isn't going to make very much sense, but if you take your time to interpret the words for yourself, the meaning becomes very obvious.  For example, &quot;Bounce&quot; may at first seem like a silly song about pogo sticks, but upon close listening, you'll find that it is actually a song about a promiscuous woman.  Guitarist Daron Malakian also stands out.  In a way, he has the ability to produce music that is just a unusual as Tankian's lyrics. He can go from heavy (&quot;Science&quot;) to beautifullly soft (the opening of &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;).  He also displays a great vocal talent by lending harmonies to Tankian's melodies on several tracks (&quot;Chop Suey!&quot; &quot;ATWA&quot; &quot;Needles&quot;).  During the bridge of &quot;Needles&quot; he sings on his own, and the result isincredible.  It seems that he has the ability to convey the few, and I emphasize few, emotions that Tankian cannot achieve.  Bassist Shavo Odadjian is definately a very talented bassist.  He seems to to far more than just provide a foundation for everyone else to play upon.  If you listen to &quot;Toxicity&quot; and concentrate on the bass, you will be pleasantly surprised.  As far as lyrical content, &quot;Toxicity&quot; must be one of the most diverse in recent years.  Their politically charged material has garnered comparisons to Rage Against the Machine, but I think these comparisons are a little off.  SoaD can be very political at times (particularly on &quot;Prison Song&quot; &quot;Deer Dance&quot; and &quot;X&quot;), but they can still have fun with a set of quirky lyrics (&quot;Shimmy&quot; &quot;Bounce&quot;).  With Tankian's incredible vocal talent to work with, almost any type of song is possible.  Despite the fact that this entire album is nearly flawless, a few tracks are bound to shine a little more than all the rest.  &quot;Prison Song&quot; is a thought provoking criticism of the American prison system and its practices.  The combination of a controversial topics and very catchy melodies seems to be the group's forte.  &quot;Deer Dance&quot; is another very political song that basically calls out the wrongs of the LAPD. The meaning of the song isn't always obvious, but the line that points a definite finger is the &quot;Beyond the Staples Center...&quot; line.  &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; just radiates the energy that SoaD possesses.  The lightning speed and electric lyrical delivery in a way epitomizes what SoaD is all about.  I have seen this song performed live and it is an incredible experience to witness.  &quot;X&quot;, at least in my opinion, picks up where &quot;P.L.U.C.K.&quot; left off, telling the story of the Armenian Genocide.  &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; is a stroke of pure genius, and everyone already knows that, enough said.  &quot;Forest&quot;is probably Tankian at his most dynamic.  His voice goes from high to low, and soft to loud almost effortlessly and that makes this one of the best tracks on the album, which is a great complement when the excellence of the rest is put into consideration.  &quot;ATWA&quot; is aesthetically the most beautiful song on the album.  The intricate melding of Tankian's melody with Malakian's harmony envelopes this song in a sort of a melancholic beauty that is unlike anything you have ever heard.  The title track is kind of ambiguously political.  Rather than pointing out a specific entity that is being criticized like in &quot;Prison Song&quot; and &quot;Deer Dance&quot;, &quot;Toxicity&quot; just describes a situation and sort of lets you pick a specific on your own.  My favorite track would probably have to be &quot;Psycho&quot;.  To be very honest, the song is simply about cocaine crazed groupies, and is quite a harsh criticism of them.  There is a bit of irony in this when you consider that rock bands and groupies basically go hand in hand.  The opening of the song is this terrific guitar driven crescendo that ends with Tankian maniacally chanting the chorus of the song.  That opening almost drags you into the song and doesn't let go until the very end.  Overall, &quot;Toxicity&quot; is a work of great minds and talent.  It is clear exactly how much SoaD has expanded their musical horizons and have mastered their new styles incredibly.  I think it would be safe to say that SoaD has their work cut out for them if they ever plan to top this!
B00004R99U|1.0|This movie was an absolute waste of my time. Being extremely bored I watched it on tv, praying that it wouldn't be all that bad. I didn't like the original Pocahontas all that much but it was by no means bad. This sequel and all Disney sequels ruins, absolutely trashes the original films! Besides the bad animation horrible plots, and endings,it completely ruins your imagination. After all Disney movies it leaves you content to imagine your own (pretty obvious) ending. The characters are immortalized in your brain. Particularly for this movie they ruined it! The ending made me so mad! I haven't the faintest idea why I care so much but it seems like it ruined a perfectly good (though historically inaccurate) movie. If you like Disney movies DO NOT WATCH the sequels.
B00004U2HK|5.0|My mom and I watched this together a little over a year ago, it was like the 50th or 75th anniversary and it made me so happy to see it. The Sound of Music is one of my favorite musicals. It's delightful, cheerful songs and happy tunes make it one of the most brillant ones out there. I received it for a Christmas present last year and it has been watched many times since then.
B00005RDAF|5.0|I think this video gives a great look into britney the performer and britney in her first movie. It shows clips of her new movie crossroads and has her fellow stars in the new movie comment on britney the girl. Also 3 of her hit videos. Pepsi comercial and mtv perfomance. I think britney is very talented and has this kinda facination about her that leaves you asking &quot;what will she do next&quot;. I love her and think she is great no matter what jealous girls that wish they were her say! Britney you keep doing what your doing and i give this video 5 Stars. so go out and get it
B00005RHGK|4.0|I dunno, I liked this movie alot, It was very stylish, and I loved how they linked the Creep with that song, I thought it was really, really scary, You just have to imagine yourself in their shoes.The ending was, hmmm , well I guess you have to tell the audience what their up against. I thought it was disturbing and horrific. There was no happy ending. I think it made it more realistic though. But anyways this was a great film, The music is Excellent!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek was so funny when my mom, me and a bunch of her friends went to see it. I was laughing so hard people were looking at me! Shrek is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. Even though there parts in the movie thst younger kids won't get they will enjoy it all the same. Eddie Murphy and Mike Meyers did an awesome job in this movie. If you haven't gotten the movie yet go get it, if you don't your missing out!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|It was really somethin'! Thank U for your providing &quot;Someone In The Dark&quot; in this album, Michael. God knows my effort to get this song in my life. In my childhood I heard it on radio and when I was able to get my favorites within my economical capability the song already disappeared.. From that point whenever I visit any record store I have never missed checking the availability of the song &quot;Someone In The Dark&quot;.. At last, it is presented again in this world.. In this song no one can be hardly moved from the bottom of his heart. Needless to say, the album &quot;Thriller&quot; contains an amount of storyline and hot issue. This album is just the &quot;HISTORY&quot; itself. And also wonderfully great Quincy's magical art can be felt in this album. It's not forgotten to include their voice.. The original &quot;Thriller&quot; is the masterpiece that could exist in space.. but furthermore the remastering &quot;Thriller&quot; is the set of the present giving happiness and pleasure to Michael Jackson's eternal fan world wide.
B00004TJK2|4.0|this film is very special to me. the plot isn't that great but it's a film that looks and feels so good and the soundtrack is very effective especially the theme tune. even rosanna arquette isn't that annoying in it!the film belongs to jean-marc barr though.it's a shame his career has never really taken off cos he's quite good in this role.location shooting in greece,new york, the riviera and taormina,sicily add to the magic!...
B00003CXTG|1.0|This is the worst movie of the decade, a big commercial piece for the U.S. and the acting and directing is also bad. But the special effects must be the worst I've ever seen! Do they mean to have a &quot;Toy Story-sky&quot; and plastic bombs??
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira is Awsome she has a wonderfull voice and the lyrics to her songs are amazing i love her voice and the song Whenever Wherever is a very very very very good song i encourage everyone to buy this c.d!!!!
B000005DQR|5.0|I have owned the disk ever since it's release in '96.  And it's still in high rotation on my stereo.  Nothing before or since has come close to the raw beauty of Endtroducing...   Shadow's choice of melody over smooth breaking beats is something everyone should enjoy.  This is a must own.  Can't wait for something new.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I love Laundry Service. I don't speak Spanish, but I loved Shakira before she came out with the English album. I used to dance to &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; when I went to Spanish clubs, but I didn't really understand the lyrics. Therefore, I love &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;, because now I can relate to the lyrics and not just love the song because of the beautiful music. I also loved songs like &quot;Estoy Aqui&quot; on her old album, and many of her songs in English have that same rock feel. My favorite track on the new album is &quot;Objection&quot;. She has a really long career ahead of her, and I have to say...I'm going to learn how to belly dance because of her. Peace out :)

1561005878|5.0|While some rate the quality of the religious or philisophical references of this book, that really isn't the soul of the story.  This is a story of a young combat veteran for whom the superficial luxuries of the world no longer have value.  He must decide if his life was worth saving and why.  What he discovers isn't the &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; or any religious ecstasy -- in fact, he arrives closer to the beginning than he thinks.  But he goes with an appreciation for life and lives.<br />I tried to be a Somerset Maugham fan but for me, this is far and away his best work. The characters are reallistically shallow, or lost, or gritty -- as the case may be.  I reread this every couple of years just to remind myself of what a good story really sounds like.<br />-Mike
B00005QZWI|4.0|The racks at the store contained at least 6-8 different covers on this CD.  The world of \\"collectibles\\" has changed since the *first* LORD OF THE RINGS movie came out in 1978 (the animated Bakshi version).  There was a cover with Bilbo, one with Arwen, another with Saruman, etc. I chose the \\"Gandalf\\" cover, paid my money, and hurried home to listen to it.  It was a few weeks before the film came out, and I was dying to hear what sort of music had been composed for the new film version of my favorite book of all time.  All I knew about Howard Shore was that he wrote the music to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS -- which I could not remember one note of.<br />My initial impressions were: <BR>1. Lots of chorus! Almost every track has some choral section.<BR>2. The Hobbits and the Elves music was rustic and somewhat gaelic. I liked it.<BR>3. The \\"Fellowship\\" theme keeps building throughout the disk .. tentative at first, then strong and heroic.<BR><br />I was pleasantly surprised. I am a big John Williams fan and am used to his style of easily-identifiable character/music themes.  Howard Shore is not as bombastic as Williams.  His FELLOWSHIP score is small when it needs to be and majestic at other times.<br />My favorite tracks are:<BR>1. \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" ... I think of Hobbit holes and books.<BR>2. \\"Amon Hen\\" ... Always a favorite passage of mine in the book. This cue really gives me the sense of Frodo overlooking Middle Earth with the ring on and seeing the monumentous task that lies ahead of him. Some majestic music!<BR>3. \\"The Ring Goes South\\" ... oh, I can just see the Fellowship marching across the landscape of Middle Earth when I listen to this music. Very cool!<br />I also like that the tracks are named after Tolkien's chapter titles. I also like the Enya song, although I'm not a big fan (to me, one Enya song sounds like most other Enya songs).<br />I was also surprised to find many lyrics included on the CD insert. <br />All-in-all, it's a great soundtrack. I must admit that it plays better than the Leonard Rosenman (1978) soundtrack while one is reading the Tolkien books.  I tried listening to it as I am finishing up a re-read of RETURN OF THE KING.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This is the one album that could make me cry tears of joy and sadness. It has captured my life into music, and it will capture a little of everyone's soul into it.
B000000WA4|4.0|This album captures the pumpkins at a point when their fame had finally caught up to their talent, and they milked it for all they could on this 28 song extravaganza. There's healthy portions of heavy and lite fare here. Most of the hard stuff is virtually unlistenable self-indulgence. Corgan repeats himself perpetually and at times seems bereft of any desire to make a pleasing song. But the harsh songs seem to cleanse your negativity.<br /><br />As it's title would suggest, this album is best at serving up sad, wistful ballads and pop songs that make for easy listening. A child of the seventies, Corgan's songs often take you away to a more innocent time in the past, sometimes drowning in pity, at others inspired with wonder, including bubble gum sing-a-longs that truly awaken the kid in you again. &quot;1979&quot; is surely among the best pop songs of 90's. The lyric booklet helps you get into the lyrical meaning of each song with ease. The last 5 songs of the 1st disc alone could be half of a great album. Aside from the radio peddled singles most people have already heard before, &quot;Galapogos&quot;, &quot;Muzzle&quot;, &quot;Stumbleine&quot;, and &quot;Where Boys Fear To Tread&quot; are great songs as well. Little gems and surprises throughout make the album truly special. A good night's sleep filled with nightmares and sweet dreams.
0679720200|5.0|This is a book I recommend to anyone who claims they liked &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.  Camus acheives the same sort of antihero in this novel, the detached, dispassionate protagonist that intrigues and mystifies us.  <br />This book should be read by all purely for the experience, for it is so much unlike the typical or popular styles that it is good exercise for the mind; in addition, it's a great story, and a classic.  Go get it!
B00005RIKD|5.0|This is definitely a must-buy cd.  Every song on it is excellent.  Every note brings out the heart and soul of one of the most talented singer/songwriters of our time.  I have listened to this cd over and over again and it just seems to get better every time.  I highly recommend it!!
0812550706|5.0|To put everything in perspective, I was referred to Ender's Game by a friend, and, after reading various reviews here, I would definitely say I thought the whole idea of reading this type of book was sketchy.  It sounded childish and farfetched...not to mention looming as a waste of time.  I could not have been more mistaken.  Do yourself a favor - if you've ever liked a science fiction book even slightly, read this book.  I say science fiction, but I'm not even sure that is entirely true.  Yes, the book focuses on a space war with aliens, but the true focus is on the human spirit.  Through a few hundred pages, Card was able to present likeable and realistic characters (albeit the age factor) and provide a captivating psychological viewpoint.  The end left me in a moral euphoria...I must have gone around smiling dumbly for at least an hour afterwards.  Picture the book as a cross between Gattaca and Starship Troopers, only considerably better than each.  Besides, if the psychological and philosophical viewpoints don't fascinate you, there's still plenty of unique action sequences to leave you marvelling at the author's creativity.  The book was a quick page-turner (I couldn't put it down); yet, if there's one defect to it, I'd have to say the concept of a 5 year old genius is a bit of a stretch...thankfully the absence of a movie allows the book to still flow smoothly, otherwise the book might resemble nothing more than a futuristic Rug Rats....but don't mind me, just read the book.

B00005OM4N|5.0|First off, I wanna say...if you're looking for bubblegum pop, you're not going to get much of it, here. Bubblegum pop songs are marked with a * Some of those are much better than the new sound, though...She's really improved...Anyway, some of the album is made up of the traditional Max Martin/Rami formula, but Britney does a little more writing than them here. The Neptunes lend a hand in the breathy third single, \\"Boys\\" and the funky debut single \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" They are still afraid to release anything Britney wrote as a single, though they could probably do much better, for example, the album's best cut, \\"Cinderella*\\" with a wildy addictive chorus. We see a new side of Britney on the song \\"Overprotected\\" We don't see Britney singing about love, we hear her singing out being so (...) protected. The \\"Overprotected\\" song will be released in Europe as a split single. We here in the US get \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" co-written by the masterful Dido. Max Martin must listen to Pink, for elements from her songs \\"H*** With You\\" and \\"Most Girls\\" were used in the uptempo \\"Bombastic Love*\\" With moderately good lyrics and probably one of Britney's best tunes yet, \\"Bombastic Love*\\" is a winner. \\"Anticipating\\" is more disco than pop, and Britney helped write it. It's a feel good song, but at times the lyrics aren't so hot: \\"Gotta Turn Me On And Make Me Feel Sexy\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock With You\\" Another great cut would be \\"Let Me Be*\\" She helped write this, too. It's pretty catchy and easy to dance to...it is bubblegum pop, though, but that's really not bad in the long run. \\"Lonely\\" takes a rock edge. Rodney Jerkins does some work with Britney on the song writing. If Cinderella wasn't on the album, this would be the best cut. The remaining tracks are \\"That's Where You Take Me*\\" the song that uses the word BABY too many times (Britney probably thought of using that word. She helped write this too) And as for \\"I Love Rock N Roll\\", Joan Jett would be proud. As for the fourth single, \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" it sounds NSYNC-ish, but isn't that the point? It's acually pretty catchy, and as for the thing about the best vocals she's ever done? I'm not sure, but they are very good. Overall, a winner from Britney Spears, and you may be surprised, Britney haters...give it a chance. It's not that bad.
B00005Q66T|3.0|I have been following Madonna's career since early eighties, say rather avidly. I have all of her albums, almost all of her singles and maxi-singles. I was, however, very much disappointed with this release which doesn't include any new or bonus tracks. Go back a few years and you'll notice that Madonna's somewhat ignored collection of hit ballads, Something to Remember, had two unreleased tracks. Go back about a decade and you'll see that Immaculate Collection, the first collection of hits, had two unreleased tracks. I do feel that it would have been appropriate to throw in at least a couple of live tracks from the Drowned World Tour, to stimulate the seasoned fans' buying instincts. If you like Madonna's music and do not have all her albums, you should definitely buy this record. It gives a good, yet not very thorough retrospect of her musical progress since Erotica, which is reason enough to have it in your music collection. I know that I, too, am going to go out and buy this album, although I already have all the tracks included on it on several different formats, simply because I am a huge fan and simply for the sake of its sleeve. Let me mention that even the album sleeve makes me feel that this album was released in a rush, as if the whole thing was put out to adhere to some record-company obligation, since the album sleeve is also a collage of previously used publicity-shots and video-stills.  All said, Madonna was and is the greatest entertainer of our time -- and even that leaves me holding on to my seat waiting for another studio album of fresh material.

0767802519|5.0|At the dawn of the now ever popular European/Hollywood violent anti-hero film noir, The professional stood out for both arthouse and blockbuster budget film goers.<BR> Luc Besson, of The Big Blue and Fifth Element fame made a perfect statement with his use of grim settings and rough film stock. His exceptional eye, which manages to capture emotion and transcend the barrier between viewer and character is enough to leave the viewer with the feeling of lost at the hands of an emotional roller coaster.<BR> Casting has always been a key element in any film, and in this case incredibly well cast. Jean Reno, although the anti-hero endears himself to anyone with his silent sad eyes where it is obvious he has longed for company and friendship, which his profession does not allow. Although &quot;Leon&quot; (Jean Reno) is a professional killer with only select targets (no women, no kids) there is no need for a redemption, but a redemption of dynamic proportions amidst a climax of hailing bullets idifies his character. Gary Oldman is simply stunning, as always, with the right mixture of saddism and chaotic mental unbalance which sets the tone and allocates the status of the most evil human nature has to offer personified even in that of a minor glace (in the direction of the camera). Natalie Portman, although EXTREMELY young in this film, has the depth and emotion of any veteran female actor and I personally consider this to be one of her most finest performances.<BR> The premise is simple, the storyline honest although dark and torturous, but if there to be a moral it would have to involve that of trust, honour and the age old book by the cover saying which stand out. I wouldn't want to go to deep into the storyline, as there are twists to the plot, and although some of these twists come to light early in the film, they are still relevent and it may be considered a spoiler for me to elaborate. <BR> When I went to the cinema to see this film in 1994, it had an impact on me both mentally and physically. The Professional is in the genre that Quentin Tarantino went on to make a house hold name for himself with, although The Professional would be considered a more intelligent and sopisticated cinematic version. After watching the artful Hong Kong cinema of the 70's and 80's, directors such as John Woo having been achiving this high standard of 'gunplay anti-hero emotionally charged honour bound storyline' in films, it's plain to see that the genre is simply based on the folly of human nature, you can never refute your emotions, and they will more than likely get in your way before the final curtain. I can honestly say there is appeal for women in this film, as it is emotionally charged and at times extremely sensitive which balances out any on screen violence.<BR> If you liked: Reservoir Dogs, City On Fire, The Killer, The Godfather series. You will like this film.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I've always had a soft spot for this movie, as it was the first film that I saw by myself as a child in 1976. No one has ever argued that it's high art, but after 25 years, it's clear that this movie has more impact on the American collective psyche than most people realize. If you ask someone about the film &quot;Logan's Run&quot;, you might get a blank stare. But tell them it's the film with the palm crystals, everyone dies at 30 in a bizarre &quot;carrousel&quot; (sic) ceremony, then nearly everyone (over 30, ironically) knows the movie of which you speak.<br />In reflecting why this is so, for a moment ignore the logic inconsistencies (if the computer is all-powerful, why doesn't it implant a timed poison pill to be released at age 30?) and the numerous continuity problems (there are four crystal age colors, but that doesn't neatly divide into 30, and &quot;red&quot; seems to last for 8 years???). Many have said that it was unusually dark for its period, but a screening of &quot;Soylent Green&quot;, &quot;Rollerball&quot;, and &quot;Silent Running&quot; puts that theory to bed. On the surface, it's just one more of a long list of early 1970s eschatological nightmares. But why the hell does a city near Washington (Baltimore? Alexandria?) have so many citizens with English accents?<br />So why is this film remembered when so many of its peers fade away?  I think the answer lies in its indictment of youth oriented culture...we see that a culture based on the young is glamorous, but things don't work very well and break down (a theme from the William F. Nolan/George Clayton Johnson novel). For example, there is a slum in &quot;Cathedral&quot; and in the undersea city works that the all-powerful computer can't seem to repair. In a deleted scene, Francis off-handedly wishes a former lover luck as she participates in the Carrousel early in the film. We know from that encounter that adult relationships are incredibly shallow, and this is reinforced by the Sandman who &quot;beam in&quot; lovers for the evening.<br />After the initial luster of &quot;Logan's Run&quot; wore off, many remember it for its camp (unintentional) and its scathing spotlight on pop culture and youth worship. So it remains a de rigeur film to see on the eve of one's 30th birthday, and an interesting paragraph in the history of 1970s sci-fi.<br />The presentation of the DVD is fine. Audiophiles and videophiles may take issue with its dated sound and artifacting, but for most it's quite beautiful in DD 5.1 and TODD-AO glory. The director's commentary is interesting, but the great comments come from Michael York. Also included is a &quot;making of&quot; documentary, and the usual subtititles, language tracks, and bios.<br />Very strongly recommended!uot;beam in&quot; lovers for the evening. <br />After the initial luster of &quot;Logan's Run&quot; wore off, many remember it for its camp (unintentional) and its scathing spotlight on pop culture and youth worship.

6304698658|5.0|Christmas Vacation is the funniest of all three of the Vacation films. The reason is simple: lots of Clark and tons of Cousin Eddie. These two together are the funniest thing going. The dialogue is hilarious:<br />Clark: Can I get you somemore eggnog? Drive you out to the middle of nowhere, leave you for dead?<br />Eddie: No, I'm just fine Clark.<br />OR<br />Eddie: You surprised Clark?<br />Clark: Surprised, if I woke up tomorrow with my head sewn to the carpet I wouldn't be as surprised as I am now.<br />OR<br />Eddie: I can't swim, Clark.<br />Clark: I know that Eddie.<br />OR<br />Clark: Where's Eddie? He usually eats these G-d damn things?<br />Catherine: Oh not anymore, he found out that squirrel is high in cholesterol.<br />Randy Quaid will never play a better character and aside from Fletch, this is what Chevy Chase's legacy will be. Also the periphery characters are hilarious. Aunt Bethany (Is Rusty Still in the Navy? or Don't throw me down Clark or Is your house on fire, Clark?), Uncle Louis (So what's the matter with you?), Clark's parents (SQUIRREL!!!!!!!!), Ellen's Parents (The little lights aren't twinkling...), and Clark's kids (who are different ages in every film).<br />Christmas Vacation is a true holiday classic for the rest of us who don't lead picture perfect lives and don't pull off every holiday without a glitch. Buy it and cherish it. Highly Recommended.
B00000K44W|5.0|Jethro Tull hatte nach dem gelungenen Akustik-Comeback mit &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; ein weiteres ansprechendes Akustik-Werk präsentiert und dieses fast noch übertroffen!<br />Die Lieder sind so gut, selbst die vertrackteren akustischen Rhytmen und Flötensolo gehen so gut ins Ohr, ich erinnere mich, daß damals die Gruppe neue Fans bekam. Da sah man diese LP und &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; plötzlich auch in Plattensammlungen von Mädchen, die sonst &quot;Boney M.&quot; &quot;Abba&quot; oder Romantische Musik hörten.<BR>&quot;Heavy Horses&quot; ist als Titeltrack eine der besten Kompositionen der Gruppe überhaupt. Von den akustischen Instrumenten gefällt mir neben der Flötenmelodie am besten die Streichereinlage in der Mitte. Der Track lief oft im progressiven Jugendclub &quot;Falkenhof&quot; in Würzburg, symbolisch, daß es die Gruppe nach ihrer Durstrecke vor &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; es endgültig wieder geschafft hatte ins Gespräch zu kommen, hervorragende Kritiken zu haben und Millionen Tonträger zu verkaufen.<BR>Das Thema ist den Pferden gewidmet, damit hatte der Namensgeber &quot;Jethro Tull&quot; vor ein paar Hundert Jahren sich auch beschäftigt. Ian Anderson hatte wirklich eine Tierfarm und interessierte sich für die Tiere. Mir als Deutschen kommen da wieder Kindergeschichten von Land/Pferd und Feldern aus vergangenen Zeiten ins Gedächtnis.<BR>&quot;No Lullybye&quot; ist die zweitbeste Komposition und hat einen dramatisch sich zuspitzenden Vocal Part und ein Flöten Solo vom Feinsten.<BR>&quot;Acres Wild&quot; gefällt mir am besten. Ich habe die Texte nicht analysiert oder bewußt wahrgenommen, aber nur durch die Thematik  (Felder, Pferde; Tierfabeln) und die akustischen Instrumente hatten Jethro Tull ein neues Kapitel der britischen Folklore-Musiktradition in England geschrieben. Und einen Tonträger produziert, der zu  Millionen das Interesse an Folklore auch in die Zimmer von Jugendlichen brachte, die sonst &quot;Ramones&quot; oder &quot;Abba&quot; hörten. In Europa war gegen Ende der Siebziger Jahre ein Folklore-Festival Boom gewesen, der aber wieder abebbte ...
014028009X|3.0|The structure created many of the problems. It's supposed to be a smooth story, but is supposed to also look like a diary. I didn't know exactly where the character was going, or that she was even trying to get any particular place. I also think she was a loser, one I found difficult to sympathize with. There were several unrealistic things happening, some of which contributed to the climax, thus the climax was not all that amazing to me.<br />Also, there were many things in it that seemed British-specific and incomprehensible (like, who would care about a guy named Daniel Cleaver? He sounds like fish pate on spam.)
6304143184|5.0|E.T. is my all-time favorite. I told my 5 year old grandson the whole story from beginning to end because I have the original movie that I watch from time to time. One night we watched it together and ever since....every time he comes over....we pop popcorn and watch E.T. again. I purchased the remake on Amazon.com just in case something happens to my older tape.....I will have a back-up for us to enjoy. (...)
B00003CX95|5.0|That dialogue has to be one of the most inspirational and moving speeches ever given on film. It speaks volumes too about the war that we have been forced to wage recently. Anyway, Braveheart is nothing short of spectacular. The battle sequences are breathtaking, epic, and completely convincing. Mel Gibson does an excellent job directing such a large scale project and Braveheart succeeds on multiple levels. The character development is excellent and the viewer comes to deeply care about the Wallace character and his motley crew. At it's core, Braveheart is a love story. The tale of a man forced to wage a war that he had no intention of fighting. Avenging the death of his slain love, William Wallace besieges the English colonizers  and liberates Scotland in the name of freedom. This film is an inspirational call to arms and is truly American down to it's very core. Funny that this would come from an Aussie, eh? I can honestly say that Braveheart is one of the best films I have ever seen, no DVD collection will be complete without it. Highest Recommendation.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Das Werk war oft in den progressiven Jugendclubs zu hren. Jethro Tull hatten Mut, nur einen Track von 50 Minuten zu prsentieren. Das Experiment war aber ein Erfolg, knstlerisch wie von den Verkaufszahlen. \\"Thick as a Brick\\" beginnt langsam akustisch und baut sich spielerisch ausufernd langsam auf. Es bietet ein Spektrum an Stimmungen und klingt nicht langweilig. Eine Stimmung leitet wieder in eine andere - softer oder agressiver - ber. Es dominiert der lyrische Gesang, Akustikgitarre, John Evans Hammond und Klaviereinlagen und exotische Percussions, die fast an den Orient erinnern und die melodiefhrende Flte. Das Werk wirkt nicht berladen, alles scheint durchdacht und gut komponiert. Mir gefiel die Platte so gut, da ich nach Ende der zweiten Seiten sie noch einmal spielte. Vielleicht sogar die beste Platte der Gruppe berhaupt. Aber das soll jeder fr sich entscheiden. Mir fllt auer \\"Tubular Bells\\" kein Konzeptalbum von 50 Minuten (1 Track!) ein, da so erfolgreich war.<BR>Originell war auch der geglckte Versuch, die Welt mit der Geschichte des 8-jhrigen Gerald B. in die Irre zu fhren, der angeblich einen Preis in Lyrik nicht bekommen haben sollte wegen moralischer Bedenken und dessen Poems die Text zu \\"Thick as A Brick\\" sein sollten. Die Zeitungshlle (wer die Platte vor mindestens 25 Jahren gekauft hatte), die als Cover mit vielen Seiten diente schrieb diese (...)-Geschichte. Noch heute kann man  in Musik-Lexika Beschreibungen lesen, die von dieser Geschichte ausgehen als wahr.
B000003TAW|4.0|To begin with I am not at all a big Weezer fan.  Their new album doesn't impress me too much and their overall reputation and sound are completely repulsive to me. (Sorry to all Weezer fans but let me make my point here.)  So you are probably wondering why I bought this album and why I gave it four stars huh?<br />Well to be perfectly honest I bought this cd for two reasons.  One being that everyone went on about how great it is and second is because I got it for next to nothing.  I must admit that I was quite impressed by the effort the band put into their debut their was a whole load of creativity featured on this cd.  At first I was utterly disappointed by the opening track MY NAME IS JONAS but NO ONE ELSE and THE WORLD HAS TURNED AND LEFT ME were good songs so I felt I should continue to listen.  BUDDY HOLLY was a massive radio during 1994 and UNDONE THE SWEATER SONG was interesting.  SURF WAX AMERICA was really fun and I really enjoyed SAY IT AIN'T SO.  IN THE GARAGE was boring HOLIDAY was okay and ONLY IN DREAMS was a good album closer.  <br />Overall I found Weezer's debut impressive but not ground breaking.  The songs range from great to half baked and considering that I am not a fan of Weezer it takes a lot for me to like an album from a band I could care less for.  In conclusion &quot;Weezer&quot; is a good abum.  However if you are a fan of Weezer you'll love this. Recommended.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Episode I is not the best of the four Star Wars films but really the comparison should not be made. The sonic boom of technology and computer animation over the past 20 years has vastly changed the possibilities on screen (see Shrek, Toy Story, or Monsters Inc). Lucas has given us a modern day version of a Star Wars tale. The main difference between the two generations of films is that in the early movies the focus was on character development, whereas now the focus is on eye candy. Don't get wrong, I love me some good eye candy, and Episode I has plenty of it. The lightsaber duels in the desert and at the finale are nothing short of breathtaking, and the pod race is easily the best scene in the film. The character development in Episode I is there but not nearly as in depth as any of the first three. Episode I serves as an introduction to such characters as Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, Princess Amadala, and Anakin Skywalker. It is pretty clear that George Lucas wanted to make a technically superior film with Episode I and in that respect he has succeeded. However, I do believe that the best is yet to come. Lucas claims that Episode III will be the &quot;darkest&quot; of all the Star Wars films depicting Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader, and that is great news for those of us who believe that the Empire Strikes Back was the best of the first three films. Anyway, no self respecting Star Wars fan should be without this DVD. The sound quality is superior to anything I have ever heard and the extras and options are fantasic. This is a great bargain. Highly Recommended.
B000007MVX|3.0|Spinnen die Jethro Tull jetzt plötzlich? So und ähnlich lauteten einige Kritiken 1973, die Magazine waren verstört, wie die Gruppe nach Millionenerfolgen der vorherigen Alben plötzlich so etwas experimentelles und internes/wirres (an Text) ablieferten. Die Rezensionen waren durchweg negativ damals, doch die Zeit heilt Wunden, Ian Anderson braucht nicht mehr sauer zu sein (wie 1973 als er als Reaktion auf das Missfallen des Publikums an dieser Musik keine Konzerte mehr gab. Hatte Anderson wirklich geglaubt, die abstruse Geschichte aus seiner (anti)religiösen Phantasie würde auf Interesse stoßen?) heute wie damals hat die Platte ihre Liebhaber.<BR>1972 hatte die Gruppe einen Höhepunkt mit &quot;Thick as A Brick&quot;. Nur ein Track mit 50 Minuten. Der sensitive Sound kam sowohl bei der Kritik wie bei den Käufern an. Obwohl die altertümlich anmutende Gruppe bereits Millionenerfolge hatte, blieben sie diesem Konzept bei &quot;Passion Play&quot; treu.<br />Es gibt wieder einen Track über zwei Plattenseiten, doch diesmal schien die Musik beim ersten Mal etwas schwerverdaulicher als der Vorgänger. Die Kritiker rieben sich an der etwas wirren Story: Texte über das Leben nach dem Tod, teils ironisch und humorvoll, kaum zu verstehen. Die Musik ist etwas eigenwilliger konsttruiert als auf &quot;Thick as A Brick&quot;. Bei mehrmaligen Hören zeigen sich viele interessante Sounds und Tempo-/Melodiewechsel, aufeinander abgestimmt. Das Album zeigt in seien besseren Parts durchaus gute Momente von Jethro Tull. Besonders die akustischen Parts überzeugen und offerieren mit Akustikgitarre und Flöte eine nachdenkliche Atmosphäre. Der Keyboarder John Evans überzeugt mit seinen Hammond-, Piano und teilweise Synthesizer-Einlagen. Da das Werk bei den Käufern und auf Konzerten nicht so ankam, war Ian Anderson sauer und gab einige Zeit keine Live-Performance. Doch für den Jethro Tull Fan empfehle ich das Werk dennoch, es ist ausgezeichnet instrumentiert und produziert, hatteilweise auch schöne Melodien. Der nicht so eingefleischte Hörer könnte sich die besseren und eingängigeren Parts überspielen, die sind meiner Meinung dem Album &quot;War Child&quot; überlegen. Ian Anderson präsentierte hier einen Sound, der noch progressiver klang als Yes- oder Genesis-Alben. Doch es ist ein Zeitdokument für 1973, interessanter als die Werke nach 1982 alle miteinander. Einfach mal reinhören und die guten Momente genießen. Einige &quot;Best of&quot; Sampler bieten auch Auszüge aus dem mutigen Album. Sicher nicht das schlechteste Werk der Barden
B00005OM4N|5.0|Another year, another great CD from Britney.  This, being her third album, definitely shows that she's all grown up and she's not a little girl anymore.  Along with her new sexy look and great vocals, this CD is definitely her best yet.<BR>1. I'm A Slave For You --&gt; The first single off the album, this song is very exotic.  Although the title may suggest otherwise, this song is basically becoming a &quot;slave to music&quot; and dancing non-stop.  I love this song, it's fun, it's exotic, it's definitely very different from what we're used to coming from Brit.  A great song to dance to, I can never get enough of this song.<br />2. Overprotected --&gt; A great song coming from Brit.  I love the message in this song, and how she wants to be independent and free.  The song if very fun, and the beat is just incredible.  This will definitely become a smash hit.<br />3. Lonely --&gt; The beat to this song is great.  It has a nice hard beat, yet it has a sort of nice, mellow tone to it.  A great &quot;girl-power&quot; sort of song, about not taking a guy back.  This is a great song!<br />4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman --&gt; Probably my favourite song on the whole album, this is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  Her vocals here are just exceptional, it is beyond words, and the lyrics are just too beautiful.  Even if you're not much of a Britney fan, I'm sure you'll fall in love with this.  This song is definitely the bomb and I can't get enough of it.  It's sweet, it's beautiful, it's perfect for every girl who's trying to find her place in this world.<br />5. Boys --&gt; I love this song!  It's so much fun, a definite &quot;party&quot; song.  A great song to play while clubbing with your gal pals on a girls-night-out.  This song is fun and definitely HOT AND SEXY!<br />6. Anticipating --&gt; Not one of my faves on the album.  It is a very fun song, you can tell by the beat of the song.  I wasn't into it, but that doesn't mean others won't be.  It isa good song, but it just didn't hit the right chords for me.<br />7. I Love Rock 'n Roll --&gt; I was worried if Britney would be able to pull this off, but once again, she has.  This cover is very well done, and it shows Britney's more &quot;wild and rock 'n roll&quot; side to her.  Definitely a great, fun song to sing along to.<br />8. Cinderella --&gt; Another great song.  This song has a nice beat, and shows off Britney's vocals.  It's a really good song, and I'm still trying to really figure out what this song really talks about.  But no matter what, this song is pretty catchy, especially once you get to the chorus.<br />9. Let Me Be --&gt; I love this song!  The beat is fun, especially once you get to the chorus.  Although the verses may not be that quite interesting, the song is actually really good, especially the chorus.  It's a very catchy song, and it's a great &quot;girl-power&quot; song for independence and all.<br />10. Bombastic Love --&gt; The beat to this song is quite &quot;funky&quot; i guess.  It's quite a cool song, fun and flirty.  It's in between a fast and slow-tempo song.  It's a little different from a regualr &quot;Britney&quot; song, but still very well done.<br />11. That's Where You Take Me --&gt; I dunno, but this song didn't catch my attention either.  It's too...&quot;pop&quot; for me i guess.  I don't know, I guess it's the beat that didn't catch me.  No matter how pretty the lyrics are in a song, if it's got a bad beat, it'll be a bad song, and so I didn't really like this song.<br />12. What It's Like To Be Me --&gt; Another fave of mine, this song was written by Brit's boyfriend, Justin Timberlake from *Nsync, and Wade Robson (their choreographer).  This song has a really nice beat, and has the very obvious *Nsync vibe in it.  The beat is amazing and the lyrics are fun.  Brit's vocals are also very awesome in this song, while Justin does sing backup (and does some beat-boxing in the background).  This is definitely an amazing song, and can be a smash hit as well.  <br />So, all in all, this CD is definitely really good, besides the two songs that didn't really appeal to me.  But we can see that Brit has grown, physically, emotionally and musically.  This CD is well worth the money if you're looking for a grown-up sound with lots of fun, danceable beats to it!
B00003CXXJ|1.0|In reading the reviews for this movie, i wonder just how mind-numbed the average moviegoer is.  Was I the only one who noticed that the only villians in this film were invariably white and male?  Or that the &quot;curse&quot; that the princess was &quot;cured&quot; of was being a caucasiaan female?  Shrek struggled between being a mindless parade of fart jokes and an example of political correctness run amok.  Do special effects make up for a weak, predictable plot, gutter humor and racist overtones?  Apparently so, judging from the reviews.  Beam me up, Scotty; there really is no intelligent life here.
B000002J03|4.0|Bis heute wundere ich mich, wie der gewaltige Erfolg der Gruppe zu erklren ist, ihre Beliebtheit bei der jungen Generation von heute eingeschlossen. Die Songs sind keinesfalls so eingngig wie vergleichbar erfolgreiche Alben z.b. von AC/DC oder etwa Scorpions. Die Gruppe gehrte damals zu den &quot;Progressiven&quot; Gruppen hatte dennoch einen riesigen kommerziellen Erfolg. &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; stand 1969/70 viele Wochen an Nummer 1 der Deutschen Single Charts, neben Miguel Rios oder Dalia Lavi oder CCR!! Heute kaum mehr denkbar. So ein harter Sound stie damals auf jungfruliche Radiohrer-Ohren, schade da man das heute nicht mehr nachvollziehen kann. Eines der bekanntesten Riffs der Musikgeschichte inklusive. Der einzige andere richtige Heavy-Track ist &quot;Hearbreaker&quot;. Dieser kommt originell bluesig daher. Vielleicht ist das Erfolgsrezept die feminine Kinderstimme (mit einer enormen emotionalen Bandbreite), die in ihrem Ausdruck eigene Melodien/ und vertrackte Melodienwechsel bildete (z.B. What should never be). Im Gegensatz dazu die Gitarrenkunst und die Riffs von Jimmi Page, das schwere, manchmal wie zeitlupenartige Schlagzeug (John Bonham wird bis heute als einer der besten Drummer der letzten 30 Jahre betrachtet), die fetten Basstupfer und manchmal das zarte Mellotron/Hammond. Eigentlich eine originelle Mixtur fr Eingeweihte und Liebhaber von Blues, aber dennoch abermillionen verkaufte LPs. &quot;Thank You&quot; ist eine schne ruhige Ballade mit einem dominanten ruhigen Hammondkeyboard. Eigentlich ist auer &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; kein Track dem Hard Rock zuzuordnen. Das waren damals eher Black Sabbath oder Deep Purple. Ein weiterer guter 3 Minuten Track ist Living Loving Maid. Manche Songs sind fr mich etwas langweilig, z.B. &quot;Ramble On&quot; oder &quot;Bring it on home&quot;. Ingesamt sicher eines der besten Werke der Gruppe, wenn mir persnlich als Gesamtbild eher III und Houses of the Holy gefllt.
B00004Z459|1.0|(...)This is not rock music.  Have you ever listened to the music, not just the rap lyrics?  There is no music.  The rhythm is exactly the same in every song.  There is no bass player!  There's a DJ!  The lead singer or whatever, not exactly a singer, but I don't care to know much about the members in the band anyway, but the Lead 'singer' doesn't play any instruments!   How can this compare to Nirvana?  One reviewer said they have the chance to become a modern day Nirvana!  Are you out of you mind?  It sickens me to think how many radio brainwashed teens think \\"Nirvana is Cool!\\".  They don't know what real music is.  These people couldn't pronounce Krist Novoselic's last name (And if you don't even know who I'm talking about then don't even bother).  Linkin Park is the worst Pop Rap group thing or whatever.  There is no talent in them musically.  Listen to the rhythm the two guitars play!  It's non existent!  Half Note, Half Note, Half Note.  Let's play the same three chords over and call it a song!  Why do all these teeny boppers like Linkin Park?  Oh ok, it's catchy!  (...)In conclusion, catchy lyrics don't make music.  (...)
B000002J0B|4.0|&quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; war mein erstes Album der Gruppe, da ich bewut im Radio mitbekam. Ich war 12 Jahre alt und dachte bis dato, da Led Zeppelin eine weibliche Sngerin hatten. Die emotionale Gegenstzlichkeit zwischen diesen Vokals und den exzellent schweren (schwerflligen) Drums hatten mich fasziniert. Gerade diese emotionalen Gegenstze trafen den melancholisch-harten deutschen Musikgeschmack genau wie Deep Purple oder Uriah Heep. Diese Frhzeit des Rock wird leider nicht mehr wiederkehren, die Hrer bestanden auch aus Klassik-, Soft- und Bluesliebhabern. Ich erinnere mich, da das Album in den Zeitungen sehr gemischt aufgenommen wurde. Es gab etliche negative Kritiken. Fr mich ist es noch heute eine sehr gute und stimmungsvolle Platte, man mu nicht Fan der Gruupe sein um sie ein wenig zu mgen. Sehr eindrucksvoll sind &quot;No Quarter&quot; und &quot;Rain Song&quot; und &quot;Over the Hills&quot;, ruhige, excellente Gitarren, Soft-Songs mit ein paar harten Hhepunkten. Die Lieder drcken auch Optimismus und Sonne aus (The Ocean und Over the Hills). Etwas dunkel ist die keltische Dmonensage von &quot;No Quarter&quot; als Kontrast. Toll ist auch &quot;The Ocean&quot; mit seinen Wechselbad der Kinderstimme von Plant und dem dominant lauten Drum von Bonham, von etlichen Polls regelmig als einer der weltbesten Drummer gewhlt. Meiner Meinung hat das Album nur einen langweiligen Song (Crunge), sonst ist alles klasse. Was man von den anderen Led Zeppelin Alben nicht unbedingt sagen kann, die hufig nur zur Hlfte aus guten Songs und zur Hlfte aus schwcheren Kompositionen bestehen. Das Album hatte auch einen besseren Aufnahmesound als IV. Die Covergestaltung ist auch orginell und erinnert an keltische Mythen. Mit III. (ebenfalls folkloreorientiert) mein Lieblingsalbum der Gruppe und die letzte Platte der Gruppe, auf der noch etwas innovatives passiert ist. Radiosendungen wie &quot;Club 16&quot; spielten die Songs sehr hufig, sie konnten ihre Wirkung zu dieser Zeit entfalten, mit der Heyvy-Welle ab 1976 (AC DC, Iron Maiden,...) verlor die Musik von Led Zeppelin an Originalitt und Einzigartigkeit, da sie - flschlicherweise - diesem Genre zugeordnet war und sich auf diesen Markt konzentrierte. Der Punk tat sein briges, um Musik in dieser Art seine Unschuld und Daseinsberechtigung mit Gewalt zu nehmen. Aber hier, 1973, da waren sie noch sehr originell und jung, ich freue mich, da die Gruppe heute viele neue Hrer gewonnen hat.
B00005B74V|4.0|...these CDs are from SPAIN, not France, as most reviews state, nor from Holland, as the stickers on the package suggest: RCA Spain Srl... BMG Especail Productos...is someone embarrassed to be selling discs from Spain? Is the quality subpar?<br />Also, as I search international Mail order sites I find that ALL of these albums have the same list price, yet here in the US, retailers insist on charging MORE for &lt;Surrealistic Pillow&gt; than all the others: probably because they feel they can get away with it.<BR>So much for 'blows against the empire'<BR>as such, besides the extra tracks, there is nothing in the way of documentation or notes...
B000008H1Y|5.0|Das Album war 1976 eine Überraschung. Ich erinnere mich, daß Jethro Tull aus der Mode kam, sie verkauften zwar immer noch mit hohen Umsätzen ihre alten Platten, doch die letzten kamen nicht mehr so an (Too old, Passion Play, War Child), eine Hinwendung an die akustischen Tull, die etwas an Fairport Convention erinnern gab es teilweise schon auf &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;.<BR>Doch &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; hatte viel mehr gutes kommerzielles Songpotential. Plätzlich überschlugen sich die Kritiker wie &quot;die Gruppe geht an ihre akustischen Wurzeln zurück, etc.<BR>Die Band gewann damals auch neue Fans mit den durchweg ansprechenden Liedern. Das ist der perfekte Soundtrack zu einem &quot;Robin-Hood Film&quot;.<BR>&quot;The Whistler&quot; hat ein frenetisches Flötensolo und temperamentvolle Akustik-Gitarren Klänge, hätte eigentlich ein Hit werden können, man denkt an den Rattenfänger von Hameln (Deutsches Märchen).<BR>&quot;Hunting Girl&quot; &quot;Titelsong&quot; und &quot;Jack in the Green&quot; gefallen mir am besten, die übrigen Tracks sind ebenfalls gute Songschreibe.<br />Eines der am meisten beachtetsten Alben im Jahre 1976 und ein gelungenes &quot;Comeback&quot; mit neuem Akustik-Sound der viele alte Instrumente vorstellte (Mandoline, Dudelsack...) und ein Verkaufserfolg. Daß mit &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; noch eine Steigerung der Songqualität kurze Zeit später kommen würde, dass hatte sich damals bei dieser gelungenen Platte niemand vorgestellt.
B00005JG6Q|1.0|I was excited when Akira came out on DVD.  However, I was not prepared for what I was about to see.  Having watched the \\"ORIGINAL\\" Akira on VHS, I was awaiting the digitally remastered and new English dialogue to be superb.  Who's (...) idea was this?  The new English dialogue lost EVERYTHING from the original Akira.  I watched and listened to three different characters pronounce \\"Akira\\" three different ways, all incorrectly.  The only part about the digitally remastering of this classic was that the colors appeared crisp and brighter accenting the fact that it is a well done anime.<br />I was thoroughly disappointed in what Pioneer has done to a classic movie.  I wasted money (...) for this awful version.  I guess it just goes to show that you shouldn't mess with perfection.
B000002J09|4.0|Die LP hatte ein phantasievolles Cover. Die Singles &quot;Black Dog&quot; und &quot;Rock'n Roll&quot; waren beeindruckende Frhwerke des jungen Hardrock. Doch beide Songs unterscheiden sich sehr. Ich glaubte damals als Kind im Radio eine weibliche Sngerin zu hren. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; ist sicherlich ein Spitzensong mit dramatisch sich aufbauenden Hhepunkten. Manchmal glaube ich allerdings keinen besinnlichen melancholischen Text zu vernehmen, sondern etwas anderes; was an den Schwarz-Okkult Gerchten des Gitarristen dran ist wei ich nicht, aber in keltischen melancholischen Stimmungen htte das Thema als Tarnung wenig verloren, man glaubt doch etwas schnes und besinnliches zu hren. &quot;When Leave breaks&quot; ist ein ungeschliffenes lautes Stck mit einem tollen Drum-Intro und einer Blues-Harmonika und einem absichtlich? unperfekten Sound. &quot;Going to California&quot; ist melancholisch fr Candle-Light, auch der Song mit der famosen Sandy Denny, die von Fairport Convention geliehen wurde. 3 Songs finde ich etwas langweilig, der Rest ist aber - trotz des etwas schlechten Aufnahmesounds - so gut, da sich die Anschaffung lohnt. Als Nostalgieobjekt fr ltere Hrer geeignet wie fr jugendliche Neuhrer, die dem aktuellen Metal etwas farbenfrohes und ursprngliches entgegensetzen mchte. Springtime. Aus einer Zeit, als der Pop noch jung war, kaum ein Fan lter wie 20 und kein Musiker lter als 25 war. Der Herbst 1971 war wirklich eine Bltezeit als Schnappschuss der letzten 30 Jahre. Ich dachte immer, das das mit meinen persnlichen Assoziationen zusammenhngt. Vor kurzem war eine zweistndige Radiosendung, die sonst aktuelle Themen an Musik behandelt in Hessen (schwarz wei). Es wurden die Vorweihnachts-Langspielplatten untersucht, die am Ende des Jahres  herauskamen. Die meisten Jahre wurden nicht so gut bewertet. Auer 1971: Chicago ist in der Hitparade mit 4 Boxes Set, Elton John &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot; erblickt das Licht der Welt, Pink Floyd setzt mit &quot;Meddle&quot; das vielleicht letzte beeindruckende Werk in die Welt, bevor das mystische Feuer (leider mit &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; eingeleitet) um die Gruppe langsam erlosch. Und nicht zuletzt Led Zeppelin IV kommt ins Weihnachtsgeschft mit &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; und dem mystischen Cover des alten Mannes mit der Lampe. Those were the days ...
B00003CXXS|5.0|I loved this edition of Jurassic Park. It was not as good as the first one because its not as groundbreaking. However it does go in a new direction unlike the second one which just copies the success of 2. With that said, bringing back Dr. Grant was a great idea. He's perfect for his part.
B000007MVX|3.0|Spinnen die Jethro Tull jetzt plötzlich? So und ähnlich lauteten einige Kritiken 1973, die Magazine waren verstört, wie die Gruppe nach Millionenerfolgen der vorherigen Alben plötzlich so etwas experimentelles und internes/wirres (an Text) ablieferten. Die Rezensionen waren durchweg negativ damals, doch die Zeit heilt Wunden, Ian Anderson braucht nicht mehr sauer zu sein (wie 1973 als er als Reaktion auf das Missfallen des Publikums an dieser Musik keine Konzerte mehr gab. Hatte Anderson wirklich geglaubt, die abstruse Geschichte aus seiner (anti)religiösen Phantasie würde auf Interesse stoßen?) heute wie damals hat die Platte ihre Liebhaber.<BR>1972 hatte die Gruppe einen Höhepunkt mit &quot;Thick as A Brick&quot;. Nur ein Track mit 50 Minuten. Der sensitive Sound kam sowohl bei der Kritik wie bei den Käufern an. Obwohl die altertümlich anmutende Gruppe bereits Millionenerfolge hatte, blieben sie diesem Konzept bei &quot;Passion Play&quot; treu.<br />Es gibt wieder einen Track über zwei Plattenseiten, doch diesmal schien die Musik beim ersten Mal etwas schwerverdaulicher als der Vorgänger. Die Kritiker rieben sich an der etwas wirren Story: Texte über das Leben nach dem Tod, teils ironisch und humorvoll, kaum zu verstehen. Die Musik ist etwas eigenwilliger konsttruiert als auf &quot;Thick as A Brick&quot;. Bei mehrmaligen Hören zeigen sich viele interessante Sounds und Tempo-/Melodiewechsel, aufeinander abgestimmt. Das Album zeigt in seien besseren Parts durchaus gute Momente von Jethro Tull. Besonders die akustischen Parts überzeugen und offerieren mit Akustikgitarre und Flöte eine nachdenkliche Atmosphäre. Der Keyboarder John Evans überzeugt mit seinen Hammond-, Piano und teilweise Synthesizer-Einlagen. Da das Werk bei den Käufern und auf Konzerten nicht so ankam, war Ian Anderson sauer und gab einige Zeit keine Live-Performance. Doch für den Jethro Tull Fan empfehle ich das Werk dennoch, es ist ausgezeichnet instrumentiert und produziert, hatteilweise auch schöne Melodien. Der nicht so eingefleischte Hörer könnte sich die besseren und eingängigeren Parts überspielen, die sind meiner Meinung dem Album &quot;War Child&quot; überlegen. Ian Anderson präsentierte hier einen Sound, der noch progressiver klang als Yes- oder Genesis-Alben. Doch es ist ein Zeitdokument für 1973, interessanter als die Werke nach 1982 alle miteinander. Einfach mal reinhören und die guten Momente genießen. Einige &quot;Best of&quot; Sampler bieten auch Auszüge aus dem mutigen Album. Sicher nicht das schlechteste Werk der Barden
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie served it's purpose well.  I think that it explains many of the situations we enjoyed in the seccond trio of stories.<br />I realy enjoyed the enhanced sound and graphics of the dvd over the video tape.  If you have a surround sound system this dvd is a must.
B000008H1W|4.0|Die Platte gefiel mir nach einigen schwcheren Werken wieder gut. Nach &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; das erste Werk, das mir in seiner Gesamtheit wieder gefiel. &quot;War Child&quot; war berproduziert mit wenig guten Kompositionen, &quot;Passion Play&quot; zu intellektuell und &quot;Too old&quot; hatte nur zur Hlfte gute Songs. &quot;Minstral in the Gallery&quot; ist ein origineller Titelsong, z.T. akustisch, dann kommt ein fr Tull-Verhltnisse uerst harter Heavy-Sound. Doch die meisten Lieder sind getragen, fast traurig und wirken wie das Cover mittelalterlich. Die Platte zeigt eine Richtung, die mit &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; und &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; noch ausgereifter klang. Zurck zu den Wurzeln, akustisch und locker. Anspieltips: &quot;One White Duck&quot;, der Titelsong, &quot;Cold Winds to Walhalla&quot;. Wenn ich die Platte hre assoziiere ich eher windiges und regnerisches Wetter und einen Tag in der Natur damit. N
6303407188|5.0|You may have never heard about the cineast Edward Wood, Jr, but if you love cinema, this film is made for you. More than a cinebiography of the late diretor, the movie is a declaration of love for filmaking itself.<br />Shoot in magnificent black &amp; white, the plot follows Ed during his 'rise' in Hollywood. Tim Burton is a great moviemaker and in this picture he is as good as he has never been. He does not hides his adimiration for Ed, and what he brings to screen is a passionate story made by someone who loves it.<br />The cast is nothing but great. Of course, most of the show belongs to Johnny Depp, who deliveries a brilliant perfornance as 'the worst filmmaker ever'. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are much more than fine as Ed's the love interests. Vincent D'Onofrio is as great as usual surprising everyone playing Orson Welles (In a key scene Burton puts together both the worst and the best director chatting in a bar ). And, Martin Landau is so good as Bela Lugosi that one might think he is 'possessed' by Lugosi himself.<br />All in all, it is a great film. It's amazing to see Wood's adventures in order to finish - or even start- his pictures. If you like this movie, I also recomend you &quot;Gods and Monters&quot;, &quot;RKO 281&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot;. They won't let you down!!!
B000002J1U|4.0|&quot;Immigrant Song&quot; bleischwer mit einer seltsam ausdrucksvollen Kinderstimme und einer vertrackten einpr&auml;gsamen &quot;Melodie&quot; war laut Charthistoriebuch ein Hit. DA&szlig; die B-Seite der Single &quot;Hey Hey&quot; bisher nirgendwo wiederver&ouml;ffentlicht wurde ist schade. Dieser Song hat eine mitrei&szlig;ende Akustik-Gitarren Figur (was meiner Ansicht typisch die verkl&auml;rte erste Generation dieser Musik um 1971 mit &quot;What is life&quot; &quot;It don`t come easy&quot; pa&szlig;te). Der Song ist -wie gesagt - leider nur auf der Single drauf, die mu&szlig; man erst mal finden. &quot;Friends&quot; klingt etwas monoton, aber interessant. &quot;Tangerine&quot; ist ein weiteres melodisches Highlight mit attraktiven schlanken Akustikgitarren-Riffs, einer der besten Songs der Gruppe &uuml;berhaupt und irgendwie unterbewertet. Irgenwie ist ein folkloristisches keltisches Element in der Musik zu sp&uuml;ren, in den meisten Songs. Richtig bluesig ist (zum Gl&uuml;ck finde ich) nur das lange &quot;Since I`ve been loving you&quot;, die einzige richtige Heavy Nummer ist der &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;. Die Zusammenstellung ist ausgewogen, melodisch und abwechslungsreich. Mit II, &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; und &quot;IV&quot; anschaffenswert.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|On September 11th to two great events happened.  One a horrible act of human indifference by some unseen, depraved monsters,  and the other, the release of this album.  At last something positive to remember that date by.<BR>A truly great album that cuts through the melee of current music like a hot knife through butter.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|As I looked at the reviews of this movie it seems that many people had made exaggerated negative ratings. Let's get it real here. Angelina Jolie does make a good Lara Croft and the action is pretty good. The robot battle scene, the mansion fight, and the temple attack scene were pretty good visual effects and a lot of cool action. The music had a nice blend with the movie. I enjoyed the music video in the DVD by U2. The only things I didn't like about this movie was how the story went. In the story Lara is supossed to battle with the Illuminati but somewhere in the story Lara actually works with them when she's supposed to be fighting against them. That's something I can't quite really understand. Maybe a better story, better combat scenes, and a better villain could make this movie better. If they are going to make a sequel, they better make a good story. If they used some action similar to the Matrix, and draw in a little more romance, it could get more people and make the movie exciting.
630451087X|3.0|I like David Lynch. He&#8217;s one of my top-five all time favourite directors. BLUE VELVET &#8211; possibly his highpoint - was a great film that hit the mark on American suburbia. ERASERHEAD was strange, but comprehensible and fascinating. THE ELEPHANT MAN is a masterpiece. DUNE was, well, let&#8217;s leave that one alone. WILD AT HEART won best picture in Cannes and deserved it too. TWIN PEAKS is just about the best television show there has ever been. But LOST HIGHWAY is just David Lynch trying to be too much David Lynch. It&#8217;s too strange. It&#8217;s too weird. It&#8217;s, dare I say it, too elitist?<br />But LOST HIGHWAY is a fascinating film. This is mostly due to a wonderful score. Angelo Badalamenti deserves as much credit for any David Lynch film as Lynch himself. It seems that the one can not be without the other. Lynch has also managed to get an impressive amount of highly talented musicians to contribute on the soundtrack. Artists such as Lou Reed, Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, and The Smashing Pumpkins are all here. Goth rocker Marilyn Manson and the German industrial heavy-metal band Ramms+ein both made their fame on this film (whatch out for a cameo by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez in the film). LOST HIGHWAY also fronts great visuals. The film opens with a shot of a lonely stretch of road, in the dead of night, being lit up by the headlights of a car driving into the dark, with the Bowie song &#8220;I&#8217;m Deranged&#8221; playing in the background. And this sort of sets the tone for the film. Everything unfolds like a dream. The story telling is non-linear. It&#8217;s fragmented. And it&#8217;s, well, &#8220;dreamy&#8221;.<br /> It may seem that everything about this film appears to be &#8220;just right&#8221;. Strong visuals. Great music. But everything sort of falls through because there&#8217;s really no way of &#8220;getting&#8221; the film. I&#8217;ve heard about a ducin or so different intepretations and, well, theyall seem plausible. Some people seem to think that Bill Pullmann&#8217;s character made some sort of deal with the devil (the mystery man being the devil) to escape from prison, and that is why the later mechanic as a lump on his forhead. Perhaps? I sort of lean to theory that Bill Pullmann, the mechanic, and the mystery man is the same person, and what we&#8217;re really watching is Pullmann&#8217;s desire to escape from his life and so he conjures up this mechanic to escape into; escapism does seem to be a favourable theme of David Lynch (as in ERASERHEAD).<br />LOST HIGHWAY is a film strictly for fans of David Lynch (or for people who in general like weird films). I like those types of film so I liked LOST HIGHWAY (albeit not as much as BLUE VELVET or WILD AD HEART). (...)

B00003CXHJ|1.0|This film, U-571, will attempt to fool you into believing that American sailors were the ones who captured the Enigma machine, when in fact it was really the British who accomplished that feat. This just goes to show that Hollywood doesn't treat history with respect. Why couldn't they just have used British actors in the film? Why does everything Hollywood produce have to be americanized? And this is increasingly devestating when a lot of people today regard films like this as history. I once read a customer review of THE PATRIOT where the film was hailed as an historic lesson. Please! Read a book! Hollywood has got to start treating history with respect. If you want to see a fantastic submarine film, see Wolfgang Petersen's DAS BOOT. U-571 is just another Hollywood blunder, that's all about getting the numbers up at the box office.
B00004XONN|5.0|I know everyone's pretty much given their own opinion of this album as is the case with any Radiohead release since Ok Computer.  The album's been described, taken apart, trashed, deciphered, what have you, so I'll try to keep this short and to the point.  To me, this album's all about growth.  Growth as artists, musicians, and as a band.  Nothing on this album remotely resembles anything from Ok Computer, which may have been troubling to some Radiohead fans, but to me it was the only logical avenue to pursue.  Growth can't be achieved without change, and with this album Radiohead replaced their entire wardrobe.
B00005LOUQ|4.0|Despite all the bashing, The Grinch is, in my opinion, a very good film. The camera angles are wonderfully creative and delightful. The computer graphics are so clear and precise, it's difficlut to tell what's real and what isn't. <br /> The acting... well.. Jim Carrey pretty much carries the whole thing on his shoulders, as it should be. He does a wonderful job transitioning himself from disgusting to charming over the course of the film. The rest of the cast seems sort of out of place. Christine Baransky took a part as Martha May, the beautiful &quot;Queen of Christmas&quot; who has always had a crush on the Grinch.<br />The girl who plays Cindy Lou Who was very appropriately cast, though she should not be singing.<br /> The film offers a fabulous soundtrack, a relatively solid plot, and fun time to get together with family. It's not a masterpiece, but it is very enjoyable.
B00002ZZ5U|5.0|When you want an album like this, you may wanna buy it import. Why? Because it has Love and Affection live, because for your collection and because it's one of the best albums EVER!!!!!!  (...) We are talking about Hysteria from Def Leppard.  This album doesn't have a wrong note on any song, it's produced by the master \\"Mutt\\" Lange and it has more hits than any Britney Spears album.<br />I have a younger brother that when this album was at its best, he was only 5 years old, now he's around 20 and he thinks it's one of the best.  I wanna ask all of you teenagers if you have, right now, an album that can stand the test of time like this one? Well, I already knew your answer.<br />I don't think if it fits to review every song, because if you are reading this, you already listened this cd.<br />The only difference from the american cd to the japanese cd is that it has Love and Affection live (like I already told you) and it has the lyrics on japanese and english.  It has other things written on japanese but if I have a hard time with the english, What do you think about the japanese?<br />This import album is for every one that have the second (or third, or fourth......) oportunity to buy it again or for someone that got stolen all the cd collection and have to start all over again (like myself).
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Christina Aguilera just continues to impress me year after year as she releases more and more great music. With this, he first holiday disc, Aguilera proves what her range is all about. The album in a word is amazing. Though the vocals become a bit extreme in some tracks, they are splendid in others. Her new songs are very easliy calleld masterpieces and her renditions of classic carols go from startling to just plain perfect! <br />1. Christmas Time: This is a pretty song, but unless you listen to it a lot, the tune sort of escapes you. ***<br />2. This Year: This is my second favorite of the album. It sounds a bit R&amp;B, but stays very undeniably Christmas-y. Her vocals in this one are just right; powerful and strong, yet not overdone. *****<br />3. Have Yourself a Merry Merry Christmas: Third favorite of the album. She does such a remarkable job with this Judy Garland classic, you'd never believe Christina wasn't the first to record it. Everything about it is expressive and heartfelt, there is so much emotion in her voice, it just makes you feel like smiling. *****<br />4. Angels We Have Heard on High: Okay, second WORST of the album. She starts off very well, but towards the end, she includes a choir and just screams too much for my liking. Hard to listen to. I usually just listen to the first half, then skip to the next song. **<br />5. Merry Christmas, Baby: My favorite of the album. This new classic begins with &quot;Auld Lang Syne,&quot; then goes into a really Ella Fitzgerald-sounding jazz song. Buy the album for this song if nothing else! *************************************<br />6. O Holy Night: Another beautiful carol. Very strong and expressive, though she sounds like she's concentrating too hard on her voice and not so much on the words. ****<br />7. These Are The Special Times: This is yet another favorite. So rich and gorgeous in every imaginable way, this song just deals with the beauty of the holiday and the meaning. Very nice. *****<br />8. This Christmas: Okay, but another one you forget the tune really quickly. ***<br />9. XTINA'S Song: Very worst thing I've ever heard by Christina. It's just Ms. Aguilera screaming &quot;It's Christmas time!&quot; over and over to a synthesized tune. Unpleasant. *<br />10. The Christmas Song (Holiday Remix): My tie for best of the album. She's really feeling what she's singing and does the best job with this song! It has a really good new beat, but it sort of sounds like someone's playing billiards in time with the music. I love it anyway, though. *****<br /> This is a very impressive CD and has just fabulous songs. So? What are you waiting for? BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005NZBN|5.0|Being a Dylan fan and throughly knowing all of his classic albums  I am certainly sure that &quot;Love And Theft&quot; IS also a classic. It took this listener a couple of times to really appreciate this album but it is very rewarding regarding lyrics and the sublime music hammered out by the band. The twelve songs are nothing but excellent. I have listened to &quot;Cry A While&quot; countless times  but also the rocky &quot;Honest With Me&quot; and the superb ballads &quot;Bye And Bye&quot; and &quot;Moonlight&quot;. Yet the album is worth listening to in a straight run. As usual Dylan's wordplay and allusions in the lyrics throughout the album are also up to notch with his usual standards. The extra tracks are interesting, &quot;The Times They Are A-Changing&quot; is so valid today as it was back in 1963, specially if you consider that this alternate version of the song was issued on the 11th September. A great buy in any of the two editions of the album.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Though there are some songs that definitely should have made the cut on this CD, it includes some of my very favorites. This album shows how Madonna has grown over the years. From her soft yet seductive &quot;Erotica&quot; all the way to the country-twisted &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; this CD covers the basic Madonna bases. Included are:<br />1. Deeper And Deeper<BR>2. Erotica<BR>3. Human Nature<BR>4. Secret<BR>5. Don't Cry For Me Argentina<BR>6. Bedtime Story<BR>7. The Power Of Goodbye<BR>8. Beautiful Stranger<BR>9. Frozen<br />10. Take A Bow<BR>11. Ray Of Light<BR>12. Don't Tell Me<BR>13. What It Feels Like For A Girl<BR>14. Drowned World/Substitute For Love<BR>15. Music <br />We've all heard most of these, and- well, it's from Madonna! We KNOW what to expect! If you're just becoming familiar with her work(I'm thinking of younger fans here), this is essential, as is The Immaculate Collection. These CDs include some of the bigger hits she's had and give you an idea of what her music is about. If you're a die-hard, you probably already own it. (As do I!) <br /> Whether you like her or not, I think this CD has an incredible amount of variety and wonderful music. An essential for any fan of pop music. (Though I would have liked &quot;American Pie&quot; on there.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I am writing this review for any music lovers who may NOT have bluegrass or folk music on the top of their list when purchasing a CD. I myself, listen to a variety of music, but have never considered bluegrass something I would listen to more than in passing. I was wrong.<br />I purchased this CD after watching the Coen brother's movie of the same name. The music was such an intergral part of the movies storyline and emotional impact, I had to get the album and give it a try. You see, folk music is about storytelling. As opposed to most pop and rock that focuses on catchy rhymes about sex, opposite sex, and raunchy sex (did I mention sex?), folk music tells stories about people. These people could me you and I, and they could be thinking about sex, but they are also living out life, and experiencing the World while you are along for the ride. It's truly refreshing, and I've made it a part of my regular CD rotation.<br />I've also begun to add storytelling elements to my own songwriting. I find that I have a lot more to say than &quot; la, la, la, la, I love ya, ya, ya, ya!&quot; We all have a story to tell. We are all just folks after all.<br />I owe it all to &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;<br />Praise be!
031286504X|5.0|I am Legend is arguably the greatest short horror novel ever written, and its influence on the horror genre has been profound.  Stephen King and many other of today's masters rank this book highly in their personal top ten lists of favorites.  It is a short novel that can be read in one sitting; it is hard to put down, building in intensity from start to finish.  Matheson creates an entirely new type of vampire fiction herein.  Transcending the traditional vampire tale, he adds science fiction elements to produce a refreshing new interpretation of Stoker's legend.  The most fascinating part of the story is the protagonist's (Richard Neville's) attempts to explain the legendary aspects of the vampire myth in scientific terms.  His discovery of a bacterium, which he dubs vampiris, as the true source of vampirism struck me anew reading the novel again after the events of September 11, 2001.  Although we only get pieces of the story regarding the outbreak of the vampiric plague, including a reference to bombings, it can easily be seen as the fruits of germ warfare.  Neville even conjectures that the Black Death of the Middle Ages was caused by this same vampiris germ, and he extrapolates facts and ideas from that history in his attempts to understand why such defenses as garlic, crosses, and stakes driven into the heart actually are effective against the hordes of undead creatures menacing his own time.  He studies academic texts and conducts experiments with the blood of these creatures, which is the means by which he identifies the bacterium.  The essence of garlic has no effect on the germ when injected into a blood sample, which initially he is unable to explain, but he later is able to explain garlic's effectiveness.  Less scientific tests lead him to conclude that crosses are only effective against &quot;Christian&quot; vampires; the cross has no meaning to for vampires who were once Jews and Moslems, but sacred symbols of those religions, such as the Torah and the Koran, do.  All of these scientific tests and speculations are just fascinating.<br />Neville is essentially the last man on earth, and the loneliness of his situation is the central part of the story.  Matheson is able to communicate Neville's emotional feelings vividly, making him very real.  We gradually acquire the story of the deaths of Neville's wife and daughter, essentially experiencing the pain he goes through when these memories overcome him.  We watch him drink himself into a stupor as each night finds him besieged in his fortified house, surrounded by vampires, including his old friend and neighbor, calling for him to come out.  We watch him slowly lose his grip on sanity and come very close to giving up.  Then, however, we watch him overcome his depression and courageously fight to live in the nightmare world he is trapped in.  The scenes with the dog he finds are full of emotion and really gripped this reader.  This is Neville's first contact with nonvampiric life, and his attempts to befriend and help the poor creature (at the same time finally finding a companion) touched me greatly and brought tears to my eyes.  His eventual discovery of another human being like himself is also powerful and emotional, although to speak more about this aspect of the story is to risk giving something away to the future reader.<br />This is a story of one man overcoming all obstacles and fighting to defend his way of life and his very humanity.  The novel deals with the human condition, the essential ingredient to effective horror writing.  Neville struggles constantly with his doubts and fears, particularly as he commits acts that he would have condemned as barbarous in the time before the plague.  His needs for companionship of any kind offer us a clear image of the inner soul of man.  By the end of the story, he does indeed become legend, both in his world and in ours.e Koran, do.

It's not that she smokes and drinks too much, obsesses over her weight and her love life, is incompetent at both her jobs, and allows her mother to manipulate her -- it's that she obviously hates the fact that she does all these things, and yet she never manages to change her ways in the slightest.  She's forever running in circles, trying to learn feng shui or become a gourmet cook, but her interest peters out after a few days and she's on to something new.  If there was just one thing she was good at or really enjoyed (other than self-destructive pursuits like the aforementioned drinking and obsessing), she would have been a much more likable character.<br />(...)The book's failings are made even more obvious by the fact that the plot draws on \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen.  Austen's novel has exactly what this book lacks -- a heroine we can respect, who makes mistakes but who learns from them, and who is actually a very good \\"match,\\" personality-wise, for her \\"prince.\\"  The borrowing from Austen becomes painful towards the end of the book, when the whole mom-on-the-lam complication arises -- obviously nothing more than an attempt to parellel Lydia's elopement in \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  While the plot twist in \\"P&P\\" works because the whole book has been preparing the reader for it to occur, it comes out of nowhere in \\"Bridget Jones\\" and makes no sense whatsoever.  <br />I was actually reminded of another Jane Austen \\"update\\" -- the movie \\"Clueless,\\" which was really pretty good.  The difference between that movie and this book/movie is that the girl in \\"Clueless\\" actually learns something during the course of the movie, and comes out with a better understanding of herself and, basically, becomes a better person.  That's something that's totally lacking here.<br />In spite of my obvious problems with this book, I'm giving it 3 stars because it IS funny and because I'm sure most people won't have the problems with it that I have.

B00005RFAI|5.0|That's all I have to say! I haven't even heard the album (just the samples on this site) and I want to get it....BADLY! This is a total departure from &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot;, and that's definately a good thing. I was thinking of MAYBE picking this album up, but hopefully I'll get it tomorrow! Way to go P!nk!!!!
B00005B4GU|4.0|I chafe a little when people suggest that Amnesiac is just leftovers from Kid A or that it should be called \\"Kid B\\", because, quite plainly, it's not. Rather, Amnesiac is very much its own album. Yes, it shares stylistic similarities with Kid A moreso than it does with any other Radiohead album, but it still remains a veritable work of its own, with its own unique cohesion. It has a more \\"songy\\" feel than Kid A- you get the feeling that the band is expressing itself in a more concrete way, whereas Kid A was more abstract. Amnesiac does has its moments of abstraction as well (Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors, Like Spinning Plates), but tracks like Pyramid Song, You and Whose Army?, I Might Be Wrong, Knives Out, and Dollars and Cents feel like extremely well-developed, thought out SONGS in the more typical sense of the word. I found this album to be difficult to get into at first, but after repeated listening, I discovered that it's a grower. Now about the songs: <BR> The album begins with the skittery, glitchy Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box. Hyper-compressed Kraftwerkian beats, pulsing bass and analog synths, and Thom Yorke's bare-bones lyrics of self-vindication combine to create a work of stunning neurotic intensity. It feels like some of the lyrics on Amnesiac employ a narrator character rather than come directly from Yorke himself, and I think Packt is one of those songs. The narrator would be snarling if he weren't so calmly and grimly self-assured. The second song, Pyramid Song, is one of the most amazing pieces the band has ever recorded; it is indescribable in words, and simply must be experienced. It is beautiful, unsettling, difficult, and impossible to ignore once it's gotten into your system. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors is a trash-compactor that pounds avant-garde techno into something almost unrecognizable as coming from human beings. Doors open and shut within the music as the rhythm surges you onward into howling dissonance. You and Whose Army?, with it's 30's lounge/jazz vibe at the beginning and it's grand piano explosion at the end recalls a sleeping giant slowly being roused to perform some terribly magnificent action. I Might Be Wrong troubled me at first, because I liked the idea and the riff, but it seemed like they kept it so low-key when I felt that they could have really rocked it out. I've come to realize now that this is what makes I Might Be Wrong such an amazing song- the restraint that Radiohead showed in arranging it; it broods and simmers rather than erupts. Knives Out is not a nice song, but listening to the mellow, surfish/jazzish guitar, you'd be lulled into believing it so. No, it's rather nasty in an ugly/beautiful sort of way, and I find it oddly compelling despite it's morbid content (again, I think Yorke employs a persona here, rather than singing directly from himself; I might be wrong). The version of Morning Bell plods at a dirge-like pace, and it very much wants to be a triumphant, happy song despite the fact that it's about a rather bitter divorce situation. It's quite a different take than the more sinister-sounding Kid A version, but equally as engaging. Dollars and Cents is a tense groove built out of a simple two-chord idea. It feels like it could be a forgotten Charles Mingus idea left at the bottom of a well to languish in it's own major/minor key pushing and prodding. Hunting Bears is nice guitar instrumental, a palate-cleanser before the subtle shark-attack that is Like Spinning Plates (on album full of memorably arresting songs, it takes the cake). The album closes with Life in a Glass House which shares with Morning Bell a dirge-like feel and a focus on domestic unrest, only this time its done up in New Orleans swamp jazz; a suitably numb and detached way to close a record where every song hits you straight in the stomach. Gasping for breath has rarely felt so enjoyable.<BR> Like it's sibling album, Kid A, Amnesiac is not music that you can casually listen to. Repeated listenings are required for it to \\"click\\" with the listener, but the payoff does indeed come and it is well worth it.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I'm a pretty big Star Trek fan and couldn't wait for this DVD to arrive, however I've been somewhat disappointed.  The advertisements say 7 hours of bonus materials, and that seems to be more of a technicality.  Most of the bonus material is commentary.  The &quot;deleted scenes&quot; are nothing more than scenes deleted from this DVD version, originally shown in the theatrical release.  I do admit that the TV spots and trailers are interesting, but I guess I was hoping for more.  The DVD is till a &quot;must have&quot; for any Star Trek fan, but don't purchase this thinking you're going to see an abundance of &quot;fresh&quot; Star Trek you haven't seen before.  The STMP VHS Special Longer Version is actually longer than this DVD version and contains the scenes listed under &quot;additional&quot; in the DVD disc 2.
0783229526|5.0|outstanding performances by depp and del toro. fast paced, capturing the feel of vegas in the early 70's. great cameos by ellen barkin, cameron diaz, gary busey, christina ricci  and of course the incredible doctor thompson himself. the lizard and drug frenzied scenes were typical terry gilliam. depp as he tends to do in his films &quot;became&quot; thompson. fear and loathing isn't for everyone but it has an edge and either you get it or you don't...
0131103628|5.0|This book is great for anybody that knows a programming laguage already and wants to jump in with C.  Kernigan and Ritchie are the true masters of the language.  These are the guys to learn from.  All the code examples in the book are complete and well structured.  These code examples are still used in the industry and  the code in this book really transcends to any language.  For this reason this book can help someone out just getting their feet wet with programming.
0451526295|5.0|Its amusing to read all the opinions about good, little Fanny Price.  Although many people would love her to be more assertive and lively, thankfully Jane Austen decided it otherwise.  Characters just like in reality, come in all shapes and sizes.  Like it or not, there are Miss Prices running about the world today- the champions of morals and manners.<br />Fanny is the result of her raising, although shy and complying in temperament, she was taught what became her zealous moral character.  Fanny in the end represents the manners and values of the ideal women at the time.<br />In the end though, it doesn't mean that the character itself is likable.  I was quite fine with Fanny, although one aspect annoyed me greatly, and that was her delicate constitution.  She could only handle horseriding as walking exerted her.  What a load of rubbish!<br />In the end though, Mansfield Park is a great book.  The characters are engaging, and the storyline is solid.  Highly recommended- it shows through these reviews, how good this book really is, that though a despising of the heroine, they still enjoyed the book.
1556154844|3.0|I read this book and I thought it was very informative.  The only problem that I had with it was the size of the book.  I think some of the points they made could have been sumarized a lot quicker.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This CD met all my expectations. I don't own Pinks first album.When I heard &quot;Get the Party Started,&quot; it made me want this album. All the tracks have awesome beats! She wrote a lot of the songs, and so it let's the listener get to know her true style. There isn't a boring track!
0800141601|1.0|When i first heard of a movie called \\"First Knight\\" (\\"Lancelot\\" in my language) i knew that it would be a bad movie. But i love arthutr legend, so i had to watch it...<BR>I think is one of the worst movies of all time (competing very close with clase B movies) the script is as simplier as a porn movie. The characters arent better. The color of each character is more obvious even than Starwars or any child movie. SEan Connery (one of my favourites actors) play the role of a (...) arthur, where is the king that united england? did arthur had such a strange hairstyle? why Lencelot look like a cowboy? While he fights he aparently is eating chewing gum...<BR>I had a lot of errors more to describe, but i dont think it would be necesary. Is not a movie for a arthurin fan, is a movie for pople who likes American Pie and that Us speudo 80s rubish
0449227421|4.0|Once, I finished my first Ken Follett, I was eager to read all he wrote. His works are well researched, and his style is breath-taking.  I hope, that he writes more in the future, as he matures like good old wine!  Gerborg
B00005R2M3|5.0|First of all, I admit I was a little wary about getting this CD. Mainly, because she looked like another Jennifer Lopez/Christina Aguleria package that we all have to stomach. However, when I turned the CD over and saw the &quot;Entire Album Produced by Shakira&quot; it made me more interested to see what the Columbian rock-star had in store for us. To make things short, let's just say she fits under the category of Alicia Keys, Michelle Branch, etc. - the gals that are breaking the mold of sterotyped young female singers. Her music is her own and she has her own sound, not to mention her own lyrics. I'm glad that I bought an album that has talent! The album is a mixture of awesome and exotic songs - you'll hear South American(Andean), Arabic, Latin, rock... a little bit of everything. It will keep you dancing, no doubt! It's a great album... and finally, Shakira IS Shakira - no one else. It's great to see some REAL TALENT! :-)
B00003CXC7|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock is no doubt one of the greatest directors of all time.  To have proof, one only needs to experience Rear Window.  This film is chocked full of Hitch's own recipe for suspense and glamour.  James Stewart is hilarious and likeable.  Grace Kelley is as beautiful as she is daring.  Raymond Burr is chilling as a wife-murderer who does away with his spouse in a gruesome manner perfect for those who love Hitch's morbid love of the lurid.  I absolutely love this film--one of my favorites!
B00005RFQ5|4.0|Finally, Prince is getting back to using &quot;real&quot; instruments on this album. Each song has a much warmer feel and the lyrics do cause one to think--WHAT you think is up to you :-). I must admit that the low voice sequence used to narrate this &quot;story&quot; can be a bit distracting, but all's well that ends well. I would recommend that you give the album a try. Prince has had a long history of &quot;controversial&quot; music and this album is no exception. Don't let &quot;controversy&quot; scare you away from some really beautiful and insightful melodies.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|all i have to say is SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!  this is the best movie in the world!!! i cant wait until it comes out!!!! i am gonna buy it the second it comes out!! i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes romance,comedy,drama....... anything!!!! this movie's got it all!!!!!!!
B00005KARK|3.0|My wife and I saw Dumbo in the cinema as children, and it was one of our favorites. So, of course, we got the VHS for our daughter, who also worships Dumbo. Naturally, I grabbed the 60th anniversary DVD when it suddenly appeared at the local price club.<br />The jacket promises a preview of Dumbo II. There is no preview on the DVD we received. We are bitterly disappointed, since this was the reason we bought a redundant copy.<br />Furthermore, the \\"Celebrating Dumbo\\" featurette is just a bunch of young Disney employees making vapid comments about what a great movie Dumbo is. None of them have any connection to the original production, so they were incapable of showing any insight into the making of Dumbo. Now, I admit that we had just viewed the featurette for Snow White, which is undeniably awesome. By comparison, the Dumbo featurette is a content-free failure.<br />Dumbo on DVD supports 5.1 surround sound, but--compared to the masterful remastering of, say, Snow White--there's not much advantage over the remastering of the VHS version.<br />Too bad Disney couldn't give Dumbo the attention it gave Snow White. If you have Dumbo on VHS, don't bother with the DVD. [...]<br />My regards to all big-eared folks, no matter your species...
B000006OAM|3.0|i am a big Natalie fan. I enjoy all of her music, but i can't see many people liking Ophelia. the lyrics are great but the music is very repetitive and monotonous. natalie merchant is a genious, though. i just think her music is better when it's written by her, not a character.
B0000028M7|5.0|I'm not a big fan of what Rolling Stone Magazine called grunge.  I instead prefer the hard corp and thrash metal groups that prevailed before the media blitz.  <br />This CD is definitely best of class.  Anybody who is reading this review who does not already own this album is either very young (go buy) or has poor taste.  Enough said.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Let me think of how to say this. If Tomb Raider was never a game but this movie was made then the movie would have been awesome and bad games would have followed. When there is a good game then bad movies follow. This is the basic plot that is followed by gaming movies. The only movie ever coming close to breaking this disatrous trend was Final Fantasy, which also was sort of a bomb. This movie is basically a Indy Jones rip off, but with a girl with a stuffed bra. The story is awful, at least the indy movies were somewhat believable this is unbelievably far-fetched with big statues coming alive and a clock that makes the planets align. All controlled by the illuminati a secret society. Whoo im getting goosebumps now! Phew yea right. If you want to see a action flick that has a hot chick ( hey that rymes) then check it out but if you are a smart person than you will avoid.
B000002AS3|5.0|This CD got no respect in America.  This CD is, in my opinion, easily the best CD to come out in the 90s.  The arguments against Oasis are moot.  Rock and roll has been derivative since before the time Elvis started swaggering.  Led Zeppelin was a wannabe delta blues band with a lot of amperage.  Who cares if Oasis ripped off previous acts.  The tunes on this CD are incredibly addictive.  The first two Oasis albums and Masterplan had excellent taste in what they pinched.  <br />The lyrics of &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; are simple, yet they are original, heartfelt, and more honest than anything out there.  One need not be from Manchester to appreciate where Oasis is coming from.  I listened to this CD in 95 and have been a hooked fan since.  <br />Note:  anybody who really appreciates this CD and Whats the Story should avoid buying anything after Masterplan...  its all garbage.  Spend your money instead on early imported Bsides (Masterplan doesn't have them all).  Oasis should have quit while they were still ahead.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Let me preface this by saying, Prince's music has suffered greatly in the 90s.  So I am not a BLIND Prince fan.  I honestly think that every compilation he has done since &quot;The Gold Xperience&quot; has been average to below average.  Now, that said, he hit this one on the head.  John Blackwell's influence (the drummer) on this CD is greatly felt on every song.  However, he recaptures his soulful sound on Muse 2 the Pharoh and Mellow (which is awesome).  Prince does a great job with expressing his spiritual and social beliefs through a 'HOLY WRIT' which happens to be The Rainbow Children.  The tracks that stand out to me are Family Name, which has a very political and social meaning to it.  It is FUNK driven and wait until he starts to mention 'Thomas Jefferson'...awe!; 1+1+1=3 brings back the ole funk sound w/ the bass and keyboard driven funk that he made so popular in the 80s - HEY!  The Senual Everlasting, which will have you in deep meditation.  Just listen to the entire CD.  You won't be disappointed (unless you are agnostic, then I can't help ya).  LOVE GOD!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are hilarious in this fairy tale for both kids and adults alike.  Like Disney sometimes does, Dreamworks throws in some adult barbs the kids won't understand but they'll love it anyway and so will you.<br />Shrek just wants peace and quiet, but soon finds his swamp overrun by a bunch of nasty disney characters (surprised they didn't get into a huge lawsuit considering all the Disney vs. Dreamworks flak).  In order to clear out his homeland from these uninvited guests, Shrek sets off on what soon becomes an epic adventure rescuing a damsel in distress from a terrible (but also lonely) fire-breathing dragon.  In the process he learns a lot about himself, friendship, and love.  With quotes like &quot;Snow White?  She lives with seven men, but she's not easy&quot;, the bathroom humor and mild sexual innuendos will keep the kids giggling, but there's not enough to restrict their viewing.  Besides, if you ever thought Eddie Murphy was a jackass, now you know.<br />One of the few cartoons I'd watch again.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk To Remember is about a young girl named Jamie Sullivan who has always been on the outside.  She wears old sweaters and carries a Bible everywhere she goes because she is the Reverend's daughter.  Now, Landon Carter is a complete hottie at their school and now the've been chosen to do a Christmas Play that Jamie's dad wrote.  Together they rehearse and slowly fall in love.  But Jamie has a secret, a secret that could destroy their innocent and true love.  A MUST READ!  Warner Bros.  is also making this into a movie staring Mandy Moore as Jamie, and Shane West as Landon.  It'll be released in Jan. 2002!
B00005QZ82|4.0|Meg Ryan's character is too sappy to be truly likable but Kevin Kline is fabulous (as usual) as the thieving, scruffy frenchman and somehow, the relationship between the two works. This move is full of both laughs and romance--the perfect &quot;woman's movie&quot; for a saturday night. It's become one of my favorites; one of the few movies that I've seen more than once. If you like 'When Harry Met Sally' or 'Forget Paris' you'll like this one too.
B0000025BL|1.0|I almost agree with Chapel Hill.  Except I knew this stuff was bad when I heard it 25 years ago...
B000001ESJ|3.0|A Farewell To Kings was Rush working towards being a more progressive band,however it's not as strong,focused,or consistent as Hemispheres,which ranks with the classical masterpieces. Farewell has a lot of wasted space that reflects growing pains. I understand how 'Cygnus X-1' is the beginning of 'Hemispheres',but it's their most annoying,screechy piece ever.I always found Xanadu a little boring also. Really,only the title cut,'Cinderella Man', and 'Closer To The Heart'validate this album,which in my opinion is the weakest of their early period,though a prelude to something great.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Ok, I'll admit it up front..I am obsessed with LOTR. I have been waiting with baited breath for 3 years for this movie. I check the Internet everyday for news on it. That having been said, I am also a bit of a music snob and have been disappointed with soundtracks, such as Harry Potter, in the past. Most of the soundtracks I have encountered fail to capture the true essence of the movie or story. This cannot be said of Howard Shore's soundtrack for LOTR: FOTR. This is a beautiful, ethereal, haunting and spot-on soundtrack. Track 17, &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; breaks my heart every time I hear it and Enya's &quot;May it Be&quot; is a beautiful endtitle track. You can actually picture the scenes from the book as you listen to this soundtrack. It is also accesible to those who have not read the books, as my mother, who is far from a fantasy buff, is now entranced with the soundtrack and wants to see the movie as soon as it come out. If you are at all considering getting this album, do so. You will not be disappointed!
B00005ONMJ|5.0|I have to sacrifice doby 5.1 and 16x9 screen to see this historical video.  Siepi was my first Don and finally I can see him life anytime in my living room.  The singing was first rate especially the ladies.  Lisa della Casa is breaking my heart singing &quot;mi tradi&quot;.  The DVD is in color and excellent mono sound.  Any Don enthusiast should immediately buy this DVD.
B00005B36H|4.0|One question before I start:  Explicit Lyrics where???<br />OK, now that's out of the way...<br />This is a solid set of music, from &quot;The Grudge&quot; to &quot;Triad&quot;.  Even the segue tracks are good!!  I'm still trying to figure out what &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot; is on there for; perhaps there has to be a proper mood/state of being involved to like that track.<br />My favorite tracks are The Grudge, Parabol/Parabola, and Triad.  Definitely a must-buy CD.
6304297912|5.0|This movie was beautiful, horrible, and unforgettable. A gritty, intimate look at heroin use, this film illustrated instead of proselytizing. The filmmakers and actors were able to incorporate life's inherent humor into this tale of five friends, along with some of the most nauseating and loathsome realities of modern drug use. Mark Renton, through whose eyes the story is told, is utterly human, a convincing character who, in his inability to be the hero we might initially seek, becomes believable in his multitude of shortcomings.<br />As duly noted in other reviews, this movie is understandably going to be too much for some people to swallow. However, if you have the stomach and the will, this movie delivers hard and fast, and leaves you with a strong, satisfying ending.
0385335482|4.0|~Meet Rebecca Bloomwood......an in-debt, financial journalist(how ironic), and a full-blown shopaholic.  Her bills are sky high, and her attempts to dodge the bank's letters regarding them are laugh out loud funny.....as is her reasoning behind her impulsive shopping.  Of course, everything that she purchases is a need, not a want.  A sale is a gem of a find and she would be foolish to pass it up.  Sales are great investments right? They save her money...right?  So to pass one up would be silly and foolish.  That is how she thinks.  She reasons that each and every purchase is a necessity, ranging from a shirt, to a sleek travel coffee mug.  There is a little romance involved in the novel as well.*I enjoyed this book immensly.  I could not put it down!  It was a fun, fast read and I am dying to read more by Sophie Kinsella.  Many times I laughed out loud as I read.  It is a book you will want to recommend to all of your girlfriends. :)  Any girl who loves to shop will enjoy this humorous read.*
B00004RJ74|5.0|From Dusk Till Dawn is so many things a comedy,black comedy,dark comedy,horror movie,action movie,. It bracks down the doors of most horror movies and puts in a little bit of everthing a good scrip and direction help with the feel of the movie. Just don't watch 2 and 3 those are just horribal direct to video B pictures. But the orignel is landmark in all the ways I just told you. The DVD is great to its very well put together. The film is extremely ultraviolent and is not for kids. This is one of the most violent films of all time and is for adults only.<br />                          Warning: This film contains Extremely Graphic Prolonged Ultraviolence including rape,graphic language,disturbing imiges,and extremely gross out Gore. THIS FILM IS FOR ADULTS ONLY
B00005QG9J|5.0|They just keep getting better &amp; better. They're not always lyrically heavy, but it works for them. They have a positivety that is appealing. Their sound, however, is heavy... in all the right ways. They're awesome.
0452282152|3.0|Having read many of the reviews on this site, I wanted much more than this book actually had to offer. I wanted more art history. I wanted a clearer picture of life in Delft at the time the story was set. But most of all, I wanted more story and more character development. This book just didn't grab me. I love the IDEA of a book describing the events that lead up to a painting I am familiar with, but in my opinion the story simply doesn't live up to the idea. . .
B00005IBGQ|5.0|With lush melodies and an equally haunting voice, Rufus Wainwright has held my soul captive. Thankfully my friend Shawna sent me a track from one of his forays on a movie soundtrack, and I've been a fan since.  <br />There is little that I can say to disparage this set of tracks. From \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\" to \\"The Consort\\", Rufus takes us on a dizzying journey. Two tracks stand out on this cd, \\"Shadows\\" and \\"Poses,\\" as both of them set the tone, of searching and finding what is sought,for the entire cd. My favorite line from his song \\"Shadows\\" reminds of his perspective on life: \\"Out of these shadows/comes the light.\\"  Not the most optimistic of singers, Rufus tends to remind his listeners that our imperfect lives still hold promise and value.  Not bad for a singer/songwriter.<br />Since I have six years of French under my belt, \\"Rebel Prince\\" is an enjoyable song for its stanza in French. Many Rufus fans, and critics, probably thought he couldn't have done better than his self titled debut CD, but, he has. Poses is one of the few cds that I can play over and over again, and still just as satisfied after the 20th time as the first time I heard it for the day.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I have been digging Prince since I was about 13 and everything that he has done since then (about 20 years) has been wonderful!  I have to say that The Rainbow Children shows that Prince ain't going nowhere.  He is just as thought-provoking, funky and trippy as he's always been.  This CD is another part of the evolution of his music.  Which is always changing yet remains familiar.  Also, The Rainbow Children is probably one of the most cohesive CDs Prince has made in awhile.  Every song just flows into the other telling a story.  If you are looking for a throw back to previous ablums like:  Purple Rain or 1999 this ain't it.  He is on something new but it is just as accessible as any of his more popular recordings.  Go pick The Rainbow Children and be uplifted.<br />MMG
6305127638|5.0|The first Star Trek film based in the universe of the New Generation series is outstanding, particulally the performances of Patrick Stuart, Alfre Woodward and Alice Krige as the borg queen. More than just the scary bad guys, i think the borgs are kind of a metaphore of the increasing dependence of people and society on science and technology. The borg are the most perfect and terrible example of what might happen to us the way things are. Picard is the most fascinating character of the movie, because behind the heroic and daring captain front is just a man like all of us determined to get even with the borgs for the unspekable things done to him. The movies high point is when Lilly(Alfre Woodward) tells Picard to blow up the Enterprise and he answers with a soundly no, smashing with his phaser his model ships. James Cromwell is excellent as Zefram Cochrane showing that legends not always are what the books and documentaries tell us about. An classic nonetheless, First Contact will have a place garanted in the hearts of all Star Trek fans or people that just like a good Sci-fi film
B000007XUQ|5.0|Two words: Karen Carpenter: Two discs worth! This compilation is basically two different Carpenters Christmas albums packaged in one case. In my estimation, Karen had one of the most achingly beautiful voices of my lifetime. Sometimes I just want to cry listening to her sing. Richard's arrangements support Karen perfectly on these two CDs by staying out of her way and letting her shine while filling the room with a soft bed of beautiful, evocative music. We don't actually get to hear Karen till track 3, but Richard's overture makes it worth the wait. She kicks off the set by singing, &quot;Frosted windowpanes. . .&quot; and you know the rest! She shows off her amazing range on &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot; and treats us to the seldom-heard verse of &quot;The Christmas Song.&quot; The controlled swing arrangement of &quot;Let It Snow&quot; is loads of fun, and Richard's instrumental arrangement of &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; is still one of my all-time favorites. Just when you think it can't get any better, track 13 pulls you up next to the Carpenters right in their element with &quot;Merry Christmas, Darling.&quot; This is the classic Carpenters sound, and all I've gotta say is if Karen had sung this to me. . .well, I'll save that for another day! Disc 2 just amazingly pumps up the Christmas even one more notch with an overture kicked off by an a capella &quot;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear&quot; that absolutely thrills. There's a happy little &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot; segment, and then once again Karen just melts me with &quot;What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?&quot; Wow!
0688170528|5.0|I never read.  Ever. Because im sick of empty, boring books and that is all i ever seem to find.  This book drew me in, and kept me in , and I could NOT put it down until i figured out the entire story.  After I read it, I realized how fleeting moments are , and I wept thinking about all that I take for granted.  This is the only book I would ever buy for someone and strongly recommend that they read it right away.  My life is changed for it. If you ever wanted to , and couldn't, lose yourself entirely in a book from the moment you read the first line, to the time you are finished, then this is the book.  I DO vow to read every single book written by this author, I can't wait to get my hands on another of her novels! Read it!

B00005O5CM|5.0|Those are some key things you'll find in Legally Blonde. Legally Blonde is about Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon). Elle is hoping that Warner (Matthew Davis) will propose the big question at dinner. He doesn't go to propose, but to dump Elle. The reason being Elle isn't \\"serious\\" enough. That is when she makes the dramatic decision to attend Harvard Law School to win him back. Legally Blonde is a fun movie with many laughs. It reminds you of Clueless. I think this movie has good acting. This film boosted Reese's career also. She went from one million to five million after Legally Blonde because of her outstanding performance which helped rack in lots of money at the box office. ... I saw it in theaters and still purchased the dvd. I urge you to see it.
B00005LOUP|1.0|A childrens masterpiece destroyed forever. Hollywood turns a classic Christmas tale into a box office throw away.Yes it did millions , it was hyped and cast to MAKE MONEY! Film Makers do this for profit and that is all fine. But Why Destroy a Dr.Seuss tale so dear to so many. They bought the rights and made Ace ventura 3. They make the Whos into a a dry,  twisted, social Complex society. Cindy Lou Who, the everychild, is now the &quot;savior of the grinch&quot; or an Expensive child prop . Motive for the Grinch to hate Christmas ? They have him ridiculed in grade school then disappear for decades in hiding . they have endless plot twists, Jim Carey jokes for Jim Carey and somewhere they HAVE to fit in that silly little story they bought the rights to. So when they do, These two visions mix like oil and water and it is an ugly film. some veiwers will be made to feel about Christmas the way Hollywood feels about Christmas.......   Shallow and cynical.
B00005QDW5|2.0|Well now....if you are true Floyd fan, you will look at the list of songs and know right away if this is a CD set for you. <br />What do I mean? Quite simply, there is nothing new, nothing previously unreleased, and nothing to suggest that anyone who already has these tracks on other releases would seek to have this one!<br />Let's also take a look at how many of these tracks are actually Pink Floyd, shall we? If you think about Syd Barret's possible statement about this album, he might say, &quot;Hey guys...did you forget someone?&quot;<br />ALso, far too many of this tracks are from The Wall and post Wall releases, which, according to this Floyd fan, is some of their worst stuff!<br />Now, since every fan already has Dark Side, let's remove those tracks too....why have them twice? Animals was an ok release but again, why bother to put &quot;Sheep&quot; on this one? Surely there were better tracks!<br />Meddle, which, according to this fan, is Floyd's best album and from it, they gave us &quot;Echoes&quot; and &quot;One of These Days.&quot; These are great tracks but why not add some of the more obscured (not by Clouds) tracks such as &quot;San tropez or &quot;Childhood's End&quot; which are the two best tracks on the album! <br />Moving on...there is NOTHING from &quot;More&quot; which is also, some of the Floyd's best work...Songs like &quot;Cirrus Minor&quot; and &quot;Green Is The Color&quot; are completely ignored with this latest release.<br />Pink Floyd never thought too much about commercialism, till now, eh fans? To quote a phrase:<BR>&quot;Money, it's a crime. Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie. Money, so they say Is the root of all evil today.&quot;<BR>So much for this one...<br />So, what are we left with? A few tracks from &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and again, the best ones are ignored. &quot;Welcome To The Machine&quot; and &quot;Have A Cigar&quot; both key signature songs are erroneously mistreated by their absence here!<br />This is what's left:<BR> From Disc 1:   <BR>1. Astronomy Domine  <BR>2. See Emily Play  <BR>9. Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun  <BR> <BR>And from Disc 2:   <BR>9. Arnold Layne  <BR>11. Jugband Blues  <br />Don't waste your money on this boxed set, folks! Just spend a bit more and by the entire Pink Floyd collection if you really want to KNOW their music!
0871137380|5.0|The author does a great job at showing both sides of the story.  Although this is about our boys in green the author mixes in images from the simple town folk who lived through this ordeal.  He also goes into the mistakes that were made by the Americans that lead to the disaster.  It is a great story and I am hoping is going to be a great movie.  If you like play-by-play stories of battles this is a great book.
0743216458|5.0|This book made the hairs on the back of my neck tingle. Nothing that I have had to endure comes close to what the boys of the 101st went through. There were parts in the book where I felt as if I was sitting in the foxhole right next to one of the paratroopers. It focused on just one company to write about and I thought that that was great. It really gave me a picture of how WWII was seen in Europe by GI's.  This book is well researched with primary sources and well written using thoughtful quotations from those sources. This is excellent reading for young officers, cadets and those interested in military history for any reason. <br />Great book, I would recommend it to any one who really wants to know what combat is all about<br />Big Truck
0743216385|5.0|If you like military battle play-by-plays then this is the book for you.  The first thing that I though about when I read this was that it would make a great mini-series.  We follow a 'band of brothers' through 3 or 4 of the most heroic battles of WWII.  You really get a sense that these guys were fighting in order to help keep their fellow troopers alive not just for themselves.  They were fighting not for glory but in order to get a job done.
B00003CX9E|5.0|It's absolutely incredible how ANYONE managed to make such a movie as this, least of all a 25-year-old. It looks like millions were spent on it, but in his absorbing and enthusiastic commentary Roger Ebert reveals how low-budget it actually was.<br />The film of the century has absolutely EVERYTHING going for it. The performances are all fantastic, led by the showstopping Welles; the haunting Xanadu has a craggy desolation reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands' castle; each time Ebert points out a new trick of cinematography, it will bring a smile to your face.<br />The DVD transfer is the most incredible I've ever seen. In my experience of DVDs I've only ever seen one that had as great a picture as this. I think it was Terminator 2. And this is sixty years old. If I switch to 9x digital zoom when I'm watching, there's still not a HINT of grain, fuzziness, or scratching. It's like they went through it frame by frame with Photoshop. It now looks like it was made yesterday, albeit in black and white.<br />The most astonishing restoration of an old film EVER.<br />The soundtrack was also given a worthy polish, and it's there in all its original mono glory. Do I need to tell you that the extras are great? The trailer alone is one of the most fun in cinema history.<br />There's the occasional person who would call this a boring film. THEY - ARE - WRONG. And they don't know WHAT they're missing. This is a film that you must give two hours of your FULL attention, NOT switching it off half way through. I made that mistake myself once, and for a short while I mistakenly dismissed it as boring. When you've given it your time, you will be rewarded in a great many ways. And you'll have seen filmmaking at its most masterful.
B00005B36H|5.0|Every Tool album is like a stage of emotional development. They started with Opiate, which is pure thrash anger. Next came Undertow, very dark and depressive. Then, Ænima, which had its angry moments, but also its sad moments, and hopeful moments. Now, with the release of Lateralus, Tool has its focus set less on anger (&quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; excluded) and more on reconciliation, and other such emotions. I say &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; excluded because that song is pure anger, but contains some of the most melodic chords on the album, overshadowed by singer Maynard's primal screaming. &quot;The Grudge&quot; is a fitting opener for the album, containing a very impressive 25-second shout from Maynard's lungs. &quot;Schism,&quot; which received no small amount of radio play, holds strong in the pacing of the album. The combo of &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; make for an almost romantic middle of the album. The trio of &quot;Disposition,&quot; &quot;Reflection,&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Triad,&quot; originally conceived as one song, is a lovely closer for the album. After &quot;Triad,&quot; though, one track remains. That track is a collection of bizzare sound effects, over which an excerpt from an Art Bell show explains to the listeners the horrible secrets of Area 51.<br />Overall, Tool has reached a new high with this album. Strongly recommended.
B000002U9W|4.0|I have written two other PF album reviews.  You can tell I like this band.  I own most of their discs and ill tell you why im rating this album.  Simply because it is great.  <br />Although if you know a little bit about P Floyds story youll know that when in the making of this album, well people didn't expect anything that would excite the masses too much.  The song If is a good R Waters contribution.  No other song sounds like this one, not &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; or anything from Animals.  Its simply a very original song and very beautiful too.  Next is Summer 68, a concise yet rocking number.  Song #4 is David Gilmour's Fat Old Sun.  Super nice song.  The melody of this tune is guaranteed to stay in your head for real long.  And the final but not least tune is Alans Psycdelic b fast.  Admitedly by PF to be the most thrown together song theyve done, but its one of my favorites.  Theres humor in this song.  And lastly the title song, Atom Heart Mother.  A true masterpiece.  The first 20 plus minute song by these guys.  Completely entertaining throughout.<br />So the big question is why do I like this album so much?  Because it gives your record collection a little more class.  Its a must have.
B00000099Y|5.0|After just looking at the animated cover of Ænima, you get the feeling that you're in for something quite special.  From the opening squeaks of &quot;Stinkfist&quot; to the screaming, pounding conclusion of &quot;Third Eye,&quot; you realize that you were correct.  Tool hit something very unique with this album.  Even the title is unique, a combination of the words 'anima' and 'enema'.<br />Keep an open mind, and try to read between the lines, and you'll find this album integrates itself deeply into your brain.
B000002952|5.0|The first of Gloria's Spanish language albums is still her best.   While the other two Spanish albums are excellent, Mi Tierra is absolutely exceptional. The souce material is wonderful, and most importantly, the entire musical ensemble is absolutely first rate. This is less a showcase for the soloist (Gloria) than a complete muscial pacakge. No mere \\"attractive backdrop\\" for the singing, the musicians  are an absolutely top of the line ensemble of the best Latin music.     Mi Tierra is intoxiating, and a landmark album.  I give it the highest possible rating.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Ok so this isnt the best star wars movie, but still its very underrated by critical [...]. The Movie is great but the DVD is spectacular the sound is unbeleavible ( especially with surround sound !). The shots are stunning and the special feature are actually watchable. Plus its loaded with DVD easter eggs [...]. The eggs feature funny outakes and a secret documentary. Some of the deleted scenes are inserted into the movie which is great! Some though you have to access via the special features. Another Great feature is the 2 hour \\"The Beginning\\" a great Star Wars 1 documentary. Plus its got exclusic DVD-ROM Episode 2 Trailer only available to owners of the DVD (must have DVD-ROM). So all in all this is a winner and this is why we have DVD.
0425180638|2.0|I can't finish it.  About halfway through it and can't go on.

Before I buy the next book in the series I'll be checking it's reviews.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I'm a teenage girl, so I guess by definiton I really should be buying Britney Spears dolls and giggling whenever she comes on TV. I borrowed this album off of one of my friends just out of curiosity, and I seriouly regret it. When her first CD came out, I bought it and loved every song on it. But let's face it, since then, she's gone down fast. Take \\"I'm a Slave for U\\", which is by far the best song on this album. The lyrics to the song's bridge are:<BR>Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOA)<br />Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOOOA) (Do you like it)<BR>Get it get it, get it get it (OOOHHHH) (This feels good)<br />(...)Quality music? You decide.
B000002UDB|5.0|The Beatles released many fine albums during the 60s, but &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was their finest. There is not a single weak track on this record. The Beatles never released an album with as many #1 hits as &quot;Magical Mystery,&quot; including &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; &quot;All You Need Is Love,&quot; and &quot;Hello, Goodbye.&quot; The other songs aren't bad either. &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is the best song John ever wrote, while the title track and &quot;Fool On the Hill&quot; are enough to make an album gold or platinum for another rock group. While the film was a colossal flop, the soundtrack shows psychedlic rock at its best.
B00001QEE8|5.0|With a 3 year old kid running around the house, this DVD is the most popular, and we watch it together with him minimum 5 times a day, at least the elephant march which is his favorite part.<br />Excellent picture and sound quality, I don't have to recommend you the story itself, because it has proven to be one of the best. I could go on and on about it, but I trust you to know a little bit about Kipling, just as I trust Disney to produce high quality anim. cartoons as they usually do.<br />The great thing about it is that we watch it in several languages - Spanish and English (Although French is available as well - unfortunately we don't know it.. yet). So what can I say.. This is a classic that should appear in every DVD collection especially if you have kids.
B000002MP2|5.0|It was back in 1995 when I was about 10 years old that I bought Greenday's tape Dookie.  Why I bought it I don't remember.  Why my mom let me buy it after she heard it swore, I don't remember.  All I do remember is that Dookie was the first recording I ever owned that I could pop into my stereo or headphones and allow to play on without ever skipping a song I disliked.  I listened to it day and night and never got tired of it.  Folks, I'm a rap fan, and Greenday and rap don't necessarily go hand-in-hand.<BR>     Dookie consists of fun, charming, witty songs, and no matter how serious the subject of the song, Greenday somehow makes it sound as if it's all in good fun.  &quot;Basketcase&quot; and &quot;When I Come Around&quot; are the two songs off this album which almost everybody's heard, so if you have heard one or the other you've heard the general sound that runs through most of the album.  Billie's stuffed-up-nose type of singing, the guitars, the drums, the catchy tunes and choruses...that type of stuff.  There are other good songs too such as &quot;Longview&quot;, &quot;Welcome To Paradise&quot;, &quot;She&quot;...well, they're all good.<BR>     My advice to you is if you think you'll like it, buy it.  And if you're not sure, maybe a little bit hesitant, you think it might turn out to be a waste of your money, buy it anyway.  To make my point, Dookie is an album that can be enjoyed by just about everyone.  It's fun, funky, and full of energy.  Unfortunatly, I lost that Dookie tape I mentioned earlier about 2 years after I bought it, and man do I miss it.

B00005RFAI|5.0|I am so sick and tired of reading pathetic, crybaby reviews!  &quot;Wah, it's not the same as the first album.&quot;  Pink is an innovator.  Flaunt her for being versatile, and for having the amazing and rare gift of range in her vocal abilities.  If you want to listen to an artists' album that never evolves, and will never be remembered for incredible musical talent, start listening to the manufactured and super untalented music of Britney Spears!  Music is evolutionary, and music is universal.  Yes, Pink is an R&amp;B Diva, but she has an amazing spectrum in her vocal abilities. It is the artists' right to explore their vocal and musical abilities.  Don't be narrow-minded to the new direction she has taken, appreciate it!!  Not many artists' now a days are willing, or brave enough to break the redundant cycle of thoughtless, ridiculous music the industry is producing lately.  I love all the tracks on this new album.  Pink has a great sense of humor (track #1), and powerful opinions about society that need to be heard and considered. Songs like &quot;Respect&quot; and &quot;Eventually&quot; address issue's about the mistreatment of women in society, and convey messages of sisterhood, and integrity.  If  you listen carefully each song is telling you a story.  The soulful richness and emotion of her voice is genuine, and exemplifies the depth of understanding a true artist has for music. This album is a very revealing look into the heart and soul of Alieca Moore (Pink).  This album is for people whom have a deeper understanding of what music is really all about (other than the simple-minded ideals of artist's like Britney spears). <br />Pink, you rock girl! Continue to be a music innovator.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|I showed this video to a busload of sixth grade children on the way to our destination (field trip). Everyone loved it, including all the chaperones and me! It was great seeing fastasy characters out of the &quot;norm&quot;. It reminded me a little of Felix the Cat, except that it wasn't rated X. I enjoyed it tremendously. In fact, I went out and bought it for myself.
0784011796|5.0|Pi is unquestionably one of the most audacious feature-length films in recent memory, largely because the questions that it raises are not only theoretical but also, in the truest sense, larger than life. Director Darren Aronofsky's debut is a wild ride to both the frontier of intellectual inquiry as well as the physical consequences such inquiries can have on those who ask the &quot;big questions&quot;, namely in this case Max Cohen, the brilliant mathematician played to perfection by Sean Gullette. This is a film that would appeal to every Einstein and Stephen Hawking in the world as well as those who have a layman's interest in theoretical mathematics. It has long been suspected that there is a direct relationship between the number pi (3.1415...) and the striking similarities we humans see in both the organic and inorganic in nature, in this case, the tormented Cohen sees a relationship between the golden spiral (based on studies by the ancient Greeks) and pi. However, the real question is: is his intense personality governed by the fact that such a relationship exists and his anxiousnees to prove it to the world or is he simply hellbent to find such a relationship, and in essence becoming the most brilliant mathematician of his time (maybe of all time)? Because the &quot;mystery&quot; of pi is not uncovered, the film leaves far more questions unanswered than answered, thus lending the film its profoundly stark, disturbing atmosphere of both intrique as well as terror.<br />At first, Max is only interested in finding a relationship between pi and the inner mechanics of the stock market, NOT in an effort to beat it to become fabulously wealthy but to further prove that the pattern(s) dictated by pi not only exist in nature, but that they also have a hand in everyday human activities. True, it may be a bit too much to swallow, but Aronofsky's script, direction and Gullette's lucid performance makes these ideas ever more tantalizing, even if they are &quot;far out&quot; (or are they?).<br />Though largely reclusive, Max does have one close friend: a mentor/former professor Sol (Mark Margolis) who he visits regularly to play the Japanesse board game &quot;Go&quot; (if the spelling is wrong, I stand corrected) which incidentally serves as Sol's basis for the idea that the universe is largely chaotic, rather than ordered and patterned, countering Max's efforts to connect pi with a dominating pattern (the golden spiral) that exists throughout the cosmos. Sol bases this on his own research into pi, which he says spans four decades and ended in no significant discoveries to back up Max's ideas. Sol seems to come from the side of Shakespeare's &quot;Macbeth&quot;: that the search for patterns in pi is essentially &quot;a 'tale' told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.&quot; Though this film doesn't refer to anything else in Western literature other than the writings of Archimedes and da Vinci, there are clearly parallels between what Max's search entails and other literary works which concentrate on the many complexities of the human condition.<br />While on his &quot;crusade&quot;, Max encounters a Jewish mystic (Lenny) in the coffee shop he frequents who also has a deep-seated interest in number theory. Rather than finding a relationship between patterns and the stock market like Max, Lenny is interested in finding a similar pattern in the Torah which would reveal &quot;the true name of God&quot;. Along with this, Max is pursued by Wall Street tycoons interested in his research, one of which claims to have studied his papers on the subject (Marcy Dawson). Along with the pressures that Max places on himself to find a unifying theory for both the stock market as well as the universe at large, he is pressured to a greater extent by these two different forces with equally different objectives. This drives Max &quot;over the edge&quot;, as Sol warned him, a breakdown so severe that he personally injures himself tothe extent that it eliminates any and all possibility of future research on the one love of his life.<br />Coupled with an appropiately dark, atmospheric IDM soundtrack with contributions by Autechre, Orbital, Spacetime Continuum and the brilliant theme by Clint Mansell, Pi does fall rather nicely into the category of science-fiction/fantasy, but it is also a tragedy as well, showing the limits of human ambition, in this case on the part of Max. I felt it was one of the best films of the late 1990s, and one which should be required viewing for anyone even remotely interested in how number theory can (and may not) tie in with human concerns of everyday life, the universe, and in the minds of religious mystics, the great beyond.the extent that it eliminates any and all possibility of future research on the one love of his life. <br />Coupled with an appropiately dark, atmospheric IDM soundtrack with contributions by Autechre, Orbital, Spacetime Continuum and the brilliant theme by Clint Mansell, Pi does fall rather nicely into the category of science-fiction/fantasy, but it is also a tragedy as well, showing the limits of human ambition, in this case on the part of Max.

B00004Y6Q5|5.0|A bit like the movie - not for everyone, unfortunately. This doesn't hold the popular appeal of a &quot;Titanic&quot; soundtrack, but would you want it to? More contemporary fare (I could easily see either David Parson's Dance Company or Graeme Murphy's Sydney Dance Company dancing to selections from this). If you like your soundtracks more contemporary, a little bit more experimental and more atmospheric this could be for you, and I'd highly recommend it. The tracks are appropriately divided into three sections. Starting with &quot;Summer&quot;, passing through &quot;Fall&quot; and finally sinking into &quot;Winter&quot;, there is no Spring here. &quot;Summer Overture&quot; and &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; are two of the best examples of the simple tune that permeates the rest of the album (e.g., &quot;Cleaning Apartment&quot;, &quot;Marion Barfs&quot;, &amp; &quot;Winter Overture&quot;) and immediately make you think - Requiem for a Dream. It is a beautiful and thoughtful piece of work. Appropriately mournful and haunting. However the happier and more lively &quot;Party&quot; and &quot;High on Life&quot; (short and sweet at only 11 seconds long) go some way to making up for this. I can't help but think that the slightly wacky &quot;Bialy &amp; Lox Conga&quot; and &quot;Bugs Got a Devilish Grin Conga&quot; could have easily been used in scenes from Baz Luhrmanns Strictly Ballroom (e.g., reminiscing about the parents dance competitions). Clint Mansell knows his stuff: he manages to compliment and amplify the feel of the movie beautifully. Indeed, he creates the landscape of the film with his music. <BR>     Darren Aronofsky is a gifted and promising director (his 2 major movies to date put him in my Top 10 Directors list). He has managed to find in Clint Mansell a composer whose work compliments his own style so perfectly and that is important. As another famous director/producer allegedly said, the music is 50% of the movie. That can be clearly seen and heard in Requiemfor a Dream. 4 1/2 stars from me!
B00003CXXJ|2.0|This movie was lacking any surprises.  It was a typical tale that really was not very funny.  It does not compare to the Disney quad- Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Mermaid.  However, the animation was spectacular.  Kudos on that front.  But you have to be awake to see it.
B00001OH7P|5.0|When this album was released in 1972, it was nearly the cause for this Dog to dye his hair fluorescent orange and effect blue eye shadow. Fortunately a stout collar and lead were put in place before this manifestation took place. But none the less this album had a profound effect on the history of Rock `n' Roll. In soccer parlance, this album took Bowie from a relegation candidate in Division Three to Premier League Champions in the blink of a massacred eye.<br /> When Bowie created Ziggy Stardust, he created a monster that would take him on one of the most exciting roller-coaster rides in the history of the entertainment industry.<br /> The songs that Bowie wrote for this album were his strongest so far. Also, by taking the heavy rock from the previous year's, \\"Man Who Sold The World\\" and the power pop of \\"Hunky Dory\\", which was only six months old, he created the perfect concept album. With the band standing satin-trousered beside Bowie, Mick Ronson tore every ounce of emotion from his guitars. This pushed Bowie's songs into another dimension. Listen to the gut wrenching savagery of \\"Moonage Day Dream\\", the glittering riffs in the title track, and the sheer unadulterated, irresistible boogie of \\"Suffragette City\\". This makes you realize that Bowie could never have done this without the platinum haired spider from Hull.<br /> The lyrics are thrust in your face and rammed down your throat. Then there are Bowie's excursions into the future, such as the image heavy \\"Star Man\\" (he'd like to come and meet us but he thinks he'd blow our minds). This is followed by the album's final number, \\"Rock `n' Roll Suicide\\", which also closed the live set, with the vocalist entreating the audience to `hold' him before he's taken away.<br /> Nevertheless, Bowie would soon tire of the Ziggy Persona (splitting up the Spiders at the peak of their powers). This dramatic music with its swaggering saxophones, rough edged guitars, tinkling piano, bombastic drumming and it's crisp production cut a swath through the music industry. It created its own category of glam rock and also changed fashion forever.<br /> The concerts were amazing but you had to have the music and this album was full of cutting-edge songs that hold up decades later.<br /> Climb into your platform boots, shake out your spandex and, as the Leper Messiah preached, \\"let your imagination soar\\".<br />Mott the Dog.swath through the music industry.

Lester Burnhamn, and his equally burned-out, nervous-wreck, wheeling-dealing, real estate saleswoman Bening, is looking for what he lost in high school, while she is figuring out why she is a lousy salewoman. And Spacey finds it in the drug dealer kid next door (whose Marine father happens to be a closet homosexual of all things) and the GIRL - Mena Suvari.<br />Mena Suvari, despite her constant prouncements she's a sex queen, gets the hots for Spacey after he got the hots for her at the basketball game (?)--I was too busy watching Spacey ogle the Girl to notice where they were at. In the end, she was a ... well, watch. <br />Spacey quits his job, blackmails his boss, and goes completely beserk until finding himself. Bening, not sure why they are married, meets the Real Estate King (Peter Gallagher) and finds her own sexual adventure into forbidden territory. Their repressed daughter then falls in love with the drug dealer of all ironies. Dysfunctional family. You think?<br />If you're a guy and want to relive wanting the high school cheerleader of your dreams, and if you're a woman wanting to understand why a guy (or your husband) wants to relive wanting the high school cheerleader of his dreams, this is for you. At any rate, pure art bleeds from this film by Dreamworks. It is one of the top ten of all time.<br />All in all, Spacey gives yet another knock-out performance (his best in my opinion) and the ensemble cast is deliriously funny and seriously deft and decidely--human. A don't miss! [...]<br />P.S - Criticisms of the sexual nature of the film are really ridiculous since it is a taboo and does happen in the minds of all men. Men are not pedophiles just for wanting THE GIRL; they are just reliving a high school experience. [...] It is also why over 50% of Britney Spears' dolls were bought by men over 30. In real life, Britney is THE GIRL!
B000002GYI|5.0|...i dont know very much about electronica, most of it dont even appeal to me, but back in the days when i was coming up, kraftwerk (or at least this album) was considered as much a part of the hip hop soundscape as anything else.  hip hop wasnt just about rappin, back then it was an outlook on life, not just how you expressed what you saw (or wished you saw) in life.  i couldnt pop-lock now to save my life, but back then, we danced offa this...it was a classic. and still is.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink is a truly talented artist unlike so many of the pop/hip hop artists out there today. She writes her own songs which is awesome.  Pink's 2nd CD is throughly enjoyable. There is not one bad song on it. There are no filler tracks at all.  I especially like the track Misery with Stephen Tyler. It has a very bluesy sound to it. Dont think this CD is just a bunch of meaningless, R&amp;B nonsense. It's not. If you buy it, it will become one of your favorite CD's.
B0000025VU|5.0|I barely remember when this Album came out, but I do remember the Cover of the Album, and I remember after seeing that Album cover, and couples years later I first heard Dylan's &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, and I instantly saw that Album Cover, and when I set out to buy the tape, I thought &quot;This will sould like Highway 61&quot;, but I was surprised, it sounded even better, and this Album is the only Album that I can say, when I see the picture of the man, I can hear his Music. Folks, this guy says who he is, and means it. <br />I know there would be a lot of the other reviewers who would beg to differ on the contrast between this album, and Highway 61. The thing about Infidels is that Dylan wrote solid, expressive, no drugs involved, cut and dry lyrics that made me think, and the production was the best it could have been in 1983(Highway 61, Dylan was under the influence if you know what I mean, but in Infidels he was over the influence). Though I personally do not agree with every thing Dylan says in his lyrics, I can say he is very persuasive(spell), and wise in what his songs says to me.<br />And the social content of this Album brought out issues that were not much on the forefront in the early 80s. Look at &quot;Nieborhood Bully&quot;, it is obvious about how the World System accuses Israel of being a bully even though they are merely defending themselves. &quot;Sweetheart like You&quot; is about a Christian woman on the verge of becoming a hypocrite, as the man singing in the bar gives her that convicting question &quot;whats a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?&quot;. &quot;Jokerman&quot; is a gem of a gem. It's colorful lyrics are so vauge, but at the same time clear.&quot;Man of Peace&quot; is a wake up call about the likeness of the anti-christ, &quot;you know sometimes Satan, come as a Man of Peace&quot;, and not to be decieved by Satan's peaceful front. &quot;Union Sundown&quot;, is one of the ones I disagree with, though I like itas a song, and the lyrics are nicely done, but we can't blame everything on bussiness owners. If anything maybe greed within the others.&quot;I and I&quot;, is a awesome song about a man's struggle with his moral conscience, and obligations as a moral agent of free will. I like the whole Album!!!!<br />This Album had a huge impact on me as a songwriter. My first Dylan Album was Greatest Hits vol.2, and that introduced me to Dylan, but when I got this Album it took me beyond the idea that I just thought Dylan was a good folksinger, this Album showed me that you can have a commercial sound, and still be solid, and I can use delay on my vocals, it's cool, because Dylan did it. If you haven't heard a whole Dylan Album, but want to, I recommend this one. It is deep, and it is simple. <br />I also enjoyed the cast of performers such as, Mick Taylor(of the Rolling Stones), and of course Dire Straight's Mark Knofler. And Sly and Robbie. The Sound is excellent, and to me it still sounds timeless. You can tell it was recorded around 1983, but it's not to nostalgic.<br />You can judge the book by the cover on this Album. If you look at that Album cover(that picture of Dylan with his ray-bans)......that's exactly what it sounds like. It's the real deal!!!!
0385505833|5.0|After a few non-Grisham like efforts, the magic is back. This book really shows the crass commercialism that is so prevalent in America today. I REALLY identified with Mr. Krank, the main character. This is probably my favorite book I have read this entire year.This book is also easily read in less than 4 hours. This book would make an OUTSTANDING movie also. Try it. You'll like it.
6303407188|5.0|Well folks, I thought long and hard on what film to mark my 200th review. I thought of this one. One of my all time favorite movies. Hopefully, it will be yours as well. Director Tim Burton really outdoes himself with this brilliant film about the worst filmmaker ever. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood, a man so in love with Hollywood and filmmaking, that he doesn't see that he has no talent for it. But, in his own mind, he thought he was really making great cinematic art. He was a cross dresser who was not gay. He had a history of wearing pink angora sweaters. He would even sometimes wear them to work!. Ed Wood's films have become famous because of their horribly incompetent filmmaking. Bad actors, cheap sets and effects, and so on. But Good old Ed, god bless his heart, thought he was making 'Gone With The Wind' every time. Martin Landau is on hand delivering a jaw droppingly brilliant performance of old horror star Bela Lugosi. His performance is incredible. One of the best performances I've ever seen. He deserved ten Oscars instead of one. Bill Murray gives one of his best performances ever as Bunny Breckinridge, an actor of Ed's looking to having a sex change. Patricia Arquette and Sarah Jessica Parker play the women in Ed's life. Landau's own daughter, Juliet Landau, has a part. Burton's girlfriend Lisa Marie plays Vampira. The film was shot in glorious black and white, and it was a brilliant move on Burton's part. It really adds to the feel of the time and the movies Ed made. Depp is great. He is definitley one of the best actors of our generation. His interpretation of Wood is upbeat and hilarious. Even in the bad times, he still shows Ed having a sunny outlook. This is one great film that did not get great box office returns. What a travesty. Some people just don't understand things. I'm telling you right now : this is a great movie to be treasured. A genuine film classic.
0385505833|5.0|If Frank Capra wrote a book about Christmas, I doubt he could have done a better job than John Grisham has in his \\"Skipping Christmas.\\" It is a story about many things: about family, commercialism, the pressures and joys of community, and the true meaning of Christmas.<br />The story centers on an idea the main character, Luther Krank, has. With his daughter finally out of the nest and with the realization that he spent nine percent of his adjusted gross on Christmas the year before, Luther decides to \\"skip\\" Christmas.<br />For Luther (and his wife Nora) \\"skipping Christmas\\" means: not presents, no tree, no buying gifts, no decorating, no office parties, and on the day after Christmas--a big fat cruise in the Caribbean.<br />Only, Luther and Nora do not find extricating themselves from Christmas as easy as it would seem to be on the surface. The rest of the book tells of their adventures in trying to skip Christmas. And as with all great Christmas stories, the ending is wonderful.<br />I give skipping Christmas my highest recommendation.
630018403X|4.0|This John Hughes film was pretty much right on. The characters here might of been cliched, but guess what?, that's life. These kinds of characters are also real people. Real people who are in every high school across America. If you don't think so, you need to look harder. They may not always act or look the same as others, but they are there. A bunch of high schoolers have to serve detention together on a Saturday. Molly Ringwald is the Princess, Anthony Michael Hall is the geek, Emilio Estevez is the jock, Judd Nelson is the loner, and Ally Sheedy is the basket case. These different backgrounds and personalities come together and clash. They are pretty much forced to spend this time together and thoughts and feelings come out. Somebody dismisses it because it's a whinefest?. Get over it. This is life. It's one big whinefest!. The young actors(well, at the time)are all teriffic. They really bring these distinct individuals to life and make them believeable. I mean, really believeable. Paul Gleason is on hand as the principal who keeps an eye on the group. The ending might be a little too predictable and happy, but so what?. Judd Nelson gives the strongest performance here. He is really good. Hughes really writes teen life well. He does it a million times better than any writer writing the so called &quot;teen films&quot; of today. We need Mr. Hughes to come back and write teen movies like this for the new world we are living in. That's something to hope for. This is a very well made, very intelligent movie. Anybody who says these people are not real or are in schools, needs to open their eyes a bit more. A great movie.
B00001IVOR|5.0|this cd deserves alot more praise than it gets.  after the debut that the wu hit us with, it was going to be impossible for the clan to live up to the hype this double cd got.  it is an excellent effort but in my opinion if they had just came with a single disc and just put the 15 hott cuts it would have worked out much better for them.  even though this is a double disc, it deserves 5 stars due to lyrical wisdom and superb beats on cuts like bells of war, reunited, visionz, triumph, for heavens sake, deadly melody, heaterz, maria, cash still rules, its yourz and the M.G.M.  if you dont have this cd pick it up, cause like the rza said &quot;you dont even gotta go to school, just pick up that wu-tang double cd and youll get all the education you need this year&quot;  -believe it
6300214753|5.0|I must be on a John Hughes kick here lately. This is, without a doubt, not only the quintessential John Hughes movie, but the quintessential high school/teen movie ever made. It was great back in 1986, and it's great today in 2001 because it's still real. Any kid at any given time in place can relate to this, and they will continue to do so far into the future. Matthew Broderick stars as Ferris Bueller. A sneaky, coniving high schooler(Broderick was 24 when he did this)who brilliantly pulls off being sick to miss a day of school. He also makes up excuses for his best friend Cameron(Alan Ruck), and his girlfriend Simone(Mia Sara). They get together and go off for a day of fun in Chicago in Cameron's father's fancy red car. Jennifer Grey(she of &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; fame)plays Ferris' evil sister who is hell bent on finding out he's playing hooky and destroying his life. A typical sister. The best is Jeffrey Jones as Principal Rooney. He is a man on a mission. He investigates Ferris and also tries to prove that he's lying. I, to this day, have never seen a principal so dedicated to his job. The great Edie McClurg plays his hilarious, ditzy secretary. The movie has very funny jokes and slapstick. The parade downtown with Ferris on the float singing &quot;Twist And Shout&quot; is a showstopper, and a memorable cinema scene. Broderick is good. He brings Ferris' cocky charm to life and makes it real. Grey is perfect as the sister from hell. This is the high school/teen movie to beat all other high school/teen movies. Be on the lookout for a young Charlie Sheen popping up too. Why doesn't everybody follow Ferris's lead and play hooky and go watch this movie!!!. Stay after the credits. A classic!.
B000002WU9|5.0|this cd is absolutely amazing.  combining rza's best produced album with one of the best lyrical performances ever by rae and ghost and this cd is the pinnacle of hip hop.  best cuts are wu-gambinos, gillotine (swordz), rainy days, knowledge god, incarcerated scarfaces, ice cream and of course verbal intercourse with the classic verse from nas. this is wu-tang at its finest, the beats are extrodinary and the lyrics cant be matched. peep this album and if you dont think it is classic you dont truly understand hip hop
B00003CXXJ|1.0|Unless we are aiming for even higher divorce rates, lower marriage rates, higher cohabitation, and even a more moral downfall in our children, this movie is terrible for children.  The girl actually goes through with the marriage but then runs off with the Shrek.  I'm sorry, in the attempt to not repeat one of the same scenes over and over like that in &quot;The princess bride&quot; they decide they actually have her marry and then run off?<br />But for a culture that has decided that marriage is nothing more than a peice of paper, making romantic love much more superior (not understanding that real love is something a person has to learn and develope as they mature.  The question when you marry someone one should not be &quot;will I still love this person?&quot; rather it should be &quot;Is this person someone I'd want to love for that long?&quot;) to marriage.  Its completely pathetic.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I think that Harry Potter is wicked. I love the music and the way J.K Rowling has writen which is somewhat magical. There is just something about I cant explain.
B00005OWEG|3.0|After waiting a year or so for this extended-version of \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" I must say that I was a bit disappointed.  The image and audio transfer are quite good but the additional footage (while enjoyable to watch) did not add anything to the overall film. If anything, it&#8217;s a distraction as the scenes interrupted the flow of the story line. Martin Sheen's character is shown to have more depth but his detached nature (in the original) is diluted with spurts of camaraderie in this newer version. <br />I guess my biggest complaint is \\"Why-why-why no additional features??\\"  Sure, director's commentaries take time to put together but at least throw the public a bone or two. The \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" documentary wouldn't need any cleaning up and would have been an ideal extra for this DVD.  (...)Paramount sure made out with this bare-bones disc - but next time, I'll be a bit more frugal when it comes to buying their discs.
B00005QXXO|3.0|I saw Radiohead this summer in Atlanta, and the band's sound was much better than on this recording. Thom's voice sounds strained and made me cringe quite often. The live version of &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is cool to hear, but again, Thom's voice is crap on it. The bootleg version of &quot;True Love Waits&quot; which has been circling the net for a couple years is better than the one featured here. I was just so disappointed with this release; It is, in my opinion, the worst thing they've ever released. I mean, it's not TERRIBLE . . . it's still amazing the way they can transform such complex studio tracks into viable live versions. Radiohead are still my favorite band ever, but I hope something on the level of &quot;I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings&quot; doesn't happen again.
B00005QATY|5.0|This is the best &quot;sleeper&quot; movie that I've ever seen!  I loved every character in this wonderful comedy.  Very few people that I've talked to have watched it, which is a shame, because they are missing out on a great time.  In my opinion, this movie is a masterpiece of comedy.  The music is not a style that I normally care for, and by the end of the first piece, I wanted to hear it again.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't wait another minute!
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought this album over a year ago, and still find myself wanting to listen to it again and again--it's simply filled with beautiful songs. When I first bought it, I listened to the whole album in one sitting; it seemed slow, (not an album to listen to when you've just had coffee) but I liked most of the songs. A month after that, I took it out of the rack it had been gathering dust in and put it on, learning to love the entire thing bit by bit.  It's the type of album that grows on you. It's also one of those that you should listen to on a stormy night while cozy in your house--a definite mood piece. The overall effect of the album is dark, velvety and introspective, even ethereal, at times. &quot;Sparks&quot;, &quot;Spies&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot; and &quot;We Never Change&quot; are favorites of mine, and &quot;Yellow&quot; was the hook that made me love Coldplay in the first place. If you like Doves, Travis, or Radiohead, I highly recommend it.
B000003CKH|1.0|Who are these guys?  They would have been 'gonged' on The Gong Show in the 70's.  I listened to this CD at least 5 times, and I just cannot seem to find the value with these clowns.  Yep, the trumpet thing is cool, and the 'I Will Survive' cover is neat, but the rest seems to reek of really bad ALT music.  This CD is purely entertainment a-la-Dr-Demento.<br />I respect a lot of the ALT artists (and all the ones that have been 'put' there), however this is seriously taking advantage of a tenuous situation in music - does any old (...) that doesn't sound like Springsteen fit here with many other better artists?  Now that TAKES THE CAKE mate!<br />(...)
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Howard Shore has become notorious for his dramatic music.  His low and slow technique has been honed and revised on scores as varried as Videodrome, SE7EN, and Crash, with standouts including The Fly, Naked Lunch and The Silence of the Lambs.<br />Shore's Fellowship of the Ring score plays to his strengths.  While short on the sorts of explicit themes that Goldsmith, Williams, and Horner are renound for, this score is also largely devoid from the curse of self-borrowing that those greats, and Shore himself is periodic prone to.  Instead what we have is a modern score that plays so faithfully to the drama and emotional cores of the characters that it feels timeless.  In layering Dwarven and Elvish voices into the work, Shore has helped Director Jackson preserve some of the the ethnic and linguistic depth of Tolkien's that might otherwise been missed.<br />As a whole, despite its classical feel, the score is darker than one might expect for Tolkien's classic fantasy.  Initially one is tempted to point to both Shore's and Jackson's history with high horror, but that would be misplaced.  One must remember, this is not the Hobit.  The Lord of the Rings is about the moral struggle against the Great Evil.  The Stakes are high and from the very beginning a cloud hangs over the fellowship.  Middle Earth is a world past her prime and the tasks at hand are likely impossible.  In preserving this tone in the music (though not to excess) Jackson and Shore have played closer to the tone of the texts than they were expected to and have provided us with a film score that is rich, dramatic, and moving.<br />Pitch perfect, tone sure and right on key; the old Professor, I suspect, would be proud.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I've seen this movie twice, once in the theaters, and once with some friends on VHS.  Here are my thoughts blow by blow through the movie (some mild spoilers):<br />-- The beginning text crawl and the Qui-Gon/Obi-Wans dialogue were pretty lame.  Pretty sophomoric.  The Asian aliens on first note didn't really bother me but the second viewing I really noticed it.  I'd be insulted too.<br />-- The lightsabre fights had no point other than to look cool.  They could have been avoided but all the Jedi did in this movie was fight.  Seemed a 180 from their philosophy in the original trilogy.  The whole \\"Force push\\" idea is ridiculous -- if it's that easy to break a droid's neck (Qui-Gon flicks two fingers as an afterthought, no concentration) -- WHY EVEN HAVE LIGHTSABRES???  Why not just do that all the time?  The old Force required concentration to do things.<br />-- The dialogue was stilted and about 4th grade level.  <br />-- Anakin has no personality traits, he is simply a vessel from which the audience can live vicariously through.  Although you could argue Luke was like this too, he had guts, got angry, and was a decent character.  Anakin is garbage.<br />-- The Force is space bacteria?  That is lame.  (...).<br />-- The pod race had no emotion whatsoever.  Anakin (...) was blowing by people on straight aways.  What's exciting about that?<br />-- The final fight scenes were insulting to all viewers over 10.  The lightsabre scene was cool but on the second viewing it was pretty stupid.  The Jedi's spin for no reason and Obi-Wan keeps twirling his lightsabre for no reason.  They do stupid stuff that looks cool the first time but after that looks pretty stupid.  (...)<br />Overall I'd say this movie is a joke.  It's almost as if Lucas was making fun of his own series.  (...).  Lucas seems to have less of a grasp on the Star Wars universe than many of his fans.  What this is is a 2 hour toy commercial.
B00005KFUM|5.0|i bought the album after i heard the blinding single newborn. the cd isn't (...) like steriophonics. it has some absoloutly brilliant tracks on there like plug in baby. its actually quite heavy sometimes but there are some good but not so heavy tracks like feeling good. i would recomend this to any alternitive person thats not into really heavy stuff like slipknot.
B00000FC5H|5.0|This is the best single disc collection of EWF...everybody knows that. Sound quality is impeccable...I can see that a lot of effort went into the remastering. What I was also impressed with was the sequencing of the song selections. This makes listening to the CD that much more enjoyable. Maurice White, you truly were in a class all by yourself and this collection is indeed your gift to us. I like pretty much all the songs here but if I had to put out a 17-song EWF collection, I would have left out &quot;Can't Hide Love&quot;, &quot;Gratitude&quot;, &quot;Mighty Mighty&quot;, and &quot;Getaway.&quot; In their places, I would have included &quot;Love's Holliday&quot;, &quot;System of Survival&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, and &quot;Spend The Night.&quot; Anyone disagree? But clearly this is such a minor quibble on my part. The disc really is a gem.
B00005KFUM|2.0|i bought the album after i heard the blinding single newborn. the cd isn't (...) like steriophonics. it has some absoloutly brilliant tracks on there like plug in baby. its actually quite heavy sometimes but there are some good but not so heavy tracks like feeling good. i would recomend this to any alternitive person thats not into really heavy stuff like slipknot.
B0000024SD|5.0|This album has what I would consider the most utterly devastating song ever written, &quot;IT'S ALRIGHT, MA (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot;.  The waterfalls of pity roar in the first verse, but later &quot;somebody thinks they really found you.&quot;  I have a book with the music, but I don't play well enough to sound like what Bob Dylan can do with this song.  If you have heard Bob Dylan in concert since 1965, there is a good chance that you have heard this song, but the live recordings had a tendency to skip some of the verses.  Even the book that I have with this song only has words for three verses, and I know there is another verse about those who &quot;Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.&quot;  That is also the verse about someone &quot;who sings with his tongue on fire, . . . bent out of shape by society's pliars, cares not to come up any higher, but rather get you down in the hole that he's in.&quot;  People who don't like anything which is this explicit might be hard to talk to about things that really matter.  As far as I am concerned, all of the songs on this album are great, and I wouldn't be surprised if Baby Blue thought that another one of the songs was even more devastating.  Even if you hear this stuff, I'm not sure you will believe it, but get this.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Folks, Britney doesn't get much better than this. We've accepted the fact that she doesn't have a voice like Charlotte Church, her songs are full of synthesizers, and she likes to wiggle her behind. It's okay. She's fun. Her songs are fun. Her videos are fun. That's why we keep coming back.<br />The best song on this CD is &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot;, written by her boyfriend Justin Timberlake and her choreographer Wade J. Robeson. The beat is fresh and it's fun to hear Justin's background vocals against Britney's. It's the closest thing to a duet that we're going to get.<br />If you like the first single, &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot;, then you'll absolutely love &quot;Boys&quot;, which is also produced by the Neptunes. <br />No one is perfect, though. Britney fails is with &quot;Anticipating&quot;, a song that sounds like it would fit in better on her first CD, &quot;...Baby One More Time.&quot; It's childish, cheesy, and (dare I say it) &quot;underproduced&quot;. Her cover of &quot;I Love Rock and Roll&quot; is disappointing. Britney completely revamped &quot;Satisfaction&quot; on her last CD, but this time it's the same song - Britney merely moans and pants, trading in the guitars for electric pianos. Frankly, it's boring.<br />Britney fans will be pleased. Those who aren't fans may warm up.<br />But if you don't dance, stay far far away.
B0000025VU|4.0|I like to rock out, when my feelings about a political situation have exceeded my opportunities to do anything, and some of the songs on this album express a lot about my own political stance.  Most surprisingly, since September 11, 2001, the song &quot;Neighborhood Bully&quot; seems to be about us as much as it is about anybody.  Rocking out isn't always complementary, and Bob Dylan has written some songs which seem to express a particular situation more than they might express how any decent person would feel about a situation.  A key phrase in &quot;Neighborhood Bully&quot; is he wandered the Earth, &quot;an exiled man,&quot; and a lot of people who came to the United States of America prior to World War II because of the situation in Germany, which spread throughout that continent in a manner that made the United States a perfect place for them (a lot of people from Europe were very interested in the possibilities of atomic physics) to start building atomic bombs, and the United States probably spent a trillion dollars since then to provide weapons of such magnitude that no one would even think of trying to push the superpower to destroying the world as rapidly as that could be accomplished.  If we haven't actually destroyed the world yet, it is probably because we have become so good at being the neighborhood bully in this song, when we couldn't get some little nation to do it for us, possibly after a surprise attack on its own government.  This isn't the time, what with all the international war crimes charges already being pushed, to be naming names, but &quot;Man of Peace&quot; has about as little ambiguity about who (Satan is mentioned, without actually calling him Mephisto) is doing what to whom as &quot;License to Kill,&quot; which is pretty clear to me.  People might have to learn to listen to these songs the right way in order to hear anything, but I've looked at the words enough to know that there is plenty of meaning here for me.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|I was curious to see &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; because it was accorded a rare one-week run at Film Forum in Manhattan; I wasn't able to see it at that time, but I rented it soon after, in spite of the fact that I remember it's being something of a failure at the time of its initial release. <br />Well! I was quite blown away by the beautiful photography and sensitive handling of every scene in the first half of this film. It's everything the other reviewers have said of its remarkable evocation of bygone era. I was enthusiastic about it, and so were my fellows watching it with me, all the way up through the intermission period. Then, I put in the second half.<br />Although it is true that we always know Barry to be a rogue, I did not dislike him through that first half. However, his character deteriorated sharply in the second half, and I for one could not trace a logical evolution for this. Yes, I understand the IDEA that he let it go all to his head and became too much of an overreacher. But it seemed too much of an on off switch--first he was a nice rascal, then he was a mean one. So the second half seemed unmotivated for me, and I was sad to see that happen.<br />Be that as it may, I would certainly recommend anyone with an interest in period furniture, art, history, whatever to see &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. It is a painting come to life, and I only wish I had been able to enjoy the second half as much as I had the first.
B00005QXXO|4.0|For all those die hard Radiohead fans that had a problem with the electronic, austere nibblings of KID A or AMNESIAC, I MIGHT BE WRONG could be your back door of accessibility. Taking an equal number (more or less) of the more melodic tunes from both albums, we're treated to alive versions of these songs. Do I dare say &quot;guitars&quot;, yes indeed. In keeping with all things Radiohead, it's top notch. Inclusive of the esoteric art work, kinetic type styling, and chaotic, fractured messages. A complete broadcast from the island of themselves. Topped off by a non-album acoustic track &quot;True Love Waits&quot;. All-in-all, everthing IS in it's right place. True genius - long enough to get your attention, short enough too keep it.
B0000028VT|5.0|&quot;Music Box&quot; is Mariah's best-selling album and it's east to see why. &quot;Dreamlover&quot;, the huge smash hit topped the charts for 8 (!) weeks and became a multi-platinum seller worldwide. So did &quot;Hero&quot;, which spent 4 weeks at #1. The third single though, &quot;Without You&quot;, which is best track on the album in my opinion, peaked at #3 (for 6 weeks) in the US but went on to become one of Mariah's biggest singles around the world; topping almost every country it was released in (and I think it's every country in the world). I read some reviews here of people not really enthusiastic about this song but I think it's perfect. Just listen to how Mariah pulls her voice up and up. &quot;Anytime You Need A Friend&quot; is a beautiful song about helping each-other.<BR>The title track is another amazing Carey ballad which could have been released as a single and easily hit the top. The up-tempo songs, &quot;Now That I Know&quot; &amp; &quot;I've Been Thinking About You&quot; are very good as well and I like them both. &quot;Never Forget You&quot; is quite nice, some kind of a combination between &quot;Anytime&quot; and Without You&quot;. The last two ballads, &quot;Just To Hold You Once Again&quot; and &quot;All I've Ever Wanted&quot; are amazing (!!!) The lyrics and music of both of them is outstanding, and they rank among Mariah's best ballads. If you don't own this album, I recommend you to buy it today. I assure you, you won't be disappointed.
B00005QZWI|5.0|If this isn't the most amazing soundtrack ever!  Totally worth every penny spent.  It is very Middle-Earth\\"ish\\" and when the choir is singing at the parts with the Ringwraiths, they sing in different Middle earth languages.  The booklet inside the cd has Many sweet pictures and it is a very good cd.  GET IT!
0783217048|4.0|Forget about the story line. It is the one liners of this movie that are so funny!!!!! I have seen this movie more than 10 times and I still laugh. I catch something new each time. Wesley is great. John is soooo funny, his mannerisms, everything say &quot;Latina baby!&quot; Patrick...well he just seems to comfortable in this role...I don't know. I hope you like it!
B000002A46|1.0|Oh my gosh..... The thin raspy weak Mariah is singing again! This album is sure a let-down to all mankind... If you thought Christina's Christmas Album was horrible, wait till you hear this one. Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Madonna, Kylie Minogue; Faye, Claire and Lisa of Steps; Andrea of The Corrs have MUCH richer and fuller voice than hers, so pls, if you think her voice is good, it's time for you to go for some BASIC vocal training to help you filter out artists like Mariah...
B000003TAL|5.0|although you may not realize at first, this album is a true work of art. every time you listen, you hear something new about it. the album only gets better with age. at first it doesn't seem like that big of a deal just because it's not a very farmiliar sound. once you get used to it, you will realize how great an album it is. after a few listens, you don't even notice kim gordan's weird sounding voice and the poor quality of the recording. these musicians are truely brilliant and i would highly recomend daydream nation as a first sonic youth album.
B00005OAIE|2.0|Over the past month or so, I've been hearing myriads of people raving about how great this CD is. Having finally bought it, without hearing any of it before I did, I have to say that I don't see what's so spectacular about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that it's a bad album at all. All I'm saying is that this is not anything to get that excited about. I liked most of it, but there was nothing that blew me away. What I heard was standard lite-pop/rock. The lyrics are nothing outstanding. The guitar playing is good, but nothing special. The backing band is actually really banal and boring. I guess after hearing so many people rave about this album I was expecting something groundbreaking. Instead, what I hear is almost mediocre, and definetly not impressive. There's promise here, but no delivery.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|The Rainbow Children fuses some great funk, jazz, soul, and high-octane rock with very religious lyrics. The result is startling cohesive, considering that mix. Rainbow Children's &quot;story&quot; may not be worth spending too much time deciphering. My suggestion is to ignore the story and just take the lyrics as they come in each song. It's impossible, though, to ignore the bold and forceful music throughout this CD. <br />The title track is funky jazz, with a very nice guitar solo slipped into the middle. &quot;Muse 2 the Pharoah&quot; is slow and seductive. &quot;Digital Garden&quot; is everything rolled into one--a fast-paced and infectious jungle beat looped behind a very beautiful and soothing melody, with Prince at times singing two different sets of lyrics which overlap...all to end with this head-banging guitar solo. &quot;Everywhere&quot; starts off calm...then explodes into this high energy chorus(including some amazing drumming by John Blackwell), ending with a soulful and personal vocal by Prince as he realizes he's got &quot;so much work to do...everywhere...&quot;. <br />Other highlights are many, but my personal favorites are &quot;Muse&quot;, &quot;The Work&quot;, the cool &amp; funky &quot;1+1+1 is 3&quot;, a beautiful pop ballad called &quot;She Loves Me 4 Me&quot;, a Sly-and-Stevie-inspired rocker called &quot;Family Name&quot;, the live-sounding funk romp &quot;Everlasting Now&quot;, and the beautiful &quot;Last December&quot;, which reflects on life just as it's about to end.<br />Musically, everything here seems to work. And The Rainbow Children is also the first album by Prince in a long time which surprises you as you listen to it. The grooves take sudden turns in different directions. And you WILL end up singing many of the songs in your head well after listening to the CD, which is always a mark of a great CD. If you love the warm, organic feel of real music being played by real and inspired musicians, then The Rainbow Children should definitely be on your list.

0780021967|5.0|If you must buy the THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS buy the Criterion version. And of course, if you are a film buff, you must buy THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS. Hitchcock's techniques are still taught in film making classes and this film is a good example of why he remains the master film maker.<br />STEPS is a beautifully restored and artfully done black and white film from the 1930s filled with excellent shots dependent upon back-lighting, side-lighting, and underlighting. In addition, many of the techniques Hitchcock perfected are still being used in modern suspense thrillers - running figures sillouetted against the sky, a screaming woman whose voice becomes the shrill whistle of a departing train, boat, etc., leading characters handcuffed together, the chase onto and through a moving train. The autogyro the police use to chase the leading man was a forerunner of the helicopter. The autogyro took off on a runway like an airplane but was kept aloft by a rotary propeller like a helicopter and was in it's infancy in 1935. Surely this was one of the first times a conveyience of this sort was used in a chase scene. The use of the autogyro (helicopter) and other aspects of STEPS are found in many later films including Hitchcock's own NORTH BY NORTHWEST.<br />The Criterion version contains the usual overvoice commentary; a documentary about Hitchcock's &quot;British&quot; period which includes the making of THE LADY VANISHES, the first MAN WHO KNEW TO MUCH, STEPS, and other favorites; plus a LUX Theater presentation based on the 1915 book THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS and starring Robert Montgomery.<br />If you're interested in film history or Hitchcock, or just want to watch an entertaining story you'll enjoy this film. Prior to viewing STEPS, I watched Woody Allen's PLAY IT AGAIN SAM (a send up of CASABLANCA), THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE--the Joel and Ethan Coen film &quot;noir&quot; currently playing in movie theaters, and the American Movie Classics piece on film noir. I found the connections between film noir and more recent films fascinating.ns between film noir and more recent films fascinating.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is an incredible animated feature. In some scenes they actually got it TOO perfect and had to &quot;dial back&quot; the realism factor to keep it in a semi-cartoon style. Looking at the swaying flowers, the details on the faces, the blasts of fire and the leaves in the trees make you realize that computer animation is almost to the point of doing a &quot;real&quot; movie.<br />There is SO much in this movie that it's hard to even know where to begin. The voices are fantastic. The animation is fantastic. The plot is great! There are certain scenes in there, the gingerbread man on especially, that get me laughing even after many, many viewings. We've shown this to kids, adults, oldsters, and everything in between and everybody has loved it. There are tons of little gags in there that you only notice on seeing it multiple times.<br />And the meaning of the story is truly priceless.<br />Definitely a must-have for any household with a DVD player!
B00005RIKD|5.0|Whatever anyone may say this album lacks, it certainly isn't energy or sensitivity to the listener!! Anyone who thinks that and that Sting is purely commercial, forgets that he WORKS for his albums - 16 month for Brand New Day alone - and that this album was to be recorded for his fans..<br />In his own words, it was intended to be &quot;a joyous occasion - a celebration of music&quot; but as the inside cover tells you (and any number of other sources), neccesity demanded that it was respectfully dedicated to those who lost their lives. Take this into account, beautiful album that it is, change the day and add the missing songs: &quot;Desert Rose&quot;, &quot;Englishman In New York&quot; and &quot;I Burn For You&quot;.. and I don't think anyone, anywhere would have much of a point to make of his place in music!<br />All music fans who know Stings work will appreciate how much this album is worth. For me, its much more than a greatest hits album of Sting, its the best of the man and his music..
0451450639|4.0|This is one of the most absorbing novels I've read in some time.   A discovery on the moon leads man to journey in to the depths of space to find it's and perhaps mankinds origins.  The book is written beautifully and you acually feel as though you are out there in space yourself.  And then there is HAL, the computer system that runs the ship who, in my opinion, makes this novel a classic (and how many times has HAL been copied since).  Do not judge this book on the tremendously boring Kurbrick film, read Clarke's novel instead.  The novel has far more atmosphere and makes ten times more sense than what Kubrick produced.<BR>Get it and read it, it it totally worth while.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira shows in this new CD that although her first language is Spanish, she can still express herself very well in songs in English. The rhythms are great, her voice sounds strong!! (some people have said she sounds different --its just that she was much much younger when she recorded Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan Los Ladrones) and the variety of melodies are amazing.<BR>I definately recommend it all the way! Sales speak for themselves and Shakira is doing awesome and I know will continue to do so in the future.
0140434259|5.0|I have to say I loved this book. Most of the cogent points about this book have been pointed out already, so I'm not going to repeat them, but add some comments additional to what has been stated already.<br />It's not Austen's best book, it's a simpler book than the ones that come after it, but that does at least make it easier to read - each successive book is a quantum leap in terms of style, narrative, dialogue and plotting over the previous, and Austen was changing the way novels would be written forever.<br />Not that this is a bad book. Personally I liked it because it has something that's not so obvious in her later books, with the exception of Persuasion - the rock hard scathing judgment that comes accross in her letters - her obvious contempt for characters like Sir John Middleton, Lady Ferrars is searing in it's acidity.<br />There are some excellent scenes - the scenes with Lucy and Elinor are classics in their own right, and the coup de theatre scenes when Edward bursts in on Elinor and Lucy, or Elinor throwing open the door after waiting for her mother when Marrianne is desperatly ill, instead finds only - Willoughby!<br />Although the habit of the author colouring the narrative with her own opinions does get irratating at times, (a lesson she'd learnt by the time she wrote Pride &amp; Prejudice, which is neutral and unbiased) this still makes for a marvellous read. Marianne's sensibitility is breathtaking, and the revelation of how individual behaviour is fundamental in preserving the very fabric of society is unsurpassed.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I have always liked Pink, but not enough where i bought her last cd.  She never struck me as one of those non talented, blonde, why are they stars?, pop singers, and with album she proves everyone wrong.  Most of her songs have a deep meaning, and if you saw the Diary Of Pink on (...)MTV, you'll know that Pink really put her all into these songs.  I always thought Pink was a feminist and I was happy to hear her talk about being one, cuz everyone shoud be.  Her lyrics prove to be that of a feminist (meaning a woman who does not let a men keep her down!)Pink is all about doing it for yrslef and I like how she encourages Ladies and grrrls on this cd.  I hope now that a popular commercial artist has brought feminsim into their music more people will adapt it too! Thanks Pink!
B00003CXXI|5.0|wow, wow, wow, wow! what more can you say.  This has to be the best animated movie of all time, better then the Lion King, better than Snow White.  All of the inuendoes to fairy tales and movies are great, esp. the muffin man scene.  Dreamworks also continues on its track record of making movies with great and heartfelt stories.  You can see the persona and attitudes of the characters change with the mood of the movie, from the funny scenes to the scene where the mood turns incredibly somber. The Smash Mouth songs also add a lot to the beginning and end of the movie as well.  Everyone must see this movie!

B00001OH1S|5.0|I am an avid listener of many movie soundtracks, this one included, and The Thomas Crown Affair is a wonderful CD.  From the first updated song titled Windmills of Your Mind to the final Quick Exit, the soundtrack is truly wonderful.  Though the second track, Sinnerman runs about ten minutes long, it is worth it, especially if you've seen the film, which gives you something to compare it to.  Track 3 is a pleasant blend of English and French, (though it may be Spanish.)  Track 8 also is a must for fans of jazz.  The saxophone is definetly preasent and played wonderfully.  In all, The Thomas Crown Affair is worth the money, trust me.
0425170349|1.0|This being the only Tom Clancy novel that i have read, i have to say i was greatly dissappointed.  I found Rainbow Six an extremely predictable story of good guys versus bad guys.  This book logged in at nearly 900 pages and yet the charactors were all one dimensional, the plot could be seen a mile away, and there were no suprises at all.  The women, although educated, were incapable of comprehending the hard realities of the job the men performed - killing terrorist.  Huh?  The sexist nature of this novel portrayed women as liberal, pouting, drones best left to mothering children than worrying about politics.  The vigilanty style justice at the end of this book was pure fantasy.<BR>On the positive side about this novel was, although way too long, it was a quick and easy read.  The action was fast paced and rarely bogged down too much. My recommendation is that if you like this type of genre, you would be much happier reading anything by Robert Ludlum.  His novels are far superior to Tom Clancy's.
6302541743|5.0|If you've never heard of Fawlty Towers, you are truly missing a classic comedy series. Don't let the fact that it's British humor turn you away either. It's not your typical British sitcom.<br />Fawlty Towers was a series of 12 episodes made in the 1970's about a hotel in the little town of Torquay, England (pronounced Torkee). The episodes all revolve around the mishaps and misunderstandings and flat out irrational behavior of the hotel owner Basil Fawlty played by John Cleese of Monty Python fame. Cleese does a wonderful job melding physical comedy, sarcasm, and British wit, but of course he doesn't do this alone.<br />Prunella Scales (former RSC actress) plays Basil's wife Sybil Fawlty while Cleese's wife in real life Connie Booth plays Polly, the hotel maid/receptionist/waitress. Andrew Sachs plays Manuel, the Spanish waiter who does a fabulous job playing opposite Basil Fawlty and aggravating him to the point of frustration. Note that every character at one point in the series explains Manuel's funny behavior with the excuse \\"He's from Barcelona.\\"<br />There are a few other regular characters such as the Major who is an old, rather senile war veteran and the two ladies who are also old and rather senile.<br />As I said earlier, there are 12 episodes. Each one is very original and I never get tired of watching them. The following is a short summary of each of the episodes.<br />A Touch of Class - Basil places an ad for the hotel to attract upscale clientele. A Lord Melbury makes reservations at the hotel, but he isn't who everyone thinks he is.<br />The Builders - Basil hires O'Reilly, a cheap Irish builder, to rennovate the hotel, but when he and his wife leave for an outing and Polly leaves Manuel in charge, everything goes wrong.<br />The Wedding Party - Basil gets into a series of misunderstandings when a flirty Frenchwoman and a young, sexually playful couple and their parents stay at the hotel.<br />The Hotel Inspectors - Sybil tells Basil there are hotel inspectors in town. He tries second guesses who the inspector is throughout the whole show and in the process is beat up, cries in front of a guest, and is frustrated beyond belief.<br />Gourmet Night - Basil attempts to serve a special gourmet dinner to the town sophisticates. Of course it goes terribly wrong. (watch him beat a car with a branch)<br />The Germans - Sybil is in the hospital with an ingrown toenail. Basil ends up in the hospital as well after a series of accidents, but escapes to the hotel just in time to greet some German guests.<br />Communication Problems - Everyone is frustrated when Mrs. Richards, a woman with a hearing aid she chooses not to turn on, stays at the hotel.<br />The Psychiatrist - Basil freaks out when he learns about two psychiatrists staying at the hotel.<br />Waldorf Salad - An English woman and her husband, an American, stay at the hotel. The cook leaves early and Basil fills in to cook the couple a hot meal.<br />The Kipper and The Corpse - A guest dies in the night and Basil has to get place the body in a discrete place until the coroner arrives.<br />The Anniversary - Basil pretends to forget he and Sybil's anniversary. He plans a surprise party that falls apart when she storms out angry.<br />Basil the Rat - A health inspector give the hotel one day to clean up their act. The hotel staff discover Manuel's pet rat (named Basil) and try to get rid of it.<br />If you like British comedy, this is definitely a classic to own. If you like comedy, this is a treat.<br />The best thing about these episodes is the detail involved in each episode. Every time you see the shows, you see something new. And all details in the episodes relate to each other. For instance in A Touch of Class, pay close attention to the pile of bricks mentioned at the beginning of the episode. You'll see them again.<br />Another little cute fact about the shows is the way the signs change during the title frame. The opening of the show is a scene from outsidethe hotel and the sign saying Fawlty Towers, but after the first episode, the sign changes to the point that it spells things such as Watery Towels.<br />Yes, the collection is on the expensive side but it is well worth the price and a must see for everyone. I am sure once you see these shows, you will watch them over and over again and love them for the classics they are.scene from outside the hotel and the sign saying Fawlty Towers, but after the first episode, the sign changes to the point that it spells things such as Watery Towels. <br />Yes, the collection is on the expensive side but it is well worth the price and a must see for everyone.

B00000K44W|5.0|This is absolutely Ian Anderson's best work.  And that is saying something considering the previous anthemic record &#34;Songs From the Wood&#34;.  Jethro Tull never molded well into the main stream, even considering their &#34;hits&#34; like &#34;Bungle in the Jungle&#34; and &#34;Living in the Past&#34;.  But there is reason for that.  They created their own genre amongst the likes of Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, Kiss, Aerosmith, and the Stones.  They sang of life and love and trying to get by in a way largely devoid of vulgarity and violence.  &#34;Heavy Horses&#34; is likely to inspire you to move to Scotland and live on a farm.  If you only buy one Jethro Tull record, buy this one.  Better yet, if you only buy one record...period.
B00005NWM3|4.0|This album is really good!  They have a lot of catchy tunes but some of them you have to listen to a few times for them to grow on you.  Overall I gave the CD four stars because it rocks but their other album &quot;the state&quot; is better.  If you like 3 doors down, Incubus and Creed, then this is right in your genre.  So go buy it already! :p
6305922748|5.0|What can I say? This movie ROCKS! Its hilarious band members and side-splitting songs like &quot;Big Bottom&quot;, &quot;Sex Farm&quot;, and &quot;Stonehenge&quot; make me wish that Spinal Tap really were a band!

B00005RFAI|1.0|The first time you listen to this, you might think, 'wow, she's really turned it around, talking about drugs, and broken homes.'  But then you hear it again, and begin to realize that, yes, she's got the balls to talk about this stuff, but she's really not doing it all that well.  Pink has no insight to offer into any of these scenarios, and leaves you wondering if she's speaking from experience, or trite, cliche, bad movies, and those info-mercials that try to be cool (\\"tobacco is wacko\\", for example).
B00005QDW5|4.0|I was at first frustrated with the non-chronological order of the songs on ECHOES, in part because I just started my Pink Floyd collection.  BUT, this is indeed a Fascinating listen with the mixed up track order.  Hearing 'Keep Talking' fade into 'Sheep' is truly BREATHTAKING!  <BR>The song selection is flawed, but that might have been what the compilers wanted.  I don't remember 'Marooned' or 'Sorrow being big hits, BUT 'Marooned gives the first C.d. a nifty intermissionand Sorrow is a good closer for the first C.D.  The 'Pre-Dark side' material is well represented, except for 'Interstellar Overdrive,' but that can be overlooked.  Songs like 'Brain Damage,' 'Have a Cigar,' 'Run Like Hell,' and 'The Turning Away' SHOULDN&quot;T have been overlooked, though, and if you're just getting into Pink Floyd (like I am) you might be better served to start with 'Dark Side' and 'WYWH' and then move to this compilation.
B00000DQSZ|4.0|This is the only Kraftwerk album that doesn't live up to it's reputation. Because of the use of the title track in the early dance classic 'Planet Rock' it's seen as being extremely influential but for me 'Man Machine'(1978) surpasses it.<BR>What it lacks are the memorable melodies that you find on their other albums, particularly the aforementioned 'MM' and 'Autobahn'. Also some of the spoken vocals are irritatingly repetitive. Of course I'm judging them by their extremely high standards and it's still a superb collection of tracks but particularly if you're just getting in to Kraftwerk 'Man Machine' is undoubtedly the one to go for.

B000007R1M|5.0|Trans-Europe Expree might be the most 'influential' 70s Kraftwerk album(mostly because of 'Planet Rock' using samples from the title track) but Man Machine is their best one. It's got the strongest melodies of any of their albums and these, allied to the wonderful electronic sounds make it an absolute classic. 'Robots' and 'The Model' get the most attention but for me the best track is 'Spacelab', it's got an eerie atmosphere and like Giorgio Moroder's 'I Feel Love' is a prototype for modern day Trance.
B00001QEE5|1.0|I am an adult who usually enjoys Disney movies, but this is the worst one I've ever seen. The author and/or adaptors into cartoon, portray all female characters except Wendy as jealous and malicious. Tinkerbell is jealous of Wendy and tries to get others to hurt her. The mermaids are jealous of Wendy and mistreat her. Then even Wendy becomes jealous of the Indian princess. The boys have all the fun, and Peter seems to relish the girls sniping at eachother over his attention. Very shallow and disappointing cartoon.

Its a must see movie
B000001ESP|5.0|The perfect balance! Meticulously composed for that new age sound that the era demanded, while capturing the hard rock rhythm that always keeps ones attention, regardless of how may times album is played. TEN stars is more appropriate. WHAT is the hesitation with inducting Rush into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame???? The yahoo's who make those decisions must have some sort of mental deficiency.

B00005RFAI|5.0|Although Pink's 1st album Can't Take Me Home is the only album I've cared enough to buy in year it debuted, I did find some of it too commercial for me. True, the album was a small reflection of her personality, but the angry-chick/men-(...) lyrics were following the trend of female music. For her 2nd album I expected the same but was I wrong! I haven't even had a chance to buy it, I went to her website to hear clips and now I can't wait to get to the recordstore and pick it up. Hearing those clips was like a starving man walking into country bufet. Being an aspiring artist myself I find it one-dimensional when most artists are afraid to crossover into other genres. Commercialism doesn't allow you to make more than 1 type of music. Pink's 2nd album has rock, diva, pop, hip-hop, r&b AND dance elements and it's refreshing to find another artist who actually has depth. And her songs aren't the same meaningless products of her trying to play off the media like Britney or Backstreet Boys, every songs lyrics are personal stories of Pink's life and mean something to her. The best artist is the one who succeeds by making music true to them. Pink, I didn't think your 2nd album could get better than Can't Take Me Home but somehow you pulled it off! I hope everyone else appreciates the album for the work of art it is as much as I do. Now the only problem is waiting for your next album, I CAN'T!
B000056MOD|5.0|When I first heard that the two Highlanders were going to be together, I was riveted to find more information.  After watching the movie, I was impressed.  The movie totally erased any lasting memory of Highlander 2 (arguably the worst merchandising move in movie history) and tied together both the series and the movies.  There are many holes that associate in tying the two together, but for 2 hours, they don't matter.  The only reason I have waited so long in reviewing this movie was to deside which was better, Highlander 1 or Highlander: Endgame.  My final verdict is a tie.  For Highlander fans, nothing can beat the original, but for Highlander: The Series fans, seeing Duncan on the big screen is unbeatable.  As a fan of both, I cannot deside.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I enormously enjoyed watching this movie. It is very different from anything I have seen so far. Its humor is well suited both for adults and children (mostly because children don't get the adult humor and reversed). Edie Murphy is the ultimate donkey - I think that this is his best role so far it fits him very well. The happy ending goes a bit too far but that is Hollywood isn't it :-)<BR>And I forgot - have you ever seen a female dragon - that is fun!<BR>Shortly - must see!
B00000J7JH|4.0|Ok I must admit it, it's not &quot;his finest hour&quot;, but even so you won't regret the money, there's a couple of fine tunes around, cool lyrics and cool cover art. If you 're a beginner in Tom Waits music, this album will make you look for more...
B00003CXDD|5.0|Oh yeah bring on the nostalgia! This movie really takes me back to my youth. It has always been one of my favourites and with very good reason. It's an amazing adventure and tells a great story. Stars Val Kilmer (Batman, Real Genius) and Warwick Davis (Return of the Jedi,The Leprechaun)If that wasn't good enough it's written by Star Wars creator and all round legend George Lucus and is directed by Ron Howard... how cool is that team!<br />This is one movie you can watch over and over and never get sick of. The great thing is that with this Special Edition dvd finally being released you can finally see Willow in all it's glory with perfect picture and sound. Special features include: Commentary from Warwick Davis (Willow), A behind the scenes documentary, Visual effects featurette and more! I can't reccoment this great movie enough... check it out!
0446677450|4.0|I fell in love with the book when I realized that the authors shared my philosophy of overcoming 'stalled' thinking. There is an excellent chapter on stalls related to fears of losing money, behaving differently than others, and so forth that most people have about money. The stallbusting advice is sound. In fact, this is probably the best chapter in the book. Also check out &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life&quot; by Taro Gold.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I can't believe that this is allowed to be publicized. My son is 13 years old and wanted this CD! Not in my life time or his will he ever get such a disgraceful, foul mouth so called piece of music. Limp bisket you need Christ in your life.
B00004U2NX|4.0|This beautiful movie moves at a leisurely pace ... be patient.  Lushly filmed on location in Holland and the Carpathian Mountains, this particular Nosferatu is worth watching for the amazing scenery alone.  Settle in, allow the story to capture you on a purely emotional level.  And emotional this film is.  Kinski portrays a sympathetic Count Dracula, complete with remnant touches of humanity which adds a depth and complexity to the all-too-frequently cliched character of the vampire doomed to a &quot;life&quot; of eternity.  This particular vampire is alone, he is unwell, he wants to die.  In fact he is convincingly undead, with his bald, bluish visage, deep sunk eyes, claw-like hands, and rattling breath.  Reminiscent is Kinski's Nosferatu to the one played by Max Schreck in 1922, the creepiest vampire ever to be put on film.  In fact, the acting in Herzog's Nosferatu might well be suited to a silent film; it is broad, theatrical, expansive.  The overall plot remains quite faithful to the Stoker novel, but what shines most in this adaptation is the love story between Jonathan, sent to Transylvania to settle the Count into a new home, and his wife Lucy who awaits her husband's return consumed by a dreadful unnamed fear which proves to be well founded--the Count arrives in town bringing with him the plague.  Splendidly portrayed is the confused feelings the Count displays toward Lucy, both touching and repulsive in turns ... his final attack upon Lucy is nothing if not touched with unabashed eroticism.  Faithful Lucy, loving Jonathan to the end, sacrifices herself to the Count, until the break of dawn destroys him.  Thus it ends, but with a satisfying twist: Jonathon rides off from his once beautiful, plague-ravaged town to continue the legacy of the undead.
B00000BKDY|5.0|Back in 1984 Maiden released their best album, the immortal &quot; Powerslave &quot; They set a really high standard for themselves. While they didn't top &quot; Powerslave &quot; they still made this classic album. This album still tends to get underrated because of the synths. Their not really noticed here as much as in &quot; 7th Son &quot; They do nothing to hurt the songs, but they don't really do much to help them. You got to admire them for trying out new stuff though. Anyway here's my grades.<br />                                      Song Grades<br />1. Caught Somewhere In Time-classic title track and opener like &quot; Where Eagles Dare &quot; It's one of Maidens epics. It's got the famous synth beginning and a pretty anthemic chorus. The amazing thing is that's its only the third best epic on this album.<br />     Final Grade-B+<br />2. Wasted Years-While it's not in the Top 10 Maiden songs this is still one of the best mainstream hard-rock songs I have ever heard. It's like the song a band like Aerosmith have been trying to write all their lives, but couldn't. It's got the same subject matter of life on the road as  Metallica's &quot; Wherever I May Roam &quot;<BR>     <BR>     Final Grade-A-<br />3. Sea Of Madness-It's an underated Maiden tune and the hardest rocking song on this album. The lyrics could possibly be dealing with Noah's Ark<br />     Final Grade-B+<br />4. Heaven Can Wait-This another Maiden epic and the 2nd best song on the album. While the chorus is only OK, I really like the singing in the verses.<br />     Final Grade-A-<br />5. The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner-Perhaps the longest Maiden-song title. The beginning is one of the most memorable intro's I have ever heard but after that it kind of tails off. It's still a good song.<br />     Final Grade-B<br />6. Stranger In A Strange Land-It's a good catchy hard-rocking song and was the 2nd single off this album, but it still feels like a made-to-be-played on radio song. It's not as good of a single as &quot; Wasted Years &quot;<br />     Final Grade-B<br />7. Deja-Vu-Here comes the first misstep of this album. I don't know the point of this song being made. The chorus is annoying and the lyrics are kind of stupid. It's not even a guilty pleasure to listen to sometimes like &quot; Mother Russia &quot; It's just a mediocre song that I always skip over. Not as bad as &quot; Quest For Fire &quot; though.<br />     Final Grade-D+<br />8. Alexander The Great-The last epic and the best song on this album. It's an extremely well put together song like &quot; Rime Of The Ancient Mariner &quot; or &quot; Hallowed Be Thy Name &quot; The only thing keeping me from giving this song an A+ is that by 1986 it became kind of cliche for metal bands to sing about historical figures. I usually don't pay much attention to the lyrics but the song is extremely well song and the guitar solo is awesome. It's better that you just not look at the lyric sheet and just enjoy this song.<br />     Final Grade-A<br />This and &quot; 7th Son &quot; are still Maiden in their prime, but after that it's all downhill till &quot; Brave New World &quot; I would recommend this album because most of the songs are classics, but especially for the 3 epics.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|FINALLY they made a movie that resembles a musical. This movie as its soundtrack sweps you away with songs singing and colors and quick and funny dialog and superb acting (my favorite being the elephant part in the begining) . I was amazed to see Nic sing, I had heard Ewan before. Though I had not heard them together they carry each other off rather well. (and I greatly admire nic for not using a voice double alot). The woman has guts and she showed us once again that she can act (and apparently sing and dance) beautifully. I wish someone will releace the rest of the soudntrack soon. Who ever heard of a movie that is like a musical and ALL of its songs arent listed? I have seen the movie 3 times already... and I cant wait for the next cd to come out. I am assuming there will be one since there was a second one  of Romeo and Juliete as well. There are incredible songs missing from the cd.<br />-Satines song in the curtains before she collapses<br />-Like a virgin<br />-So exciting!It will last for 50 years<br />-The show must go on<br />-Here we are now Entertain us<br />-Got some dark desire... outside it maybe raining but in here its entertaining....<br />-Come what may (end version)<br />In short all the songs with Harold Zidlers character are SADLY mmissing from the cd... Personally next to Nic, I thought he was the best of the whole cast! Also I think for those of us who bought the first cd really early because we recognised a good trailer when we saw one, that the second cd should also include the Remix of the song that was omitted in the first cut of this cd. Bravo everyone that got involved in this soundtrack. It is breathtaking and funny at the same time... (or did you not see the like a virgin scene?)PLEASE RELEASE THE WHOLE CD ASAP. judging from other peoples reviews I am guessing there is a long line waiting to buy it!
B00005JKHP|5.0|I completely forget about this movie sometime.  In fact I haven't seen it in years.  So when I saw it in the store, I bought it on a whim.  I don't know if the changes the director made really made any difference, but it's a great deal better then I remember.  Saw that it was supposed to have new effects, but I hardly noticed them.  There was one glaring addition at the end, but aside from that the new effects were seemlessly integrated.  One thing about the movie is it's difference from the rest of the Star Trek films.  It was made before they set the standard with the Wrath of Kahn, so it's unique.  A very good movie, highly recomended,
0767830520|5.0|Martin Scorsese's second collaberation out of eight with Robert DeNiro is probably the most memorable. DeNiro is Paul Schraders'<BR>Character Loneley Travis Bickle. DeNiro brings on a his soft mood performance in the first half of the film and then after the first half it really lights up. Oh and by the way if you buy the special collectors edition you would know that the famous mirror scene &quot; You Talkin to me&quot; was improvised by Robert DeNiro not in the original scrpt. Travis takes Betsy a girl who works for the Senators cmpaign on a date. After an awful night at the movies Travis goes in and tries to talk to her about why she wasn't returning his calls. Everything is going miserable until something intresting happens. Harvey Kietel ad Jodi Foster are introduced and Foster is being harrassed. He finally realizes that He can't take this anymore. After  Getting advice from old buddy Wizard(played by Peter Boyle) He goes and gets his own collection of firearms. He then finds the people that are harrasing Jodie Foster and realizes that He's inlove with her.<BR>Directed by Martin Scorsese
0930289234|4.0|Watchmen is an excellent graphic novel. The characters are totally dope and the story is great. Pure Alan Moore. But to say, I am quite disappointed with Alan Moore's work because there is one thing that he includes in all of it: nudity and language. In my point of view, I think that comics should lack the amount of language and nudity. In Watchmen, Dr. Manhattan was nude throughout the novel, which was totally unnecessary. And when (I forgot the woman's name) went nude and had sex in the dark, I thought that was totally, totally unnecessary. I don't know if it is true but is Alan Moore just another perverted writer who all he thinks about is nudity, language and sex. But overall, this novel is totally awesome except with all the adult content, language and nudity.
B000001FSU|5.0|After hearing how bad this album supposedly was, I decided I'd buy it and find out for myself. I gotta say this is one awesome album. Highlights would be Be All, End All, Make Me Laugh, and Who Cares Wins. The rest are all good, except two tracks: 13 and Antisocial. I dont't know why everyone else likes Antisocial, it just doesnt cut it for me. and 13 is just bizarre, it really shouldn't be on this otherwise excellent album. Overall it seems like Anthrax set dow ntheir comic books got alot more serious with this album. The issues the songs deal with are much more relavent than on Among the Living. I have to say that if you consider yourself a fan of Anthrax to pick this one up today.
0385484518|5.0|This is a book you cannot read only once. The story grabs you and you become a part of it.  I found it hard to put this book down. My recommendation would be to grab a box of tissues before you get to the end. We should all be so lucky to have a Morrie in our lives...very touching, inspiring and heartwarming.
B00005OWIU|3.0|The &quot;Harry Potter Soundtrack&quot; is good.  John Williams is back with his usual style - giving us Harry Potter mixed with &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters&quot;.<br />I am not saying this is a poor soundtrack, just the usual John Williams fare.  Williams does have distinction between his soundtracks but his &quot;same&quot; style lingers in all of them where you still hear a little &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, etc.<br />A good soundtrack not great.  Why this is getting 5 star reviews is beyond me, it is not a classic, just good fare.  Williams brings the music to the story of Harry Potter alive in a pop classic sense.<br />Williams needs new influence in his style, like Michael Nyman &quot;The Piano&quot;, &quot;Gattaca&quot;, etc. (who has yet to win an academy award for music score).<br />I am sure Williams will win again at the Oscars for this been there/done that style with just a different twist.
B000002J6F|5.0|I always loved Stephen Stills in all of his bands and as a solo artist, but Manassas really kicks because it had the best percussionist I think I've ever heard in a rock band.  I'm talking percussion, rather than just drums, because Joe Lala played various other percussion instruments on this and the other Manassas album.  Lala is dynamite and brings an added dimension of greatness to an album that's otherwise really wonderful. I highly recommend this album to anyone seeking killer percussion.  I played the heck out of this record (which is better than the second Manassas album, Down the Road) when it first came out and expect to do the same to the CD.
B00004RFFS|4.0|&Igrave; first got the attention 2 this production when River Phoenix died of a drug overdose on October 31 1993 and that h e was to have played the interviewer...<br />In addition author Anne Rice gave Tom Cruise the trashtreatment when she learned he was to play her beloved Lestat. S h e wanted John Malkovich. Indeed, when the film premiered, she splashed a great &quot;sorry&quot; 2 Tom published `round the world.<br />Because this IS Tom Cruise`s film. He owns it. He is formidable as we say. As are newcomer Kirsten Dunst. The problem is that when Tom is absent, we miss him. We miss his EVIL... Brad Pitt`s Louis is a SULKING character and we really think he overstayes his welcome...<br />The production values are high, but at times theatrical AND THAT in a BAD way. So my overrall impression is that the intensity and interest are gone when Tom is missing...<br />It is a thousand pities that he didn`t get the Oscar for this...
B00003CX8J|4.0|The X-Men is a great movie both for it's entertainment value and it's theme of tolerance. This is a classy film--moderate profanity and no graphic violence. I have watched it several times now on DVD (saw it once in a theater). I am probably part of the film's ideal audience--having never read the comic book the things different in the film (such as lack of yellow spandex) don't bother me. I think the parts were very well cast, the dialogue is strong and the direction is quite good. Also, the DVD has excellent picture and sound quality and several extras, including a &quot;special edition&quot; of the film with deleted/edited scenes re-inserted.<br />Ironically, the included Fox special &quot;The Mutant Watch&quot; contains overtones of petty politics and politically correct racism (the Senators favoring mutant registration are white male Republicans, while those speaking against are minority race Democrats). I am an independent, not a Republican, but still found this appaling enough to knock a star off the final rating (I was going to give it five).<br />All in all, I still highly recommend this DVD. I rate The X-Men as one of my favorite movies of all time.
0800104846|4.0|December 28 1989 I first saw this film and became an instant fan of RIVER PHOENIX. Teamed with great Sidney Poitier it is a cold-war thriller and at times - a good one. But in the end it goes over the top and it quickly lost its importance when the cold war vanished...  soon after the films completion...<br />However, it is a treat for the fans of these stars and the supporting cast are great especially Caroline Kava.
6301607929|5.0|I think that Picnic is one of the best movies ever made in Hollywood.  <BR>Everything about it is first rate.  The acting, directing, cinematography, music, everything comes together to make a wonderful whole.  Rosalind Russell, Susan Strasberg, Cliff Robertson, and the whole supporting cast, are superb.  William Holden and Kim Novak, as the main characters in the movie, are really magic together. The chemistry between them, is the most electrifying I have ever seen on screen. If you have never seen this movie, I urge you to do so, and if you haven't seen it for a while, have a look at it again.  You are in for a REAL TREAT.
B00002E224|5.0|Ethan and Julie are great as Jesse and Celine. It is a beautiful told piece of filmmaking where the dialogue is the important factor. It`s so realistic and u remember similar experiences dangerously close 2 those in the picture.<br />A minus is the streets, backalleys and parks of Vienna. They look quite cleansed of the underworld creatures.<br />But this is a treat...
B00005RFQ5|2.0|First off, like many people writing reviews here, I must say I'm a HUGE Prince fan.  But I was disappointed with this release.  My main complaint is that annoying &quot;narrator&quot; voice between many of the tracks.  I'm happy for the man that he is excited about his new faith, and I even support his idea of putting all newfound excitement into his music.  But it's just not that terribly interesting.  Sure, there are standout moments (like &quot;The Work&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Everlasting Now&quot;--which calls to mind &quot;The Sacrifice of Victor&quot;).  But there's more than the normal amount of filler material.  Lyrically, it feels like he's coasting on this one.  But if a more laid-back, jazzy style suits you, then you might at least find the music pleasing.  Prince has made a career out of changing styles with almost every release; and THE RAINBOW CHILDREN certainly continues that trend.  Unless you're a die-hard fan (in which case you almost certainly bought the thing already), I recommend you TRY before you BUY.
B000031XCR|1.0|This album contains some of the biggest hits that Celine has produced over the last ten years. I could not avoid listening to most of them in one venue or another as she competeed with Mariah, Whitney and even Barbara in 'screaming matches' in one movie or another.  In the mid 90's it seemed she was everywhere as she decided to re-interpret classics of the past.  Anyone that can carry a tune and still has good hearing will never forgive her for ruining All by Myself by Eric Carmen.  This song was one of the best of the 70's. Apart from the simple - and poignant - lyrics delivered without oinctuos sappiness, the quality of the orchestration, the piano and the subtlety (and smoothness) of Carmen's voice make this song a classic of all time that requires no alteration.  What possessed Celine to make her think she could somehow improve on it?  On this decade collection listeners will cringe as she ruins perfectly good songs with her over-interpreting, screams,. shouts and dissonances - The Power of Love being a particularly notable example, with so many trills and shrills Celine may force you to buy a new set of glassware. Celine Dion used to sing well in her Quebec - French only days. Her songs reminded me of Mirelle Mathieu and had a French simplicity  and melodious elegance about them.  Somehow, these days, to break into the global charts, you have ti ruin and cirrupt your talent.  You must scream, rather than sing, a song and overact emotions more than Lawrence Olivier reciting Shakespeare.  However, when the quality of song and lyrics are so banal (i.e. My Heart will go On)all these elements come together to produce an abomination of music. Celine has thankfully retired (I hope permanently).  Hopefully her songs will soon be forgotten.  By the way Mariah and Whitney, you're no better.
B00005A46T|1.0|I hate slipknot. Slipknot, to me represents everything that is wrong with metal. They are pop death metal. If you want loud, listen to manowar. If you want heavy, listen to At the gates. If you want skill, listen to Yngwie Malmstien. If you want evil, listen to Rammstein. (...)
B00004Z459|5.0|every time i listen to this cd i swear they wrote it for me... i listen to it so personally and besides the awesome lyrics the rythyms, melodies, the music in general is so eclectic and new and absolutely awesome... every single person should own this cd
B000000643|4.0|It was very hard for me to give this album only four stars.  This is one of the most varied folk (or rock) albums I have ever heard.  From the cajun-styled 'Cajun Woman' and 'Si Tu Dois Partir' to the country-flavored 'Million Dollar Bash', Fairport certainly showed itself adept at a variety of styles.  'Genesis Hall' is one of the finest performances I have ever heard (and a further indication, if any were needed, of Richard Thompson's genius as a songwriter), but there are not as many magnificent moments as either on 'What We Did On Our Holidays' or on 'Liege and Lief'.  Still, if you are interested in a group showing itself proficient at a multitude of styles, with a magnificent lead vocalist (Sandy Denny) and brilliant musicians (and you SHOULD be!), buy it!
B00004Y6RO|5.0|i have not heard a better new hard metal album... you can not put slipknot into words... the emotions, the music, its amazing... THANK YOU SLIPKNOT...
B00000063U|5.0|I feel that this is the best single album of one of the finest overall songwriters of the modern era.  Where to begin?  At the end...the final two songs, &quot;End of the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;The Great Valerio&quot; are a beautiful, dark, ending to this album, possibly the most perfect ending to any album.  The music is stripped of frills, reflecting despair without entering into self-pity.  There is a feeling of being alone and without purpose, with no hope for this to change; this is our condition, not some malleable situation.  How perfect is this: &quot;Life seems so rosy in the cradle/But take a look outside your nursery door/There's nothing at the end of the rainbow/There's nothing to grow up for anymore&quot;  It is the realization of the tragedy that our lives must be if there is nothing beyond it.  It is the conviction of a man who cannot see beyond the horrors of his own life.  <br />There are MANY other great songs on this disk: &quot;Calvary Cross&quot;, &quot;Down Where the Drunkards Roll&quot; and the title track all spring to mind.  There is not a dud in the collection.  Richard shows himself a superlative songwriter and an excellent guitarist, and Linda's haunting vocals are beautifully suited to his work (although Richard's vocals on &quot;End of the Rainbow&quot; are also perfect).  I have never heard a 'perfect' album, but this album has certain strengths that make it something sui generis.
B00005B36H|5.0|im speechless... i dont know what else to add that nobody else has already said... tool IS one of THE best bands ever... they are just so..... no words explain..... the music, god..... its soooo, just sooo great, creative, eclectic, and beautiful... true artists in this pop-infested society
B00003CXTF|5.0|I took my girlfriend to see this movie, we both loved it. Great SFX, great story and just a great movie. Gives you plenty of time to snuggle close. Good movie and we are definatly going to buy it. (...) This was a terrific movie!
B00005A46T|5.0|to the guy up there... BITE ME... can a band BE more honest in this completely messed up society we tread upon... slipknot's music is therapy... the hard metal is intense and just gives this feeling of relief that other people are out there that understand... given, their first album was better, iowa is still wicked...
B0000021RD|5.0|Chicago II was the first album from the band that I bought, back in 1999. Needless to say, I was hooked. From &quot;Movin' In&quot; to &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot; there is some solid material. For instance, &quot;Colour My World&quot; is by far the best love song that they ever made in the Terry Kath era. He does a great job belting out the song with his unique voice. The songwriting is excellent as well, with Kath, James Pankow, Robert Lamm, and for the first time, Peter Cetera contributing tunes. I'm convinced that the guitar work on this album, especially &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;(the FULL version, instead of the lame radio edit), &quot;In the Country&quot;, and &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; is better than what anyone else did during the era, not named Plant, Page, Clapton, and Hendrix. It's a great album overall, so it's worth a listen or two!
B00005R2M3|5.0|When I first bought the CD, it as becuse of Whenever, Wherever. Now, after I have listened to the album day and night,  have grown to love everyone of the songs! There is no other artist like Shakira on Earth. She'll rock your senses with not only great melodies, but moving lyrics. Shakira is the WOMAN! She writes all of her songs and produces them as well. You won't find anyone with this amount of talent anywhere else. Buy this or you'll be missing out on great new world.
0312932081|5.0|I've only read Enders Game in the series, but after Reading it I was blown away on how good it was and the ending was pretty cool, I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read it though. As I was reading the book I was like &quot;I wish I could be that kid&quot; because there was nothing Ender couldn't do, he even when the odds were against him. This is a great book and I recommend it the readers of all ages.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Kinda along the lines of Indian Jones flicks, but definitely a<br />bit more steamier with Laura Croft and her..let's say she is NICE<br />looking..sorry Indiana.<br />Good story line, with some great special effects and a wee bit of gore.
6304057709|5.0|This movie is just wonderful! I love the acting of Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. The two sisters are opposite in terms of one being practical and the other who bases her actions only upon emotions. They both learn through the trials and tribulations of their time how to balance logic and feelings to overcome the odds and fall in love. It was just so heartwarming and I can't say enough about the acting, every little look meant something, every action had meaning. The sets were gorgeous, you could just feel the wind blowing and the beauty all around you when you watched the film. The whole movie was a perfect 5. I don't rate many at this number, so be prepared for a good time well spent. Warning, it may appeal more to the female sex, but men could learn a thing or two from watching this comedy/drama.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I like my incubus in three ways; funky, heavy, or electronic. This album fails  to be any of the above but that does not make it a bad album. Even thought this album is a transition from incubus' old music, it is handled with expertise that only proves the talent of incubus even more. This record succesful emerges from the stale air of nu and rap metal and gives you a refreshing and unique work. It features songs that sound like old incubus hits (wish you were here), heavier pieces (under my umbrella), and completely new sounds like 11am.<br />Even though this album is lighter than incubus' previous works, it shows some vitality that proves that these guys will be around longer than 1 minute fads like limp bizkit. Incubus is no rush to sell out.<br />Well, i geuss i learned to enjoy my incubus in one more way.
0345350499|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! I love the way Marion Zimmer Bradley put a feminine spin on the old Arthur tales. She was able to recreate the fairy tale with more feeling and detail. The book adds an element of emotion to the old semi-macho stories. Also, the scenes involving magic rituals and such were very acurate and believable. This is a definite must-read, especially for women.
0684833395|5.0|There have been many novels written about the horrors of war in the 20th century, and in my opinion, &quot;Catch-22&quot; is the best one.  Heller adopts a completly original style for this work.  He takes scenes of outrageous comedy and mixes them together with brutal descriptions of violent conflict.  The contrast keeps the reader off balance; you never know what to expect next.  Heller's amazing talent as a writer comes through in almost every paragraph.  His dialogue is believable, sharp, and witty; his word choice is very precise; and his descriptions are incredibly powerful.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about the novel is the way that Heller juggles his gigantic cast of characters.<br />So, should you buy &quot;Catch-22&quot;?  Here are a couple sample paragraphs.  If you find these to be funny, you will enjoy the entire novel.<br />&quot;Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre.  Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them.  With Major Major it had been  all three.  Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as one lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were all impressed by how unimpressive he was.<br />Major Major's father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age.  He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism.  He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down.  His specialty was alfalfa and he made a good thing out of not growing any of it.  The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa that he did not grow.  The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce.  Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa.  On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done.  He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county.

B00000K19E|5.0|While the idea of someone living in a world that is not what it appears to be is not alien in the realm of science-fiction films, the delivery of this concept in \\"The Matrix\\" is solid.  If the film was nothing less than some shoot-em'-up action flick, I doubt it would be as successful as it is now.  Visually, this film gives you little chance to rest before something even more stunning appears, which is a credit to all those involved.  The DVD itself is good (it's still a heavy seller (...) despite being two years old), cementing \\"The Matrix\\" as one of the truly great action films of our time.
6303921248|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I could watch it a million times and still cry and never get sick of it. I watch it all the time and it still feels like the first. I always cry when Jane is trying to get over her love for Bingley, and always cringe when that stupid nit of a mother goes on about money. (You just want to smack her.) I always &quot;awwwww&quot; when Mr. Darcy says he made Wickham marry Lydia (That ungrateful wench) for Lizzie. I roll my eyes at Lydia, laugh at smiley Mr. Bingely, Scowl at Mr. Wickham, admire beautiful Elizabeth, and I just *looooove* Mr. Darcy!! <BR>The acting was superb. Really wonderful. The mother should win an oscar for most annoying actress. And those sisters...my god! How awful! And Lydia, that brat! But best of all were Jennifer Elhe (She is so pretty, she has such twinkling, merry eyes) And Colin Firth (So hot!!!). They all were superb.<BR>And the scenery! How accurate! I love the clothing, the sets, the language, everything. It's just so good I could DIE.<BR>I love this movie sooooo much. It's romantic, witty and just WONDERFUL!!! And the fact that its in six tapes makes me have my favorites. I like #3 and #6 the most. I like #3 because that's when Darcy confesses his love for Lizzie, but she refuses him because he is too proud. (But I can understand why, when he says she has bad connections and is going against everyone's wishes. Meanie.) I like #6 becasue it's the BEST ONE!!!!!! It's so sweet when they get married and Jane marries Bingley! Oh, it's just so good! <BR>And #2 was pretty good, you just want to Punch Mr. Collins, he is sooo annoying! I can see why Elizabeth refused him. But #6 is really the best because you just HAVE to hate Katharine DeBerg and love Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, and it's just such a wonderful movie. <BR>YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!!!! IT IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005LOUQ|4.0|What better praise can I give a movie than to tell you that my ten year old son says he will memorize the lines in this movie because he likes it so much. It arrived today and he is already watching it for the second time. It is pure enjoyment. <br />This Ron Howard directed film starring Jim Carey and narrated by Anthony Hopkins is destined to be a holiday classic; we waited in line at the theatre last December to see it, and afterwards we agreed that as soon as the DVD came out we would purchase it. It doesn't matter whether you like Jim Carey films or not; this adaptation of the Dr. Suess classic cloaks Carey's neurotic comedy under a mound of green fur and yellow eyes, puts him inside a cave and wraps him in the Christmas spirit of Whoville. If Carey is remembered for anything by filmgoers, his portrayal of the Grinch may just be the one. If the adults listen closely, there are even enough lines in the film that will make you laugh out loud. <br />Well, my son's still laughing. So if you want to make that favorite child happy this holiday season, buy this DVD now.
0552124753|5.0|Pratchett's a brilliant satirist and wildly creative guy who lightens this reader's world with his inanities. His writing took me by surprise at first, as I became accustomed to his style and began to catch the subtleties of his humor. And then he got me - made me laugh, and I'm a tough audience when it comes to making me laugh out loud.<br />I just discovered his books this past year, and have been running steadily through his Discworld list. Despite the long list of life-disrupting events that have befallen us in that same period of time - or perhaps because of them - his books have sweetened the hour before bedtime for many months, and I know I can credit them for lifting any worries from my mind before sleep (which says a lot these days). Light-hearted reading that will entertain and make you chuckle!
6302054982|3.0|Good fellas has some funny moments, like the &quot;you're a funny guy&quot; scene, but this movie is too much like a real life story to be good entertainment.  Plus these wiseguys are so empty as people, I get tired of watching them.  Ultimately, the characters in this movie are not that interesting and I see no redeeming value in any of them, and my main feeling is that at best these gangsters are social parasites.<br />So, I guess the main value of this movie is a somewhat entertaining semi-documentary, but this only is worth 3 stars in my book.
6304981635|4.0|If you're a martial arts movie fan and you haven't seen Enter the Dragon, there's no excuse for you.  This is the Hollywood granddaddy of 'em all, and not just because of Bruce Lee.  Admittedly, Bruce Lee supplies the best fight scenes in the film (the one featuring ex-model John Saxon is very disappointing.  Brutish Bolo is touted as the big boss fighter throughout the movie, and when he doesn't actually fight Lee, it's a definite let-down.).  The film also has cameo performances from some very big name performers before they became internationally-known:  Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung are the three I noticed.  Unfortunately, they are not listed in the credits.<br />Bruce Lee is great to watch, not just as a supreme martial artist but also for the anatomy lesson he provides.  Lee is all bone, sinew, and muscle, and his skin almost seems to be an afterthought.  There's not a shred of fat on his frame, and it is easy to see which muscles come into play for various movements.<br />The film is filled with vintage 70s cheese, from the over-the-top cool cat performance of Jim Kelly and his afro, to the funky wakka-wakka guitar music.  Every punch and every kick, even if it doesn't actually hit anything, is accompanied by a swooshing or smacking sound effect.  It's as though every strike breaks the sound barrier.  And when contact is actually made, enormous thwacking sounds accompany it.  I may only be a yellow belt in karate, but something tells me if my arm really made that smacking sound every time I punched, there must be something horribly wrong with my joints.<br />I found the panoramic scenes of karateka training to be very interesting.  It looks like a complete hodgepodge of styles.  I also noticed an awful lot of white belts, considering the setting is an elite invitational tournament.  I thought the white belts would be there as practice targets for the masters, but the movie just didn't shape up that way.  Instead, it was the hapless guards who got to be the punching bags.  Something tells me all the students from all the martial arts schools in the Hong Kong area were herded onto the set as extras.  I saw a lot of sloppy strikes during the punching drills, and many of the white belts didn't appear able to tie their belts properly.  I saw more than one belt tied like a big floppy shoe lace, and a couple with one end poking straight up toward the wearers' chests.<br />The version of the film I saw includes a behind-the-scenes short and an interview with Bruce Lee, featuring some home video footage and some of Lee's philosophies on martial arts.  I enjoyed watching Lee teach his infant son how to do kicks, but could have done without the syrupy aggrandizing of Lee's wife.<br />As with most martial arts films, don't watch this expecting much in the way of plot.  Watch it for Lee.  He really is awe-inspiring.ot to be the punching bags.

B00005R2M3|3.0|I had heard of Shakira many times living in the Los Angeles area. How could I not, right? I had seen her face on the MTV Movie awards and on many signs around this fine city. However when I bought a cd or two I liked what I heard in Spanish. <br />I feel bad for her, believing what someone told her about changing everything in order to make it in the American market. It's more sad that she gave up her roots in order to appeal to the masses. <br />My admission: I bought this cd only for the Suerte, the Spanish version of Whenever, Wherever which is by far a more beautiful song in Spanish. And my cd player play the MTV Unplugged instead.

B00005OM4N|5.0|When I first heard the single &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; I thought it was pretty weird and I was afraid I'd be disappointed in the CD. But as a Britney fan from the start, I bought the new album anyway. I don't regret it!! Britney's new album is great, her voice has really matured and the sound altogether is funkier and different from her last two albums. &quot;Boys&quot;, &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot; etc. are all cool songs. &quot;Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot; is a sort of ballad, slow and touching, while the other songs are great danceable tunes or pop &amp; rock. All in all, a CD worth getting. Brit's back!

B000002KNY|5.0|&quot;I Zimbra&quot; is a wild African rhythmic wonder complete with nonsense lyric chant which immediately announces a departure from the previous two Talking Heads discs. The new direction is marked  by that familiar frantic energy but now it doesn't sound so friendly. The first two were like great music for art school parties but FEAR OF MUSIC's atmospheres are menaced by paranoia, and FEAR. As if the very &quot;Air&quot; we breathe is not safe, and perhaps it isn't. But &quot;Air&quot; is a great song, great heavenly music and background voices and guitar. And so is &quot;Heaven&quot; even if it is &quot;is a place where nothing ever happens&quot;.  &quot;Drugs&quot; is perhaps the least Talking Heads sounding song. Certainly the most Eno crafted.  An Eno created environment with great slowed down Heads rhythm section, and Byrne tentatively exploring his new surroundings which are both ethereal and primordial(Eno reptile and insect noises in background).  Perhaps Eno cages the band a bit too much in his ideas. I like this disc but always look forward to once again hearing the more accessible Heads albums after this one.<br />This disc came out in '79, the same year as Bowie's Lodger. Both were produced by Eno &amp; both reveal Eno's fascination with Africa and sound collage which would appear later in more advanced form on the Byrne/Eno My Life in the Bush of Ghosts.<br />Just like some people didn't like what Eno did with Bowie's pop, so there are plenty of people that feel he shouldn't have messed with Talking Heads sound.<br />If you play Remain in Light, &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; for instance, after this disc it will sound very liberating. Much more alive and in touch with both Heads own roots and the world at large. And even more alive is the very live disc, THE NAME OF THIS BAND IS TALKING HEADS. There &quot;I Zimbra&quot; and &quot;Drugs&quot;(funked up with great guitar part) as well as &quot;Memories Can't Wait&quot; and &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; removed from the studio come alive and find their true form along with all the other great Headtunes of the first four discs.quot; removed from the studio come alive and find their true form along with all the other great Headtunes of the first four discs.
0790737973|1.0|I did not like this movie and that has nothing to do with the fact that i read the book.<br />This movie is a failure because the director failed to capture the notion of hysteria. What you get is small amounts of confusions.<br />The story is about the unknown, and confusion would mean that people are not sure about certain things. Following what the SPHERE is supposed to do and be, everything is possible and anything can happen. There should be hysteria.<br />The movies makes attempts at greatness, but falls short because of minor issues. For example, toward the end, three survivors are being held for debriefing, and you see the sub-title Day One on the screen. For affect, shouldn't it say Day three. Then the viewer would think, wow, three days, in a room, with nothing to do, wow. Instead, we see, day one, and then the movie is over.
078322608X|5.0|Yes, it is science fiction that drives the plot of this powerful and often mind bending film. But it is the magnificant performances of the three main cast members that make me say absolutely see this movie. When I watched Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt create their characters, Willis the sane man who everyone (eventually even himself) believes is crazy, and Pitt the insane man who everyone (including himself) believes is a genius, my thought while I watched the story unfold was &quot;what brilliant acting!&quot; But later, when the movie ended and the dust settled in my mind, I realized that the performance of Madeleine Stowe far eclipsed even those of the other great actors. Her performance was so incredibly real as the psychiatrist who was trying to put together the pieces of the time paradox puzzle - first terrified of Willis and trying to convince him that he was crazy and needed help, and then trying harder to convince him that he was not crazy and they all needed HIS help - her performance was so real that during the movie, I never even considered the possibility that she was acting! It wasn't till the movie was over that I realized how perfect a job she had actually done. Yes, 5 stars for 12 monkeys - but the 5th star belongs to Madeleine Stowe.

0345448898|5.0|I had really given up on fantasy--I was really tired of rehashed Lord of the Rings take-offs and never-ending series a la Wheel of Time, et al.  An Amazon.com email showed up in my inbox (which I don't even usually read) about &quot;The Golden Compass.&quot;  It intrigued me enough to order the first book, and suddenly I was hooked!  This was some of the best fantasy I'd read in YEARS!  Original, fresh, yet not too out there--it was vaguely reminiscent of some of Connie Willis's longer works, but from an 11-year old's point of view (for the record, I'm 32).  I can't recommend this highly enough, especially to people who are getting tired of &quot;traditional&quot; fantasy.
B000002H2Z|5.0|In my opinion, this is simply the best album by the Cure. Drummer Boris Williams joins the line up on this album, and is an extreme improvement over Lol Tolhurst who moved to keyboards. \\"In Between Days\\" is the closest to pop perfection that Robert Smith has ever been, and \\"The Baby Screams\\" and \\"Screw\\" are way ahead of 1985. If these songs were played on the radio today, they would be instant hits. \\"Close to Me\\" is such a catchy song that can't help but make you want to dance around the room and clap your hands along. And for you Christians out there, \\"The Blood\\" is not blasphemous. Robert wrote it about a drink called The Blood of Christ that got him really drunk. This album would be flawless if it weren't for the unnecessary \\"Push.\\" What Robert was thinking when he wrote that, I don't know. But since every Cure album has one really annoying song, this completely fits the formula. Why are you wasting time reading this? Go out and buy it!
B00005LOUP|2.0|Why is it that Hollywood moviemakers seem incapable of understanding the simple fact that works that start off as drawing art (be they in the form of stills or animated cartoons) have a tough time translating to the live action format?  It didn't work with \\"The Flintstones,\\" for instance, and it works even less well with \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\\" Ron Howard's labored and lumbering attempt to bring the whimsical Dr. Seuss classic to the big screen.  Unlike the beloved half hour animated version made for television in the 1960's, this non-animated edition ends up burying the wise and witty tale under gobs of overproduction.  Despite the best efforts of the costume designers, set decorators and makeup artists in bringing the Grinch, the Whos and their village of Whoville to life on the screen, the sad fact is that what appears charming on the two-dimensional printed page can often become grotesque when transferred to the more three-dimensional world of live action filmmaking.<br />Even more detrimental than the film's garish visual style is the fact that the beautiful simplicity of the streamlined tale has been padded out and stretched to the breaking point to fulfill the demands of a 105-minute running time.  Although the film adheres fairly closely to the original plotting in its final third (even using a portentous recitation by Anthony Hopkins of Dr. Seuss' original rhyming text), the first hour or so is overloaded with dreary subplots involving the various Who characters, a silly flashback showing how the Grinch came to hate Christmas, and enough Jim Carrey shtick to make us wish he had never left \\"In Living Color\\" to embark on a movie career.  Much as I have loved Carrey in some of his earlier filmic efforts, I must say that his act is fast losing much of its original freshness and charm.  Not that he can be forced to shoulder all the responsibility for the film's failure, since the writers, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, have neglected to provide a single line of witty or creative dialogue to go along with the stunning makeup, art direction and special effects.  It's a particular embarrassment when the screenplay shifts between the soaring ingenuity of the Seuss poetry and the flatfooted triteness of the Price/Seaman prose.  The grinding of the gears becomes almost audible.<br />One wonders why an industry, which used to do so well by Christmas in the past (\\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" \\"Miracle on 34th Street,\\" the various versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\"), seems to have had so much trouble lately putting together a decent picture with a yuletide theme.  In fact, in the past 20 or so years, Hollywood has managed to produce only one film with a Christmas theme that can truly be called a certified classic.  I am speaking, of course, of the wonderful 1983 film, \\"A Christmas Story,\\" the only work that has been able to successfully combine the gentle cynicism of the modern world with the sweet sentimentality one traditionally associates with the holiday.  Perhaps that perennial delight will forever stand as the one exception to the cold crassness of overproduced and over-budgeted dreck like \\"Jingle All the Way,\\" \\"Santa Claus - the Movie\\" and \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\\" which, by their very nature, drain Christmas of its childlike magic and charm.

B00005QFF1|5.0|When is a piece of fluff not a piece of fluff? When it's directed by Zhang Yimou.<br />In any other hands, &quot;The Road Home&quot; would have been so light and breezy you would barely have noticed it was there. Fortunately, the credits say &quot;Directed by Zhang Yimou,&quot; and that makes all the difference in the world.<br />The story is very, very simple. Upon the sudden death of his father, a young man returns to the small Chinese village where he was born. As he attends to the details of the funeral, he recalls the often told story of his mother and father's romance, and we flash back 40 years to a simpler day.<br />The romance is hardly awe-inspiring. It is less of a romance than a silly young girl's (Di Zhao, played by Zhang Ziyi) silly crush on the new, young village school teacher. Di is soon finding any and all excuses to walk past the school house to hear the young man's voice and, perhaps, catch his eye.<br />That's it! Sorry! If you want more of a story, it isn't there!<br />But oh, what Yimou does with this simple story! First of all, he lays on the sentiment. Simple objects such as a hair clip, a broken bowl and a red cloth become the most important objects in the world. Secondly, Yimou frames each shot with incredible<BR>beauty and detail. The shot of Di leaning up against the door frame as the school teacher drops by for his first visit is unforgettable.<br />Most notably, Yimou has an unfailing instinct with his actors. In Raise the Red Lantern&quot; a large percentage of the story is told through Gong Li's facial expressions. In &quot;The Road Home&quot; most of the movie seems to be told simply by watching the eyes of Zhang<BR>Ziyi. (And what lovely eyes they are to watch!)<br />As with any Yimou movie, his attention to detail makes you feel as though you have actually been to China and you now understand these people and their particular place and time. And as with any Yimou movie, as it ended I found myself already impatiently<BR>awaiting the next cinematic voyage he will take me on.

B00005QK3W|4.0|At times Paul comes close to some of his best Beatle songs and that is about as good as anyone gets.  His very uneven solo career has marked highs and lows and this effort is one of his highs.  All this album lacks is maybe the polish that a little more time could have brought but his base guitar playing is once again exceptional and his melodies tuneful and engaging.  I found Your Loving Flame the best along with Magic and Lonely Road.  Spinning on an Axis and Rinse the Raindrops could have been left off for me.

B000001FS3|5.0|This was U2's best album- their zenith. Every song is excellent lyrically and musically (except for 'Bullet the blue sky' which seems out of place). It is an album that can emotionally grab you at every listen. The production by Brian Eno perfectly melds the sonic musical landscapes and the majestic word play (which was only hinted at with the cd &quot;The Unforgetable Fire&quot;).<BR>After this cd, in my opinion, U2's craft was fumbled due to overblown self importance and indulgences.<BR>Whereas Bob Dylan continued to make solid recordings with various peaks and valleys (and has repeaked with 'Love and Theft'), U2 experimentalized themselves out of my favor. Nonetheless, this is a must have cd, for all collections.

Of course it is full running fiction...but I like a movie that i can watch for pure entertainment reasons.  There is no reason to get a movie if you are going to worry about how unrealistic it was later.  And of course it was unrealistic....it's scfi/fiction...it is suspose to be that way.  If you would like to entertained for the purpose of being entertained...then get this movie.  It is a good family movie.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|My nephew brought this over one night and begged to watch it. He fell asleep but I was curious, so I watched it. This is a great movie that sort of throws all the other classic tales out the window. Involved in the story are Shrek, his donkey, a man wanting to be king, and a princess named Fiona. Shrek is forced to go and resque Fiona from her prison/or castle guarded by a huge dragon. As they near her new home, the donkey discovers Fiona has a horrible secret that could bring her and Shrek together. Shrek overhears and goes to get the king, angry at her for keeping it a secret. At the marriage ceremony, the secret is reveiled and Fiona and Shrek live together, happily ever after, of course.

0375500901|2.0|I couldn't wait for this novel to end.  I don't forsee the need to hire any assasins in the near future, but I know who I wouldn't want to hire if I needed any.  All the plot twists and their eventual consequences were predictable.  There was the reappearance of a former lover that triggered the main tragedy in the protagonist's life propeling him into retirement, there was the Boss who manipulated the protagonist in his own secret agenda, there was the protagonist coming out of retirement for one last revenge, there was the bad guy with a potentially fatal condition, it just goes on.  I didn't care for any of the characters nor could I see what made them special as assasins. A main plot twist develops because the assasins can't bug a bad guy's apartment without nearly getting caught but still tipping him off.  The female protagonist couldn't hide her emotions from the bad guy, but the scheme hinges on her abilities as a pro.  The book is like a car with a sticky gas pedal, it speeds up then slows down, endlessly.  The epilogue has no redeeming characteristics.  There's lots better out there.  Look at some of the espionage Lists on Amazon.

It did not have the realistic look like the other dinosaurs did.  I was disapointed in it.  But other than that it was great.  I can't wait for the DVD boxed Trilogy to come out later in Dec.  THAT is on my Christmas list.<br />   To have Sam neil back in it was great.  And they did a good job with all the other actors they picked...they did a good job together.  You got to see alot more of different dinosaurs, which was great.  I love the petradon house...(enormous bird cage).  that whole scene was great.  this movie made me jump once...I laughed....and watched twice in a row.  The whole Jurassic park thing is great.  I hope now that maybe the Jurassic park series might be over (which I hope not) that hollywood doesn't let the dinosuar thing die....it would be a shame.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Excellent movie.  Austrailian Russell Crowe convinces me he is a Roman general and a good one at that.  This movie is as historically accurate as Hollywood gets.<BR>    The Emperor Commodus probably did not have inner child issues portrayed here, but they are well done.  <BR>    The Gladiatorial arena is very vividly and accurately portrayed.  Also the battle scenes are the best ever done.  I think a Roman legionary watching this movie would think that the Roman Army in was for real here.<BR>    For lovers of history and tragedy, gladiator is your movie.  Take a trip back to the dark side of Rome and the dream that Marcus Aurelius had for it and the nightmare his son Commodus made.<BR>    For lovers of old movies, this is sort of a redoing of &quot;Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; with Alec Guiness and Steven Boyd.  It follows a similar story line, but at the same time it is a different movie.<BR>    A+ all around, see this movie!!!!  It was the best.
B00003CXAA|3.0|I don't know what the wait was for.  Yes, Godfather 1 is the best movie ever made.  That said, buy the video tape.  The picture quality on the DVD is abysmal -- especially since they force you to buy all three movies.  The blacks are spotty and grain can be seen throughout.  I assumed that the DVD was delayed so they could clean up the print.  Obviously not.  Save your money, buy the tape -- its much better quality.
B00004Z459|5.0|If I could rate this CD a 10 I would. Its Staind,Limp Bizkit,and Def Tones all packed in a 12 song CD. BUY IT!!!
B00003CXAA|4.0|The Godfather trilogy is a great DVD set and has a bonus disc jammed packed with extra scenes, pictures, interviews, that will take you all night to watch.  The sound is excellent, I don't have a digital TV so I can really tell a definitive difference between the visuals, although for the most part the DVD's looked excellent, especially in pan scan format.  I liked the commentary by Francis Ford Copolla in the 2 Channel Dolby Surround format, with his comments on the events of the movie, while the movie is playing in the background, such as when Michael goes to see his father in the hospital, to create suspense, they wanted shots of empty hallways, but since they were pressed for time and money they put in the ends of scenes, like when Michael walked up the steps, the empty steps scene was frozen and placed later in the scene for suspense. My only problem with the DVD set is that there are scratches in the video, they didn't clean it up enough, so it looks like the beginning of a movie in a theater. This doesn't last the whole movie though, it comes and goes, and when it goes, it is a perfect picture.  Conclusion, great DVD, great Extras, Some Problems, Overall, worth the Amazon.com price.
0345350499|5.0|I loved this book. So many wonderful aspects. Romance, adventure, history... and on and on... Evokes every emotion while you read it. Wonderful story you won't forget, and you must re read and re read
B000009RXY|1.0|This video is an absolute waste of money--flush your money down the toilet instead.  Poor video quality, with less than 30 minutes devoted to the Apollo 13 flight.  The rest of the video is even worse.  Probably the worst documentary I've ever had the displeasure of watching.
B00005QK3W|4.0|When I first listened to this record, I was disappointed.   I liked most of Flaming Pie and Run Devil Run the first time I listened to them.    The only songs I liked immediately here were &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; and &quot;Freedom&quot;.   But then I listened a couple more times and &quot;Lonely Road&quot;, &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, &quot;Your Way&quot;, and &quot;Magic&quot; became favorites.   I listened some more and now I really like &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot;.  After some more listens, who knows?  Maybe the others will grow on me too.   Only two tracks I can't stand are &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; and &quot;Riding into Jaipur&quot;.  Do yourself a favor and listen to the whole thing a couple times.
B000002MUW|5.0|Forget the dreadful EROTICA, musical EVITA, or even the electronic RAY OF LIGHT, BEDTIME STORIES is Madonna's best album of the '90's. She proved in '94 that she too could do R&amp;B, and do it well. BEDTIME STORIES is her most consistant and her most appealing album. It's filled with laid-back, smooth R&amp;B grooves. Lyrically, Madonna sounds clearer than she's ever been. She's sings with smooth confidence, self-assurance, and even vulnerability. BEDTIME STORIES is also filled with creamy ballads. They're so smooth and sweet, you'll take a second look to see if it's really Madonna singing. Her smash hit &quot;take a bow&quot; and &quot;inside of me&quot; are perfect examples. The track &quot;bedtime story&quot; is also a nice surprise. It's a weird, techno track produced by Bjork. That song was the bridge to RAY OF LIGHT and set Madonna off into a new sound. BEDTIME STORIES is the perfect chill-out cd.
6303832563|5.0|No words can express the bundle of feelings and emotions that stem from watching every single image and breathing every individual melody from the music score of Koyaanisqatsi. I happened to see it fifteen years ago and its still in my mind. The film also works as a reflection of our relationship with nature and the way human beings are dramatically changing the planet for the worse. A piece of art worthy to be revisited once again to revive our internal child and look inside ourselves. Please, release it on DVD as soon as possible.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|I had never before seen the Furtwngler Don Giovanni, but I knew that it was considered by many to be one of the greatest productions of this much loved opera. This production was filmed shortly after its wildly successful run in Salzburg, Austria in 1953. It has lost none of its appeal nearly a half century later. This is the most rivetting account I have ever seen, live or on video, of Mozart's &quot;dramma giocoso&quot;, which in this production definitely tilts towards the &quot;dramma&quot; aspect. The singing is fabulous from all members of this stellar cast assembled in the early 1950s. The Wiener Philharmoniker plays with a real feeling for this opera under Furtwngler. Indeed, this is a highly atmospheric production on all levels. Cesare Siepe is regarded as one of the all-time great Giovannis, and you will see and most importantly hear why in his highly dramatic portrayal of the lascivious don. Siepe not only sings the part flawlessly, but he can truly act, too. The final act will have you on the edge of your seat, to be sure. After brazenly lunging at the statue of the Commendatore with a knife, he recoils in terror when his action has no effect. After a brief moment of fear, he regains his composure and defiance.  The emotions of Giovanni are conveyed by Sierpe in the most subtle of ways, a gesture here, a facial expression there, and of course via his singing. I'm sure everyone reading this knows the rest of the story, but you may be surprised at how brilliantly Siepe brings it all about, with his actions as much as his singing. I found myself feeling much more sympathetic towards the doomed Giovanni in this production than I have in most others, and that is entirely due to Siepe's brilliant portrayal. The rest of the cast is equally or very nearly as strong as its lead character. I watched this performance in utter amazement from start to finish, and cannot recommend it highly enough.  It is in color, although the colors are on the pale side (not a problem!) and the sound format is in a high-quality mono (please don't let that steer you away from this masterpiece!).  The sets are very realistic, and unlike many other operas on DVD, the picture is clear and the color excellent even in the night scenes (of which there are many in this opera). Included is a very informative booklet that gives background of this production as well as a summary of the opera. The picture format is 4:3, so it will fill your entire screen, and the playing time is 177 minutes. Subtitles are in English, Italian, Spanish, French German and Chinese. This is an opera DVD not to be missed, as it captures a historic performance that is nothing short of stunning.  I would definitely rank this Don Giovanni in the top 5 best operas on DVD that I have seen.

B000050IE6|5.0|Opeth #4 continues the quality of their first 3 releases. Production sound is closer to &quot;Morningrise&quot; than &quot;MAYH&quot;. Unpredictable as always, their sound is not one you will tire of. Just load up all their cds and take off on a journey to the center of your mind...
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears is by the far MEGA-star of teen music today. Not just by popularity, but for her choice in music. 'Britney' is by far her most revealing and incredible albums, although it doesn't all flow in one direction. She tells us so many things that we often forget which one she is or which one to believe. But it is clear that Britney has done wonderfully with this. Her change in direction has taken a great path both musically and in her image. The best songs on here are definitely 'Slave,' 'Lonely,' 'Cinderella,' and 'What Its Like to Be Me.' Britney never ceases to amaze me and I can't wait for what she has in store for us next. My only complaint would be how short it is.
0786915749|5.0|From the first few chapters, anyone can tell that Weis and Hickman know what they're doing.  Incredible battle scenes, a growing intruigue and subtle sparks of humor make this book stand out from all others, at least that I've read.  If you haven't read it, buy it right away!  You will not be disappointed!  If you have read it, by all means, read it again.  This is a story that should be re-told again and again.
1558216847|5.0|This book is amazing, although catagorised under adventrue and escape this does not sum up the book. Telling the story of a group of POWs who walked over 3000 miles to freedom during WW2, it talks about courage, survival, and friendship. An inspriational tale.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I have always thought of myself as \\"open-minded\\", but this album (which I at first thought was (disappointing)) forced me to open it further.  It's amazing that there is such a HUGE gap between \\"white\\" music and \\"black\\" music.  And it takes an amazingly versatile band to bridge it.  No one who truly appreciates the value of well-crafted songs can dismiss the songwriting on this album.  I think the only things which can get in the way are the typical mental hangups: \\"This is too experimental and mixed up\\", \\"This is too techno\\", \\"When will they be normal again?\\", etc.  I have to admit that in THEORY I am open to rap, hip-hop, and techno, but I never really listen to it; I dismiss it as shallow.  Pop opened up a whole new world of sound for me; I don't think I ever really knew anything about rhythm and how awesome it can be!  The songs on this album are like heavy, heavy drugs.  It is a whole new world.  And once you get past the mental hangups, you are in for a treat: incredibly intense and pleasurable music with brilliant lyrics.  After this, most music sounds dull and boring.  <br />In general, one of U2's great strengths has been mood.  No matter what they are writing about, they are emotionally honest and the sounds always serve the purpose of creating the perfect background for it.  And on this album, the techno/trip-hop/funky sounds are perfect for the desolation, confusion, and darkness they are trying to express.  The sound couldn't have been any other way.  The people who don't like this album most likely come from one of two angles: they either typically don't like this type of music so don't like it anyway (this is like if you don't like country, you won't like country sounding songs no matter how good they are) or do like this type of music and just don't like this album because U2 are the ones doing it (in which case if you gave them a blind taste-test, they might have really thought it was great).  Either way, like I said, it is simply a brilliant albumif you truly enjoy the art of music and aren't afraid to leave labels behind (of either \\"U2\\" or \\"techno\\").<br />\\"Discotheque\\" at first sounded like the tackiest song on earth, but you get hooked after you realize the song totally ROCKS due to Edge's five different guitar styles.  And when you get the humor of the apt yet tongue-in-cheek lyrics: \\"you know you're chewing bubble gum, you know what that is but you still want some, you just can't get enough of that lovey-dovey stuff\\", it becomes a really enjoyable song.<br />\\"Do You Feel Loved\\" is an extremely desperate, bitter, and sexual song that asks all of us living in this pleasure-seeking society a pointed question.<br />\\"Mofo\\" is at once one of the weirdest and brilliant songs I have ever heard.  It is at first the scariest because it is the most techno/strange sounding.  But it is musically loud, fast-paced and furious.  A truly intense sensation for the ears.  Adam's bassline pumps it up so fast your heart starts beating in anticipation and Edge's screaming guitar bursts forth on one of the most hard-hitting songs you will ever hear.  But I guess most startling are the unexpected lyrics dealing with Bono's mother, search for God, etc.  The serious, angry, desolate lyrics and the (at first trashy sounding) furious music set each other off perfectly.<br />A lot of people didn't like \\"Miami\\" but the addictive hip-hop rhythms and the completely heavy, almost sexual guitar are such a perfect juxtaposition.<br />\\"The Playboy Mansion\\" was probably the only song I liked right away.  Musically it is a really mellow song.  (It's funny, after hearing this album, I really \\"get\\" a lot of phrases I've heard for years: \\"groove\\", \\"rhythm\\", \\"mellow\\").  Lyrically, it at first just sounds like a clever and funny song; by the end, however, it has taken you somewhere completely different and you emerge with a sense of sad beauty (I don't know how the hell they do stuff like that!).<br />\\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" is a really transcendent, mental song.  Bono's voice and lyrics are so intimate, you feel he is standing 2 inches away from you; you can almost feel his breath.  Edge's guitar is beautifl and subtle (few musicians make use of subtlety the way Edge does).  The music keeps expanding in a haunting and atmospheric way until you are enveloped in it.<br />One of the greatest things about U2 is that they are practically the only band you need; any kind of mood you are in, they can give you.  If you ever feel sad or angry, this album is an amazing trancelike drug trip that hits the spot.  And I think this album proves that not only are U2 an open-minded, ever-innovative, fresh, relevant band, but that they can go into any genre and master it.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Every once in a while, a group of musicians gathers and the members are able to bring out the best in each other.  In the  20th Century, it was men like Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein; John, Paul, Ringo, and George; Mick Jagger and Co.; Bono, The Edge, Larry and Adam.  And now as we move into the 21st Century, the members of Radiohead are doing the same thing. These are artists in the truest sense of the word who understand what you can do when you combine music with thought and add in more than just a little inspiration and willingness to strive for something new.  Radiohead is the most innovative band of our times.  This album, like &quot;Kid A&quot; may be a little too creative at times for some, in that the melodies and or lyrics may at times go over your head. You really have to pay attention when listening to Radiohead, just as when you're listening to Beethoven or Brahms.  If not Classical, this is classic music in every sense of the word. While &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot; were good rockers, beginning with &quot;OK Computer,&quot; Radiohead has been turning out groundbreaking albums.  Pop in one of their CD's, crank up the volume, and listen to some real masters at work. This is everything rock music can and should be.
0780624890|3.0|Blade could have been really good. However, the writers and directors of this film decided to focus on lots of gross, gratuitous gore than on real action. I must admit, the opening is truely awesome. It's probably one of the best action sequences I've seen. After that, though, Blade goes down hill, with only one other cool action scene (which isn't all that great.) With Blade's cool arsenal, including shotguns, automatic pistols, stake launchers, and a katana, and his skill in martial arts, Blade could have been an action masterpiece. I would have also liked to see the katana used more often. Blade isn't a disaster, though. The previously mentioned opening rocks, there are a few suspenful moments, and I like the movie's stylish visual tone. If you're an action fan who isn't squemish or sensitive, you might want to check Blade out. If you're a gore addict, you'll surely enjoy this. Either way, there is more action and better action in many more films.
B00005QG9J|3.0|After having been unexpectedly overwhelmed by the sharp lyrics, the intriguing melodies, and strong production of Incubus' &quot;Make Yourself&quot; album, I couldn't wait for &quot;Morning View&quot; to hit the stores. Unfortunately, this album doesn't quite reach the standards set in the band's previous release.  The songs are still a little more literate than most bands out there today, it's just that there doesn't seem to be as much here to pull you in and grab you until the final track, &quot;Aqueous Transmission.&quot;  While die-hard Incubus fans will enjoy this, I don't think this album is as destined to be a classic as &quot;Make Yourself&quot; is.
0671006932|3.0|John Steinbeck writing exemplifies economical and efficient writing. <br />The storyline as a whole lacks appeal although the setting is interesting. <br />Definitely not worthwhile if you are looking for characters that are good examples for character building. Not recommended for children owing to the deficiency in its moral values.
B000002JPA|4.0|Aside from perhaps Opeth's &quot;Orchid&quot;, this is one of the most unique albums I've got. I'd heard a lot about Dream Theater, but I really wasn't too sure what too expect. I saw this album in passing and to this day I'm glad I've bought it. The song structures are very long and complex, the music being very deep and rich. This isn't blow you away music, you have to work with it. But that is not a critism. If you take a look at quite a few of the albums in my list of favourites you'll see that I wasn't particularly blown away by more than one of them. And quite a few albums really impressed me when I first heard them and now they get played quite rarely. If you don't expect an album to blow you away, eventually it will.<br />I'd also heard quite a lot about John Petrucci, the guitarist in this band. He certainly knows what he's doing. He's up there with the greats but (along with other metal widdle-meisters like Zakk Wylde) he doesn't get the full recognition that he should simply because he doesn't play mainstream accessible music. Kevin Moore is a great keyboard player as well. Mike Portnay is a great drummer and James LaBrie? I wasn't expecting to hear such a good voice!<br />I will admit that they do have moments that I strongly dislike. Although I've gotten used to it, &quot;Another Day&quot; is just so cheesy. Surrounded isn't much better. Still, the likes of Pull Me Under, Take The Time and Metropolis make up for it. I also like the &quot;keyboards and vocals only&quot; track, &quot;Wait For Sleep&quot;. I am very impressed with this album and I certainly intend to buy more by this band in the future.
0140340203|5.0|&quot;The Witches&quot; begins with a short warning about witches--what they look like, how they act, etc.--, but the seven-year-old orphan boy who tells this story learns all about witches from his Norwegian grandmother--and, later, from firsthand experience.<br />His first meeting with a witch is in his own backyard in Kent, England. She tries to coax him out of his tree house with a snake, but he recognizes her as a witch by her gloves and purple-tinted eyes and refuses to leave.<br />The second time he meets a witch (actually, several witches), he isn't so lucky. This happens when he and his grandmother go to the Hotel Magnificent in Bournemouth so his grandmother can recover from pneumonia. The hotel they stay in is also the meeting place of several other English witches who are masquerading as members of the RSPCC (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Children). Leading the convention is the Grand High Witch, the most evil and powerful witch alive.<br />The young boy accidentally overhears the entire meeting of the witches and their terrible plan to exterminate all the children in the world by poisoning their candy. He even witnesses their mouse-transforming experiment on a young boy named Bruno Jenkins. And before the meeting ends, he's discovered and changed into a mouse as well.<br />Although they're hopelessly small to physically stop the witches, they aim to outwit them with the help of the boy's grandmother--and a stolen bottle of Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker.<br />This was the first book by Roald Dahl I ever read and is still my favorite. I remember reading it dozens of times when I was a kid; it was that good. I highly recommend it to all 8 to 12-year-olds.<br />I saw the movie several years later and thought it was all right, but not as good as the book. The movie's ending was too happy-ever-after, not that the book's ending was any better though. (It felt like there should be a sequel.) Nevertheless, I would still recommend the movie--right after you read the book, of course.
B00004T40X|5.0|I don't know if I can forgive myself. When I first heard this album I thought it was a bit average. Well played of course, but average. Then it grew and grew on me, until it dawned that this is in fact one of those rare gems in music. Every single song is memorable, and I mean that sincerely.<br />This band have their almost poppy moments but I am very pleased with this album. The vocalist and keyboard player Tony is very good at both his feilds, while the guitarist sure knows what he's doing as well. The bass player is a little drowned, but the drummer is fast and precise. This band are power metal though (albeit a softer form than Blind Guardian or Manowar); if you bought this on the Dream Theater comparisons you may be a little let down. I was expecting it to be more intricate and epic and a little less accessible. The comparisons simply are not justified as Sonata Arctica don't have the depth, variation or, well, many other things that Dream Theater have. They don't even SOUND like DT, neither should they try to. I guess that's why I didn't realise its brilliance at first. This album simply rocks hard - it doesn't try to do anything else. Tracks like Full Moon, Blank File, Kingdom For A Heart and Letter To Dana are so well executed that you constantly sing in your head and they stay lodged there all day.<br />This is worth it, even for the import. Fortunately, I didn't have to pay much extra because I live in England, but nonetheless I recommend you splash out on it. It's a great album, and it deserves more credit than it gets.
0385505833|1.0|I expected another John Grisham mystery. Instead I found a predictable and ridiculous short story whose sole purpose seems to be to generate holiday related sales.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I just have to say that Shakira is the best. With this new release, she is becoming number 1 on MTV and Billboard. The CD is great. Her music is a mix of pop, rock, and even regional styles like mexican, brazilian, arabic, and a mix of Andes Mountains' music. You can see these mixes in her single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;. This song is great in Spanish too. This song is just sooooooo natural. It makes you feel in contact with nature. Not just this song, but the whole CD. She's 24 and she writes her own lyrics and even plays instruments in her songs. She has a great voice. It just makes me feel good and relaxed.
0385505833|5.0|I,ve been looking for a book that caught my attention and this book did that! I can hardly wait to recieve it.
0385505833|4.0|Every Christmas I read one book with a Holiday theme.  This year I chose Grisham's little ornament of a book, and I am glad I did.  It has all of the necessary ingredients: humor, love, gratitude, all stirred in with likeable &quot;Grisham&quot; characters.  Invest a few hours of your time, and you will get the same feeling you got the first time you read, and understood, Dicken's holiday classic.  Well, not quite but almost! Merry Christmas to all the Grisham fans out there.
B00005R2M3|1.0|Shakira used 2 b my favorite singer. When she first came out with Pies Descalzos. She was \\"diferent\\". She was a young girl who claimed to write all the songs she was singing. (...). Her voice was something I had never heard in the HISPANIC music industry. (...)<br />Then she met the Estefan. She recorded Donde estan Los Ladrones? I noticed something in this album. The song Bruta, Ciega, Sordomuda was far too stupid to be coming from the same composer who wrote wrote Quiero (just to mention one of her previous album). I think it was a good album too but something was bothering me.<br />Then she came up with MTV Unplugged, which was the same album of \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones?\\" but acoustic. Only Estoy Aqui of the Album PD appeared in this \\"Unplugged\\". Kind of weird, ah!!<br />By now she had  her hair red. That kind of shocked me but didn't bothered me because she kept the image of a very normal girl.<br />(...). She's compared with Britney S. Shakira says \\"she feels flattered for such comparison\\". PLEASE!!! Donde Esta \\"Shakira\\"?<br />The gigantic publicity behind her and herself claim Shakira is the songwriter of her songs in English. \\"She's the producer of all her music\\", according to them, too. <br />Anyway, I gave this Laundry Service one star because of the publicity given to it. <B>This cd lacks of any protest song about social issues.</B> I like some of the songs like, Suerte (yes, in spanish), Fool. Although she gets anoying at times, trying to impress with her vocal changes or whatever...<br />If it were Britney S. the one who recorded this album I would give her a 2 1/5 star or maybe more. However, coming from Shakira (the one that I first knew about), I give only 1 star.<br />I declare myself a former fan of this artist. I wish her the best with all her endeveours because after all she's just another human being.
B00004Z459|5.0|When I first got this CD.  I really wasn't sure about it.  But as I listened to it more, it really grew on me.  Each song has a completely different style.  Also, every song also has a completly diffenrent subject and feeling to it.  To top it all off the mixture of Mike Shinoda's rapping and Chester Bennington's singing really make a good mix to listen to.  If these guys can keep it up, I think they can become really big.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I was surprised that there was actually an Enigma greatest hits, I never expected it.  Same thing with Type O Negative's greatest hits.  The songs on this album are all amazing, from the erotic to the moving.  My favorite will have to be &quot;Gravity Of Love&quot; which is just jaw-dropping how that girl sings.  You won't regret buying this album.
1558807381|3.0|I like fantasy films and would give Legend a higher rating except that a lot of the footage originally produced was cut from the final film.<br />I heard 25 minutes or so of Legend footage was deleted from the American version of the movie, but remained in the British version.<br />Does anyone know what happened?
B00003CXXI|1.0|This movie was a PG-rated animated version of &quot;Something About Mary.&quot; (Note the Cameron Diaz similarity.) Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed &quot;Something About Mary.&quot;  My point is that &quot;Shrek&quot; is being marketed for children, but it really isn't appropriate for children.  The &quot;PG&quot; rating is definitely there for a reason.  It is not &quot;G&quot; material.  It contains bathroom humor and sexual innuendo that is entirely inappropriate for children.  I suggest that parents view this movie alone before letting your children watch it. I am glad that I rented and didn't buy.  It's not a classic.
B00005OAIE|3.0|If I was not familiar with Mayer before hearing &quot;RFS&quot;, I'm sure I would have been blown away--his voice, the lyrics, the overall quality of the album is impressive.<BR>My favorite track is &quot;3 x 5&quot;, and I'm thrilled it was added to the Columbia release (it was not featured on the album of the same title released by Aware Records).  &quot;Why Georgia&quot; is a song anyone in their early twenties can relate to--the uncertainty of the future is something pressing on this soon-to-be college graduate's mind!  &quot;City Love&quot; and &quot;St. Patrick's Day&quot; require repeated listening before they catch on--while I initially didn't like them, they're both favorites now.<BR>However, the album pales in comparison to Mayer's live performances.  A fan of acoustic singer-songwriters, I have enjoyed seeing Mayer live, accompanied by bassist Dela.<BR>It's a quality album, I recommend buying and enjoying it (especially for someone new to his music), however, I encourage you to catch a show after you listen to it.  It's ten times better to see him live.
0385484518|5.0|\\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\" is an unusual book. Technically it is about a man dying, yet it teaches you how to live. And the lessons taught in this book are all beautiful!<br />We meet Mitch Alblom, a sports writer for the Detroit Free Press and his old professor from college, Morrie Schwartz. Mitch and Morrie had an unusual close relationship while Mitch was in college. On his graduation day Mitch gave Morrie a very nice leather briefcase. Morrie had tears in his eyes, when he asked \\"Will you stay in touch?\\". Mitch promised to do so. A promise he did not keep.<br />And it wasn't till 20 odd years later, now, a somewhat famous (at least well known) sports-writer, he is in a hotel, zapping through the different TV stations, that he sees his old professor on a TV-show; Nightline with Ted Koppel. He is now an old man, just diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). [This a neurotical disease, which slowly kills you. First you loose your balance, then the ability to walk, next you cannot lift your legs, then the arms and at last it hits the lungs and you suffocate.]<br />Mitch decides to pay his old college teacher a visit. This is the start to what will be their weekly meetings. For each \\"class\\" they set a topic to discuss (death, family, marriage etc.). My favourite scene from the book is at the end, when we all know that Morrie will soon die, and Mitch and Morrie are saying goodbye. Reading this, I just gave up on holding back the tears.<br />I laughed and cried my way through this book, and my only complaint is that the book isn't longer. I have had (still have) my own Morrie (Ms. Syring, from the Norwegian School of Management). I know for sure that I wouldn't have made it through college without her. So, when I found this book, I knew I had to buy her one as well.<br />We both recommend this book!
B00003CXXI|5.0|There really aren't many words to describe &quot;Shrek.&quot; It is great for both kids and adults. The extended ending on the VHS/DVD versions was absolutely hilarious!!!!!! In my opinion, Eddie Murphy steals the show as the heart-melting Donkey who struggles to attain a place in Shrek's heart. At a glance, Shrek seems like a cruel old ogre, but once you get to know him, you realize that he's just an angry, insecure creature who is just looking for love. He finds just that when the lovely Princess Fiona comes into his life. The two of them have many ups and downs, but in the end, their love for each other and their understanding of one another's pasts brings them together for life. This is one movie you don't want to miss--it's got sensitivity, humor, action, adventure, and so much more. Don't miss this one!
0783882963|3.0|I picked up this book in Singapore when it was first released, while it was a lot of praise for Arundhati Roy's &quot;God of Small Things&quot; in the press. In the end this book won the Booker Price.<br />The author has chosen an interesting approach to this novel. There are many stories in the story, and to confuse us even more the author chose a flashback narrating style. We enter the story in the 1990'ies as the young woman named Rahel returns to her village (in a small town in Kerala, in India) to be reunited with her twin brother Esthahappen (shortened Estha), whom she hasn't seen in many years. (That being said, the story in \\"God of Small Things\\" is set for the most part during the 1960'ies.)<br />Two of the lead characters are the fraternal twins Estha and Rahel. They are bonded (unusually) close, so close that they think of themselves as \\"Me\\", and when separated as \\"We\\" or \\"Us\\", this to their family's great frustration. Told from the childrens' point of view, the story centers on the story of the twins' childhood, the tragic death of their English cousin, why Estha stopped speaking, to mention something, but not too much.<br />There are many interesting characters in this book, and several of them has a great potential, such as Grandma Mammachi, Grandaunt Baby Kochamma, the handyman Velutha (another important character), Ammu etc. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, few of them are very well developed.<br />It is not often I almost put a book away (I have a thing for \\"must finish\\" what's been started), but this one I almost gave up. Arundhati Roy's prose and writing style is unusual, and I found it charming (in small doses) and I enjoyed this novel for its' prose more than for the story.  I was never sure where the author was headed with the story. This left me confused. On top of that, I am sure that I missed some of the metaphors, as well. Come to think of it, the same thing happened when I read Rushdie's \\"Satanic Verses\\". Maybe it is just me not getting the Indo-English writing style?ing the Indo-English writing style?
0446677450|4.0|This book is great. But it is about ideas. It is about changing the way that you think about money, investing, and debt. It will not make you rich. Kiyosaki does not give you a formula or specific sequence of steps to become rich, but he is helping the common person (like me) get away from being only seen as a consumer. The idea that most helped me was the notion that your home is not an asset. He is not stating that you should not purchase a home, but he wants us to get away from the idea that when we get a raise or better paying job, we should puchase a new, more expensive house to get a tax break. A house is not an asset. It does not put money in your pocket if you had no other source of income.<br />The book is a quick read and has good ideas.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Many music artists like to claim they are taking big \\"risks\\" with an upcoming album, possibly because they believe it increases publicity. <br />     For example: Britney Spears said she was going to sound \\"edgier\\" on her new cd \\"Britney\\", because she uses words like \\"damn\\" and \\"hell\\" on some tracks, but this doesn't actually mean shes taking a risk. <br />     On her new cd, \\"Missundaztood\\", Pink is taking a different kind of risk entirely, a creative risk, a real risk, a risk that may keep some of her songs from getting onto TRL, which is a very great risk to some artists nowadays. There is substance in her songs, content that is very rare to find in radio-friendly singers, and this has instantly set her apart from \\"being compared to Britney Spears\\" or the rest of the TRL regulars, which is what Pink intended in the first place. <br />     Her first single, \\"Get the Party Started\\", is only one of the types of music styles she uses on the album. There's rock (\\"18 Wheeler\\"), blues (\\"Misery\\"), and even what may be called Lilith-Fair style rock (\\"Lonely Girl\\"). I personally think the best, and bravest, song on the CD is the last track, \\"My Vietnam\\", about the Vietnam War that took place throughout the 60's and early 70's. It's so different, musically and lyrically, that its refreshing. The muffled sound of helicopters and bombs in the beginning reminds us of the intense horrors of the Vietnam War, many which have stayed with the veterans of that war, like Pink's father. It is also the most honest song, besides \\"Family Portrait\\", on the album and possibly the one most people will not understand. It is a comparisson between life and war, Pink's childhood being much like a war. <br />Maybe the fact that not many know that Pink's dad was a Vietnam veteran explains why it was only mentioned in a few reviews, as I believe that this song may be the one where Pink really layed her emotions on the line and was most poetic. It's beautiful.
0743420373|5.0|This book opened my eyes. It with other books that I have read on financial matters has helped me to realize that the wealthy are not necessarily those driving the expensive cars and living in the expensive houses.

B00005IBGQ|5.0|Rufus can really make a few notes sink in. He has the musical talent of all the best composers but can condense his masterful compositions into only a few minutes of music. I bought this CD because of the Shrek soundtrack, which Rufus contributed a track to, influenced me. I love the way Rufus can sing a melody and just put all the emotion he has into it. This is the most emotional album i've ever heard. It has the potential to be one of the greatest albums of all time. Buy this al;bum and support this canadian boy's talent.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums, Radiohead's best.  It's slighty better than Amnesiac in my opinion.  Its better than their earlier rock stuff.  Creep is an OK song, the rest of the albulm \\"is bad\\" compared to this.  For those of you who like simple beats, not very complicated music, don't buy this.  I'm surprised this CD made the charts in any way at all.  I usually hate most popular music, but this is great.  If you are somewhat intelligent, buy this CD.
0441003257|5.0|I can't believe that anyone could possibly give this book a bad reveiw!  It has everything, humor, romance, humor, danger, humor, paintball, humor, ect.  I loved it.  I read it in one sitting (18 hours in an airport, don't ask).  Beautiful, A-1 stuff, up there with Hitchhiker's Guide!
B0000041LL|5.0|Little needs to be added about a series of recordings of such depth and breadth, so let's be brief: this is an exalted collection of chamber pieces that rank among the very best in the history of Western music. In particular, the Grosse Fuge stands out as the great dividing line of its era, prefiguring Shoenberg, Webern, Berg, and scores of others a century later. Unlike anything produced in its day, the Fuge represented a technical and conceptual quantum leap from compositional methodologies of the past, and survives today with its power and complexity undiminished. Quartetto Italiano perform magic on these scores, and these sessions should be a foundation for any collection of classical music.
B00005QG9J|4.0|A great CD by a great band.  Incubus has, in my opinion, refined and focused the sound that made Make Yourself a good CD.  The sounds that worked for Incubus were the driving rock of &quot;Pardon Me&quot; or the softer sounds of &quot;Drive&quot;.  &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; blends the two without recyling them Limp-Bizkit style.  Morning View is an album that truly solidifies Incubus' place in the genre of alternative rock.  The band shows that they're not afraid to go in new directions, by moving away from the heavier sounds of Make Yourself, but without turning into pop.  &quot;Nice To Know You&quot; shows that they haven't lost their edge, and &quot;Just A Phase&quot; has a different, funky sound to it.  Incubus may be embarking on a journey to push the limits of rock, Radiohead-style.  So for those who don't like this CD, I have a feeling it's just a phase.
B00005QG9J|1.0|...The guitarist (einzinger?) claimed that when making this cd they were trying to avoid sounding like all other bands in the cluttered nu-metal scene. They sure did accomplish their goal. They were trying to make music that doesn't sound like something, and it's pretty obvious. Gone is the fresh sound from science and make yourself, replaced with a sound that i can explain as nothing more than forced. I had always thought that incubus were artists; I was apparently mistaken.
B000002UAX|4.0|The White Album is a definate turning point for the Beatles, though they did not seem to know which way exactly they were turning.  Every track on the record seems to test a new genre, lets break it down: BACK IN THE USSR:vintage rock'n'roll<BR>                    DEAR PRUDENCE:60's style epic<BR>                    GLASS ONION:psychedelic pop<BR>                    OBLA-DI:early ska/regaee<BR>                    BLACKBIRD:classic folk<BR>                    ROCKY RACCOON:country &amp; western<BR>                    YER BLUES:british blues parody<BR>                    HONEY PIE:78 rpm music hall<BR>                    EVERYBODY'S GOT..:flat out rocker<BR>                    HELTER SKELTER:proto-heavy metal<BR>and the list could keep going. Now i respect the beatles for having attempted so many styles and i thouroughly enjoy most of this album, but it seems that songs come of more as parody than honest attempts at the styles they were playing.  The Band more thouroughly melded country, rock, blues, and various others, but, hey, The Band was never half as popular as the Beatles.  I love the Beatles, and this record was kind of a goof off, but it is still on of my favorites, The Beatles would soon after return to what they do best...pop music.
6305313687|5.0|Edward Norton gives an extraordinarily brilliant (and Oscar nominated) performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead in this explosive and powerful drama about two brothers caught up in a cycle of racial hatred and violence. Told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, superbly portrayed by Edward Furlong, this is the story of a family torn apart after the loss of their firefighter father, killed whilst working in a black neighbourhood. As a result, the highly intelligent Derek (Norton), already influenced by his late father's bigotry and manipulated by cowardly fascist Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) becomes the charismatic leader of a local gang of skinheads. This inevitably leads to friction within Derek's family and his imprisonment for the murder of two black youths. Whilst in prison hero-worshipping Danny (Furlong) seeks to emulate his older brother and becomes more and more involved with the white power movement and influenced by Cameron (Keach) and his mindless morons. However, with a hero's welcome being planned for Derek's release from prison, he returns to his neighbourhood a changed man and sets out to repair the damage he's done to his family and to persuade his brother not to travel the same road.<br />Brilliantly written by David Mc.Kenna and with top-notch performances from both its male leads (ably supported by Avery Brooks and Stacy Keach) American History X is an intelligent and powerful examination of the causes and existence of racial bigotry and hatred. It does not seek to sensationalise rascism or violence but neither does it duck the issues. Controversial because of its frank portrayal of rascists as human beings, the scariest part of watching American History X is how credible and believable Edward Norton's rascists arguments (as the charismatic leader Derek Vinyard) can be and how easy it must be for impressionable youth to be drawn into a world of hatred and violence. This is as much education as entertainment and essential viewing for fans of intelligent drama. Described by the critics as \\"magnificent\\", \\"extraordinary\\" and \\"outstanding\\" American History X genuinely is a must see movie and a must own DVD.viewing for fans of intelligent drama. Described by the critics as \\"magnificent\\", \\"extraordinary\\" and \\"outstanding\\" American History X genuinely is a must see movie and a must own DVD.
B000002UAX|4.0|The White Album, a great record, shows the Beatles remarkable abilty to play in almost every popular genre of the day.  There are few \\"Beatles\\" songs, if you know what I mean, songs that are purely Beatles, with no satire involved.  \\"Dear Prudence\\", a Lennon classic is one of those, it is almost epic the way it builds up and breaks down, and has some great McCartney bass-work.  \\"I Will\\" is in the vein of early-Beatles songs and comes of well.  Harrison scores with his songwriting coming into full bloom on his biting \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" featuring Clapton on lead guitar. \\"Long, Long, Long\\" is a weary tune thats so soft and sweet that you forget that you can't hear the words.<BR>Ringo even gives us an original tune with his Beatles-stamped country song \\"Don't Pass Me By\\".  Now, there is 8 or so straight up style parodies, which I think is fine. but I only gave the record 4 stars because of this, i could have been alot more focused of an album, but than who am I to argue with the Beatles.<br />The style parodies I can name off the top of my head are as follows:<BR>BACK IN THE USSR:Chuck Berry/Beach Boys parody<BR>OBLA DI OBLA DA: early reggae, ska music<BR>ROCKY RACCOON: country & western, cowboy songs<BR>WHY DONT WE DO IT..: Ray Charles type R&B<BR>YER BLUES: 60's British Blues<BR>HELTER SKELTER: Heavy Metal<BR>HONEY PIE: 1930's style music hall, 78rpm sound included!!<BR>GOOD NIGHT: Disney style <br />Now there are some classics on this like \\"Revolution\\", \\"Blackbird\\", and \\"Birthday\\", but like George Martin said it would have made one hell of a single album, but definately worth checking out for anyone with even a passing interest in the Beatles.
6305558175|2.0|I've been surprised to read how many positive reviews that this film receives from Amazon customers - 12 out of 13 so far has given this film glowing review, which to me is quite remarkable.  So this film has to be doing something right to receive such approvals.  Admittedly the film was supported by strong performance from its star actors like Jodie Foster, which managed to rescue a film with unbelievable plot from a total flop to a mildly enjoyable film.  I happened to have watched this film's French predecessor, &lt;Return of Martin Guerre&gt; during a Film history class before I watched this film, and I couldn't help but notice the subtle but important changes to the overall plot of the original film, and I don't mean the change in historical and cultural setting.  The original French film was essentially a historical drama with imperfect characters, including the man who claimed to be Martin Guerre, who proved to be a good lover but a flawed man when it comes to greed.  In the Hollywoodized version of &lt;Sommersby&gt;, the man who claimed to be Jack Sommersby was a perfect hero whose only flaw was his general antipahty towards Confederate cause during the time he served in the Confederate army - hardly a condemnable flaw.  <br />To me all this reinforce a general observation - for Hollywood, films are essentially escapism, even when it attempts to deal with real issues that have no quick solutions.  Escapsim exist as well outside Hollywood (eg. think of the countless HongKong films and Bollywood films you hear about...), but for a significant number of French filmmakers, film is about an honest portrayal of reallity in all its glories and ugliness.  It is a confrontation, a meditation.  The room exists for imperfect ending, for plot driven films, for mysteries unresolved.  For some moviegoers, this can be quite unsettling and over-confrontational.  For others however, this approach carries more integrity, because life usually has imperfect endings, filled withordinary people, with mysteries unresolved.  <br />To illustrate my point further, consider the film &lt;Ransom&gt; starring Mel Gibson.  Near the end of the film, we sees the head kidnapper, who was himself a police officer, shooting the other criminal accomplice and turned himself into a &quot;rescuer&quot; instead.  Had this been a French film, this would be the &quot;perfect&quot; ending.  Instead, film goes on, with a typical Mel Gibson action scene in the end.  <br />&lt;Sommersby&gt; unfortunately is simply one of the many symptoms of a modern Hollywoodism that threatens to turn the film industry into bland and uninteresting escapism.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Though many have pegged Tenacious D's debut as more comedy than music, in terms of impact, the music is what shines. Sure, there are some funny bits (Black's &quot;discovery&quot; of inward singing is exactly the sort of almost-obvious, dead-on insight that makes for great comedy), but the shock is that Black can honestly sing, and Gass can honestly play guitar. And to further their cause, the two can actually write songs, the music being a winning mix of acoustic, metal, balladry, and downright sticky melodies. The songs are often brief to the point of frustration, but the twists and turns they pack into two minutes is inspiring. After many, many listens I find myself skipping the comedy bits for the songs, singing along to Black's often hilarious lyrics. Tenacious D is an oxymoron (Musical Comedy) that works in the most suprising ways.
B00005QK3W|1.0|I've got all his albums and this is by far the worst dribble I've ever heard!  I'm so disappointed in this I can't stand it.  This is as bad as Flaming Pie was good.  Mr. McCartney, if this is the best you can do at this point in your career, give up, go back to the farm, and don't keep teasing us with you on again/off again attempts at producing consistantly &quot;good&quot; albums.  Honestly, there's not one good song on the album.
0790731894|4.0|Terrorists hijack a jumbo jet with over 400 passengers. Terrorist expert Dr David Grant (Kurt Russell) believes that the terrorists have nerve gas bombs on board and therefore, they can't let the plane enter US airspace, since the nerve gas could probably destroy the entire Washington DC. And they don't want to shoot them down, since that would lead to a big scandal. Instead, they send up a special military unit, led by Lieutenant Colonel Travis (Steven Seagal), to get on board the jumbo jet and take control over it. This turns out to be even more difficult than they had thought.<br />This is an action thriller that unfortunately doesn't seem as unrealistic now as it would've done some months ago, and some people would maybe prefer not to watch it because of the recent attacks. On the other hand, it could be interesting to watch because of that. Either way, it's a very good and well made movie. It's not so different from Air Force One and if you liked that one, you'll probably like this one and vice versa. <BR>   Steven Seagal's role is actually quite small, he's out of the movie after approximately half an hour, or even less, and you don't miss him. Kurt Russel, Oliver Platt, Halle berry and the other actors are good. <br />If you like quality action movies, here is one that will keep you at the edge of your seat for a little more than two hours. I really liked it!
B00005QK3W|1.0|Absolute dribble.  His worst effort (?) in years.  He might as well &quot;get back&quot; to the farm and stay there if this is the best he can do.  Jeez, this is as bad as Flaming Pie was good.  Nothing new or original.  I can hear this kind of quality at the local club (and pay a lot less too).<br />Don't waste your money.....
0790740249|4.0|Serial killer expert Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) lives isolated in her apartment after being the victim of a murder attempt. When a new killer wreaks havoc in San Francisco, the police contact her for help. They soon figure out that the killer is copying old, famous murders. In order to catch the killer, and avoid becoming his victims themselves, they have to try to figure out his next moves. <br />It's a good thriller with some quite chilling scenes. Sigourney Weaver is good as the traumatized Dr Hudson, and Holly Hunter is charming as always as the good cop. The supporting cast is good as well. If you like thrillers and haven't seen this movie, you've got two thrilling, entertaining hours to look forward to. And it may be worth watching more than once.
B00005OM4N|5.0|There are doubters among you, but this perfect album makes it perfectly clear that Britney Spears is much more than a flash in the pan. Each one of her pores secretes more talent than most other music stars nowadays. Just because she's young, beautiful, and hip does not mean she lacks talent. Quite the opposite - her every note and every word or every song has layers of deep meaning that grasp the avid listener and speaks to the heart of every true (young) fan.<br />Wake up world! Britney is the next true, best thing. Our children will be listening to her, the same way the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Beach Boys, Springsteen and few others have been passed down from generation to generation. The only difference is, she's much, much better, and more talented than those put together.
B00005O5JV|3.0|Well,, I can't really say my opinion on whether I liked this or not. Reese looked just as great as always, and, well, I guess it was kinda funny. There were some funny lines &amp; scenes, like &quot;Cause I'm too BLONDE?&quot;- lol. Worth watching for once, but I don't think it's somethin I'd wanna see again. I wish they could've put the music video for that song &quot;Perfect Day&quot; after the credits- Hoku is soooo hot

6303477259|3.0|Dont get me wrong, i love floyd, but i couldnt stand watching this video.  The concert from a visual point of view is amazing of course but it seems that gilmours vocals were missing something (like his english accent). To me it was like watching a cover band play. But everything was flawless as you would expect from this band. if you want to see an excellent video of floyd live get &quot;the delicate sound of thunder&quot; i feel it is way better.  When are we gonna see &quot;the wall live&quot; on video or dvd?
B000000HSU|4.0|If you are a Bad Brains fan, or are interested in the early 80s hardcore scene in DC, this album belongs in your collection. The songs show strong punk influences -- long before BB adopted reggae and progressive hardcore sounds into their songwriting -- but the lyrics show the same angry, topical style as is found in later releases.<br />The production is raw (I think it's an eight track recording, and I heard that Rock for Light was originally released on cassette!) but the CD sounds good. The title track and &quot;Big Takeover&quot; are particularly good.

B000001ESP|4.0|Rush made it big on FM radio while still playing quality progressive rock,something only they and Yes have really been able to achieve. This album and the previous one, Permanent Waves, were part of a very successful period for the band. I think Permanent Waves is a little more consistent though. The first four tunes here are maybe the best album side Rush ever produced,though classic rock radio has me kind of sick of this stuff from overplaying it to death,namely 'Tom Sawyer', 'Red Barchetta',and 'Limelight'.'YYZ' is the second best instrumental in their catalogue(La Viila Strangiato is still supreme).Side two is not as focused despite a couple long pieces that are usually a strength for Rush. 'Camera Eye' is the best of the bunch,but 'Witch Hunt' is maybe the most musically plodding thing this band has ever done. 'Vital Signs' Signals things to come and would have been more comfortable on the next record.
0790733897|1.0|Steve McQueen in my opinion has made lotsa dull films (not The Great Escape and The Magnificent Seven.) Most of the film he looks at dead people at the morgue, and little else. He barely pays attention to his case. This movie is too [...] detailed. I remember them showing him in the grossery store 16 times. The film slowly got tiresomely slow. I was squirming in my seat 37 minutes before the car chase. When it came, all I heard was roaring motors. It was so damn pointless that after the car chase I decided to fast foward to the airport shootout. Big mistake! It was just as slow-paced as the car chase, only worse. The film is just too terrible for me to talk of anymore. I recommend it to [...] fans of dated films. Peace out!
B000001ES9|4.0|There are many ways of looking at the music on the debut album from Rush. The majority of Rush fans want to downplay the importance of this album for two reasons:1)Their(and I stress THEIR) drum god (he IS NOT Bill Bruford or Robert Wyatt)Neil Peart isn't on it so they don't even really consider it Rush which is silly. 2)The band got way more progressive attracting a different kind of audience along the way<br />If you look at this album as quality 70's hard rock/metal it's a winner any day,ranking up there with the best from Budgie,Kiss,BOC,etc. This is the point they always miss.Lee and Lifeson wrote good songs without Peart,despite the fact that Neil eventually proved to be a better lyricist,and also a better drummer (than Rutsey at least). This album contains material that smoked in concert (check out 'All The Worlds A Stage')like Working Man,What You're Doin',and Finding My Way. The bluesey ballad Here Again is my personal favorite and a one of a kind for Rush. Give this album a chance. A down to earth album from Working Men indeed,recorded in between late night bar band gigs.

Stripped of the pretense of &quot;Raging Bull&quot; and the stylized atmosphere of &quot;GoodFellas&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is a unashamedly honest look at New York city and its effects on a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran. Often uneasy to watch but amazingly and utterly compelling, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; launched Martin Scorsese into the pantheon of great directors. <br />   Set in modern day (1976) New York, the story centres around Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a 26 year-old ex Vietnam veteran. He is shy, dispossesed and utterly alone. He frequents porn theatres, yet is repulsed by the 'filth' he sees on the streets. Unable to sleep at night, Travis becomes a taxi driver, working long shifts with little or no sleep.Through his nightly experiences as a cab driver, Travis becomes even more bitter and confused. Bernard Herrmann's impecible theme aurates Travis' battle between what he thinks he should stand against and what actually arouses him. In fact, the theme music is perhaps the second most important character in the film, acting as a metaphor for the daily downward spiral of Travis' mental state. In his solitude Travis lets the drudgery and depressive nature of his job burrow inside his mind. He falls for an angelic WASP named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and even manages to take her out on a date. But his complete lack of nuance for the real world ends up with any chance of a burgeoning romance left in tatters.<BR>     What makes Travis' journey into madness even more compelling is the portrayl of the character by Robert De Niro. As the film progresses, De Niro's fractured performance is so real, you almost feel he really is Travis Bickle, even now some 25 years since the film's release. De Niro's best scenes are when he is trying to interact with 'normal' people, like his cab driver friends, or his confrontations with Tom (Albert Brooks) - a co-worker of Betsy. The way De Niro is one step removed from these and all the other characters in the movie is a feat he has not matched since. The script by Paul Schrader is also superb. The film shifts from centering on Travis' insecurity, to his misguidance and eventually to his role as a psychotic vigilante. The dialogue is superb and each character is shaped perfectly. The film also makes use of its many smaller, but no less important roles, such as Sport the Pimp (Harvey Keitel), Wizard the cabbie (Peter Boyle), Tom and Iris (Jodie Foster). All of these characters display an on screen presence that is rarely matched by other supporting cast members. <br />    <BR>Holding it altogether is Scorsese. New York has never looked sleazier or grimier. &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; works because Scorsese never lets the film slip in any way. Movie buffs will recognise many small homages to different directors, but even the casual viewer will feel nailed to their seat as the walls within Travis' mind creep further and further in. A true feat of modern film making and a study in paranoia that may never be bettered, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is an important chapter in American film and one that requires repeat viewings despite its difficult and uneasy vibe. A modern classic without question.<br />Rating: 5 out of 5<br />Grade: A+ 100%
B00003CXZ4|5.0|... what can I say ... this was an excellent movie, in my head the best since fight club. :) see it!
B00005M989|4.0|I must admit I like this CD but this album should have been titled Prince-Sample volume 1. Don't get me wrong this CD is good but the title is far from accurate. Some songs that are missing are Controversy, Batdance, Round And Round, and the stunning The Most Beautiful Girl In The World. While many of his hit are on here many of the songs on here I,ve never even heard of. I like this CD but this one's worth passing on. His 3 CD Hit/B-Sides collection is a far better choice. You'll get a far better example of his best hits and you also can get B-Sides on the third disc.<br />This album is just a rushed compilation of songs from 1979 to 1992 but nothing after that.<br />As I said before this album is more like a sampler than a Best Of CD. It's a good album but I,m not planning on getting this one.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|This has got to be the best attempt at a good game-based movie that I've seen. There were a few minor plot discrepancies that didn't quite follow the storyline of the game, but they could be ignored-I actually didn't notice them myself until my avid Tomb Raider-playing pal pointed them out. I loved the action sequences-the &quot;ceiling ballet&quot; being my favorite, and I think that Angelina Jolie did a suberb job portraying our feisty heroine. The music was probably the best part of the movie, though. The fast-paced techno stuck with me more than the actual story did, and I bought the soundtrack almost immediately afterward. <BR>What I didn't like was that the storyline of the movie wasn't that well developed. The charcters were typical, the events were ordinary, and the plot was so predictable that I found myself speaking the dialogue before the characters did! The story wasn't that detailed or involved. A third-grader could have followed it without trouble. I had been hoping for a more provoking, mature movie. Overall, it was...okay. Maybe the next ones will be better...that is, if they don't follow the rule of sequels...
B00000JCB2|1.0|This is not metal at all. This is a travesty to metal. This is pimp\jock\lowlife rock. Limp Bizkit's music is the most immature music that I have ever heard in my life. No heart, no soul, no intelligence, and no talent. It sickens me that some 30 year old fool from the trailer park is trying to be 16 and use cuss words to gain popularity. I couldv,e written those lyrics when I was in kindergarden. This is not rap either. Real rap is street. This is nothing but suburbia garbage for the brainless mallrats of America. The music itself is nothing feel proud about. Two chord noise that sounds worse than screeching a chalkboard is enough to make me want to turn off this CD at about three seconds upon starting. All that these fools are doing are trying to get a seal of approval by MTV and make a buck or two on the spoiled youth of America.
B00005OM4Q|4.0|I had heard and seen so much hype about this movie that I went into the viewing with some loathing.  As it turns out it is not a movie to loath but one to embrace at least for the moment as it transports you back to that heady time that was the early seventies.  It occurrs to me that this movie will make more sense and have more meaning to people in their forties as (we) lived it about the same time that Cameron Crowe did.  The movie is a bit of a &quot;cop out&quot; as it does not hold true to Crowe's actual/factual experience of being on tour with Led Zeppelin.  Now that would have been a 5 Star movie.  Instead we are treated to the on tour saga of a fictional Stillwater complete with a photograph of the band sitting on anvil cases a la Allman Bros. Band Live at Fillmore East.  Two stand out perfomances are Phillip Seymore as Lester Bangs and Jason Lee as the lead singer of Stillwater.  I read damn near every word Lester ever wrote and I do see him coming off as very cynical but not introverted and uncool as depicted in the film.  Lester/Phillip does have some good lines like:  &quot;Hey man I'm always home, I'm not cool.&quot;<br />Some problems I have with Almost are constant references to the year 1973 when some of the soundtrack songs are from many years forward.  Russell on top of a house with a head full of acid shouting, &quot;i am a golden god&quot;.  A quote later attributed to Robert Plant in Hammer of the Gods.  Crowe's homage to his time with Led Zeppelin?  Not enough sex and drugs but plenty of booze and beer.  A very watered down seventies.<br />Great soundtrack, great acting, good movie.
B000002PC6|5.0|Somethings just improve with age.  I must have been in the second grade when &quot;Physical&quot; first came out.  I can still remember playing the 45 single nearly everyday and watching her tv special.  It's amazing that there were only 2 top ten hits from this album (the title track and &quot;Make a Move on Me&quot;), &quot;Falling&quot; is such a beautiful ballad and ranks up there with some of her 1970s materials.  One of my favourites is &quot;Stranger's Touch,&quot; I also had that on 45, it was the B-side to &quot;Heart Attack&quot; off of Greatest Hits Volume Two.  Also, &quot;Silvery Rain&quot; should have been a big hit as well.  From start to finish, this is a great pop album which still is a pleasure to listen to today.  I can only hope that ONJ's box set that I keep hearing so much about will be more of a definitive collection than other greatest hits packages.  Most seem to only concentrate on one era of her career and usually just the singles that made it on the charts.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|You really can't say enough about Dr Suess' How The Grinch Stole Christmas. It is, in my opinion, the greatest Holiday film ever. It would'nt have been as good without Jim Carrey. I think he did the best job as \\"The Grinch\\". He is believable, hilarious, and exactly what the real movie Grinch should have looked like. The visual effects are extremely great, as well as the Who's. (Molly Shannon is very good). Based on the book & the cartoon, the magic of the film is unbelievable, as you will laugh until you cry and you will not belive your eyes as the brilliant brings How The Grinch Stole Christmas to life. This film will be a classic from now on, and Jim Carrey will always be remembered as the \\"vile\\" Mr. Grinch!<br />DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDED:<br />&#8226; Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<BR>&#8226; Color, Closed-captioned, DTS Surround Sound, Dolby<BR>&#8226; Production notes<BR>&#8226; Spotlight on location<BR>&#8226; Deleted scenes<BR>&#8226; Outtakes<BR>&#8226; Whoville section (includes Who School, Jim Carrey make up application, set decorations visual effects)<BR>&#8226; Faith Hill music video<BR>&#8226; Sing-Along songs<BR>&#8226; Read-Along songs<BR>&#8226; DVD ROM: \\"Add a Grinch to your own photograph, screen savers games, recipes<BR>&#8226; Full-screen format (1:33:1)(...)
0792107683|5.0|Shane is undeniably the greatest western ever made. Lets start with George Stevens eye for the camera. The cinematic elements of this film are equal to the most beautiful Texas landscapes in Steven's later work &quot;Giant&quot;. The backdrop of ominous, dark clouds and the majestic Wyoming Mountains enhance the reality of the small, western town standing as a small, symbolic beacon of the coming of civilization. The onset of settlers carving out their place in the west is also the centerpiece of conflict in this exceptional film. A mysterious stranger named Shane stops at the small family farm of a tenacious settler named Joe Starrett. This ex-gunslinger who longs for a different life is befriended by Starrett and idolized by the farmer's young son Joey. Shane also forms a respectful, unrequited admiration for Starrett's wife Marian, which becomes unmistakable prior to the film's exciting conclusion. As the story progresses, Shane becomes drawn in the settler's struggle against an aging and grasping rancher named Ryker, who desires to protect the open cattle range and drive the &quot;sod busters&quot; from the valley. When Shane and Starrett defend themselves against Ryker's henchmen and dispatch them in the best barroom brawl ever filmed, the desperate rancher calls upon the help of a professional killer for hire named Jack Wilson. The film climaxes with Shane facing Wilson in one of the grittiest showdowns ever seen in Western movies. This film has been a classic since its release in 1953. Alan Ladd is brilliant in the lead role with great supporting performances by Van Heflin and Jean Arthur. However, Jack Palance nearly steals the show in his turn as the cold-blooded Jack Wilson. Shane stands today as a simple, powerful and vastly entertaining picture; an example of flawless visuals and great story telling.
B000002JAX|5.0|How I wish I were reviewing another cd of Ms. Peyroux!  I bought this one years ago, and checked in today to see if she had anything new out there.  I can only hope that someday there'll be another.  When I'm stressed out, I slip in the Dreamland cd, settle down with a sigh, and slip back into my own skin.
B0000009OU|5.0|This Year's Model is definitive Elvis Costello. It's the hardest rocking of all of his albums, and each song is a triumph of the now venerable songwriter. This album features all the classics: the stream-of-consciousness `Pump it Up'; the brilliant `I Don't Want to Go To Chelsea'; the chilling `Night Rally'; and `Radio Radio'. This album exemplifies how good Elvis can be - it is the best thing he's ever made, and lays the foundations for a lot of the contemporary punk/pop music around today. Perhaps the best feature of This Year's Model is that it's a rock album with brilliant lyrics. Costello is known for his lyricism, and This Year's Model, in my opinion, shows Costello at his lyrical best. Each song is like a poem, in that the lyrics are complex, deep and meaningful. This album is an integral part of any Costello fan's collection, and is also perfect for anyone wanting to get a feel for what his music is like. A must buy.
0385505833|4.0|I was quite surprised by Grisham's ability to create hilarious word pictures in this amusing and sensitive little novel.  Those who are used to Grisham's legal thrillers will find that this is an amazing departure from his previous books, giving the reader a mega-dose of humor and quite convincing marital dialogue.  It is a quick, satisfying read that looks into the lives of a middle-aged couple who decide to &quot;skip Christmas&quot; and go on a cruise.  The resulting chaos is surprising and funny, catapulting the reader toward a wonderful message of good will to all, which is what Christmas is all about.  I found this such an entertaining read - laughing out loud in some parts!  I highly recommend it for a shot of good cheer!
B00005N5S5|5.0|This movie has held up well over time considering the budget it was made under. I will not go into a movie review since most of you are well aware of the plot, characters, and story. The DVD is just awesome! The movie has never looked this good, I saw it in the theaters when it first came out and also owned the previous DVD. The video transfer was first rate, no edge enhancements, color bleed, or artifacting. The video quality challanges most of the new movies with it's quality. The Dolby 5.1 sound track is superb considering the original soundtrack was a mono track. The dialog is focused on the center channel and rear channels along with the subwoofer are utilized frequently. The extras are just incredible, all 2.5 hours worth. This is a must own for any DVD owner!!!
B00004RE7C|5.0|And the search for Captain Spock begins. Afet his apparent death in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,&quot; Kirk soon learns from Spock's father Sarek(the late Mark Leonard who will be missed very much) that Spock's katra(his spirit) is alive within Dr. McCoy. This leads Kirk to reuniting his original crew, and hijacking the Enterprise to recover Spock's body on Genesis. However, Kirk will soon confront the evil Klingon Commander Kruge(Christopher Lloyd from &quot;Back to the Future&quot;) who is attempting to steal the secret of Genesis from Kirk's son David; the end of this is not a pretty picture. Fun, heart-warming, and nicely paced, the crew of the Enterprise gets better with every new entry in the movie series. This one is no exception.
B00003CY0V|4.0|A few of my co-workers had viewed this movie and did not have the best things to say about it. I thought it was actually pretty good. There are technical flaws with the computer stuff and it is a little far fetched but hey this is Hollywood and movies are made to entertain. I can find flaws in almost every Hollywood movie if I really look for them. The movie is fast paced and has a good amount of character development with many mini subplots. The video transfer is good but the Dolby 5.1 is fair, it utilizes the rears and the subwoofer but all the dialog is low and not focused on the center channel. Therefore if you turn up the volume to hear the dialog the action sequence volume is overwhelming. This caused me to deduct a star. All and all this is a real fun movie!
B00005AQEA|5.0|In 1993, international hiphop outfit IAM dropped the first hiphop double CD. a largely ignored fact...<br />still, Pac DID have the first double LP from a solo artist and along with Biggie's attempt months later, stands as the only good solo Double album in hiphop history.<br />Pac's rhymes are emotional and varied and have the strength to carry the album and the production, while occasionally weakened by flimsy keyboards is competent enough. Unfortunately, being from his death row period, this album is almost devoid of NY influence which would have given it more variety (check the battle rap with Meth, Kurupt and Redman)<br />In conclusion: if you hate Pac, this album won't change your opinon and if you love him you'll cherish it. It certainly is'nt the greatest hiphop album of all time, but it's certainly in the top 5 for it's year. Wu-tang Forever and Life after Death are it's only competition.
B00005Q66T|2.0|I love madonna and I consider myself a true fan, but I'm very disappointed with GHV2. The songs included in this album are really great and do represent what madonna has been doing throughtout recent years. However, it does not bring any new material, which is a shame!<br />I own all her CDs and singles and I don't need this GHV2. This is the album recommended for those who did not buy her CDs and want to have the greatest songs at home.   <br />I believe Warner should have released a greatest hits colection like &quot;something to remember&quot;. It was also a greatest hits CD, but it has special remixes [w/massive attack] and unreleased tracks. I'm sure they have new songs of madonna, who were recorded and not included in &quot;Music&quot; album.<br />Anyway, GHV2 will be good for some.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Joan Sutherland, Luciano Pavorotti, Monserret Caballe, all in top form. A resonating recording by the decca engineers with the fabulous Zubin Mehta conducting the London Phil. There you have it, a sure-fire recipe for success. And indeed this powerful reading of Puccini's masterpiece, Turandot is one of the best in the catalog. Of course it would have to stand up to the sensational version with Nilsson/Bjoeling/Tebaldi, or the one with Nilsson/Corelli/Scotto. But each one has its ups ( there are no downs in all three of the versions! ). But the edge might go to the Sutherland/Caballe/Pavorotti (1971) because of its state of the art sonics. Caballe is glorious as Liu, Pavorotti was borned to sing Calaf, and Sutherland, at least in the studio, sings so very beautifully as the princess of ice. Nough said, a 5 star effort.
0394800184|5.0|My son is a big, hulking, almost-16-year-old, but to this day, when he sees construction equipment, he says, &quot;Look, Mom! It's a Snort!&quot;<br />&quot;Are You My Mother&quot; was the book my son never tired of. All through his early toddler years, it was his bedtime favorite, his naptime favorite, a comfort when he was tearful, and his best friend. How many times did he curl up on my lap with his blankie and his thumb while I rocked him and read this book?<br />The &quot;plot&quot; concerns a baby bird who hatches while the mother bird is out of the nest. Baby sets out to find his mother, and asks everything and everyone he sees, &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; The &quot;Snort&quot; reference comes when the baby bird asks a huge piece of digging equipment, and...&quot;The big thing just said SNORT!&quot; This is what my son waited for throughout the book...he laughed every single time. And still does.<br />In the end, the birdie finds his mommy. The perfect, secure ending for a small child who wants reassurance before bed, or any time. This book is a classic. My son still has it, and I know he will read it to his own children some day. I hope I am there to see it.
0385505833|2.0|Unoriginal, formulaic, its a quick holiday read that isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the best.  I disliked the characters from the opening chapter and never felt they ever rose above one dimension.  As a minority, I was horrified at the shallowness of the characters when they fervently hoped their daughter's friend &quot;wasn't dark.&quot;  What?  Good news.  Later it was determined he &quot;wasn't dark at all, in fact he was lighter than they were!&quot;  What a relief.  And what dreck.
B00005RIKD|5.0|Any reviewer who would put down this live album a) is not a Sting fan and/or b) doesn't know a thing about music. This is the live album that Sting fans have been waiting 15 years for. It was recorded at his house, in front of 200 of his fans and friends. Almost every song has been reworked from scratch, injecting new life into Sting's masterful repertoire. It's a very special album, and a must-have for every Sting fan and music lover. I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars...
B00003CXSM|5.0|Okay, I admit it....I just love romantic comedies!  And this was one of the best I've seen.  I've watched this movie over and over with my friends--even my 11 year old brother loves it!  This is one of those rare movies whose fans really do cross generational lines!  And for fans of Matthew McConaughey you will NOT want to miss this flick!  Even Jennifer Lopez, who is not normally one of my favorite actresses, is perfect for her role.  I cannot recommend this movie enough--one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!
B000002BFZ|1.0|Pearl Jam even more than Nirvana was te difinative rock band from the eraly 90s. Every thing from the look, to the quasi social messages many of their songs contained define the eraly 90s. The biggest irony, is that with Ten and even Vs., they were by far the most conventional sounding of the &quot;grunge&quot; bands. Ten was a brillant hard rock album, one of the best hard rock recordings ever. And the music on Ten is timeless, it could have come out in 75,85 or even in 2001. Vs. is somwhat rougher edged, less refined than Ten, but still a excellent effort. Then comes Vitology, when Vedder starts to take further control, and when the politics, such as Pearl Jams fights againts commercialisim and ticket master take a toll on their music. Also, the timlessness of their material started to fade. Ever since Vs. Pearl Jams sound and image has been stuck in the early 90s. The band ceased being a and in the true sense, and become a Vedder solo band. Vitalogy,No Code, Yeild and BinAural all sound like they were recorded in the 93-94 time period.<br />  No Code, to put it bluntly, is trash. Yes, the consideriable talent is still there, but sadly Vedder runs the whole show. Not even new drummer Jack Irons considerable talent shines on this album, while Ament, Gossard and McCready are held back. The somng writing on No Code is a sloppy mess, meandering from Neil Young style electric folk rock to neo punk to sloppy Zep style hard rock to their laughable attempt at world beat. All and all, a complete failure to execute any of these styles. <BR>  <BR>If one is a Vedder fanatic, No Code is the album for them, but if one is simpily a fan of rock music, avoid No Code. No I am obviously am not a fan of Pearl Jam, and other people who write reviews will throw the &quot;you dont understand&quot; line out. But I am a fan of rock music, and to people who are simpily fans of good rock music, who read these reviews trying to get a idea of what to buy and not to buy, sadly you wont find ithere with this album.
0960191038|5.0|In my professional life in consulting, I have read two or three books as basic and fundamental as this. Unfortunately, just because the Minto system is so basic and logical, it does not allow for being vague, for fudging statements and being political -- inevitable factors of any project I have seen. It calls for being explicit and transparent. A few individuals can afford that, and those are usually not senior managers.<br />Minto's system is an ideal to apire to but never to achieve. Everyone should read this book if they want to understand what it's all about, but I am sorry to say we may never see it used properly in business life.
B00005LOUP|3.0|Ok, I know this is only BASED on the Dr. Suess book. But so was the cartoon and that is what most remember. The story is simple, the Grinch lives above the Whos, they love Christmas, he hates it, in the end he finally understands what the holiday is all about. In the cartoon you never really find out why he hates, he just does. The movie explains why (although it's somewhat strange). I suppose if you don't compare the movie to anything, it's alright. But you can't help but to compare it to the cartoon. The cartoon showed the Whos as fun loving folk who in the end despite having their material Christmas items stolen from them, still join hands and sing as if nothing ever happened. The meaning of Christmas is not lost on them. In the movie they are given a more human aspect and the mayor points out that they never should have invited the Grinch to an earlier celebration, because he knew this would happen. That part totally ruins the idea that the Whos fully understand the meaning of Christmas. The movie could have been so much better if only they'd stuck to what the book was all about. As for the DVD extras it's got all the bells and whistles you want, even some Who recipes!
B00003CWRX|5.0|There were a few very good films in 1999. The Insider was sure one of them. It is so well crafted, every aspect of it. Russell Crowe performance is astonishing, you can actually feel the torture that this man went through -I loved Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but I think Crowe is fantastic here, well, they gave him the Oscar for Gladiator, to compensate. The documentary-styled photography makes the movie even more gripping. <BR> I loved Lisa Gerards music, by the way, solemn and dramatic, and finally redemptive, when Crowes characters battle is finally over.
B00005RYQO|5.0|This is deafantly a movie anyone would be proud to have in their video collection. The intense speed will pull you into the driver's seat. Fighting, speed, action, and hot guys, this movie has it all.
067144901X|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Sandra Boynton books, ever since I bought &quot;Barnyard Dance&quot; for my older son when he was an infant.  Ms. Boynton doesn't disappoint with this book either.  My sons love to make the same sounds as the animals and this book is always a fun read.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|An admitted Tolkien fan, I had reservations about anyone even able to approach equalling the emotional world in music that Tolkien mastered in his tale of The Ring.<br />But again, my sceptisism will take a back seat.  Howard Shore's score is excellent.<br />Like the books, it carries a feeling of mystery, fantasy, and heroism.  In listening to the score, I now have confidence that the images from the film that inpired Shore's work are surely worth the anticipation of the film.
B000000H64|2.0|If you like this, be SURE to check out Meshuggah, particularly the album Destroy Erase, Improve. Same sort of style with better vocals, tricky polyrhythms (which make it more interesting) and a better guitar sound. Those guys have the Machine-sound down pat. I guarantee you will like them better than Fear Factory unless the rhythm's are too complex and it goes over you're head. But that won't happen, right? :)
B00005QZWI|5.0|Star Wars, Shawshank, Gladiator - time to move over.  Just when I thought film scores couldn't get any better, along comes Howard Shore.<br />Truly great!  It is mysterious, tragic, but above all - Heroic.<br />Shore had to have inspiring images to weeve this wonderful score.  My anticipation for the film has now increased ten-fold.
B000000H64|2.0|Am i missing something? there is so much rave about this band and particularly this album, and i can't seem to find out why. The riffs are pretty boring, every song sound basically the same, and the singing's so-so. Another thing, this is not death metal. Death metal is Cryptopsy, Suffocation, Dying Fetus, etc. This is just Nu Metal, with less melody (which makes it worse). I seem to have bad judgement on some things though, like i love instrumental guitar music but don't like Steve Vai. EVERYBODY who linstens to instrumental guitar like Vai. I'm kind of a freak that way. I guess you should go by the other reviews before mine, but there's a chance you may feel as i do. This actually kind of reminds me of old Sepultura, which i don't like either :) If you want GOOD heavy music, go buy something by Gardenian or Soilwork. If you want good Nu Metal, buy something by Nothingface or Puya. This music seems incredibly boring to me and usually i like pretty much anything (and i mean that, it's not because this is TOO heavy for me or NOT heavy enough, it has nothing to do with that, i just found the music boring)I guess you shuld try it since a lot of people really like it, but beware, because if i can find it really boring, i'm sure someone else will too.
B000002OOY|5.0|This music rocks, I love it.  Ireccommend it to any one who like classical music, or Jurassic Park.
B00003CXDD|1.0|I just read a copy of this week's entertainment weekly (with harry potter on the cover) and saw an ad for willow dvd and it says:<br />\\"Before there was hobbits, before there was wizards, there was an unlikely hero named Willow\\"<br />To anyone who likes Lord of the Rings, or respects the work of the late great tolkien, should be insulted by this ad. The film was released in 1988(!) by Lucasfilm, long after Lord of the Rings was written more than 50 years ago, so who really did come first? I'm really looking foward to the release of LOTR film, and it looks like LucasFilm is trying to sabatoge unknowing movie-goers into thinking Lord of the Rings was something created just recently, and that Lord of the Rings is  untruthfully a rip off of \\"Willow\\" As a matter of fact, after watching willow, it becomes apparently obvious that the character was modeled from the hobbit Frodo, in lord of the rings. Even Entertainmet Weekly called Willow a cheap rip off of Lord of the Rings on their cover story of the upcoming epic movie. I'm sure the advert agency for Lucasfilm knew this when they made the ad, and this ad is an insult to the public. If anyone is equally disgusted, be sure to mention it in your amazon review. (...)
6303187064|1.0|I tried to watch this on cable, but gave up because it's just a bunch of gratuitous violence.  Like so many modern movies, a good premise but poor follow-through.  Also, that bird is a raven, not a crow.
B00005O5JV|5.0|I love this movie.  It's the only movie I saw in the theatre all summer - and I saw it twice!  It is not a deep movie, but it will make your day and put a smile on your face.  Don't dismiss this movie as another chick flick - give it a try!
6304057709|5.0|I suppose it makes perfect sense that if you want to make a 19th-century English romance novel into a superb film you hire an actress almost twice the age of the main character to not only play the role but also adapt the screenplay into a book and then hire a Taiwanese director to direct the film.  You might say, yes, such things happen in Hollywood, but the success of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is due to what transpired in England, not Southern California.  Having read the novel and the original screenplay, the largest share of credit goes to Emma Thompson, who deservedly received the Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation.  Thompson began by dramatizing every scene in the novel, which resulted in 300 hand written pages to be followed by 14 drafts as the 1811 novel was crafted into the final script.  The result was a script that manages to be not only romantic and funny, but also romantic and funny in the best Austen sense of both.<br /><br />After watching the film again I focus on three particular points, which I think best reveal the strength of Thompson's script.  First, the entire introductory sequence, which induces us to like the Dashwood sisters because we are introduced first to their step-brother and his shrewish wife (credit for this particular sequence also goes to Film Editor Tim Squyres, who recut the scene so that we get all of one side and then the other instead of alternating back and forth as in the original script).  Our sympathies cannot help but be with the plight of Elinor and Marianne.  Second, the use of Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 (\\"Let me not the marriage of true minds\\"), which Marianne and Willoughby share to their great mutual delight (except he gets a word wrong, in an elegant little bit of foreshadowing) and which Marianne repeats standing in the rain looking at Willoughby's new estate.  Third, Austen has Elinor bolt from the room to cry outside during the happy ending but Thompson creates a wonderful moment by having her stay in the room and having the rest of her family flee.  There are not too many scenes where you are crying and laughing at the same time, but Thompson certainly created one (and has the added virtue of relying on herself as an actress to nail the performance as well).  All of these are marvelous examples of playing to the strength of the cinema to bring Austen's novel to the screen.<br /><br />The performances are first-rate, especially Kate Winslet as the passionate Marianne, Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood and Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon (the look on his face when Marianne thanks him for rescuing her is so wondrously touching).  Hugh Grant does find a way of slowing the delivery of his dialogue more than usual, but it does fit the overall pace of the film.  The supporting cast is exactly what you come to expect from a British production with Elizabeth Spriggs stealing every scene she is in as Mrs. Jennings, Robert Hardy as Sir John Middleton, Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, Oliver Ford Davies as Doctor Harris, and the enchanting young Emilie Francois as Margaret Dashwood (\\"They always kneel down\\").  On the darker side of the ledger we have Greg Wise as the less than honorable John Willoughby, and Imogene Stubbs as Lucy Steele and Harriet Walter as Fanny Dashwood vying for the main villainess role in the proceedings.  No wonder Emma Thompson's performance as Elinor is almost lost in the proceedings, but she is the center around which everything resolves who has to keep it together when everybody around her is losing it (even when she first confesses her broken heart, she ends up consoling Marianne instead of the other way around).<br /><br />Ang Lee had already proven he could handle a tale of sisters in love when he directed \\"Eat Drink Man Woman.\\"  In \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" he has the script, the actors and the set design all working in his favor to create a sense of 19th century England.  But there are a few moments when he uses the camera to great advantage; in particular the overhead shot of Marianne on her sick bed achieves a painting like quality and the tracking shot of Mrs. Jennings running down the street bearing the latest gossip.<br /><br />I first saw this film when visiting England and I was so caught up in the story that I had no idea who was going to end up with who.  Actually, I was sort of rooting for Elinor to end up with Colonel Brandon since they were obviously the two finest members of their respective sexes in the proceedings.  So the ending was as much of a surprise to me as it was to the Dashwoods, which is certainly something to be cherished.  Obviously if you love this film it will lead you to other Austen adaptations (the film versions of \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\" along with the BBC mini-series \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" immediately leap to mind), but hopefully it will also lead you to the original novels as well.  Finally, Thompson published \\"The Sense and Sensibility: Screenplay & Diaries,\\" which I would highly recommend after you have done both the film and the novel.er sick bed achieves a painting like quality and the tracking shot of Mrs. Jennings running down the street bearing the latest gossip.

B00005OAIE|5.0|(...) this CD is just plain awesome. Every song is beautifully constructed with a thoughtful, mellow feel that I only wish was heard more often. Most of the themes can be related to by almost anyone (especially \\"83\\"), and the music is amazing!! Definitly buy this CD!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|After one of the best albums ever, Aenima, I didnt know what to expect from Tool and Lateralus. I mean, considering what a masterpiece Aenima is, I thought, &quot;If Lateralus is going to get better then...well...how!?&quot; I expected an album that was going to blow the world away, and that I didnt get. Yet, the album still holds a 5 star rating in my book. Maybe I had set my expectations a little too high. The songs:<br />1) The Grudge: By far my favorite track off the album. The first time I heard this I was blown away and thought if the rest of the album was of this nature then it will surely surpass the expectations I had set. The song passes the 8 minute mark and ends in one of the most powerful fashions of any tool songs.<BR>2) Eon Blue Apocalyspe: Only about a minute and four seconds long. I often wonder what the purpose of this filler is and if anyone cares to let me in on it, please email me. <BR>3) The Patient: Another stand out song. Comes in as my second favorite song on the album. Like the Grudge, theres alot of changes, lot of riffs, and just doesnt end. But thats a good thing. It keeps getting better and better, builds up, then blows up.<BR>4) Mantra: Unlike Eon Blue Apocalypse, which really isnt a song, yet contains instruments, Mantra does not. I cannot write anything about this track because I do not know the purpose for it. Sounds like some background noise out of a ghost story.<BR>5) Schism: This is the song alot of people heard first off the album. Although in my opinion it is not the best song on the album, it is the one best suited for a single, so therefore, you have a single. Obviously the Grudge wouldnt get any airplay clocking in over 8 minutes long. This was the first song I heard off this album, and I notice a change in sound. The intro sounded somewhat like something from a Queensryche album and it took my a while to get used to it. However, the song is again one of the best off the album, contains great bass playing, great drumming(which goes without saying because your dealing with Danny Carrey), and a great ending. <BR>     So far we have gone through the first 5 songs from Lateralus. Lets compare this 5 with the first 5 off Aenima:<BR>1) Stinkfist vs The Grudge: The Grudge <BR>2) Eulogy vs Eon Blue Apolcalypse: Are you kidding me? (Eulogy, for you Tool newbies.)<BR>3) H vs The Patient: H (But alot will argue for The Pateint)<BR>4) Useful Idiot vs Mantra: This is not relevant, since both are simply fillers consisting of nothing but strange sounds.<BR>5) 46&amp;2 vs Schism: 46&amp; 2 (Unique bass lines in both songs. But, the breakdown to 46&amp;2 is amazing and so is the rest of the song.)<BR>     Now, continuation of the Lateralus song reviews:<BR>6) Parabol: This is a very slow paced song which is a predecessor to Parabola. Maynard does some cool singing in this song, and does sound like a priest in church. Basically, it is a great big build up waiting to explode into track 7. It is great when done live.<BR>7) Parabola: Continuation of track six, played fast and heavy. Great tempo, great feel to the song. This song is one of the most &quot;Arena Rock&quot; style songs tool has. Very progressive sounding and very energetic.<BR>8) Tickets and Leeches: I wasnt a great fan of this song until I heard it live. This one contains the strangest vocals done by Maynard ever probably in any Tool album, and it is hard and heavy. An angry song.<BR>9) Lateralis: This is a great song and another fan favorite on this album. Like the Grudge, it is long, going over 9 minutes, and contains lot of changes. However, unlike the Grudge, which maintains a heavy sound all throughout, Laterlis shifts constantly between slow and light to fast and heavy.<BR>10) Disposition: Here we are again faced with a similar scenario between Parabol and Parabol. Yet, its tempo is faster than that of Parabol.I ts sister and brother. Dispostion is not heavy, and it is not fast. However, it gives you an undistorted taste of what is tocome in the next track<BR>11) Reflection: Very long intro. Before the vocals come in you are fed a nice drumbeat, a haunting bass line, a synthesizer, and arabic sounding something, whatever it may be, and some guitar. This song like most other long ones on this album is a journey, and does not dissapoint. Like Laterlis it shifts between heavy and light.<BR>12) Triad: Third favorite song on the album. It is an instrumental track. Some people might wonder why it is my 3rd favorite track when theres others like Schism and Laterlis lying around. But it is simply the mood of the song. Very energizing, weird and fancy guitar effects done by Mr.Jones, and the drumming....well, what else is there to say about the drumming? Im not a drummer myself, but this is the first guy Ive seen in a while that can match up to Neil Peart. I listen to these Tool songs over and over and there is always something nifty Danney Carrey is doing. A constant creative force. Never seems to lay back and hold down a simple plain beat. The song overall is just very energetic, very lively, and powerful bass and guitar playing. Very cool. Would be a nice opener for a live show.<BR>13) Faaip De Oiad: Another filler. Weird sound effects with a guy behind it saying some freaky stuff. Nothing special.<BR>     Now lets compare tracks 6-11 off Aenima and Lateralus.<BR>6)Message to Harry Manback vs Parabol: Parabol<BR>7)Hooker With a Penis vs Parabola: Hooker with a Penis (Both fast and powerful songs, but Hooker with a Penis...incredible song.<BR>8)Intermission vs Ticks and Leeches: Ticks and Leeches (Intermission is a filler track so Ticks and Leeches got a break here, although Intermission is a really cool buildup to Jimmy)<BR>9) Jimmy vs Lateralis: Jimmy (Again, like H and The Pateint, many will argue between the two.)<BR>10) Die Eier Von Satan vs Disposition: Dispostion<BR>11) Pushit vs Reflection: Pushit (By far)<BR>12) Cesaro Summability vs Triad: Triad (Cesaro Summability is a filler)<BR>13) Aenimavs Faaip De Oiad: Aenima, by miles. If anyone choose  Faaip De Oiad, the something is wrong with you.<BR>     Of course it isnt logical comparing one albums track to the others. But im basically summing up both albums songs and which are better. Lateralis comes to and end here, but Aenima still contains another filler and another great song, Third Eye. <BR>     Overall, Aenima is the first album anyone not familar to Tool should get. It contains some of the greatest songs ever, Stinkfist, Eulogy, H, 46&amp;2, Hooker with a Penis, Pushit, and Aenima. As opposed to Lateralus, whos strongest track in my opinion is The Grudge, and other others do not beat those of Aenima. <BR>    Still, a great album overall but kind of like comparing And Justice for all to Master of Puppets from Metallica. Both are great, one is a masterpiece, and everyone will have their own likes and dislikes. <BR>     If you dont own any albums by Tool, this is the order of albums to get:<BR>Aenima, Lateralus, Undertow, Salival, Opiate.
0553278398|5.0|Prelude to Foundation is chronologically the first novel in Asimov's Foundation series. Hari Seldon has just introduced his theory of psychohistory to the public on Trantor and is now sought after for his potential to one day mathematically predict the future. In this book we learn much about the Imperial home planet of Trantor and the time period of the beginning of the Empire's decline. I haven't yet read the rest of the Foundation series but I'm looking forward to it, the more so after this enjoyable start.<br />Since Prelude was written many years after the original Foundation trilogy, Asimov chose to tie in a few plot elements from the four-book Robot series and the old Empire trilogy. In fact, a major character from the Robot series also shows up here in a marvelous twist at the end of the book! Having recently read both the Robot and Empire series, I feel that Asimov did a wonderful job considering that something like 20,000 years have passed since the time setting of the Robot series. I highly recommend reading the Robot novels before you start Prelude.<br />Prelude describes \\"The Flight\\" period of Seldon's life during which he was hiding from the Emperor Cleon I to prevent psychohistory from falling into the wrong hands (or so he thinks). This book is quite difficult to put down and the 400+ pages flew by for me in less than two weeks, which is unusual given how much time I usually devote to sci-fi. The ending has a couple great surprises in store for you, just make sure you don't peek!
0385505833|5.0|I saw this book and thought \\"Skipping Christmas\\" who would want to do that and who would want to read about it.  But I ordered this book and started reading it one afternoon and was laughing.  It is so funny.  I couldn't wait to finish the book.  The characters are so good and Mr. Krank is so funny.....a typical man at Christmastime.  He comes up with a great reason to skip Christmas and a trip that most people only dream about.  Then at the last minute those great plans come to a halt and he has to rethink his great plan.  And in the middle of it he gets himself caught up in the whole Christmas festivities that we all love.  (he literally does).  I was so \\"sad\\" when I finsihed reading it.  Everyone thinks of not decorating or getting caught in all the crowds, but only John Grisham could make it so funny.  I hope he writes another one like this one.  Everyone can relate to this book!  A must read for the Holiday season... especially after a shopping trip in the crowds.  I liked it so much that I'm sending it to my mom.
B00000JMOF|5.0|After repeated attempts of securing a Frankenstein, director James Whale hired a middle-aged character actor named William Henry Pratt (stage name: Boris Karloff) who had previously been limited to cameos, stand-ins, and predominantly small eccentric parts to play Frankenstein's monster. Karloff's restrictive age, massive obscurity, and absence of experience may have emerged as hindrances for this newly discovered personality. However, time and popular opinion has obliterated these fears into long lost paranoid hallucinations. <br />It is Boris Karloff's indisputably iconic and singularly haunting performance as the child-like brute, misunderstood and despised by all, who's only longing and desire is to be loved and cared for by others that continues to be one of cinema's timeless jewels of acting perfection, dramatic magnitude, and note-fully seamless pathos. Karloff's monster, like Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates or Robert De Norio's Travis Bickle, is one of cinema's fortunate accidents of how the exact casting of just the right perfect someone can unbelievably bolster the film. Karloff's casting as the inevitably sympathetic artificial concoction of a mad scientist with a deity complex turned out to be one of many grandiose happy accidents that has allowed this 70 year-old gothic horror film to continue to be copiously admired, internationally beloved, and enthusiastically cherished up to contemporary times. <br />Frankenstein retains numerous stellar elements including a magnificently captivating early sound ensemble cast including Edward Van Sloan (Doctor Waldman), Mae Clarke (Elizabeth), Frederick Kerr (Baron Frankenstein), Dwight Frye (Fritz), and the unforgettable Colin Clive, the archetypal mad scientist, (Henry Frankenstein), brilliantly provocative Frankenstein make-up by make-up genius Jack Pierce, manically splendid and cleverly articulated German Expressionistic sets ,that place this tale in an indescribable alternate Grimm Fairy Tale reminiscent landscape, James Whales immeasurably eloquent moral consolidation and inventively multi-faceted interpretation of Mary Shelly's tale, and forever crowned with one of cinema's most cunningly virtuoso and unredeemable bravura performances of inarticulate primal indignation and childish rage ever recorded on film by Karloff as the monster. <br />However due to it's age and Hollywood production values at the time, Frankenstein is not totally absent of problems: lacking of a musical score to countermarch the film's profuse talkativeness, predictably saddled with pedestrian and extremely dated comedic and romantic sub plots, and weakened by an awfully trite comedic conclusion. Despite these blemishes, Frankenstein consummately embodies the finest narrative qualities of the early Universal monster films, contains the simply greatest incarnation of Frankenstein's monster, and stubbornly remains both in ambiance and creative evocativeness the finest film version of the Mary Shelly story.<br />Either virtually creating or establishing the most memorable template for many of the horror genre's most blessed clichés and stereotypes including the angry mob laced with the burning torches and sharp pitchforks, the rustically appearing European town, the burning windmill, the broadly mentally troubled mad scientist, the tragically misinterpreted monster, the lavishly designed laboratory machinery, the chronically sadistic hunchback, and the supposed evil psychological significance of lightning. James Whale's Frankenstein remains an altogether manifestly influential film landmark that has predisposed numberless incalculable sequels, remakes, homages, and spoofs to habitually exhume its timeworn formula over the last seventy years. <br />One only has to warmly revisit this beloved perpetual love letter of the macabre to immediately recap its' resplendent spoils of immortality time after exultant time to re-experience all of perpetual sacrosanct epiphanies which compose James's Whales Frankenstein and are eternal adjectives of film all by themselves.  <br />Talk about staying power!!! <br />As for Frankenstein's DVD format, it contains a uncannily pristine Pan and Scan standard presentation, a 45 minute absorbingly intriguing making-of documentary, film historian Rudy Behlmer's consistently stellar illuminating time-defying chorological exodus of a film audio commentary, original theatrical trailer, a short 1930's fictional film subject entitled Boo!, and much more. <br />Universally (pun intended) recommended to anyone interested in film classics, the Universal Monster films, or the everlasting time repelling landmark films of the 1930's. Followed by James Whales' superior sequel The Bride of Frankenstein (1935).

B00003CY0V|1.0|In a year with a seemingly endless array of creatively devoid commercial films, Dominic Sena's (Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), Kalifornia) monotonously incoherent, visually grandiloquent, and manically unoriginal Swordfish fits right in to 2001's aesthetically sparkling yet dramatically inadequate parlor of creative misfires, strategic miscalculations, and just plain mediocre stink bombs. Adorned by cardboard cut-out acting, a fiendishly under-whelming techno-spiked background of hackneyed terrorist stereotypes and undeveloped law-enforcement formulistic stooges, a narrative hogwash cluttered with typically pedestrian and inventively bankrupt sub-plots that do nothing more than accentuate the film's lack of breadth, an exceptionally halfhearted auto-piloted performance by John Travolta (alas continuing on his second horrible movie phase) that may initially impress but eventually grovels into artistically sterile complacency, and blatantly unimaginative action conventions that are stylistically astounding albeit momentously stale ,after the film's initial overwhelming sensation wears off, culminate in stranding Swordfish into only fulfilling it's entertainment aspirations through excess and overkill alone leaving out content, drama, pathos, and storytelling integrity replacing it with a superbly displayed and provocatively decorated entertaining nothingness of noncommittal that infuriates with its dysfunctional diet of by-the-numbers entertainment.<br />For those easily deluded by eye candy, Swordfish easily has as much stylistic bravado as the Wachowski Brothers' The Matrix in appearance only. Underneath it's keenly realized pictorial anarchy of ball-bearing explosions, shock nudity, M-60 gunfights, impressive set decadence, and flying buses, we are left with a liquidated creative barrenness supplementing for an extremely unacceptable farce of movie by devising a semblance of content to deceive the audience with. By means of concocting this visage of real movie to coverthe shambles of imaginative ineptness all around it, Swordfish is only an intensely ornamented empty shell casing of film that engrosses through it's dynamic distraction of it's problems rather than through just telling a powerful story. Frankly, Swordfish is the dubious epitome of how not to make an action film. Stay away at ALL COSTS. This is the proverbial pits.<br />As for Swordfish's DVD options, it consists of a very impressive anamorphic widescreen presentation, two Making-Of documentaries, a Dominic Sena commentary track, the theatrical trailer, and several other options. Ironically, the special features are highly more preferable than the infernal film itself.<br />It is recommended for all living organisms to STAY AS FAR AWAY from this quality toxic waste dump as feasibly possible. Only seasoned crack film reviewers should come within a hundred miles of this film abomination.<br />I rather watch a Mr. Rodgers marathon instead of this.
B000000W6X|5.0|Great tracks and variety in song tempo. Highly recommend.
0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock was a legendary perfectionist. He believed in pure cinema. The cinematic expression through images of a film and not through the common usage of words was his forte and his godsend, and not in any one other of his films (Other than Vertigo, Strangers on a Train) did this show up more than in his black comedy &quot;Psycho&quot;. Hitchcock always believed that all the hard work to a film was done in the production of the screenplay and the storyboarding. Read the insightful books by Donald Spoto, Truffuat, and others and you will notice and comprehend their constant attention to Hitchcock's numerous film<BR>motifs, allusions, and philosophical consistencies that add variance, complexity, overabundant detail, and seemingly unobtainable fullness to every one of his fifty- four films. Psycho is a cinematic experiment to see how the audience<BR>would react to Hitchcock killing off the leading lady one-third into the film. Hitchcock noticed the abundance of low budget film thrillers in the late 50's that were receiving extremely good business. Films by Roger Corman, William Castle, and others seemed to represent a low budget send off of Hitchcock. So with using his Shamely Productions from his Alfred Hitchcock's Presents television show crew, Alfred Hitchcock created the definitive psychological horror film and one of the most  sensationally crafted films of all time. Despite forty-one years since it's theatrical release, 'Psycho' remains a magnificent artistic document chronicling America's obsession with exaggerated Momism and phobias revolving around the bathroom. Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot; is filmdom's most exquisite look into the unsavory aspects of humanity and brilliantly exploits it.<br />A review of Psycho would NEVER be complete without due praise and profound respect for Anthony Perkins tour de force audacity and seemingly endless nerve in playing Norman Bates. A role that was initially exceedingly unsympathetic in the Robert Bloch novel (in the novel Norman was an extremely overweight balding alcoholic who Bloch portrayed more as an unredeemable deviant than a human being), Hitchcock and Psycho screenwriter Joseph Stefano mutually agreed that for the film version of Psycho the Norman Bates character needed to be thin, moderately attractive, and advertently agreeable from his very first second of exposure in the film itself. When Hitchcock originally hired Anthony Perkins to play the \\"anti-hero\\" for his dark comedic thriller, Hitchcock permitted Perkins complete creative autonomy, as Hitchcock allowed for most of his actors in his films save the icy blonde female types of course (Tippi Hedren, Very Miles), for the role of the meekly sensitive emotionally unstable momma's boy, as long as Perkins could manipulate and contort his performance into the structure of Hitchcock's canvas. Voraciously relished with limitless freedom with his character, Perkins fashioned the archetypal template for all psychologically grounded horror films to follow. A role of apparently eternal nuances, infinitely perceivable levels of pathos, ravenously savage ironies, and an incalculable human tragic sincerity that endeared his doomed character to the hearts and minds of the audience. Perkin's Norman Bates, along with Karloff's portrayal of Frankenstein's monster, characterizes<BR>the absolute optimum emotional intensity, sincerity, and blatantly real authenticity feasibly possible in a performance. Perkin's slouched body language (signifying years of heinously excessive abuse), the bird-like chewing of candy corn, the inconsistent stuttering, and Perkins elastically flexible facial figures all contribute to one of cinema's most profoundly fundamentally indispensable performances in last hundred years. The fact that Perkins didn't even receive an Academy Award nomination for the role in 1960 is a repugnant oversight in itself. Unfortunately typecast by the monumental impact of this role, Perkins was forced to play psychotic madman roles for the rest of his career.<br />Not just the film's magnificent craft, Perkin's renowned ingenious performance, or Hitchcock's hideously tight narrative of Psycho are completely responsible for the film's rampant success, Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 gothic horror classic<BR>changed the way filmmakers viewed their occupation and enhanced film audiences' expectations as far as what the movies could do. Before Psycho, Hollywood was in the dying days of the age of sentiment. Hollywood produced pictures that were sentimental, emotional, and concerned about showcasing the human condition. Psycho with the savagery of Mother Bates butcher knife hacked through Hollywood sentiment and created the age of sensation. 60's movies such as Bonnie and Clyde, the Birds, Rosemary's Baby, Midnight Cowboy, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and the Wild Bunch are among many examples of how sixties filmmakers became liberated due to Hitchcock's magnificent defiance of conventional film guidelines with Psycho. As for the film's structure, musical accompaniment, direction, film editing, and acting performances, the film masterfully excels at all levels and is one of the important films in the last 100 years. The granddaddy of the modern horror movie and the inspiration for modern screen violence, Psycho is still a one of a kind Hitchcock masterwork. The DVD is superb edition to your DVD or video collection.

Drowned World/Substitute for Love and Bedtime Story are weak songs for a greatest hits album. I felt that the track Beautiful Stranger was not sounding like the original version on T.V.?

B00003CX5P|5.0|STAR WARS - EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE was an excellent movie! Whoever thought it was bad either a) must not be a true Star Wars fan or b) didn't understand it. Well, I have to say that I don't fit under either 'a' or 'b'! I just love this new second-part trilogy and totally can't wait for EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES! Anyway, THE PHANTOM MENACE was supposed to be the first chapter in the whole Star Wars sega. It's basically the introduction to how it all started, so of course it was a much &quot;lighter&quot; chapter because it was before the Dark Side. It's about how Naboo came under attack and the introduction of Anakin Skywalker (future Dark Vader, for those who are totally clueless) and all your other favorite characters. This is before Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Hans Solo so of course they wouldn't have been in this movie! I mean really people - what are you thinking? The only character whom I thought was semi-annoying was Jar Jar Binks. His character was slightly humerous, but mostly he was just stupid...although he's an important character in this Star Wars sega, and you'll find out later on. I thought the kid who played Anakin was okay. I mean, he wasn't the best but c'mon - give the poor guy a break! He was like, nearly eight years old or so when they filmed this. And George Lucas had chosen him out of thousands of other kids so there must have been something about him that caught Lucas's eyes. The other cast members like Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, etc. were also superb. Yes, they were a little stiff but I think that is what Lucas wanted. Even the storyline and plot weren't all that bad and the diolouge had some clever parts. And yes, the movie WAS long but aren't all Star Wars movies really long?<br />Anyway, now onto the DVD. The DVD for THE PHANTOM MENACE is fantastic! Seriously. This DVD is totally worth your money and much better than the boring video version which has like, nothing on it except forthe movie. It has all kinds of cool special features to it like never before seen footage, games, trivia, cast and crew interviews, a music video, the making of EPISODE I, visual effects, sound effects, and much, much more! This DVD is hours and hours of extra bonus footage and fun. The DVD itself comes in 2 discs. The picture quality for the movie is top-notch and (if you've got a big TV screen) it makes you feel like you're watching it in the movie theater again. You can watch the DVD over and over again and keep finding new stuff that you didn't discover before.<br />If you're starting a DVD collection, then I strongly urge you to go out and purchase this DVD for your collection. It is worth both the extra special features and the movie! Can't wait for A NEW HOPE, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and RETURN OF THE JEDI to be released on DVD. And when all six films are completed, I hope George Lucas will create a special box set featuring all six episodes with even more special features to add to the sega! THE PHANTOM MENACE is an excellent movie and I totally recommend it.

B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is yet another 'step' in Tool's quest to take the boundaries of 'music' to another level.  It took me at least 5 or 6 plays of this CD to come to this conclusion, however the vision of Maynard and Co. is clear - They are out to bring us something we have not heard before, and take us down to the depths of their music in the process (as opposed to just whack us in the face with something different or weird).  I guess that is what just hooks me to this band.  They are easy to dismiss on the surface with a 2 minute 'clip' to judge them on...but opening the package that they present with each CD is the joy - and challenge - of each new TOOL experience.<br />One cannot dismiss the power of their music, as well as Maynard's shedding of his soul and voice on every track.  This is real rock and roll a-la-2001, where everyone who listens these days wants something thrown in their face (be it lyrics that your mother would cry about or bass/guitar beats that whap you in the head head-on resulting in medical attention). Tool delivers a truly intense and intellectual present to us all.  Compared to earlier releases, this is a true progression for the Tool fan.  Yep, Undertow might be a better Tool CD for the 'virgin', and 'Aenima', well, flip a coin - loved it, but it is not your typical 'mainstream' rock CD!<br />Lateralus is primo Tool, one to take you on an 80 minute ride you will not soon forget. This CD is not a palatable as the latest 'similar-sounding' CD from 'Staind' (which I do love, by the way), however set aside some time and soak this *gem* in...
B00005OM4N|3.0|So Britney's confused, and so are we. She's &quot;Not Yet A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, but she declares &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, but also to &quot;Let Me Be&quot;. She has the image of a sex siren but wants to maintain her teenage image. She wants to recreate herself, yet stay safe. Guess that's why there's that feeling you've heard all this before. &quot;Slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; sound like songs Prince wrote for one of his harem (see Sheena Easton, Shiela E. , etc). &quot;Anticipating&quot; sounds eerily like Janet Jackson's &quot;All For You&quot; and &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot; could be mistaken for Janet's &quot;Someone To Call My Lover&quot;. Even &quot;Bombastic&quot; is a chord for chord rip-off of her own &quot;Oops... I Did It Again&quot;. Sing along with it and change the words. It works! Guess if you've run out of sources, why not plagerize yourself? The rest of the album could be off of any of the pop flavor of the month bands.  <br />The only exception to the trend is &quot;Not Yet A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, the Dido written track which is sung some honesty. And yet, Britney's able to take the best of all these elements and turn them into a very catchy collection of songs. And she pulls it off in her teasing captivating style, even if it's not all hers.
B000001FYZ|5.0|This CD was what was to become a victim of rock of the 80's - excess, loud, and all that great stuff.  Regardless, the Scorps delivered a powerhouse bunch of rock tunes as well as some classic 'slow' stuff that wasn't just rock ballad stuff (&quot;Winds of Change&quot;).<br />Can the icons of metal change?  Well, I would say that this CD proves it.  Scorps, after so many years of 'powerhouse rock' stuff, as well as classic rock ballads, something had to swing - and here you have it with 'Crazy World'.  There is underlying tone to most of the tunes here, as you can tell that they are ready to rock, but ready for some new forms of it - take their follow up CD's as an example...  <br />Either way, the bottom line is that this is one of the best Scorps CD's there is - period.  What they did after this or before is really not relevant - what matters is how you get into this CD for what it is - and it rocks, period.
B00004YRQA|4.0|Wish it held more. Games are getting more complicated needing more memory. But it'll do for most games for now.
B00005NGSD|4.0|I only gave this gem a 4 because I do admit I do like 'In Trance' and a few others from this part of the Scorps era just a bit better - however I must admit that this one holds a special place in my heart.  The 'Sails of Charon' and 'Steamrock Fever' are classic, and Uli had a major influence in these.  'The Riot of your Time' is simply one of those songs that only a true Scorps fan could appreciate - a real classic.<br />Bottom line is that this is a classic 70's rock CD from a band ahead of it's time - need I say more?  No hip-hop-in-your-face-mutha - just straight-ahead rock and roll with a great mix of 60's and 70's influences and great playing throughout - check these guys out if you haven't already!
0960191038|5.0|This book should be a required course in college. Professionals at any level would greatly benefit from this book. Suffice it to say, the Harvard PhD who suggested the book to me told me this book was one of the best things he learned out of his PhD experience. Strongly recommended!!
B000002JBG|5.0|I Like how Michael Jordan came together with Bugs and all the looney game for a comedy movie like this. Its a great movie. I love all the songs on the soundtrack.  All these songs get me pumped up and ready to jam. This movie is great for little kids let me tell you my niece and nephew love this movie and I do to. The songs are so perfect for the movie. Its just great how Michael would do a movie like that as big of a star as he is and its like its a based on a true story one cause its like talking about his life and how he quit basketball then went back so its a great movie and what else can i say about the sound track other then its a great one and has all big stars singing on it. The songs just fit so well with the movie.  They make you want to get up and dance.  At the beginning of the movie they have all the songs on there and just makes you want to get up and buggy on down.  Jesy
0385505833|4.0|John Grisham delivers a humorous Christmas parable, ending with a thoughtful message on the true meaning of the season in &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot;  The Kranks decide not to celebrate Christmas in a neighborhood obsessed with the yultide season.  This delivers a great deal of tension and angst for all.  The character are larger than life.  The author pokes fun at most holiday traditions and excesses.  The reader sorts through all of the chaos until a very satisfying ending.  This reader continues to enjoy Grisham's detours from legal thrillers.  The balance helps me better appreciate all aspects of his work.
B00003CX6P|3.0|A thriller which is not thrilling. The Italian policeforce are portrayed like idiots when the character of Matt Damon is far from clever and HELPED by 2 fantastic solutions...<BR>The actors and the Italian landscape are a joy; Jude Law steals every scene he`s in. The film has a strong gay overtone, but as with the story,  it doesn`t deliver into a catharsis and the last 30 minutes are full of stupid people who doesn`t seem 2 understand that Mr Ripley is a &quot;wacko&quot;...
B00005BL2A|4.0|I don't think this album sucked but after all these years of DM albums this one is not like all the rest.  As a DM fan I enjoy it but the majority of the tracks are slower and not as upbeat as other albums.  Even after seeing the concert for this album you can tell how slow the album is because most of the songs from the album are played near the middle when you only need one or two people on stange and the rest are taking a break.  If you're a fan of DM you'll want this for your collection but if you're not already a fan I'd suggest trying the preview tracks first.
B00005RIKD|4.0|If you don't like jazz, chances are, you won't like this one too much.  I feel that many of his classics are very well re-arranged on this cd with a jazzy touch.  My favourites are the openning track Fragile, Perfect Love...Gone Wrong, Dienda and Moon Over Bourbon Street. I only wish that his rendition of Windmills Of Your Mind is included here.<br />Sting has clearly matured and this cd probably marks the beginning of another stage of his career, one where the element of jazz will be stronger than ever before.  I suspect most of his fans like myself will welcome this move.  After all, it's not that that different from before.  He's a real artist.<br />Just kick back at home, turn up the volume, and sip a scotch whisky whilst you listen to this cd.  It feels great !
0385505833|5.0|We have all felt the same way the main character feels at Christmas time so when I picked this book up I expected the same old story about a scrooge, but with in just a few pages I was laughing out loud. I read this book aloud to my husband and children and they too were laughing along with all the funny antics this gentleman gets into. I would like to see this book be made into a holiday movie, it would be my favorite to watch. I have since passed this book on to friends but when it is returned to me I will absoultly read it again.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|I watched it this weekend and it was slow.  I finished it because I don't like to see half a movie.  But really, it was like watching Ground Hog Day without the Humor.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac emits a certain type of atmosphere that is so prevelant in the music of Radiohead.  It is like an emptiness.  A post nuclear holocaust air.  This album is more abstract that KID A, but more accessible.  It's more acoutic.  There are more structured songs.  The airy, psych experience is still there.  The sonics are perfect.  The total production is perfect from beginning to end.  There is nothing critical I can say about this.  Radiohead puts so much thought in all their albums, that it shines through and the result is a new listening experience each time.  Truly one of the best recordings I have ever heard in 50 years.  There really is nothing to say about this except you have to buy it.  Just buy the disc.
B00005NGSE|5.0|Finally! I've been looking for this CD for a long time, seems like my prayers have been answered! I was jamming this cassette back in '83 while in H.S. HUGE album! I haven't heard it in probably 15 years, but I remember it very well. Ulrich Roth (Uli Jon Roth) was and is one of the all time best guitar players and it shows on this one; the awesome vocals of Klause Meine only add to the experience. This is one of the best live albums I've ever heard. All Night Long, We'll Burn the Sky and Polar nights absolutely rule! I strongly recommend Scorpions' 'Virgin Killer' as well, I cannot emphasize how good Ulrich Roth is.
B00002NDB1|5.0|Iron Maiden has done a dynamite job with this album, Blaze and Jannick haters beware!!!.  Blaze is not as good as Bruce at least not with maiden, but he does superior with his deep vocal range.  it still does have evrything maiden should have though.  Steve Harris still has the awesome clean sounding lightning speed bass with his dynamic songwriting.  dave and Jannick sore great together, with excellence, and Nicko Mcbrain being very solid, maybe not his best drumwork on some of the songs but still excellent all the same.<br />Futureal-Opens fast, with a great raw repeative solo, nailed with excellent bass, and the its a very cool sci-fi type of song, Dave tears the lightning solo up.<br />Angel &amp; the Gambler-ok maybe if u hear it the first time, u might not like it, but try to listen to it some, and ull be surprised how awesome it really is, the keyboards are very cool, and a different type of keyboard maiden sound.  As always cool lyrics, u even start to enjoy the repeative chorus over and over again, also the solos are sweet kind of get a classic rock type of feel to them.<br />Lightning Strikes twice-powerhouse achievment,awesome melody, once again the solos are sweet and how they jam is awesome especially towards the end.<br />The Clansman-Based on the film Braveheart, this song is incredible and a major metal classic.  You get a major british metalfeelfrom it, the opening raw bass sound is incredible, Blaze sings his heart out and Nicko does absolutely spectacular on the drumming.<br />When two worlds collide-interesting lyrics,cool song, chorus rocks, and the opening of the song u get a major pink floyd feel to it,and the repeative solos are cool too.<br />The Educated Fool-Great melody, oh come on and ur going to tell me these lyrics arent very good?  The song is dynamic though the chorus is overly repeative i suppose, but is still cool all the same, great tune.<br />Dont look to the Eyes of a stranger(continuing saga to Killers)-Awesome tune, i luv howthe keyboards sound, creepy, kind of odd sound at first but u get into it fast. Also the mid melody with the bass is awesome, ull know what i mean when u hear it.<br />Como Estas Amigos-This is a beautiful song, Jannick's solo is perfecto on here, so beautiful a very sad deep, deep song.  Its truly incredible and blaze sings his heart out.<br />The only thing i see different with x factor and XI is alot more melody, but melody is awesome and is very complicated to create, the repeative lead here is quite awesome because it builds up when they drive and nail the solos a whole lot longer.  Blaze did awesome with maiden while he was with them, and this is indeed a true metal classic. Everyone listen to the album for a bit and it will grow on everyone fast who luvs true metal.  UP THE IRONS!!!
B00003CXDD|2.0|I've seen this movie several dozen times.  I remember the two-headed monster and the morphing special effects.<br />What I remember the most, though, is two old ladies fighting.  It's rather comical, if you think about it.
B000007T1M|2.0|Ok i happen to find SOAD an ok band, simple easy guitar, good bass, good drumming, and the vocals arent too shabby either.  I think Sugar is an ok kind of funny song, but all in all for my taste i think Spiders is the best song off of here, terriffic lyrics, and music all together.  But i think the song shouldve been longer because of how dark and deep it was. All in all SOAD is ok and sound alot better then alot of these bands today.  At least the guy actually sings.  The thing is though, is that SOAD is not metal at all.  Not even Nu Metal, there is not such a thing as nu metal, SOAD are just good old hard rock, and ill take it over the rap/rock mix anyday, so hardcore rockers enjoy the album.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the way to see this film.  The composition of the shots is a feast for the eyes!  As for the complaints about the actor's faces looking &quot;bleached,&quot; duh, it's called England.  It is famous for being cold, and not having a lot of sunny tanned faces.  If it's tans you want, watch Bay Watch!  I suspect that the Standard version might have been colorized.  But that hardly ruins the film one way or the other.
B00004RD54|4.0|Despite expectations from critics to be the post-Beatles savior of rock, New York street poet, Lou Reed's initial solo career was filled with inconsistency and sharp turns. Reed's first work after leaving the trailblazing alternative rock band, the Velvet Underground, was a calm, folky, 1972 self-entitled debut. It was followed that same year by the bouncy glam rock of Transformer, which was trailed in 1973 by the bleak and disparaging Berlin. By the time Rock N Roll Animal, his first live album, was released in March of 1974; fans and critics should have forfeited most of their predictions for Reed. When compared to the utter desolation of Berlin, Rock N Roll Animal's feistiness and sleekness make it another drastic alteration in the flavor of Reed's work.<br />Reed, along with a stunning pair of lead guitarists, blazes through the seven songs of Rock N Roll Animal with a full, glossy sound and cohesive energy, stretching the tracks with extensive guitar duals and sparkling, improvisational riff rocking. The techniques employed on the album are more like those of honky tonk, southern rock outfits than anything taught in the New York school of sneering artrock the Velvet Underground founded. Although unexpected, the approach is triumphant. The extra oomph of Rock N Roll Animal delivers the definitive versions of the Velvets songs, \\"Sweet Jane,\\" \\"White Light/White Heat\\" and \\"Rock `n' Roll,\\" (an anthem that was left sounding utterly non-anthemic by the laidback style of the band's final album) and nicely buttresses the sneer of \\"Caroline Says I\\" and \\"How Do You Think It Feels?\\" both from Berlin. Reed did a fine job of selecting songs for Rock N Roll Animal. Each has an aura of extreme turmoil (\\"Heroin,\\" \\"Lady Day\\") or extreme elation (\\"Sweet Jane\\" \\"Rock `n' Roll\\") that makes it fit to be energized by the album's modus operandi.<br />Of coarse the techniques employed on Reed's next albums would be considerably different from those of Rock N Roll Animal. 1974's Sally Can't Dance and 1975's Lou Reed Live, the latter featuring sadly conventional versions of his biggest hits, were overtly commercial, while the 1975's Metal Machine Music featured literally nothing but feedback, distortion and other noises. Reed's solo career would finally reach a degree of maturity with 1975's Coney Island Baby and 1976's Rock N Roll Heart, works whose dark, sober feel would leave only memories of Reed's hectic, unpredictable early days. Throughout his early history of surprises, the sleek and buzzed Rock N Roll Animal was Lou Reed's most pleasant.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|I didn't know what to think of this film when I saw it, so I saw it with a pretty open mind.  It stunk.  This is the most wandering, stupid, over-budgeted waste I have seen in a long time.  Jim was given plenty to do, largely because he had to fill-in a character who didn't exist on the script.  The town is composed of vaccuous rat-faced idiots, and and a meandering plot searching for somthing to say beyond Christmas involving spending money, and The Grinch not liking it.  What a waste!
B0000060NF|5.0|Popular music had long been a hotbed for personal reflection and social commentary when Marvin Gaye's classic, What's Going On, was released in 1971, yet the album was still a groundbreaker. Little of the LP's personal reflections and social commentary was expected from its prolific label, Motown Records. The leading R&amp;B label, founded by entrepreneur, Berry Gordy in 1959, avoided the heated sociopolitical wars being fought in popular music in the 1960s and specialized in infectious, sugarcoated pop tunes. With Motown as its leader, R&amp;B music in general was syrupy. Although his baby-faced charisma and soulful, beefy voice always drew special notice, Marvin Gaye seemed to be one of many of the genre's nicely manicured, unperturbed pop stars. This entire situation changed the day Gaye's brother returned from Vietnam.<br />Gaye's soul had been stirred and his social conscious awaken. Music became his meditation. The singer blossomed as a songwriter, penning (with support from Mo-Town's crew) a charmingly beautiful and powerfully affecting album of social concerns (\\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology\\"),\\" \\"Inner City Blues\\"), spiritual affirmations (\\"Wholly Holy\\" \\"God Is Love\\") and intelligent mantras (\\"Right On\\" the title track). What's Going On featured not only beautiful lyrics but also Gaye's voice is at its strongest. The newfound poignancy of his words called for deeper conviction and his spotless, versatile vocals delivered stunningly. As a poem \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" would be affecting; Gaye's perfect vocals make it absolutely tearjerking.  Musically, What's Going On keeps a relaxed feel. Gaye's musings are backed with a full, jazzy, breezy sound, sporting a loose, yet gorgeous, array of strings, horns and Gaye's nicely positioned, overdubbed vocals. Sonically and lyrically the album is unpolluted beauty.<br />Even so, What's Going On was met with resistance. Berry Gordy, always a shrewd businessman, did not want to release the it, worrying about the societal repercussions and lack of sales potential of \\"protest songs.\\" Eventually, What's Going On, was released and changed the face of R&amp;B forever. Immediately artists such as Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder reconsidered their roles and begat a series of socially and spiritually conscious work. Modern artists such as Lauryn Hill and Jill Scott are successors of the What's Going On-era Marvin Gaye. Gordy's cleanly cut pop soldiers and cookie cutter hits were a thing of the past. The poignant, conscientious sound of What's Going On was the future of R&amp;B and the genre never sounded so soulful.
B00003CXQY|4.0|This is a noisy film, but a fun one.  I certainly would recommend it over one of Disney's typical cookie-cutter musicals.  I just wish it went even further with the zany humor and forgot about trying to be &quot;deep,&quot; or give it a &quot;message.&quot;  People want to laugh, not get preached at on the importance of *a friend*.
0140149295|5.0|hello to whoever is reading this.  although i have not yet read the book i cant wait. i orderd the book for the simple reason of the movie &quot;The Hurricane&quot;  when i saw that i was so inspirerd by his courage and will to fight for his rights that i just knew i had to have that book as soon as.  so i went around to book stores and none of them had it so i came here and this site is so handy and helpfull. anyway from the reviews i have read and from seeing the movie i cant wait until it comes and i am sure that it will be a great book.  <BR>I know this because   Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter is a great role model and inspiring.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I really enjoyed all of this musical - the story,the drama,the music(of course),the educational aspects of it.The actors are well chosen;and the addition of extras like interviews  made it even more interesting.This is something that is really 'safe' for family viewing,for there is no violence,nudity,curse words - it's quite a change from most that is out there.All were portrayed realistically,and very honestly.It was very educational to see where some of the actors we meet in the beginning were in the end.The nuns are shown as normal human beings,with a very positive image of Mother Abbot - something that is rarely seen,as more often religious heroes are shown removed from realistic life.Anyway,this is something that is worthwhile to buy and watch again and again!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I had Donde Estan Los Ladrones so i bought her this Cd and it's wondeful again.Although there are songs in English they are wonderful.But Ojos Asi is better in Spanish i don't like it in English very much but it's ok.So a wonderful cd waiting for all Shakira fans.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I've been a fan of Shakira since first hearing her during a semester in Spain in 1997. My friends and I have followed her since, and think she's a pretty amazing, multitalented woman. Eat your heart out, Christina!<br />&quot;Laundry Service&quot; is one of those albums that grows on you. I was impressed with her ability to master English in such a short period of time. But in the English songs, it seems her focus on pronunciation and eliminating her accent prevent her true voice from shining through; that's why &quot;Suerte&quot; sounds fresher than the English version, &quot;Whenever, Wherever.&quot; I think in time she'll become more comfortable with Enlgish and that gap will disappear.<br />One thing to note: While Shakira did write most of the lyrics (Spanish and English), the one song that everyone here has roundly panned, &quot;Eyes Like Yours,&quot; was actually written by Gloria Estefan.
B00005RFAI|4.0|well i've always loved p!nk's first album and i think she has one of the best voices in music today... its so funky and man i dunno i just love that girl's voice... anyway after my wave of britney and boybands i was looking for some nice rockin ladies like nikka costa (awesome album!) and p!nk's new album is just what i need. it's a mix of r&amp;b rock blues ...like alanis nikka and destiny's child. i would give the album a 5 ..but for some reason it doesn't sound like a totally new thing..and some of the songs are a bit bland...<BR>M!issundaztood (4.5/5)... a nice funky song... almost a capella and the end is pretty funny<br />Dont let me get me (5/5)... awesome song... i can totally relate to these lyrics...<br />just like a pill (5/5) ..i think this is her next single.. another rad song... probably my fave... ya just listen to it and feel so empowered...<br />get the party started (4.5/5) ..we've all heard this.. fun party song...<br />respect (3/5)... her &quot;rap song&quot; just the average corny but cute rap track<br />18 wheeler (5/5) another great track... makes ya feel strong<br />family portrait (3.5/5)...even though i dont directly relate i could really feel this song the first time i heard... you can tell it has alot of meaning.. nice slow song<br />misery (4/5) her voice blends well with steven ... bluesy track with the organ and all... its kool but it sounds like some other song too... i could see christina aguilera singing it too..<br />dear diary (3.8/5) ..i like the chorus alot... it was playing in the background of the mtv diary and i was like wow that song is awesome... its pretty kool .. another song with meaning<br />eventually (1/5).. i can't get myself to listen to this whole song...its just really boring and has no melody..<br />lonely girl (4/5)... another great deep song... i really like it excpet for linda perry in the end... ugh she messed up the song<br />numb (4.5/5).. great track.. last rockin song on the album<br />gone to cali (3/5)..really slow... i gotta be in the mood to listen to this... but being from philly i know what shes talkin about ...<br />my vietnam (2.5/5) another slow track...she sang this with her dad on diary... again gotta be in that chill mode to listen to it<br /> overall its a good album with some slow and boring points but not bad for a complete change in her sound
B00005RFAI|1.0|I don't really see much talent in Pink as a Artist.now She went for a Different Pop take here but Her voice really doesn't have much Range.Overall this is Standard Pop Material but given Coded Words.alot of the Material is pretty Much Derivative of what Happen in the past couple of years.it's cool to Bite over time but not where it's like last week?She will Be Lost in the Gwyenn Stefani Clone Era.

0783225792|3.0|Good enough to own, but not one of my favorite mob movies. I find the narration a little annoying, kind of like a book on tape, but it's a good story.
B00003CXAA|2.0|I love the godfather move and i did wait to get this item so long and now that i have it, I wish i did not.  They only made it widescreen.  They did not even think of people that do not like widescreen.  I have over 7 friends that were going to buy it, but they have changed there minds.
B00005QG9J|2.0|This being one of the most anticipated albums of the year for me, I was quite sorry to hear it.  Rather than depending on solid musical prowess to steer the tracks, Incubus turns to moaning wails and gimmicks to keep their listeners interested.  What they end up with is a listener--at least on this end--sorely disappointed in the new direction that this band has taken.<br />No band should produce identical replicas in their albums, but generally a band's new direction should be forward instead of back.  Granted, the single &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is sweet, in a bland sort of way.  But the song lacks the quirky quality that made &quot;Stellar&quot; so captivating.  While some say that Incubus has become more happy, the truth is they're just more boring.  Their weak attempts at the unexpected don't hide the fact that Morning View is all too predictable; most of the time, these little moments just look ridiculous.<br />Need I mention the Chinese-restaurant soundtrack or the full two minutes of chirping crickets?<br />Though Incubus' inherent genius sometimes surfaces in this ho-hum album, most of the time it leaves one wanting to turn on the soft-rock radio station for some edgier entertainment.  If you want great Incubus, buy S.C.I.E.N.C.E.
0553106635|5.0|The series thus far in a word: rocks!  Action and intrigue that keeps you riveted and begging for more.  Just don't get too attached to any character; heads roll any time, any where (The Red Wedding crept up and bit hard!).  The first book in this series brought me back to reading fantasy, and each subsequent tale has built up the tension.  I can't wait for the next book to be released!
B00005O3VD|5.0|FUNNY GIRL stars a suspenseful pace, dazzling production values, thoroughly entertaining musical numbers, and a young woman who tickles the soul from the opening scene to the last. Isobel Lennart's topnotch screenplay and expert direction by William Wyler (BEN-HUR) make adapting a Broadway musical to film seem painless. The A-plus DVD (with FUNNY GIRL's original aspect ratio, Overture, Entr'acte after Intermission, and Exit Music) turns the already thrilling FUNNY GIRL into the movie theater rollercoaster of yesterday.  (The &quot;Don't Rain On My Parade&quot; sequence pumps the heart like BEN-HUR's chariot race.)
014028009X|5.0|if i could, i would rate this book with as many stars as possible. i have owned this book for about 3 years and have read it more times than i can count, each time laughing and loving it more and more. although i can not relate to everything bridget does, i can relate to her emotions facing work and family. this book gives me hope that there is that boy with whom you used to play naked in the paddling pool is out there waiting  <BR>the movie is also very good but i would recommend reading the book first.
630460291X|4.0|I've never seen a DVD split the movie between two discs or two sides of one disc, but that is what was done with the DVD edition of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.  I don't particularly enjoy having to get up and flip the disc over halfway through to watch the second part of the movie.  Other than that, I find this movie quite entertaining.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Right now, and probably for a while, this is my favorite movie! It is awsome! I saw it in the theater and when I left I was filled with feelings of happiness and excitment. It was fun to watch with humor for all ages and lots of &quot;feel good&quot; moments. It is a very creative story with wonderful characters! :)
0679409998|4.0|Among the many themes of Frankenstein, one of them is that of friendship, ambition, and the conflict between the two.  The message is that the deeper need of the two is friendship, but that we are susceptible to the temptations of ambition, which can destroy friendship.<br />Ostensibly, Victor Frankenstein had an unselfish mission to \\"benefit all mankind\\" with his scientific project.  His \\"selfless\\" ambition failed him and proved to aim at self-glory because he wanted to create a race that would bless him as its father.  In Captain Walton's second letter to his sister, we learn that although he has a well-trained crew, he has no soul companion; this need he regards as a \\"most severe evil.\\"  Walton's exploration of the secluded and frozen Arctic serves as a metaphor for how his ambition has removed him from society.  His ambition even threatened his own and his crew members' lives when ice surrounded and trapped his boat.  Likewise, this is where Victor's ambition leads him when he's hunting down the monster in futility.  The message is that if one sets out ambitiously to benefit mankind, once that person has acheived their goal, their prominence sets them apart from the same society they set out to benefit.<br />Victor had a much more intense ambition than Walton, with corespondingly more disasterous results.  As Frankenstein prepared for his project, he isolated himself from his friends and family to laboriously study the sciences and he would later postpone his marriage for this project.  The embodiment of his ambition, the repulsive monster, would eventually slay several of Victor's loved family members, including his fiance on their wedding night.  Even the monster feels as his deepest need a human relationship, which he has none and which is the very thing that turned him from good to evil.  While observing an impoverished family, \\"the bitter gall of envy\\" arose in the monster.  He considers them rich because they have the companionship of each other even though they are in financial poverty.  When Frankenstein rejects the monster's pleas to create for him a mate of the same race,  the monster sets out on an unstoppable path to destruction and an ambitious one indeed.  The novel links ambition with destruction, particularly destruction of companionship and conveys friendship as a great , if not greatest, need for man.<br /> I don't think the story conveys that all ambition is destructive.  At the end of the story, Victor has great regret for the results of his ambition, but he still has pride for his effort.  Although he cautions us that we would be better off to believe our \\"native town to be the world,\\" he adds, \\"yet another may succeed.\\"  You could interpret this as Victor not \\"learning his lesson;\\" that mankind will continue to give in to harmful passions.  Another, much different analysis could be that this story portrays that limited ambition, integrated with society and not aimed at self-glory, can be virtuous.  After all, for the teenage author of a classic, enduring novel to tell us that all ambition will destroy us would be a contradiction.though they are in financial poverty.

0385505833|2.0|I couldn't help suspecting that there was an underlying mean-spiritedness about this short novel.  The characters evoke not a single emotion and the overall feeling is flat.  There are better stories about Christmas, both happy and sad.  Skipping Christmas isn't one I'll read again.
B000002KKS|4.0|When Tony Iommi sat in the studio recording this album, he no doubt felt confident that it would be the milestone album that took Black Sabbath to new heights of popularity and made fans forget all about Ozzy Osbourne. Of course, that didn't happen.<br />Heaven And Hell is a milestone album, not for proving that there is life after Ozzy, but for introducing Ronnie James Dio - a relatively unknown vocalist - to the world. Backed by Iommi's dense, blistering riffs, Geezer's bonecrunching bass lines and Bill's thunderous drums, Dio's powerful voice rocks hard, sailing through the first track, the lightning fast Neon Knights, and trudging through the last track, Lonely Is The Word.<br />Dio's lyrics are for the most part pretty good. The only clunkers are Wishing Well and Walk Away, two corny, cheeseball (translation: sell-out) tracks penned in a blatant attempt to garner hit singles. They didn't make it. Instead, Neon Knights hit the charts. Go figure. :o)<br />When Heaven And Hell first came out, diehard Sabbath fans like myself were left scratching their heads. Never Say Die, the last album made during Ozzy's tenure, was a brilliant, bold experimental album that introduced jazz riffing into the mix (the song Air Dance featured simulataneous guitar and piano jazz solos) and featured Ozzy's best lyrics ever. <br />Heaven And Hell was a big step backward for the band, musically speaking. Not that the music wasn't good, it just wasn't their best. As musicians, Iommi, Butler, and Ward were capable of far more than what the post-Ozzy albums had to offer. In Dio's case, the reason is simple - he's a one-dimensional singer. His voice had the power, but lacked the color and texture that made Ozzy's voice so remarkable and adaptable to different musical styles.<br />Tony Iommi's gambit failed to pay off. This album wasn't nearly as successful as Ozzy's first solo record, Blizzard Of Ozz. The follow-up to H&amp;H, The Mob Rules, bombed big time, and Dio was fired after the MR tour ended. Iommi recorded more albums under the Black Sabbath name with different singers fronting the band. None of those albums were as successful as Ozzy's solo records, either.<br />Still, I've always liked Ronnie James Dio, and Heaven And Hell, the best of post-Ozzy Black Sabbath, is a good, solid album that rocks hard. It belongs in every true metal fan's CD rack.
B00005OM4N|5.0|You won't believe your ears when you give this CD a listen.  Song after song could hit the radio and be a smash.  I wasn't going to buy it, but somebody gave it to me two weeks ago and I haven't stop listening to it.  It's obvious that Janet Jackson is an influence, as the next single, &quot;Anticipating&quot; reminds of recent/early Janet.  You could actually call BRITNEY, Britney's &quot;Control&quot; record, the one that makes the difference and reaches a whole new fan base.  My favorite song is the 2nd cut, &quot;Overprotected.&quot;  Some of the negative reviews makes me think that the reviewers didn't even listen to the record.  Give this one a chance!
0767812166|5.0|It is such a sad thing that the great actress Karen Allen has not made much films lately. I just absolutely love her in this small gem of a film. I saw this back when I was a kid and I still cry in the ending where &quot;Starman&quot; tells her again good-bye. She just made this movie work. Not to say that Jeff Bridges performance wasn't good enough to deserve an Oscar nomination but why did Karen Allen get left out of a nomination? Her performance was also equal to that of Jeff Bridgers. I mean from a grieving widow who hit the bottle, to being able to show the true emotions of being scared and a willing hostage and to finally fall in love again and that tear jerking ending where she doesn't want him to leave. That part...I have to say looked so real, she showed what it really is to be left behind. But to me what really made me a fan of hers was the part of the movie where she asks him what his planet is like. He says that his planet is civilized. She looks at him and smiles. He then tells her what he will miss of &quot;the planet earth&quot; is the music, the singing, the dancing. She is looking at him expecting him to say that he will miss her too. You can just see her hope of wanting him to say the right thing. That he will say he will miss her most of all. But her hopes are dashed when he says &quot;and all the others things&quot;. Her face just falls and you can just see hurt in her eyes mixed with love and little bit of hope that he will say the right thing later. I love that scene. Don't ask me why. I guess it is true that anyone who sees a movie sees something different. The role of Jenny Hayden must of been a hard role. It had to be to have to express so many emotions. If Julia Roberts won an Oscar for having the ability to say four-letter-words on cue then why the hell couldn't Karen Allen have been nominated back when this movie came out. Ohh the injustice of it all. Well I just hope Karen Allen makeing more movies. She is a wonderful actress who is beautiful and talented.
0671027379|5.0|I just love books like this that respect the reader so much.  It's so readable, completely unselfindulgent, and you're happily entrenched in escape-from-the-world mode from cover to cover.  Also, personally I'm a great fan of all the amazing new technology that comes out but I'd never have time to learn about it. In Dan Brown's books, one of the things I look forward to is knowing that he's going to teach me about all the cool new stuff, in a way that shows how it might all actually be used, for good or for evil, and I always come away feeling like my knowledge is right there on the cutting edge! I just have a ton of respect for an author who does so much homework about interesting things and does such a good job at making it so much fun to absorb for his readers.  It's something I've always liked about Tom Clancy, but I now think I like Dan's books more because they always keep the energy level up and don't drag on with filler like it seems Clancy's books now do.<br />I find Dan's books somehow entertain me in the effortless, direct way a great movie does: I can just sit down and sink into the great story and, and I mean this in the best possible way, I don't really have to think; it's not like reading, it's more like watching a great flick. You kind of just sit back and enjoy the ride - the story just flows into you.  I'm always sad to finish them because life seems so mundane afterward.<br />Anyway, great stuff.
1577311523|5.0|This is a spot of light in the darknes something that can really help to anyone to find the inner self and the meaning of life. Most of self esteem and espiritual books are full of inspiring histories that might inspire to someone but thats it. However the Power of Now goes beyond that and build a espiritual path or a bridge to life enlightment, joy and peace. The best of a had read so far. Make yourself a favor and buy it and give it to others.
B00004Z459|5.0|If you have trouble expressing your feelings, this is THE cd for you. It is hardcore, yet soothing and you never want to stop listning to it. It'll get you pumped up or calm you down...you can't miss this CD! Buy it now or you WILL miss something big.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I have enjoyed the great banquet of Lord Of The Rings for over 30<BR>years and have anticipated the film and music that would do justice to Tolkein's expansive vision. My thanks to you Peter Jackson for this magnificent film and to you Howard Shore for the music that brings it to life. This superb score takes me from the comfort of the Shire into the black of Moria and the terror of Khazad Dum, onward to Lothlorien and down the great river toward Mordor. You have captured the emotional tone of friendship, courage, sacrifice and the powerful endurance of love. This musical score is a feast and a triumph.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Just keep on making music for the fans.....Paul McCartney hasn't sold the millions he has because he isn't top notch......listening to the critics down through the years, you'd think he was a light-weight....not the most commercially successful artist in the history of music.....<br />This one is another solid release.  My personal favorite is track #15 &quot;Rinse The RainDrops&quot;......many other top rate songs are also included.<br />Thanks again Sir Paul for bringing your fans so much joy over the years....I just can't wait for the next McCartney release!!!
B0000057C5|5.0|Again Rammsteins seems to amaze the U.S. with another album.  This album is much different then Herzeleid, This album is a little slower but still hard enough to please the newcomer Rammstein fan.  Sehnsucht is a good beginning, having one of the faster song start then go into a slower song Engel.  To most Americans Du Hast was the song heard by Rammstein, a smart choice to bring this song to the U.S. because it is unique to commen American music and unique to most other Rammstein songs.  The powerful voice of Till(vocalist) saying, &quot;Du, Du hast, Du hast mich,&quot; gets the attention of the listener.  Overall the album is great, it doesn't displease devoted Rammstein fans, infact I'm sure a lot of Rammstein fans will lable this Album their favorite, but every Album they have put out is worthy of that title.
B00004XONN|4.0|Every song on this album is infectious (save for the skipable \\"Treefingers\\"), you just can't help but listen to it.  The first time I listened to \\"Kid A,\\" I was blown away by how awful I thought it was.  \\"This is ... compared to 'OK Computer',\\" I moaned.  However, after a few more listens I realized that this album was a monumental achievement from arguably one of the best bands on the planet.  It's not \\"OK,\\" but that's okay, for \\"Kid A\\" has a completely different sound, which makes it a stand-out disc.  Really, I love \\"OK\\" but a band must progress...and boy have they.  Some stand-out tracks include the bass-riff driven \\"National Anthem\\" (check out this track on their new live disc--you'll be blown away!), \\"Optimistic,\\" the electronica driven \\"Idioteque,\\" and finally \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack.\\"  But the best track on this disc, arguably one of their if not THE best Radiohead song is \\"How To Disappear Completely.\\"  It's gorgeous, operatic, simple yet dense, just simply amazing!  Buy this album if only for this track.  Four proud stars--some of their best work.  [Also, check out \\"Amnesiac,\\" a more listener friendly and ultimately slightly better album.  You won't be disappointed.]
B00003CXA4|5.0|This movie is the translation of Richard Attenborough's incredible understanding of the incredible human being, Gandhi. I have watched this movie more than 10 times trying to do what Richard Attenborough requests us to do in the beginning of the film, that is, &quot;...find one's way to the man's heart...&quot;.  Every time I see it, I feel so much reverence for the spirit of the man.  I am immensely grateful to Richard Attenborough and Ben Kingsley for having brought Gandhi back to life in a lifetime that needs a leader like Gandhi as much as ever before in history.  If not for this movie, I would have missed out so much indeed...!<br />I just bought the DVD and it is great. I only wish there was an interview of Richard Attenborough in the DVD. I can't imagine the DVD being released without Richard Attenborough's thoughts in it as, after all, it was his 20-year long passion that made the movie possible.  Ben Kingsley's interview is in it and that's great..!<br />If another DVD is released with Richard Attenborough's interview in it, I would certainly buy that too...!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Looking at other reviews, many are quick to compare &quot;Amnesiac&quot; to &quot;Kid A&quot; (it's inevitable, due to the close release dates of both albums, not to mention their sound).  And that's okay; comparisons help you understand a work.  But &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is really a stand-out album.  The lyrics are more understandable (not necessarily a good thing, just nicer), the songs are much more rock-driven, and the band seems to meld together more effectively.  Every track is amazing (even the hard to listen to yet oddly enjoyable &quot;Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors&quot;), and even though all are essentially great tracks, some stand-outs are &quot;You And Whose Army?&quot; &quot;I Might Be Wrong,&quot; &quot;Life In A Glasshouse,&quot; and &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; (check out this song on their new live album--the piano and strings give it a whole new and beautifully simple sound).  But the best track on this album is &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;--a piano-driven song with a huge beat change half-way through, and Thom's vocals are at their hauntingly best.  Five stars--their best album next to the pinnacle, &quot;OK Computer&quot;!
B00003CXRM|5.0|O Brother Where Art Thou is by far one of the funniest movies I seen in years.  The humor is subtle in parts.  The humor is not your typical hollywood guy running down the street with butt showing..instead this is the thinking person humorous movie.  I have met people who simply didn't get this movie because they fail to see the humor of the dialoge.  <br />Hollywood has programmed this generation that if the joke doesn't revolve around sex or nudity it can't be funny.  One of the best parts of this movie is the ability to see the level of humor in polar opposite such as Everett and Delmar.  The two are complete mental opposies.  Everett is the &quot;brains&quot; and Delmar is the &quot;lack there of&quot;.  I think the balance of this movie is found in these two characters.  <br />However, the two  characters are joined by a third person who fills in the gaps of Everett and Delmar.  His name was Pete.  Now Pete seems a cut above Delmar mentally but, he falls short of Everett.  So what we find is a nice mix of Intellivence,Ignorance, and dumb innocense.   The 3 amigos face challenge after challenge to reach &quot;the treasure&quot;.  Along the way, they find abilities they didn't know they had, make friends with bible salesman, and pick up hitch-hickers.  All the while the trio find themselves in the middle of some of the best comedic situations on earth.  In short, If you like a movie that is funnier the 2nd time you watch it.  Get O Brother!<br />Thanks,<br />The Real McCoy
B000002H33|5.0|This cd has so much power in it. the vocals are simply awesome, and kirk and jason and lars do a very nice job on the guitar, bass, and drums (james does good on guitar, too). the song sanitarium has a nice switch about three minutes into the song from ballad to headbang. that song is probably the best on the cd, but its so hard to rate the songs because they are all outstanding. Damage inc gets a little old, but its still very cool. this is a great metallica cd to start out with, as are all of them. Metallica keeps the creepy feeling going from the previous two cds. i will not say it is THE best cd, but its one of them.<br />P.S.  I can't stand people who think Reload and alike are bad just because they aren't as hard.  its still good music people!
0871137380|5.0|My wife and I took a short vacation and I packed this book in our luggage. <br />Big mistake.<br />My head was buried in this book so deep, it would've taken a major earth mover to dig it out.<br />Some people criticize Bowden's writing style, but I think it's perfect for this book. He tells the story like it is. He tells it and YOU FEEL IT.<br />I finished the book in 48 hours. (And probably would've finished sooner if not for the dark looks coming from my wife's general direction.)<br />I told a couple of buddies about the book and they polished it off in a single reading.<br />It's that good.<br />God bless the guys who go out there and do what they do.<br />Let's hope the film does the book and the soldiers justice.
B00004VVNC|3.0|This is a beautifully made movie. The photography, particularly the composition and landscape work is enjoyable even before the actors start to speak. The costumes and sets are first class, and the actors all acquit themselves well. Director Zwick made good choices with all the lead roles, choosing star names who turn in good performances. Hopkins' performance loses subtlety towards the end, and Brad Pitt is sometimes too expressionless, but Aidan Quinn never wavers, and Henry Thomas displays the quality of innocence which led to Spielberg casting him as the star of E.T. as a boy actor. James Horner's music is emotional and appropriate, however it is sometimes too prominent in the mix. With five major stars, the film gives them equal prominence, so it would have benefited from making the characters more sympathetic. However this is a personal thing (and of course taken from the novel rather than created by the film people and you might like the realistic portrayal of rounded characters, neither wholly good, nor wholly bad. The plot is a little predictable, but this is not unusual for subject matter of this type. Just sit back and enjoy the scenery and performances.
6304198523|5.0|One of the better videos I have seen in a long time.  A fantastic twist at the end.  Thrilling. Kevin Spacey was excellent, as was Pete Pestlewaite.
0451160916|5.0|My whole reason for reading this book was to find out how much Kubrick diverged from the novel in making his film.  And I was thoroughly shocked at how different the two are and yet how brilliant each is.  King succeeds in writing a brilliant piece of Gothic Horror in the vein of Edgar Allan Poe, whose Masque of the Red Death is quoted in King's Preface to The Shining.  It's definitely not a book for the squeemish or afraid of wasps (this is the only warning I'm giving you).  I was astounded at the psychology and depth of each character, which is necessary in sustaining such a long book with so few people.  Length is however, not an issue as the family tension is enough to keep pages turning at an alarming rate.  I'm in no way a Stephen King fan, but this book is a masterpiece of any genre.
0446677450|1.0|Worst financial book I have ever read. This book should be used for HS kids. I found it funny how Mr Kiyosaki claims he paid 3.5 million for his house...yet the tax records show it was nearly 1/3 of that. You would be better to buy 1 share of stock...at least you have potential to get your money back. HAHA! Seriously...Don't buy this book.
B00000IL1K|5.0|This CD is great; a real mix of popular and more clasical stuff, similar to the balance found in la Luna.<BR>The arrangements and Brightman's vocals are excellently arranged with only a couple of poorer tracks.<BR>Well worth buying if you are a fan of La Luna.
0380778556|5.0|I had to read this novel over my Thanksgiving week of 01' (I was behind, didn't start the book so I had to read 50 pages a day, wasting 2 hours :) At first I thought this is going to be one of those boring books like all books you have to read in English class. I started reading, boy, I couldn't believe how good this book was. Ms. Du Maurier always ends the chapter with maybe an ironic scene, which makes you push yourself to read what's going to happen next. Even though it's 380 pages long, it's a great book. I recommend you to read it.
0780021150|5.0|There is no better German film since.<br />Some notes about some reviews:<BR>- Any mention of Nazis is just plain wrong. For the historically challenged: The Nazis came to power 1933, two years after the film's first release. (They were, however, annoyed by Lang's 1933 'Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse', and verboted it; Lang subsequently left Germany.)<br />- The UFA was (nearly) ruined by Lang's 1927 Anti-Blockbuster 'Metropolis'; in addition, they disputed over the dubbing of 1929 'Die Frau im Mond'. They split; 'M' was no UFA film (Tobis, IIRC).<br />- Lang did indeed invent the sound bridge.<br />- The film is probably based on multiple real cases, but most prominent is Fritz Haarmann, 'The Butcher of Hannover'. 'Der Totmacher' (1995) is a very good movie about Haarmann's questionings; Götz George as Haarmann is brilliant.
0792839625|4.0|I admit I did not see the original B'way production, but I thought this movie was done nicley.  I admit from what I have read, that Hollywood changed it, and took out some songs etc. and that is the result of these poor reviews....The actor's were good, and there were some strong voices.  For example, the song &quot;Let Me Dance for You&quot; was song with alot of power and gust.  When you think about it, it is (sometimes) hard to compete with a huge success.  They did the best they could with the movie and what they could present on film.  BOTTOM LINE: A Chorus Line is something to watch when you want some good musical entertainment and would like to forget about your troubles and listen to some body elses problems....  Why not give it a try?
068485743X|5.0|This is my favorite book about writing -- and reading. It's hilarious and brilliant: a map of the writer's terrain with instructions to the treasure.<br />I'm a produced screen writer working on my first novel. &quot;The First Five Pages&quot; gave me everything I needed to pull together years of writing and rewriting. I believe the author succeeds because he wants his readers to succeed. Even the most abstract concepts are brought to life in an easy-going, heart-to-heart way.<br />If I taught literature or composition -- at any level -- this book would definitely be &quot;required reading&quot; for the course.
B00003CXFG|4.0|The movie was great, the effects were cool.  The concept/plot, however seemed like a take-of from the Alien legacy.  I hate movies that rip off the concepts of others.  I recieved this movie as a gift last year.  I liked the movie though.  Vin Diesel's performance was top-notch.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I must admit that I'm not a die hard Britney fan and that I went off her for a while, but i really liked Slave 4U as it was so different. I was excited about the release of the new album, but unfortunately was very quite disappointed with it when I got to listen to it. <br />It has got some ok tracks on it, but they're not at all individual and sound very alike. One of the tracks sounds like a NSync album track, unsurprising since Justin did some writing on her album. There is only one proper ballad on there; I'm not a girl, not yet a woman, and it's not very strong.<br />This album lacks the content of the first two, it feels like she's trying to be Michael Jackson, as in every song she half whispers some of the lyrics. It doesn't have the contrast in tracks of the first two and I don't think is a CD that I will be able to listen to over and over. <br />Britney is good at the style of music from the frist two albums, she should have stuck to it.
0385334206|4.0|This is a pretty clever darn book. It seems real simple, but if you tried to write it yourself, you'd find that having all the bits fit into each other (eventually) would be real tricky. I liked &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; better, though. It's fun reading more of Vonnegut's books, because characters from other stories do cameo appearances and things like that. Thumbs up!
B00004ZD69|5.0|Just to put my two cents in here: I am a pop music fan, who worships at the altar of Matthew Sweet, Spoon, and the Beatles.  I was looking for something different, something to shake up my sensibilities a little.  I read a review of this is the Austin Chronicle, thought it sounded interesting, an I bought it.  Since then, I have added perhaps 25 cds to my collection of this type of music, mostly from the Kranky records label.  I still love a well-crafted pop song, but the vast majority of my listening time is now spent studying these beautiful aural landscapes and marvelling at the power and beauty that GYBE (and their many offshoots) have been so kind to create for us.  If you are ready to venture into some uncharted musical waters, I cannot reccomend this band highly enough.
B000002LUB|5.0|Maybe not the reunion that everyone would have liked to see but a welcome one for the hardcore Sabbath fans.  With Dio's return to Sabbath the band proved that they still had the heavy hitting material in them.  This album contains the best lyrics for any Sabbath album since Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Vol. 4.  The standout song is without a doubt Computer God.  This was the perfect way to start off the album.  Right from the opening drums you could tell this was going to be a heavy album.  Probably the most overlooked song is After All.  In my opinion it is the best song Sabbath ever recorded.  With mindblowing lyrics and bone crunching guitar riffs, Dehumanizer is a must have for any Sabbath fan of any era.
0226264017|5.0|This book grows on you.  You start out reading it with a lovely liberal mindset.  By the time you're done, conservatism has entered your thoughts.  Friedman's ability to create this transition is matched by few.  His points are logical and interesting; they pull the reader along, convincing as they go.  All in all, a great read.  As it has become something of a classic, there's a good chance you'll want to read it.<br />And do take what Friedman says with a grain of salt.  Yes economics is a powerful tool, but it relies on simplifying assumptions which can limit the relevence of models and ideas.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|If you have read the previous reviews, you can easily see that this movie has been debated greatly. Some thought it excellent, while others liked it and still yet, some who deemed it &quot;trash.&quot; <br />Some seem to think that Angelina Jolie (Lara Croft) was too sultry and self-assured, or didn't seem to show much emotion. For those that have played the game, Lara Croft is depicted just that way. In the video games, Lara Croft doesn't get scared too easily, or often at that. Not that I think it's right for her to seem so tough, just that it stayed true to the video game. <br />Some think that Jolie's clothes were too skimpy. I understand where this is coming from and I would be just the one to object to a skimpy outfit, but Jolie's wardrobe was very well done. Her outfits were VERY much like that of the games. <br />Others stated that they thought Lara Croft was depicted as invincible. I find some truth to that, but Lara Croft is wounded in the movie. She does bleed, she's not Superwoman.<br />Still yet, some seemed to think that the plot was too weak. I, myself, found it rather well done. Some stated that the artifact she was searching for should have been more recognizable to the average person. Yes, this could have been done, but, again, returning to the video game, the artifacts that Lara is usually after are not well known, but they all hold some great power. (Much like in the movie)<br />Overall, I think that, for a game adaptation, this was VERY well done. It WASN'T another underdeveloped Street Fighter. We follow Lara Croft to find a special triangular articfact that holds the mystery of time travel. A good self conflict happens when Lara must decide whether to use the artifact to find out what happened to her father. I found the plot was deepened by the mysterious disappearance of her father and, returning to her &quot;lack of emotion,&quot; we see that Lara is not always sultry and tough. Her father seems to be her soft spot. Special effects were wonderful and VERY enjoyable.<br />I found that casting was very well done. Angelina Jolie made for a perfect Lara Croft. As for doing ALL her own stunt, I found myself in awe with some of the extremely challenging motorcycle stunts as well as the bungee roping. I found the casting of Lara Croft's father, perfect. Using Angelina Jolie's own father, John Voight, to play her character's father made for perfect scene chemistry. As for Lara' enemy, talk about good. I hate to say that I'm not sure of the actor's name because he did such a good job. He was so devious. I think that a very enjoyable scene is the Croft Mansion break in, but if you haven't seen the movie, I'll let you see it for yourself. This movie has a little of everything and would be enjoyable to men and women. There is loads of action, adventure to different countries (Cambodia, Britain, Russia), drama, comedy, and even a bit of subtle romance, with Lara Croft's ironic attitude and sarcasm as well as her &quot;sidekick's,&quot; if you will, goofiness. BOTTOM LINE: Very enjoyable and recommended.
B00003CY0V|4.0|A well made cyber-thriller by Dominic Sena. I heard mixed reviews prior to seeing this movie. I like the story and it had a interesting plot. I liked the fact that it had you guessing alot. &quot;pulling the rug from under ya&quot; kind of thing. Travolta was good as the pretty slick bad guy. Hugh Jackman and H. Berry too. However I thought the brief glimpse of Ms. Berrys' boobies wasn't REALLY necessary. I mean, don't get me wrong. She's a beautiful woman, no doubt.....but how did that help her character any? The only small complaint I have with this movie is the use of the F-word at least 30 times. Other than that, the movie was really cool!!!
B00005QK3W|5.0|JUST WHEN YOU THINK SIR PAUL CAN'T TOP HIMSELF...HE DOES IT AGAIN. SOME OF HIS MOST PERSONAL WORK TO DATE. YOU CAN HEAR THE PAIN IN HIS VOICE ON LONELY ROAD, FROM A LOVER TO A FRIEND, BACK IN THE SUNSHINE. BEAUTIFUL INSTRUMENTALS ON HEATHER AND OTHERS. SIMPLY MAGNIFICENT
1560549505|5.0|&quot;Cotillion&quot; is on eof Heyer's finest achievements - for it is quite a complete triumph of her writing here. Those looking for something strong in the plot may look elsewhere. The plot as such is weak and the work would have fallen flat had it been authored by anyone but Miss Heyer. Heyer turns this seemingly plotless tale into one filled with wit and laughs. <br />Kitty is a country-bred heiress who is prepared to go to any extremes to have a time in London. She is put into a most uncomfortable spot by her guardian who insists on her marrying one of her cousins in which case only his wealth would be bequeathed to her. Else, it goes off in charity. It is in trying to make a escape from the place that she runs into one of her cousins, Freddy Standen, a self-confessed nitwit, and a dandy. But dont let that put you down - for Heyer develops Freddy into one of her best heroes. I personally love Freddy simply because he resembles the sidekicks of her other novels whome I adore (like Pel and Sir Pom in &quot;Convenient Marriage&quot;). Kitty is sufficient without being as captivating as Frederica or Horatia Winwood. But the tale is led on at a brisk pace filled with all fun and laughs. <br />So have a go at it if you are down in the dumps and need something to perk you up. Freddy, Kitty, Dolph, Meg and all the other host of splendid characters will make you smile in not too long a time.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|He has done it again. He has made several steps from ROMEO+JULIET and made an exciting tribute 2 love in the 20th century. The songs are humouresly chosen and sung with great class by EWAN MacGREGOR and NICOLE KIDMAN. The supporting cast is also ace...  This is what film is all about...<br />It is so nicely edited 2gether; that Luhrmann; I can c Oscars, honory Oscars and countless awards in your horizon. U have taught the world 2 love musicals again. I thank u...<br />As I said; a beautiful fable about love, hate and greed...<br />And last(NOT LEAST): JIM BROADBENT is Oscarmaterial and his versions of Madonna`s Like a Virgin and Queen`s The Show Must Go On? Musical treats that must be viewed over and over and over(With Kidman and MacGregor of course...)
0671004107|5.0|Definately the most awe inspiring novel I have ever read. The imagery given as I was dragged into the story by your words is just beautiful. I was caught up for weeks on your theories on how likely life is out there and I will forever be caught up in the mystery. Three cheers for the high master Carl Sagan! Thank you sir and you are correct. We Are Not Alone!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is the album that Prince fans have been waiting for.  This is from start to finish an amazing record!!!  Musically, Prince sets the bar so high that it's unreachable.  Lyrically he proclaims his new found faith in a beautiful way.  Unlike his fellow 80's icons Michael Jackson and Madonna, who hasn't changed musically in the last 20 years.  The Rainbow Children is unlike anything the Purple One has ever done.  It totally plays like a story in which you can't wait for the next chapter to hear what happens next.  Some people are turned off by the deep voice serving as the &quot;narrator&quot;, or the heavy religious lyrics.  To be honest, I wasn't bothered one bit by it.  This is also the album in which Prince proclaims his black pride.  With references to the everyday struggle of the black man, and he even samples the great Martin Luther King Jr.  <br />Even though Prince has found God, he is still oozing sexuality in songs like &quot;Mellow&quot; and &quot;1+1+1 is 3&quot;.<br />I refuse to list any &quot;standout tracks&quot; because this album is meant to be heard as a whole and it should be, but I will say that the first 3 songs are good, but from track 4 to track 14 is the most amazing music I've ever heard.  From funky tracks like The Work (pt. 1), 1+1+1 is 3, and The Everlasting Now.  To amazing instumentals like The Senual Everafter.  Beautiful ballads like She Loves Me 4 Me.  And Arena Rockers like Last December.  <br />Every instrument on this album is played to perfection!!!  From the awesome guitar and keyboard play by the man himself.  (Habibi is on point!), the beautiful horns from Najee and the NPG Hornheadz, the kick arse bass from funk legend Mr. Larry Graham, and last but not least the amazing drumwork from John Blackwell.  Words can't describe how great this man is.  Dude just goes nuts on the skins!!!  Prince has definitley found a diamond in the rough with Mr. Blackwell.<br />This is without a doubt this is the best Prince album to come out in a loooong time, and dare I say that this is the best Prince album period?  I think I just did!!!
B00003CXXR|5.0|Jurassic Park III is probably the 2nd best in the Jurassic Park Franchise. Still doesn't live up to it's original, but it works. This movie gets my adrenaline pumping and my heart racing. This movie is worth the bucks. I Reccomend this movie !!!!!!
B00005JHAD|5.0|I'm not sure what the editorial review is talking about, reading it I ended up shaking my head. Snatch is in no way whatsoever formulatic, sure many compare it to its prequel of sorts &quot;Lock Stock..&quot; but they are both in the same vein and tell a continuing story. But back to Snatch. I rarely give out 5 stars, yet this movie deserves it. The story moves at a quick pace and is very unpredicitable. Along the way, we are given stellar performances by Brad Pitt (not just a pretty face, the man can act. see this, se7en, fight club, etc.), Denis Farina (hilarious in the little screen time he had), Rade Sherbedgia as Boris the Blade (who also provides many hilarious moments), and Alan Ford as a kingpin who has a rather...unusual way of disposing of his victims (oink oink). The movie is billed as an action flick, which it has a lot of, but it could just as easily be billed as a comedy. The dialouge is witty and realistic, and once again the characters are vibrant and played extremely well by this ensamble. The only small problem I had with the movie at first was the heavy british accent nearly everyone uses (the movie is set almost entirely in London), which can take some getting used to, but do NOT let that dissuade you from seeing this movie. Very Highly Recommended
0679729895|3.0|I am writing my review primarily for 1st time readers of Roald Dahl's pieces.  <br />I would consider a plus sign the tales' briefness &amp; conciseness.  Except for a few stories, they were simply a few pages off.  I also consider the uniqueness/strangeness of both the plot &amp; setting quite interesting &amp; noteworthy.  I somewhow relate this book to one of Edgar Allan Poe's short story collections, although Roald Dahl's book has a different style &amp; a touch of (black) humor.<br />There were approx. 4 stories which really caught my attention &amp; they were that of the meek (as a lamb) wife pulling off a successful crime, a surviving brain, a royal-jelly product baby &amp; the reincarnated Lintz &amp; Edward the Conqueror.<br />However, there were several stories about gambling which I particularly were not fond off.  I couldn't see the humor in it --- instead, I felt something of a &quot;GOOD FOR YOU&quot; attitude.<br />I guess it all boils down to taste &amp; preference.  I wouldn't mind trying another of his pieces though.  I am optimistic that I will find another book by this author which I will truly like.
0618135871|5.0|David Kepesh is the aging, Porsche-driving professor who alternately brags or obsesses over his conquest of a beautiful 24 year-old Cuban-American student. \\"Everybody's defenseless against something,\\" David declares, \\"and [female beauty] that's it for me.\\"     Consuela, his conquest, is likened to Modigliani's painting, \\"Reclining Nude.\\" \\"The accessible dream girl. One long undulating line, she lies there awaiting you, still as death.\\"     Kepesh critiques a previous girlfriend and we notice his obsession with age too. \\"Still beautiful...though beneath the pale gray eyes the biggish sockets were now papery and worn.\\"     The professor has a resentful forty-two-year-old grown son, Kenny, as well. He was traumatized at age 8 when his parents divorced. In college Kenny wrote his thesis paper based on his hatred of his father. \\"A depraved sensualist. A solitary old lecher.\\"    \\"Put him anywhere near me and the wound begins to hemorrhage,\\" the elder Kepesh reflects. This ceaseless emotional attack came before Kenny graduated and took up his profession as an art conservator. \\"Before he cauterized the wound by turning himself into a prig.\\" Ironically, the professor's son now finds himself caught up in his own affair and troubled marriage, frequently spending the night at Dad's pad.    David Kepesh blames the 1960's for his divorce. Never mind that Kepesh is just another alter ego for Philip Roth, whose unrestrained 60's novel, \\"Portnoy's Complaint,\\" fueled the sexual revolution. The \\"real\\" weapons of that generation are nailed however. Music, marijuana, and the Pill. \\"For them there was an arsenal of all-out anti-inhibitors.\\"    But the sexual rebellion had more casualties. Rejected mid-meal by her date one evening, an ex-student, Elena, visits her favorite college teacher and comes unglued. \\"Do you think it's supposed to be like this when you're as successful as I am? Life baffles you and you become a very self-protective person and just say the hell with it.\\" The men, Professor Kepesh analyzes, come in five types: narcissistic, humorless and crude; great-looking and ruthlessly unfaithful; emasculated; impotent or dumb.    Is the thinking man's Hugh Hefner getting a little unhip? Maybe not. He tells teary-eyed Elena about a male friend who detested the trap his marriage had become. He finally divorces, and then, at loose ends, marries again, only to begin more affairs. \\"Deferring, deferring, deferring? Appeasing, appeasing, appeasing: Every other day dreaming of leaving? No, it's not a dignified way to be a man. Or, I told Elena, to be a woman.\\"    David Kepesh is no longer the young, surrealist dreamer who narrated Roth's 1970's novella, \\"The Breast.\\" In that absurdist fiction Kepesh found himself hopelessly imprisoned by his desires. 29 years later the professor still struggles, but for the most part he's contrived a system, or at least a defense, for his unfettered emotional life.    Continuing the art metaphor he portrays Consuela as if she were a cubist canvas painted by a raging Picasso. She's a tempting collage of erogenous parts until, in a final whirling striptease, she is undone by a grotesque joke. A joke grisly enough to make us perhaps choose to opt out of \\"The Dying Animal.\\"  But Kepesh persuades us to hang in there, making us unwitting legatees to the thoughts of this peculiar intellectual. Check to see if you're not part of the will.
B00005RIKD|4.0|I must say that this album is great. I was'nt a real fan of sting's until the released of &quot;Ten Summoner's Tales&quot; back in 93. Before, I had seen earlier police videos, but I did'nt really take any notice. So my taste in his music does not linger on his band from the early 80's for those of you who keep dragging the &quot;police&quot; stigma around ever time you review one of his albums. Over all, this album is great. I like the jazz reworking of his ealier stuff. The addition of Christan Mcbride (one of todays leading bassist) was and awesome idea. I would have preferred the extra tracks included in the U.S. release though. But still, I highly recommend this album.
B000002OOY|5.0|The score to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was the first soundtrack that I ever purchased.  I have bought many film scores since then, but &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; has and will forever be one of my favorites.<br />Unless you've been living under a rock on the planet Mars, you've no doubt heard the familiar themes to this great track.  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is a bonafide classic that will stand the test of time.  John Williams is one of, if not the, greatest film score composer of our era, and this collaboration is some of his best work.<br />There is not one bad song on the entire CD, which cannot be said for all of John Williams' work, even though he is brilliant.  He knows exactly what chords to strike (no pun intended) with the listener - he can dazzle you with luscious music, he can tantalize you with heart-stopping dread music.  For crying out loud, this is one of those rare works that takes you on every kind of ride imaginable.  I didn't think another score could do that for me until James Newton Howard's score for Disney's &quot;Dinosaur&quot; came out (which I highly recommend you check out for yourself).<br />If you are a fan of film score music, get this CD.  If you are a fan of great music in general, get this CD.  If you have just bought a brand-spanking new CD player or stereo and need something impressive to test it out, don't hesitate to pick up the score for &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;  Great scores come and go, but &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; has been around for 65 million years.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Ok.  I knew what I expected when I saw the trailer: Indiana Jones in a D-cup.  Problem is, there's no real story here.  The writing is horrible, and the directing is pathetic.  About the only thing going for it is Angelina Jolie, who at least looks interesting.  Unfortunately, nothing she did could save the movie, and I felt embarrassed for her when watching it.  You might want to see this one before buying it.  Don't say you weren't warned...
B000059R8Y|4.0|There is no doubt that Clapton is a good guitar player, but he doesn't seem to want to let us know that here. Reptile for me serves for some good background music. Although the Impressions do a fine job on this album and the songs are much better on Pilgrim. However, if you want some real guitar playing, check out Jeff Beck's new album You Had It Coming instead.
B000002L80|5.0|I have loved the Talking Heads for longer than I can remember. This is my favorite album. It just makes me smile. This remastered CD is delightful. Put it on when you are down and you won't be for long.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is a great cd.  The best songs are #3, #5, #6-7, #8.  I highly suggest it.
1587990717|5.0|I nearly did not buy this book because of some of the very negative reviews on these Amazon pages. But I'm glad I did. At the time of writing, the average review of this book is a mediocre review, but at the time of writing this review there are no actual mediocre reviews. The explanation is that the variance of the reviews is very high, either very good or very bad - which averages to mediocre. I find that when there is a high variance in surveys completed by people, the subject matter of that which is surveyed is often more interesting than the subject matter of surveys which yield more or less unanimously good or unanimously bad reviews. (Bimodal rather than unimodal distibutions in other words). This is the case here.<br />If any of the above makes sense to you, then you will understand where Taleb is coming from, to coin a phrase. To take some of the criticisms made in other reviews: is Taleb a boasting egomaniac? No - quite the opposite, he tells stories against himself and states that he suffers most of all from the faults that he identifies in others; does Taleb fail to deal with major issues in statistics? No - but I suspect that to some people who lack a solid grounding in the principles of statistics, it may seem that he does, because he is primarily concerned with dealing with issues beyond those treated by our current statistical methodology, for example the propblem of induction and falsification (as in Hume, Popper and Nelson Goodman). <br />There will be little new theoretical material in this book for those who have a background in mathematics, quantitative finance,   quantitative economics or philosophy (in the analytical rather than the continental tradition), but the value of Taleb's book is in two things. First, he applies the theoretical to practical trading problems, or more specifically he shows the reader how to apply the gaps in the theory to trading, and also to life in general. Secondly, Taleb is interested in how life should be led, andmakes the connexion between this ancient but ever-important question and the problems in statistics. He mentions Hume and Kant, I can't remember if he mentions Aristotle, but he does not mention Epictetus - however, in respect of how we should live, Taleb's book is in certain senses a follow-up to some of these authors, though as Taleb would be the first to assert, not in any way pretending to be on their level.<br />Taleb has a good writing style. In this sort of subject it is very easy to drop names and quote quotes, but Taleb keeps such academic strutting to a minimum and writes entertainingly. I found it a very good read.
B00005N9CV|5.0|By  focusing on her vocals for really the first time this album becomes a benchmark for Diana's maturity as one of our finest interpretative singers.  This is NOT a bland rendition of popular standards but a nuanced, carefully phrased, perfectly timed, and emotionally evocative performance.  Listen to &quot;I get Along Without You Very Well&quot;, &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and &quot;The Night We Called it a Day&quot; and you will note how her husky, sensual voice embraces each word, telling a story in a fashion that would make Sinatra proud.
B00005LOUQ|3.0|Compared to other family and/or children's movies this one was a disappointment.  I think Jim Carey could have added a bit more of his personality to the performance. In fact, I hoped the Grinch would have been more funny. It must have been hard to create a movie out of a 30 minute cartoon.
B00005R87Q|5.0|IT IS AN AMAZING, SUPERBLY PUT-TOGETHER MOVIE. IT TOTALLY BLEW ME AWAY.  BRILLIANT STUNTS AND CARS I WOULD DEFINATELY WATCH IT OVER AND OVER.  VIN DIESEL IS HOT TOO!!
6303426468|3.0|Junior is a great casting film but the storyline is awful ! I love Danny Devito I have seen most of his movies ,but in my opinon this movie is a insult for pregant women that is .It shows kids cross dressing and sexual harrassment ,a pregant man is a insult I mean just think of that was a real fertily drug they would be selling like crazy ! This movie is ok but is a insult ? You be the judge .
6302994063|5.0|This movie was great.  I have rented it numerous times and I am finally going to buy it.  It is fun and I love the dancing of Fran and Scott.  The soundtrack is also great.  A must see.
B00003CWL6|2.0|First, I love American Beauty.  In recent years, The Matrix and Crouching Tiger are the only other films I've seen more than once while still in first-run theaters, and American Beauty has much more substance than either of those.  This movie is not an \\"ugly look at life\\" as some have said.  It is an extremely hopeful look at life.  Lester is a very real character that can be easily identified with, and everybody who feels that in some way their life has become a pathetic routine of dull existence can find assurance in the message that there's always time to make something of your life.  The opening narration very clearly states this as Kevin Spacey says:<br />\\"Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and they're right.  I have lost something.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated.  But you know what?  It's never too late to get it back.\\"<br />This movie is an inspiring message wrapped up in fun humor, great music, and beautiful cinematography.  The director states that it is a movie about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment.  I'm shocked at the number of people who just don't get it.  The people I know personally who don't like American Beauty aren't actually friends of mine, and they generally have that cranky, going-nowhere attitude about life.  (...) Does Lester&#8217;s mundane life hit a little too close to home?<br />The closest thing to a legitimate criticism is that the movie glorifies a would-be pedophile.  People who say this need to pay more attention.  Lester is a middle-aged guy who isn't getting any at home, and Angela is constantly giving him eyes.  He even hears her shouting the obscene things she wants to do to him.  She claims to have had more sex as a teen than Lester has in his whole life.  Then Lester finds out his wife is \\"getting nailed by the King of Real Estate.\\"  It&#8217;s understandable that his affection shifts from his wife to Angela.  Once Lester finds out the truth about Angela, we see a nice guy who wouldn't think of touching her.  Lester is a normal man who shows a moment of human weakness when a young girl is coming on strong.  If you think that makes him a pedophile, I'd hate to see your opinion of Kuberick's Lolita, where an even older man is very actively pursuing an even younger girl.  Just look at the facts.  Mena Suvari was 20 when the movie was made.  She plays a high-school girl who is old enough to drive, meaning her character is between the ages of 16 and 18.  16 is above the age of consent in 39 of 50 US states.  This film does not glorify a pedophile.<br />(...) Yes, it is somewhat unpleasant seeing Lester get his brains blown out, but if they wanted gore, they would&#8217;ve shown the exit wound and made the blood darker, instead of making a bright puddle to match the red theme of the film.  Yes, the movie shows young girls&#8217; breasts, but I don&#8217;t see anybody accusing Traffic of being child pornography, and that has graphic depiction of a teenage girl whoring herself for drugs.  The beauty lies in the transformation of Lester.  I feel sorry for anybody who doesn&#8217;t fill with joy at the beginning of chapter 21.  I&#8217;m not a big fan of The Who, I don&#8217;t run marathons, and I don&#8217;t aspire to flip burgers, but when the film cuts to Lester running down the middle of the street to &#8220;The Seeker,&#8221; it makes me glad to be alive.<br />Anyway, the DVD itself is a real disappointment.  Look at the name of the DVD.  \\"The Awards Edition.\\"  It should've been called the (...) Edition.  This DVD was specifically made so that fans would end up purchasing the DVD twice when the REAL version is released.<br />OK, maybe it's not that bad...  It DOES have both DTS and Dolby 5.1 audio, and it is one of the few DVD's that doesn't make you sit through a minute of obnoxious \\"don't copy this\\" warnings.  It DOES have two trailers, audio commentary, a featurette which just says, \\"This movie is great!\\", and a \\"storyboard presentation.\\"<br />So let me tell you what the problems are.  Just try to watch the hour-long storyboard special feature.  Particularly annoying is that it is one single 61-minute chapter.  It's really just a 49-image slideshow being discussed by the director and cinematographer.  The first 22 minutes of the presentation are spent discussing chapter 1-4 of the DVD.  The rest of the presentation skips around discussing chapter 5-18 of the DVD, and it ends abruptly without touching on the last 10 chapters.<br />The most important flaw is heard when listening to the director commentary.(...)<br />If you listen to the commentary, it's obvious that a \\"deleted scenes\\" section has already been compiled and prepared for the DVD, but they chose not to include it with \\"The Awards Edition.\\"  Nobody in their right mind would say, \\"I think people would rather see this horrible and incomplete storyboard discussion instead of the deleted scenes.\\"  It is clear that Dreamworks just wants to force the true fans to buy the DVD twice to get the version with the deleted scenes.  Expect to see &#8220;American Beauty: Special Edition&#8221; in a year or two.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I've just read a few pages worth of the reviews below and to pick up on the points and complaints that everyone is ranting about...<br />a) Not all of these tracks will be your personal faves. I don't care for their last two Gilmour albums, but the very notion of a greatest hits compilation is to span a bands entire output.<br />b) The edits of Echoes, Crazy Diamond and Sheep (apparently) aren't intrusive and are done with a surgeons precision. <br />Now for my few gripes. Though everyone has their preferred tracks, some here aren't really Floyd's 'greatest hits'. The dull instrumental Marooned for instance makes an appearance albeit in a severely clipped form (it's about 2 minutes), so why include it at all?<br />The sale clincher 'When the Tigers Broke Free' (an unreleased track) is IMHO, cack. It just sounds like something from The Final Cut. <br />Anyway, a very good selection of pre-Orb chillout classics. Again, only pick this up if you're not prepared to purchase all the albums that these tracks have been culled from. Oh, and Atom Heart Mother, for some mean reason it isn't represented by a single track.
B00005LOUP|4.0|Though I usually scorn movie remakes --Christmas or otherwise, I found THE GRINCH to be a charming, visual delight.<br /><br />Deep inside Grinch Mountain, Ron Howard shows us a misfit's world filled with loot instead of love. Your eyes flit about, drinking in the artfully imagined junkyard palace, all the while gaining glimpses into Grinchy's warped soul. Thankfully, the story never strays so far from the original as to trigger outrage from the ardent Seussophile.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays the Grinch with uncharacteristic restraint. We all know he could have gone GLARINGLY over the top. Instead, he treats the character with respect and affection as if he, too loved this Seuss-tale as a child. Green prosthetics were never put to such good use or employed with such surprising effect.<br /><br />While this foray into Whoville may not go down in history as a classic the caliber of \\"Rudolph\\" or \\"Frosty,\\" for my money it's still well worth the trip!
0767824571|4.0|OK, I did actually go wrong.  About 1 week after I got this DVD, the special DVD came out.  Now, I have to buy that too, since this is truely one of the classics.<br />&quot;Come and see the violence inherent in the system!  I'm being repressed!&quot;
0440234743|3.0|this book started out with an excelent plot and then by the middle and definitely toward the end it fizzed out! the ending that I had anticpated in my head was much better. the one john grisham went with was very anti-climatic and blah....! the crazy kids of the billionaire were very intriguing yet he decided to focus on a recovering addict looking through the jungle for a boring character..(yes that was a very good sub-plot but the heart of the book was with the fight for the $$. the drama and humor was with the crazy a** wanna be heirs) in the end it was very disappointing.
0671578278|5.0|If you've never read encountered Lois McMaster Bujold before, I strongly urge you to lay hands on any volume bearing her name.  The adventures of Miles Vorkosigan top the list, however.  With charm, a lively sense of adventure and ripping humor, Bujold chucks her hero into the breech and we anxiously wait to see whether he sinks or swims.  Miles' successes are as monumental as his screwups.  Miles suffered teratogenic (*not* genetic) damage before birth and has had to find ways to overcome his brittle bones, lack of height, innumerable surgeries, and cryo-revival in a society that has a history of killing mutants at birth.  He's a &quot;hyperactive little git&quot;, a genius, and incredibly lucky.  His defects neatly balance his assets, so it is easy to cheer him on.  He's not a perfect hero.<BR>As usual, there are many situations going on in this book.  The Emperor is getting married, Miles' clone-brother is starting up a business in Vorkosigan House, genetics interfere (once again) in the political world of the Counts, and Miles is on a single-minded hunt to make a lovely widow his Lady.  This book is great as a stand-alone volume, but it does help to have read the other books in the series first.  <BR>I love this series and am not-so-patiently waiting for the next installment.
0553579908|4.0|I don't like fantasy. The few I've read in my past was boring and, most of all: I hate elves :))  In this great Saga there are not elves, but there are people. Real people who fight for life, who live, have pain, all that real people do.  There are also draghons and magician, but they are sets in such a marvelous way that you believe they are real too.  I love this saga!
B00005Q66T|5.0|Madonna is the best. Period. There is no one that can match her professional lyrics, production, and vocal talent.
B000053VAF|5.0|This is one of the great movies of recent time.  Add to it all the deleted scenes on this great DVD and this is a classic that any Kevin Smith fan needs to have.<br />Without a doubt a needed addition to any DVD collection.
0790729644|5.0|This film is Eastwood's best Western.  This is so because the film is very realistic.  The gunfighting is believable (as opposed to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly were Eastwood managed to shoot a rope from 1,000 yards away), the acting is superb, and the writing is excellent as well.  The film is a little gruesome, a &quot;man's movie&quot; so to speak, but I found it very entertaining.  As well as having awesome gunfights and some blood and gore the film had a little comedy relief at times.  Eastwood, Hackman, and Freeman did an excellent job acting in the film.  I would recommend it to anyones DVD collection as a great Western.
B00005O5CM|4.0|&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is a cute fluffy as air comedy staring Reese Witherspoon as the blonde.  She is one of the best young actresses around right now.  She has a great comic ability and her timing is impeccable.  She is very talented, and in my opinion, is a bit underrated as an actress.<br />Enough about the Blonde, and on to the movie.  The main character, Elle Woods, played by Reese, has been kicked to the curb by her man because she isn't smart enough.  It takes an episdoe like this to get Elle to prove to herself that she is smart.  While she acts pretty ditzy, and graduates with a Bachelors in Fashion Design, she decides to try and get into Harvard Law School as that is where the ex boyfriend goes.  She wants to show him that she is smart enough for him.  One of the funniest parts is her &quot;video essay&quot; she sends to the school and the board of admissions is viewing it.  I laughed through this entire scene.  She is accepted.<br />Along the way, she learns a lot about herself, and she meets some pretty funny characters.  When she goes into a nail boutique for an emergency manicure, she meets Paulette Bonafonte, played hilariously by Jennifer Coolidge.  They become fast friends.  She meets Emmett, played by the sweet and charming Luke Wilson, at the school.  He is a lawyer who is also an assistant to Elle's worst professor.  He becomes her new love interest, and Emmett is sweet to her and believes in her more than Warner ever did.  Elle is the underdog, but in the end she wins out.  This is a good rental. It's a fun movie.
B00000K2SC|5.0|Wow!  That's really all I can say about this film!!  My husband just loves it and eventually got me quite hooked on it.  We must watch it once a week!!
0440180295|3.0|Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; is an enjoyable read.  Vonnegut writes with a smooth and witty writing style.  The story of Billy Pilgrim's experiences as a POW during World War Two, including his time traveling adventures, are shocking and amusing at the same time.  Confronting horror and death with humor is an age-old concept, and Vonnegut finds a good balance between the two.<br />One thing that I kept asking myself as I read the book was &quot;what is this book about?&quot;  I think Vonnegut may have succeeded in writing a book where the reader can make up his or her own mind concerning the book's meaning.  Yes, it addresses the horrors of war and makes light of authority, but there were so many subliminal and idiosyncratic references to various things, places, events, people, etc., that I couldnt help but think that I would just have to use my own creativity and ideas to figure out the book's real message.<br />What really disturbed me about the book was Vonnegut's constant use of sarcasm and irreverent humor.  Many people in modern society equate cynicism with sophistication.  I respectfully disagree; I think that Vonnegut's numerous disparaging references to various institutions got old after a while.<br />All in all, I recommend it . . . but I won't exalt it to the extent that other readers have.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|French Kiss is a wonderful romantic comedy that can uplift you from the worst mood.  It is a very lighthearted and funny movie.  Meg Ryan plays the delightful role as the unfortunate Kate who has lost her fiance and flies to Paris to regain his love.  Along the way she meets Luc, a French man who takes her on a wild ride.  If you have ever been to Paris this movie will  make you want to go back, or visit for the first time!  A bonus is the soundtrack is just as great as the movie.  I have literally seen ths movie 100 times and will keep watching it forever!
B00005LOUP|5.0|Before I saw this movie I thought it would be stupid, that they would take too much from the original cartoon version and leave it out.  Actually, It was a pretty good film.  I really enjoy it, and it did have plenty from the original.  Some things in the movie could have been left out but overall it's great.  Very funny, and it does put you in the Christmas spirit.  I think Jim Carrey did a wonderful job as well as the other actors.  This film being different in many ways from the cartoon doesn't ruin the fun of watching them.  They're both great Christmas classics.  You should own both!
B00003CXZ1|1.0|what were you thinking? It is becoming consistent that the winner of best supporting actress at the Oscars, comes out with a really bad movie.  I am not a fan of the game nor this movie.<br />She is a very talented actress, and I am disappointed that she is in this video game/movie.  Maybe you need to be a fan of the game, and totally obsessed with it or her to appreciate this movie.  I thought it was really lame, and it put me to sleep in about twenty minutes.<br />While there may be alot of great action sequences in this movie, there is no plot.  Just Jolie in some sexy lingerie.<br />Only for fans of game...
B00003CXXI|5.0|I just got this for my grandkids (ages 8-boy & 16-girl) We watched it & laughed & laughed.Company came & They loved watching it the next day.Great music! Story had a great moral to it. & a little love story.(not surgary) Fantastic graphics. Eddie Murphy was terrific as the donkey(lots of jokes thrown in. ) Shrek was Mike Meyer and i LIKED him in this! There's a Dragon,princess,storybook charectors,& a nasy little wantabe prince.5 isn't high enough it's a 10! VERY FUNNY & all ages will like it ! i'm buying sound track next.
B00005QK3W|1.0|I am a great fan of Paul's, but this c.d. sounds &quot;effortless&quot; (in a bad way!). Instead of a track by track breakdown, it suffuces to say that this collection of songs sounds as if it were recorded to fulfill a contractual obligation.<br />While many people laud this release as one of his best, I must painfully admit that this is the one Paul C.D. I wish I had not purchased. While Paul has nothing left to prove, one gets the feeling that he has &quot;hung up his hat&quot;....and hereally shouldn't .Paul is truly a gift to pop and rock music, and unlike many other reviewers, I have enjoyed the many &quot;sappy&quot; ballads he's written...and Paul has written some of the greatest ones.<br />I gave &quot;Driving Rain&quot; 1 star, because of &quot;Freedom&quot;. It is the one song that keeps me from putting this disc up for sale on E-Bay. I will continue to buy any future Paul releases with &quot;A Hope For Deliverance&quot; for better material.Paul can do it if he really wants to.
B00003CXXS|5.0|I'm not going to say a lot about this film, but it's great.  I like it a little more than the first JP. The Lost World was just terrible.  Anyway, see this movie, buy it, and enjoy it.  They really made up for the sorry sequal.
043936213X|5.0|The only reason I got this story in the first place, was because it came in a set with other books that I wanted in a book order at school. I simply put it in the back of my bookshelf when I got it in the mail and didn't look at it for several months. Then, on a snow day while school was closed I had nothing to do. I looked through my room and found Harry Potter. I read the first few chapters and became HOOKED! Just as I finished the first one I went out and bought the second. Two years later, I had read the third and second books at least two times. Something about leaving your troubles behind by going on a train far away and meeting new friends was a universal dream that most people have wished for. I've now seen the movie and waiting for the fifth novel of the series!
0140367357|4.0|I have to admit that this book has an odd title.  The \\"Five Children\\" part is easy enough to figure out - that refers to Robert, Anthea, Jane, Cyril, and their adorable young brother who has the pet name \\"the Lamb\\".  But what on earth is \\"It\\"?  As it turns out, \\"It\\" is a Sand-fairy, or Psammead.  And like the title, the Psammead is odd.  \\"It\\" is small, round and furry with snail-like eyes and bat-like ears.  But the Psammead's odd-ness is matched by its extraordinary potential.  It has the power to grant one wish a day, lasting until sunset.  And so when the five children stumble across this magical Psammead while playing in a gravel-pit, they quickly learn that wishes can come true!<br />But the children soon discover that having your wishes come true is not always as pleasant as it might seem.  Wishes for beauty and wealth result in an unexpectedly bitter after-taste that confirms that these much coveted wishes are not as grand as most people think.  Other wishes lead to harrowing adventures, such as being in a beseiged castle, and being stalked by Indians.  Still other wishes result in rather bizarre scenarios, such as having wings, being the size of a giant, or being grown-up.  But in each case the children soon end up yearning for time of day when the wish will come to an end, as one of them remarks: \\"We're getting into the habit of longing for sunset.\\"<br />But as a reader of this tale, you'll find yourself quickly wishing for day-break, and for another exciting day to begin with another exciting wish to be fulfilled.  This book may have been written about 100 years ago in 1902, but it hasn't lost any of its charm. When Edith Nesbit wrote this book (her first \\"magic\\" book) it was an instant success. It is equally beloved today - and with good reason!  The magical adventures are full of charm and excitement.  Yet they convey important moral lessons, such as the transitory nature of beauty and wealth - &quot;neither had exactly made them happy.\\"  Generally speaking each chapter features a new wish and a new adventure that lasts until sunset.  It's a great read-a-loud book for young children, guaranteed to enthral and please with its wonderful blend of magic, adventure, and humor.  I must warn you that when the book does come to an end, you will be disappointed.  But only because it means the end of the children's enthralling magical adventures!  To have a book that can have such an effect - now that is a wish come true!ing each chapter features a new wish and a new adventure that lasts until sunset.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|This movie was great..everyone from my 7 year old to his grandma has watched it and enjoyed this film.  For the $.... it cost we have certainly got our moneys worth.  My 7 year old son watched it 3 times this week, and although he probably doesn't get all of the humor, he absolutely adores it!
6305041156|3.0|I agree that this is a great movie.  Also that this DVD is not a good transfer.  The resolution is mediocre.  However, the main problem is that it has no time display and won't accept \\"Last Memo.\\"  Nobody has noted that.  There are (only) nine scenes which can be accessed directly.  To be sure, within each of these there are several skip points, but these are nowhere identified, relying entirely on the memory of the viewer and trial and error to return to the last point seen.  I for one rarely watch a movie continuously.  There are errands, sleep, etc..  You'd have to leave the player running on pause to save your place, and some players won't even do that for more than a few minutes.  These lacks are essentially fatal flaws, but this DVD is the only version available.  You don't expect this kind of stuff except on...Madacy discs and the like.  Some other DVDs have this same problem.  Why?  How hard can it be?  Also, on this one there are no special features, unless you call a preview special, and there is no insert pamphlet - short shrift for a \\"World's Greatest Movie.\\"  I await a redo.
B00005QZWI|2.0|I have listened to this CD several times now and while it is good, it isn't that good.  There is way too much choral music and the heavy hand in the orchestration can make it depressing.  Enya's music on this album sounds like stuff from her old album.  Fusion jazz or something lighter would have been better.
6305205639|5.0|I got the DVD, and it is amazing.  I'm sure that the VHS version is excellent too.  Metallica doesn't always play all of their songs the way they originally wrote it, as a matter of fact I have several different live/studio/demo versions of songs, and all of them are played differently.  Someone complained in another review that they didn't do it right. NO, THEY JUST DID IT DIFFERENTLY!  Another person complained that they didn't seem really into it during the first part of the concert.  You know, when you are doing something like this, it takes a while to get into it.  The first part was not at all bad.  They just weren't fired up like mad like they seemed for the second part.  All of the people's complaints are very very minor issues.  If you are a Metallica fan, you would be a complete fool not to give this tape/DVD a watch.  I know, I watch the DVD at least once a week, sometimes more.
B000002HMH|1.0|When someone says the word Metallica, I think heavy guitar riffs, screaming vocals, great baselines, some good drums (I'll give them that), and classic heavy metal that you could play over and over again. That's what they were for their first four and a half albums (the black album wasn't quite as good as the others). As soon as &quot;Metal&quot; got replaced by the talentless alternative crap, instead of Metallica coming along and proving Metal is alive and kickin' like Pantera did, they cut their hair and became a K-Rock band. They sold out with the times instead of sticking to their roots. In the process, they have lost all their TRUE fans and have gained a new crowd of fans who know nothing about Metallica, talent, or good music. <BR>This album along with Re-Load should not be called Metallica because it defies everything Metallica has represented since their first album in '83. So if you want a Metallica album, buy any of the first four because this is not Metallica, this more like N' Sync with guitars
B000005RG7|5.0|Lots of cover songs. Lack of Originality. More hard rock them classic Rock? So what! this album rocks. The mix of the group members Daisley-Kerslake back end. Box's guitar with Sinclair on Heavy Keys. And Peter Goalby's vocals fit perfectly into the mix. What Box did on this release was pull the band out of the 70's/doldrums. MTV Played a cover song from this LP in medium rotation good for HEEP at the time. No Byron, or Wetton? Thats not great but Hell Sinclair and Goalby easily made up for that with their own talent. Out of the 200+ hard rock/metal albums I bought in the early 80's Abominog rocked the hardest with the best mix of Hard rock/Keys/vocals. I wore the disk out.
B000002UW1|5.0|This is the album that made REM more widely known as it had the hit song &quot;The one I love&quot; and the slightly lesser hit &quot;It's the end of the world....&quot; Rolling Stone gave them a cover story calling them &quot;Americas greatest rock n roll band.&quot; At the time, in 1987, that may have been true. Songs like &quot;Welcome to the occupation&quot; are likened to then-peers, The Smithereens (a good thing). &quot;Resuming Mccarthy&quot; and &quot;Disturbance at the Heron House&quot; are but a couple of the political songs from a band that made a million young malcontents proud to be democrats in the Reagan era of slime. This album featured their second cover song, Wire's &quot;Strange&quot; which sounds a bit out of place and should have been kept to a B side on a single, but oh well. The cover artwork is total REM as we knew them then. It calls to mind the bands videos for Reckoning in the Whirly Gig park. It would be the last of it's kind for an REM album, as if signing to Warner the following year would require a facelift for packaging styles (some of which were horrifyingly bad). The guys still looked really cool then too.
B000050XEI|5.0|Just lovely...dreamy delicious music.This music seems to bring out the best in people. Labeling her Celtic or Newage is an injustice.Only Time, is a masterpiece of beauty for the unsettled soul.
B00003CXN4|5.0|This is the best anti-drug movie ever made. Forget about the 'Just Say No' campaigns. They are homogenized and packaged to the point where they are ineffectual. Get this movie. Watch it with your kids. Let them know what is real and what is out there. Add Requiem for a Dream, and even you will think twice about taking an asprin.
B00003CWL6|1.0|This was one of the worst pieces of tripe I can recall sitting through.  I realize that I put myself in the vast minority by panning this flick, but I cannot recommend this movie in the slightest.  The mechanics of the film were, admittedly, well done.  However, the plot, premise, and script ruin the entire viewing experience.  <br />While I acknowledge that there are some aspects of truth to the generally acknowledged depraved premise, they are not presented as the parody of American life that they are touted to be.  The vast majority of the people I talked to didn't like it because it made them think about what is wrong with our society but because they like what is wrong with our society.  It's the same sadistic pleasure people get from watching Jerry Springer or slowing down to look for blood on the pavement at an accident scene.  This window into the disordered mind of a &quot;typical&quot; suburban father and husband is more of a view into the intellectual and moral wasteland of Hollywood than into reality.

B00005OWEG|1.0|Apocalypse Now Reduced!<BR>Two good reasons not to buy this DVD :<BR>1) The Coppola's renewed masterpiece is not presented in its original aspect ratio of 2:35, but in 1:85, which is inexcusable. <BR>2) A total absence of extra features. <br />Mike Goldberg
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Last spring, I headed out to the movie theaters with my family to see Shrek. My seven-year-old sister dragged me to this movie, which I had thought would be &quot;just another fairy tale&quot;. Believe me, Shrek is NOT &quot;just another fairy tale&quot;! It tells the story of Shrek, an ogre who just wants to be left alone. When his swamp is invaded with other fairy tale creatures, Shrek goes to Lord Farquaad to get them out. He is sent on a mission to go rescue Princess Fiona, who is to be Lord Farquaad's wife, and then his swamp will be cleared out. Shrek heads out with Donkey, his &quot;sidekick&quot;, to find Fiona. And then...well, I don't want to spoil the ending.<br />Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz lead an all-star cast of voices in this funny fairy tale. It is guaranteed to make anyone laugh. I reccommend it to any movie-goer who is looking for a funny film that's not just for kids!
6305014140|5.0|I am far from an authority on anime (so far I only own three titles...this one, &quot;Akira&quot;, and &quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot;), but &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; represents everything that adult anime was ever represented to me as being, in that it is fantastically  stylish, hyper-violent and sexy as hell.<br />&gt;<br />I won't detail the plot (there are plenty of other good reviews that do so sufficiently), but I will say that anyone who has ever been even mildly curious as to what makes a good, no, a GREAT adult anime would do very well to check this one out...as much as I enjoy the other anime DVD's I own (and I'm quickly beginning to understand the addictive nature of this gorgeous art form), I have a hard time rating either of them above this one.
B000002MG1|5.0|This album is always referred to as the one about death. True, death is a common theme on Automatic for the people, the bands third on Warner Brothers. What demonstrates the genius of REM is the juxtiposition of spirit lifting melodies with doom and gloom lyrics. &quot;The sidewinder sleeps tonite&quot; will have you bouncing and singing happily, yet the song seems to be about a dying person in a hospital. &quot;Try not to breathe&quot; is less pop happy, and discusses and elderly person's decision to pass on. &quot;Everybody hurts&quot; is a plea not to commit suicide, and one that I wish Kurt Cobain took more to heart as he spoke fondly of this album in interviews. &quot;Nightswimming&quot; is undoubtedly the bands best song ever, and never fails to move me after all these years. The front and back cover art is fantastic. I am reminded of that ship Superman flew off from Krypton in. <BR>This is also the album where Stipe became more mainstream in his appearance, spoting athletic shoes and baseball caps in promotional photos for the album. You knew REM had changed. They would never be the thrift store clothed jangly long hairs they were just four years earlier on Green. Thank god they still write good songs!
059035342X|3.0|Sweet Summer is about how the author, Bebe, grew up knowing and not fuly knowing her father. Every summer Bebe went down South with daddy where life was completely different than  with her mother in the North. Everythign was 'easy living' as she put it, where you could run down the lane in yoru bare feet, pump water and boil it for a hot bath,and where ain't wasn't a word momma could yell at you for. As much as I had enjoyed the book, it stirred up a few emmotions i had though hidden as it became more clear exactly how much she idolized her handicapped father Through different flashbacks of the summers they had shared an the laughs they enjoyed though her youth and well into her adult and mother hood. A must have novel for every &quot;softie&quot; out there.
B000002MU3|3.0|This is my least favorite REM album. The cover should be a warning that the album will be their least original and most disposable one yet. The band displayed that they would never be as original as they were on IRS records until this years &quot;Reveal.&quot; Granted, there are some good songs on this album, like &quot;I took your name&quot; which is my personal favorite (and killer live). &quot;Let me in&quot; is the most interesting song musically. Buck's guitar is like a continual spray of fire over Stipe's pained vocals about Kurt Cobain who had just killed himself while REM were recording this record.  &quot;Whats the Frequency...&quot; still manages to rock thanks to the chorus.  And who can forget the buttkicking &quot;Crush with eyeliner?&quot; Otherwise, you are in store for some bad tunes. &quot;Circus Act&quot; recalls STP or some other post grunge  &quot;Grunge&quot; band. &quot;Strange Currencies&quot; was better when it was called &quot;Everybody hurts.&quot; &quot;King of Comedy&quot; sounds like a recent Duran Duran song (yeah they still make records). And &quot;Tongue&quot; (which is about orally pleasing a woman) is nice for the piano, but Stipe's squeaky vocals are anything but sexy.<BR>All in all, I'd say pick this up in the used budget bin at record store for five bucks for the few good songs on here.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Along with LED ZEPPELIN III (1970), PRESENCE is undoubtedly the most overlooked and underappreciated album in Led Zeppelin's career.  That's really a shame, because this album isn't nearly as bad as many reviewers have claimed it to be.  The fact that this was released less than a year after the sprawling double album PHYSICAL GRAFFITI more than heightens PRESENCE's unfair reception.  But, that's their loss.  I believe that PRESENCE is a much more cohesive and well-made album, unlike the hack job of GRAFFITI where it contained some great tunes (&quot;Kashmir,&quot; &quot;Ten Years Gone,&quot; etc.) and some bad ones (&quot;Trampled Underfoot&quot;).<br />The opening 10-minute epic &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; is not only the band's best epic, but the best song they've ever done.  It's probably Zep's best overall performance.  John Bonham bashes his drum kit like the speed demon that he is, while John Paul Jones's galloping bass lines would make even Chris Squire green with envy.  Add Jimmy Page's wall-to-wall guitar riffs and Robert Plant's always mystical lyrics, and you got the makings of a great song.  Although the remaining six tracks on PRESENCE don't measure up to (or surpass) &quot;Achilles,&quot; they are still good nonetheless.<br />&quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine,&quot; though lacking lyrically, has an awesome harmonica solo and an excellent groove, while &quot;Hots On for Nowhere&quot; is as close to a catchy pop song as Zeppelin would ever make.  &quot;Royal Orleans&quot; is pure taut funk.  &quot;Tea for One&quot; is a slow, mournful blues dirge that shows the band at their most downbeat.  It kind of hints at what would happen to Zep in the next few years.  Despite the fact that the 18-day recording was rushed due to an approaching deadline and Robert Plant's broken leg subsided him, PRESENCE will definitely make itself felt.
B000002LOE|4.0|I always wondered if the band had heard The Mason Williams Phonograph Record when this came out. Spin magazine called it &quot;baroque&quot; and it certainly is. Full of lavish strings and horns and mandolins, &quot;Out of Time&quot; introduced an REM we never heard before. They still employ this style from time to time, and &quot;Reveal&quot; comes close in places to this 1991 release. I recall buying this when it came out and thinking the cover was horrible. Why the big logo covering a cool looking image of sepia toned water? Perhaps it was the bands way of saying &quot;REM will be huge witha this album.&quot; &quot;Losing my religion&quot; and its video made them huge stars indeed. Alot of people who never heard or bought an REM album bought this one.  There are two songs with Mike Mills on lead vocal, &quot;texarcana&quot; and &quot;near wild heaven&quot; and both are splendid pop tracks. &quot;Endgame&quot; is a majestic near instrumental (Stipe sings, but without words). &quot;Low&quot; is practically a spoken word track, bringing Jim Morrison to mind a bit. This album is so nifty that you forgive them for &quot;Shiney Happy People&quot; even!
B00000IJPU|1.0|Just about the only thing this disc is good for is nostalgia. I suppose if you've listened to Iron Maiden since the 1980s, you will be able to listen to this &quot;Best of&quot; album with fond memories to carry you through it. The problem is, Maiden's sound is now extremely dated; the band likely wouldn't even be signed to a record deal today because of its lack of talent. Bands like In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, and Children of Bodom (or, if power metal is your thing; Stratovarius, Sinergy, Nostradameus, and even Yngwie Malmsteen) have pushed their music so far beyond the reaches of the &quot;classic&quot; Iron Maiden sound that it's rediculous. The only somewhat decent track on the entire album is The Trooper, and even this I have no desire to ever hear again.<br />If this album chronicles the best of Iron Maiden, I'd sure hate to hear the worst.
B00005Q66T|2.0|No new songs or remixes....WHAT ??? Don't I already have all of these songs un-edited on CD and MP3 ????
B00000DI06|5.0|I have loved this hauntingly beautiful piece of choral music ever since I first heard it several years ago, though I do not generally like contemporary music.  In the wake of the events of 9/11 I found myself longing to hear it and pulled it off the shelf.  I have found it healing to listen to and am brought to tears during parts of it.  The performance is impeccable and listening to it takes me to a depth of experience of music that is rare and wonderful.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna has released 2 albums since this one and none of them, nor any before, have ever been even close to the masterpiece that Ray of Light is.  This is easily one of the best recordings out there and Madonna's best album.  Forget all this &quot;material girl&quot; nonsense, this is a more mature Madonna!  The album's first track, &quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot; is a Madonna masterpiece that sets the tone for the rest of the album.  After this, the album explodes into a truly unique sonic experience.  Aside from the singles &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, and &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot;, other gems from the album such as &quot;Swim&quot;, &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot;, &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot; and the haunting &quot;Mer Girl&quot; truly shine.  This is a definite must-have album!!!
B0000060NF|5.0|I've owned this cd for 3 years and it can't be touched. I'm 27 and I listen to all kinds of music from pop/rock like Rod Stewart to serious rap like N.W.A./ Dr. Dre, old stuff like Chuck Berry to newer stuff like Eminem. However this album is the best. I heard Inner City Blues when I was in high school and went and bought his greatest hits. Then a few years later I heard this album and I was amazed. The songs flow from one into the other, the messages are all good and hey, Marvin is one of the best voices we'll ever hear. Rarely do you get an album that every song is good; actually maybe only this album and Michael Jackson's Thriller (remember that's why Thriller is the best selling album ever). It's funny though, after watching that music special that appeared on all the channels after the World Trade Center attack I thought someone would sing What's Going On, but noone did. However, a few weeks later a few singers together released a version, but nothing compares to the original.  Right on Marvin.
B00004YKUY|5.0|I am giving \\"Arrival\\" 5 stars because I think it deserves every ounce of praise for such a bold effort without Steve Perry.<BR>It took guts to go on with out Perry, and I believe the New Steve fills his shoes quite amply........although I do miss Perry!<br />\\"Arrival\\" is what you expect from Journey, <BR>Schons Guitar sound is as classic as it has always been.<BR>I wouldn't say that \\"Arrival\\" stands out in comparison to previous Journey Cds, But I am completly taken in by a few songs on this Cd........<BR>\\"We Will Meet Again\\" is one that jumps out and grabs me in the heart.....this song appeals to the desperate Romantic idea that true love is quite possible and all it takes is time for it to rear itself.<br />\\"Livin' To Do\\".......every now and then a song will enter a persons life at just the right moment and helps you too see why music is so powerful........take the words to this song to heart!<br />\\"Live and Breathe\\"......its classic Journey in my mind again.<BR>Augeiri proves himself through his soulful voice in my opinion.<br />I have to say.....I am looking forward to more work from these guys.<BR>We have entered a whole new era of rock music.......I wished we didn't have to........I wished we all could embrace the greatness of the 70's and 80s a little bit more before everything completly changes.......everything must change I know, but as long as we can support such groups as Journey through its phazes and lineups and continue to buy their Cds as they release them, then I believe all this [stuff] we are hearing on the radio doesn't have to take over as soon as we let them.<br />Rock on Journey......!
B00005OMTT|5.0|For Enigma freaks like me, it seemed like a cop-out to release a greatest hits CD after making us wait for 2 years since the last CD.  BUT!!!  They've enhanced several of the songs to be more up-beat and modern and THEY ROCK!!  I'm SO glad I bought it!!
157270036X|5.0|I read &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; for the first time in my early twenties, and it changed the way I read books.  It more than entertained (although it did that as well), it made me look at my place in the world in a profound way.  I was skeptical when we found the audio book because so many times the reader gets in the way of the story.  Happily, this wasn't the case with this audio book.  Roses Pritchard perfectly captures Harper Lee's distinctive and straightforward voice, finding all the subtle nuances and bringing that small southern town to life.  We usually lend our audio books to friends when they take long car trips, but this is one that won't ever leave our library.  (We'll buy one as a &quot;bon voyage&quot; gift instead!)
B000000WJZ|5.0|When SIAMESE DREAM was initially released in the summer of 1993 it was hailed as alternative rock's first great post-NEVERMIND hope. And while it has gone on to become an overwhelming commercial success, it has also helped further re-draw the artistic borders of &quot;alternative&quot; music.<br />By combining neo-psychedelic AOR guitars (band-members proudly claim Boston as an influence) with Pumpkin auteur Billy Corgan's &quot;outsider&quot; lyrical stance, SIAMESE DREAM creates a rebel image; but one with a wandering eye towards mainstream acceptance as well. Consequently, Smashing Pumpkins are equally successful relating to young lollapaloozers and to classic rock radio.<br />The album's immediate attraction is plain to see. Corgan and co-producer Butch Vig have sculpted a sonic wall of guitars--in some cases, using up to 32 separate guitar tracks on a single song--that is electrifying in its sheer scope and power. Along with Jimmy Chamberlain's powerhouse drumming, guitarists Corgan and James Iha's thick sound endows SIAMESE DREAM with a fresh feel that holds up even on repeated listens--and how many other &quot;top ten&quot; albums can yousay that about?
0385484518|5.0|This book was required reading for a class and I am so glad that it was. The opportunity to read about Morrie's life showed my how important it is to stop and smell the roses.  This book is the type of book in which you read between the lines and relate it to our own lives.  Comparing what he has learned from his visits and what Mitch had forgotten as he grew can be a wake up call.  Life is so precious.<br />  This book shows us that even though we may have been raised without love we can change.  We do not have to be a person that continues our own selfish ways by putting work and money first and family second.  We should cherish all the time that we have with our families.  We are not immortal.<br />  When Morrie refers to the Family is my favorite Tuesday visit.  He states: &quot;The fact is, there is not foundation, no secure ground, upon which people may stand today if it isn't the family.&quot;  We must get back to our families again.  Stand beside each other and guide our families to a moral and loving foundation. <br />  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a  second chance.
B000006NPY|5.0|In the wake of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin's departure, the Pumpkins have taken a giant step away fromthe grunge-flavored, turbo-powered alt-rock anthems that made them famous. On ADORE, Billy Corgan and company opt instead for a more scaled-down approach that relies heavily on acoustic instruments and ballads of love and longing. Corgan may still be expressing angst here, but he does it in an understated, romantic way, addressing matters of the heart with subtlety and maturity on tunes like &quot;Shame&quot; and &quot;To Sheila.&quot;<br />Don't take all this acoustic-based balladry (a path also explored by James Iha on his solo debut) as a sign that the band is out of touch with contemporary production trends, though. Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb is on hand to add a sprinkling of electronica to the proceedings via his programming talents. His contributions, like much of ADORE itself, remains modestly unobtrusive, providing just the right underpinning for some of the tunes. As the album ends with a solo piano instrumental, we're reminded that Smashing Pumpkins are a band who refuse to ossify, constantly changing and evolving. ADORE is just one more leg of their continuing journey.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|since the release of emancipation in early 96 prince has seemmed to be fascinated by all this adult contemporary r&amp;b style. it's nice to see him finally spread his wings again and get a little more diverse. it is so nice to hear prince use new millinium sounds with his pre-existing funk style. and sometimes jazz, sometimes rock, sometimes blues, a couple parts even feel a bit trancy. frankly, i am amazed, and i think this is his best work since lovesexy. the overall concept is as deep as a pink floyd album, as is the atmospheric quality. sometimes sounds like a more electronic &quot;hendrix band of gypsys&quot; or even old &quot;santana.&quot; the chapters:1. the rainbow children: a sometimes dark jazzy smooth opus. kinda a cross between &quot;come&quot; and &quot;jam of the year.&quot; the outro to this is an awesome guitar segment that will leave your brains on the floor and remind you of prince's undeniable talent.2. muse to the pharoh: typical prince 90's r&amp;b. my least favorite track.3. digital garden: trancy santana style drums plus alan parsons style synths to make up one of the highlight tracks. music sounds vaugely like mr. mister's &quot;broken wings&quot; never the less, it is absolute genius.4. the work pt. 1: this funky soulful james brown influenced masterpiece sounds like it was performed at harpo's juke joint.5. everywhere: sickeningly jaunty swing infuenced track in the order of 1986's &quot;a large room with no light&quot;, but ultimately inferior.6. the sensual everafter: amazingly hypnotic instrumental soundscape that reminds me of gary numan's heyday. sweet solos give way to a grand closing overture. truly a triumph!6. mellow: r&amp;b strait outta the 70's, decorated with wonderfully sexy flute.7. 1+1+1 is 3: prince's updated electro-funk takes us back to school. sounds like a funkier &quot;girls and boys&quot; if you can imagine that! the definition of prince.8. deconstruction: more of a segue than a song. music is so atmospheric it sounds like something from roger water's &quot;amused to death&quot;.9. wedding feast: seems to be a take on broadway musical style. almost comedic among all these serious tracks, yet very catchy and fun. 10. she loves me for me: soft catchy little balled with outstanding chords during the bridges.11. family name: without a doubt the best track. i have tried to avoid lyrical comments, but this one is truly ingenius. this anti-racism song will be making you think for weeks. i am white and i still felt the power of this track. i think this was prince's point though.13. the everlasting now: funk juice down your leg! reminiscent of 1994's &quot;now&quot;.14. last december: another brilliant closing track in the order of purple rain, with guitar work that would make any guitarist jealous. the outro to this is so diverse and rocking it will leave you salivating for more.i haven't been able to get this disc outta my player since tuesday. thank you prince.
B000000W3G|5.0|Elaborately packaged in the kind of box in which people used to store vinyl singles, THE AEROPLANE FLIES HIGH is a set of 5 CDs, each containing a single from the Pumpkins' 1995 album MELLON COLLIE AND THE INFINITE SADNESS along with several B-sides. The singles are &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings,&quot; &quot;1979,&quot; &quot;Zero,&quot; &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; and &quot;Thirty Three,&quot; and the B-sides number 28, some of them previously unavailable in the U.S. THE AEROPLANE FLIES HIGH celebrates the chart hits while fetishizing those B-sides; they run the gamut of Pumpkindom, from stadium anthems and classic-rock ballads to metal thrashings and GISH-era indie rock.<br />The &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot; disc alone offers five covers: The Cars' &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight,&quot; Alice Cooper's &quot;Clones (We're All),&quot; the Cure's &quot;A Night Like This,&quot; Missing Persons' &quot;Destination Unknown&quot; and Blondie's &quot;Dreaming.&quot; These covers reveal the true heart of the Pumpkins, a band whose love of pop music is so unabashed and wide as to disallow any attempts to pigeonhole the band's sound. Some might consider this singles box-set business a bit of a self-indulgent vanity. But it's a perfect forum for the Pumpkins, who have always followed their whims and not commercial strictures.
B00003CXS4|4.0|(4 1/2 STARS) 'Snatch' is pure wild, zany fun. Expect to laugh out loud, and be reeling from the breathtaking action. From the writer/director of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch' is the most fun you can have watching a movie right now. The extras on the DVD are great, and worth the extra time to watch.
B000000W6R|5.0|Billy Corgan probably never smashed a pumpkin in his life. He was too busy making fun of the macho oafs who fueled their teen angst with power chords and cheap beer. Corgan is much more the type to hide in his room and write sweet songs or bash out manic sludgefests with tricky titles. &quot;Plume,&quot; being the perfect example, finds Corgan boasting &quot;my boredom outshines the sun.&quot;<br />Boasting aside, Corgan's boredom is not contagious or completely self-serving. PISCES ISCARIOT is a collection of B-sides and rarities that, even more than GISH or SIAMESE DREAM, offers insight into the workings of one of alternative rock's most sought-after songwriters.<br />Corgan's introspective quiet side is exemplified by his cover of Fleetwood Mac's &quot;Landslide&quot; and the Corgan original &quot;Soothe,&quot; which, in the spirit of lo-fi, he recorded in his apartment. The other side of the Smashing Pumpkins' sound is James Iha's driving guitar, a psychedelic sonic blast that is quickly distinguishable from the ranks of AOR and typical grungy alterna-rock. If you'rea fan of the Smashing Pumpkins' sound, PISCES ISCARIOT will show you where it all came from.
0312979479|5.0|This was the first Agartha Christie book I ever read (since then I have read many more because of this books excellence), and thought this book was excellent.  This is an amazing mystery, you will find yourself baffled to the end.  This is a must read mystery!
B000000WA4|5.0|When an artist releases a 2 CD set as an album, the album is usually filled with album filler, and basically all the good songs could have been placed on one CD. However, with MELLON COLLIE, the Smashing Pumpkins have created a set that is exciting for the listener, and will provide many repeated playbacks. All the songs here are excellent.<br />For all the criticisms levied on head Pumpkin Billy Corgan, one thing he can't be accused of is being narrow in his artistic vision. On the breakthrough SIAMESE DREAM, he and co-producer Butch Vig built a landscape of layered, corrosive guitars that shimmeredbrighter with each additional glance. On MELLON COLLIE AND THE INFINITE SADNESS, Corgan turns his eye to the dreariness of modern existence and comes up with a broad alterna-rock opus that plays out like an offspring of Roger Waters and Kurt Cobain--verbose and angst-ridden, bleak in its view, cathartic in nature.<br />With its two distinctly titled song-cycles and overture-like title track, there is no doubt that MELLON COLLIE is meant to be approached as a concept album, and Corgan's lyrical musings only reiterate the point. The songs explore alienation in the physical and spiritual worlds, generally concluding that it can seldom be overcome. Only the early &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; offers a glimmer of hope (&quot;believe that life can change, that you're not stuck in vain&quot;), on the wings of a soaring, string-laden production. Far more constant are spiritually depleting images of &quot;the world [as a] vampire, sent to drain&quot; (&quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot;), of love as &quot;suicide&quot; (&quot;Bodiesö&quot;) and of heaven's unresponsiveness (&quot;Zero&quot;).<br />The constant din of guitars that illuminated GISH and SIAMESE DREAM has been replaced with a varied sonic palette that reflects MELLON COLLIE's operatic nature. Piano interludes connect the opening title track and the closing &quot;Farewell And Goodnight&quot;; harps, harpsichords and other heavenly sounds trim &quot;Cupid De Locke&quot;; synthetic, Cars-like drums and a general faux-New Wave feel spur on &quot;1979&quot;; and &quot;X.Y.U.&quot; explodes with distorted guitar wallops and yelped vocals that scream post-modern confusion. The 28 tracks are as motley and disconcerting as the world they describe, and MELLON COLLIE is a dispiriting glimpse from the eyes of a man whose last vestiges of hope seem lost.
B00005Q66T|5.0|I was wrong about GHV2 the first time. After a few spins it's actually a great collection of songs. THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION still remains superior but GHV2 is a close 2nd. I now understand why &quot;rain&quot;, &quot;this used to be my playground&quot;, and &quot;you must love me&quot; were excluded from this collection. GHV2 would've been too slow and &quot;ballad-heavy&quot; if those were included. Anyway, GHV2 covers some of Madonna's best hits though the 90's-2001. Songs like &quot;deeper and deeper&quot;, and &quot;beautuful stranger&quot; are great. The ballad version of &quot;don't cry for me argentina&quot; is actually not bad. It would've been nice to have the dance remix included instead though. My only other problem with GHV2 is how obvious some of the edits are to some of the tracks. Songs like &quot;human nature&quot; and &quot;ray of light&quot; are SO obviously edited it's funny. Other than that, it's a great collection and it goes hand-in-hand with THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION and the DROWNED WORLD TOUR DVD.
B00001IVOF|5.0|This is the best MOBB album pound for pound.  If you not a MOBB fan, don't listen to this.  These two are the epitome of underground in a nutshell.  I hope this one coming up is as tight
B00005Q66T|4.0|I love this CD.  IT will forever rest next to The Immaculate Collection on my shelf.  Well technically it will rest beside Music, next to Ray of Light, etc.  I own every one of them.  So the Absence of new tracks warrants the question WHY??????   Well, it is MADONNA.  In spite of the fact there is no new material, Madonna's career can be traced through this album.  Listen to the songs in the sequence they are given and remember what the phases of her career were during this era from 1992-2001.  You will get it.<br />However....<br />If this were to be a true follow up to Immaculate, I think a better tracklisting would have been:<BR>Erotica<BR>Deeper and Deeper<BR>Bad Girl<BR>Secret<BR>Bedtime Story<BR>Human Nature<BR>You'll See<BR>You Must Love Me<BR>Don't Cry for Me Argentina<BR>Frozen<BR>Ray of Light<BR>Power of Goodbye<BR>Beautiful Stranger<BR>American Pie<BR>Music <BR>Don't Tell Me<BR>Impressive Instant
0452282152|5.0|This is a wonderful book for a long relaxing weekend.  The writing style flows for an easy read.  The author crafted a great piece of historical fiction and beautifully describes the time to bring you back there.  It was nice to learn a little about this artist that I otherwise would have overlooked.  The story leaves you wanting to investigate his other works especially when they are referred to throughout the story.
B000001Y42|5.0|This CD is perhaps the best offering by a band who's front man is as down to earth to his fans as can possibly be. Fred Durst's voical limitation is pushed to the extreme and every track is full of emotion and energy. I could really feel the hatred and misunderstanding in the first and second tracks. In addition, I could feel Fred's feelings abandonment on the sixth track. THE GOOD: EVERYTHING. It's all good on this album, there is not a bad thing about this album. From lyrics to production, every little detail is masterfully composed and blended together. THE BAD: 1) THE LAST TRACK. Some might say that the extended last track is too long and that the band ran out of material so they took the easy way out instead of writing more songs. This is an arguable point. 2) LANGUAGE. This album has some seriously foul language in it and therefore, under the current censorship of music, will not be buyable buy the kiddies;... <BR>  If you call yourself hardcord then you should already own this album and have listened to it 45 billion times over. For those that do not have this album, stop calling yourself hardcore until you get it. This is one of the few albums that I consider a \\"must have\\" for any collection. Nice work Fred and the rest of Limp Bizkit.
0385486804|1.0|Jon Krakauer chose to write about an actual person, so I cannot riff on him for the stroyline.  He can take the facts and paint a picture displayed beautifully in one's mind.  Unfortunately, his subject, Chris McCandless, is less than an interesting character.<BR>Common sense was not a prevelent resource found in McCandless.  Academic smarts could have carried him into law school, but a primal yearning sent him on a two year joy ride.  He left his parents behind, worried and scared.  They were his closest relatives, but they didn't know what had become of their son.  Somehow, he managed to keep in touch with those he met along the way.<BR>He left with a good plan to go into the wilderness; a deer rifle and a .38 offer enough stopping power for whatever he wants to eat.  Yet, he buried the rifle, and when he returned from Mexico, they confiscated his .38.  When he went into the bush with a .22, his future was grim if he intended to survive.  Let's face it: if you want to live, start packing some real heat.<BR>Aside from the firearms, he lost his car, burned his money, and what he was left with was shoddy equipment, which eventually led up to his death.<BR>Being forced to read this for English class doesn't help my opinion on this story either.  However, I hope that people will learn from McCandless' mistakes if they wish to go on such a journey.
B00000JCB2|3.0|Coming off one of the best debue albums of the century, Limp Bizkit seems to feel the pressure on this album.  They move away from the hardcore sound, mainly because Fred's voical cords were blown out, and try a different musical direction; one will alienate a ton of the hardcore listeners. <BR>  THE GOOD: 1) NICE MIX OF SONGS. Not every song here sounds the same; this is a good thing because it shows musical growth on the part of any band. 2) BIG SHOUT OUT TO THE FANS. Fred gives a huge shout out to the fans from various cities in one of the tracks. This is a nice touch because when bands get big they tend to forget about those cities and people that made them. <BR>3) THERE IS STILL AN EDGE TO THEM. &quot;Brake Stuff&quot; and &quot;Nookie&quot; are classic songs that will make the listener remember the likes of &quot;pollution&quot; and &quot;counterfit&quot; from the first album. 4) SMOOTH PRODUCTION. Once again this album is perfectly put together. There are no ruff edges and the songs flow smoothly into each other. <BR>  THE BAD: 1) WHAT HAPPEND? I was extremely excited when I heard that Limp was going back into the studio. I was drooling when I heard &quot;Nookie&quot; and could not wait until I got this album. When I finally did get it, after waiting in line for 4 hours, I was left speechless; speechless in a bad way. The addition of Scott W. from Stone Temple Pilots to the production team, did not help Limp, although Fred's voice did improve. A change this big in sound is not easily done by any aritist, although Bob D. continues to do it successfully, let alone on a bands second album. <BR>   Over all, I was disappointed by this offering from a band who defined angry. I hope this does not continue to be the direction that they choose. This offering is not a &quot;must have&quot; unless you really like change in your bands.
0451203933|4.0|Mark Bowden has done the military a great service by writing this book about the desperate battle fought in Somalia back in the early 1990s.  He provides today's military leadership with a detailed account of this tragic battle so that we can applaud those who fought so bravely in it, and hopefully avoid the mistakes that were made.  Many of these mistakes could have been avoided, and unfortunately cost US soldiers their lives.<br />The most compelling reason to read this book, is the accurate and balanced approach that the author takes.  He is not in the military, and does not have a specific agenda for writing this book.  Instead, he aims to tell the story of what went wrong, how the participants reacted (what decisions were made, why, and what effects did they have on the battle), and why this battle was lost, despite the bravery of those involved.  It is a sad part of US military history, but one worth telling generations to come.<br />For this book, Mr. Bowden spent a few years on interviews, went to the battlefield, and completed extensive research, in order to put all the pieces of the battle together.  The amount of research and documentation he completed for this book is impressive.  The fact that he spoke with many Somalia participants adds a realistic dimension to this story.  Not only do you get a feeling for what happened from the US perspective, but you also gain an understanding of the battle through the eyes of the Somalie people, as they experienced it.<br />The one complaint I have about the book (and reason I did not give it five stars) is that it is not very well written.  The action is gripping, and vivid, but the author's style is a bit simplistic for my taste.  Having said that, it is still an excellent read.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in modern military history.  Any current members of the US Army should take the time to read this book, and draw out the lessons learned in order to make sure that these kinds of mistakes are not made again.of mistakes are not made again.
0385505833|3.0|I've always enjoyed Grisham's novels, but am disturbed by the subtle racism in his newest book.  The book was fun-to-read and was read easily in one afternoon.  It had the pace of watching a movie.  The jabs at Peruvians, though, spoiled it for me.  I do not want to tell anything about the ending of the book for anyone reading it, but especially at the end, I found the racism a bit over-the-top.<br />The book really seemed like it was made to be a movie, and it looks like that is exactly what will happen.  Hopefully, they will take the racist dialogue out of it though.

B00005QK3W|5.0|I cannot believe some of the reviews here... <BR>Has anybody listened to the music inthe charts recently, <BR>because as far as I am concerned theres nothing in it but <BR>manufactured talentless boybands. There is actually very <BR>little good rock / rock and roll music coming out in the last <BR>few years (last week, I noticed that most of the top ten <BR>consisted of greatest hits compilations). <BR>As far as I am concerned Paul McCartneys new album contains some<BR>of the best rock I have heard in ages. Some of the reviews <BR>here are really unbelieveable. It makes me wonder do some <BR>people actually listen to it at all (more than once or twice!). <br />The whole album is so inventive, like the beatles were <BR>always so creative and thats waht I loved about them. <BR>Rinse the raindrops, Ruding into Japiur and Spinning on <BR>an axis are very creative and enjoyable tracks. Lonley <BR>Road and About You are the best rockers he's produced since <BR>the likes of Back in the Ussr and Get Back. <BR>From a Lover to a friend is a &quot;Georgous&quot; piece, as is <BR>&quot;I Do&quot;, &quot;Loving flame&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;. Your way is a great little <BR>country piece and &quot;Heather&quot; is musically excellent. <BR>I am glad &quot;Freedom&quot; was attached onto the end of the album, <BR>its very catchy and Paul is in great voice. <BR>The song &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is very catchy also, why oh why is <BR>everyone harping on about the lyrics, so what they go: <BR>&quot;12345 Lets go for a drive&quot;, its a feel good song anf lyrics <BR>dont always matter. Some of the best rock songs of all time dont <BR>make much sense...for example...the beatles &quot;hey bulldog&quot; <BR>and &quot;baby your a rich man&quot; or the stones &quot;Jumpin jack flash&quot;..<BR>what do they really mean???...who knows but still they ar great <BR>rock songs.....Anyway....what about the lyrics to a song that was<BR>number one on the charts in the UK and Ireland - &quot;Because I <BR>got high&quot;....great lyrics (not!). <BR>I love this album , people shuld stop complaining and start <BR>listening and not take the lyrics so seriously. <BR>Great album Macca!!!!
0553275569|5.0|Who is the true hero of the American space-race?  Is it an astronaut that started in the space program?  Or perhaps a man that we think of as 'a boy behind the rudder of America's self-esteem?'  If you think you know, then you might be surprised by this book.<br />The story is that of the development of the space program that eventually becomes NASA.  It is told in such a unique style and quasi hum-haw way that it keeps the reader gripping the pages and saying, &quot;Holy Mackin-oly son.  This is tense!&quot;<br />But I bet if an english teacher ever picked up this book they'd cringe (i.e. 'and the pilots soared and came back down to earth in a charred ball and the rest of the pilots brought out their blue dress suits and went to the funeral and sighed.)<br />But hey! This is entertainment...mixed with a some serious history.  So the level of enjoyment for the reader is up there.  I read the book in three days and laughed, cried or did both multiple times.<br />I think what made the book interesting was the fact that it was basically told from the perspective of one of the astronaut's wives.  Basically, but no wholely.<br />And who do you think the true hero is in this story?  Alan Shepard?  Neil Armstrong?  Buzz Aldrin?  How about another astronaut?  Or could it possibly be a man who's never been in space but has directed some of the best pilots in the world and has done incredible feats with those sound busting rockets strapped to his behind.  Could it be, Chuck Yeager?  Naw!  It couldn't be, could it?  Read the book!
B00005RFAI|3.0|When you think of the singer Pink you think of trendy, bad girl music that makes you want to dance...Well, that's what you would think of her before listening to this album.  She's still trendy and she's still a bad girl, but where's the dancing?<br />The lead single on this cd (&quot;I'm Coming Up&quot;) is the only truly feel-good song on the whole album.  The rest of this cd is very introspective and deals with a lot of Pink's &quot;issues&quot; with her past, her parents, broken childhood, etc.  In other words, a bunch of stuff that doesn't apply to or interest a lot of people who buy this type of music.<br />Pink's new sound may make her seem like a more credible musician in some ways, but this effort fails to stay true to what the fans fell in love with her the first time around for.  Her words don't have the insight of Alanis Morissette or Tori Amos, but they are thought-provoking in their own way.<br />Pink loses ground, however, when she gripes about Britney Spears (ala Willa Ford) and how she gets compared to her all the time in one of the songs.  On a personal note, Britney's new album is twenty times better than this one.  I can't help feeling that all the singers out there that keep picking on Britney are having some serious insecurities of their own that need dealing with.<br />Pink is treading a fine line here between sounding whiney and sounding like a surivivor.  This is a cd for hardcore Pink fans only.
B00005QZWI|3.0|I have to recognize that I was eagerly waiting for music that was to be original and fresh; Instead I found myself with  a kind of Hollywood standard music for an epic story. Overall, it sounds impressive and strong, the problem is that I feel that I have been here before...<br />One complaint on the score will be that there is a lack of memorable thematic ideas (except for Track No.2: &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;). Nevertheless, what really made me uncomfortable were the choral sections which on my humble point of view are an imitation of John Williams excellent music for &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. Williams shall be proud of being imitated on music for such a great film, but Shore should have made a better effort towards being original. On the other hand Enya's contribution does not add much value. Although her voice is great, the songs are nothing new under the sun...just different words.<br />On the bright side, I shall say that there are some tracks that I really enjoyed: No.2: &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, No.5: &quot;The Black Rider&quot; and No.17: &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. They are the highlight of the CD, with some interesting orchestrations and intelligent developments of the main motifs. <br />Don't take me wrong on my 3 stars, the score is enjoyable, and I love LOTR but I won't over-praise all that comes to me with the brand of Peter Jackson's film. If it's bad I will say It's bad. In this case, Shore's Score is just...standard, nothing else.
0679746048|5.0|highly recommended - - much better than the movie
B0000065O1|5.0|This video is great. She never repeats her moves - each one has a count of ten. It has good music and is hard. She gets to all muscle groups and has a minimum of high impact jumping around. It creates a great sweat and I never do it without being sore and tired afterward. :) I LOVE this video!
B00003CX8J|4.0|Before I get into this I should mention that I was a big X-Men fan back when I was about 11-12 and avidly collected the comics. So I went into this thing knowing who these characters were. That didn't prevent me from liking this movie though. In fact I appreciated the nods they put in to characters they didn't get into detail with (Iceman, Shadowcat)in this movie. Let's face it, there are enough X-Men out there to dedicate at least thirty movies to. Concentrating on these specific characters was the only way to make the movie work. Who really cares that Rogue doesn't have the powers she absorbed from Ms. Marvel when she was a villain and Mystiques young charge? Some things had to change to make this movie work and they did what they had to. Upset? then read the comics and leave the rest of us better adjusted types (i.e. those of us who have actually dated people and moved out of our parents basement into homes/apartments of our own)alone. I couldn't think of anyone better suited to play Professor X than Patrick Stewart. He is a great actor. I saw him on Broadway doing his one man show of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol in '95 and I knew then he was far more than Jean-Luc Picard. This man is a great actor with lots of range. Don't believe me? Check out &quot;Jeffrey&quot; for some amazing work by him. But I digress. He was great in this as was Hugh Jackman. I was a little disappointed in Halle Berry as Storm though. I didn't feel she had hit upon the spirit of the character.<BR>Here's an interesting tidbit I stumbled across: during part of the production Joss Whedon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame was brought on board to do a little work on the script. He admits to writing both the best and the worst line in the movie. I'll leave it up to the viewer to figure out which lines they are. Look for Spiderman in the hidden features on the DVD, he shows up to help our heroes out.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This review won't sway anyone one way or another.  Most people will buy this dvd regardless of their views of this one episode to keep their collection complete, but here's my two cents:<br />I love the Star Wars series.  I still enjoy rewatching the first three movies and can even put up with the Ewoks.  But this entry in the series is a total letdown.<br />Sure, it does fill in an important part of the Star Wars history, and could be used to build up to a great story, but by itself it is useless.  We get to see some interesting political maneuverings, for example, but without the payoff (we have to wait until the next movie).  The special effects ARE stunning (although the old animatronics and models still look better than some, not all, of the digitally produced characters and machines), but there is none of the storytelling magic of the first three.  About Jar Jar Binks (WHAT WAS LUCAS THINKING!?!?!?):  I did not understand how a character, especially a good guy, could be so utterly reviled by an audience until I saw this movie and was converted.  To be fair, his scenes during the big battle are somewhat comic, but most of the time he is a complete and utter irritant, made worse by the fact that some of the weakest digital imaging is done for his character. Darth Maul (or however his name is spelled) is an overrated villian.  Sure, he is visually interesting and a great fighter, but his character is never developed!  For the approx. ten minutes he's on screen, he just fights and says nothing.  (He'll probably be brought back somehow and hopefully given even a one-dimensional personality). For all we know, he's a nice guy who likes kittens who mistakenly thinks he's helping defend the good guys (although I seriously doubt it).  Lastly, the pod race is somewhat exciting (less so on the small screen), but there are many racing movies that are much better.<br />Overall, when viewed as part of the new trilogy, it'll likely be an important piece of an overall (I hope)great story, but for now, on its own, it fails to live up to Lucas' legacy.
B00005MAM2|5.0|As many people have said &quot;Akira&quot; is classic anime.  But why?  Is it the animation?  The plot?  What?  Well lets take a trip back to when this was first released shall we?  Back in the 80's (70's?) Disney ruled the world with an iron fist (Okay, so mabye the world hasn't changed THAT much!) cartoons were made &quot;for kids&quot; and nothing more!  Everyone knew that the word &quot;cartoon&quot; ment &quot;kids stuff&quot; or something like that, anyway...when Streamline Pictures first released this movie people reacted with shock!  People being shot, smashed, blown up (From the inside none-the-less)...this movie was a madhouse of gore!  Blood, language, MILD MILD MILD nudity (Really), there was even a scean where a guys guts just spilt on the floor (No joke)!!!<br />THIS wasn't something people were used to in cartoons...heck, this was definetly NOT &quot;kids stuff&quot; like cartoons normally were!  Not only was it bloody as hell, but the plot was complex and weird!  Remember those old horror flicks (You know, the one's that were actually smart)?  The plot in this movie resembled the weird twisted plot of an old Hitchcock movie (Although STILL not nearly as suspenseful)!  Of course lets not forget the fact that the animation was lightyears ahead of it's time!  People were wondering if Disney would ever make it to this level of animation with their films.<br />Whether they did or not is not for me to say, but lets just say it started the controversy of whether or not american animation was better then japanesse animation!  Not to mention the rockin soundtrack that was also tacked on made this one solid adult movie!  Now 20 (30?) years later, Pioneer Entertainment decided it was time for this wonderful movie to break out of it's shell and be seen again!  Pioneer spent $1 million dollers to re-dub, re-master, and re-sound (Okay so it's not really re-sounding, they just buffed the sound to suround sound.  Same thing right?) the movie so that it could shine!<br />While not many people saw it on the big screen, many people now have the chance to view this anime classic with a load of special features bound to please any fan!  The cons?  The special tin case is no longer available, and the may still be too gory for some people!  But other then that, &quot;Akria&quot; managed to set a whole new standerd for animation, and it also opened up many possablity's for future animated releases!br />While not many people saw it on the big screen, many people now have the chance to view this anime classic with a load of special features bound to please any fan!

6303477259|5.0|This concert video is without a doubt the best one I have ever seen, but why is not being published in DVD yet? We all have heard of release dates going back to early this year, but to no avail. Even Roger's 2000 tour is about to go on DVD pretty soon, so it is listed on Amazon's listing; in fact you can pre-order that one.
0517548232|5.0|The average American knows very little about economics or monetary theory. That's why they tend to believe whatever they see and hear on their televisions. By reading this short book, you'll gain a basic understanding of economics, and an explanation of the many myths that are taken as truths.<br />In the final chapter of this book, Hazlitt revists his work 30 years later (he was writing in 1978, and the book came out originally in 1946). He surmises that during that period, nothing was learned. If anything, he says, subjects related in the book (wage rates, price controls, government \\"make work\\") have become more political. I wonder what Hazlitt would say now.  <br />You need to read this book in order to appreciate the real consequences of actions your government wants to take. The theme emphasized over and over in the book is that actions must be thought through to see what the long term effects will be, not just the highly visible short term ones.

B000001EHS|5.0|this is an album with all the best Def Leppard trax and for anyone who enjoys their music....go get this album.<BR>IT'S  SIMPLY AMAZING.
B00005B4GU|4.0|The only reason this CD doesn't have 5 stars is because it is slightly short in length.  It is about 40 minutes long, but all the songs are incredible!  There is not a dull moment in this CD, no fillers, everything is great.  I will say, I only have OK Computer and Amnesiac, so I cannot compare it to their others.  But I think it is better than OK Comp because there is more variety, more electronic and weird sounds are found in Amnesiac than mainly guitar in OK Comp.  It is very relaxing to listen to, perfect for any occasion, whether working hard or going to sleep.  The Pyramid Song is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, quite simply.  I cannot chose a favorite because all of the songs are very good.  <br />If you don't mind a short CD, then consider my rating 5 stars.  I usually listen to heavy metal/industrial, so this is a refreshing change when I feel like listening to something softer.  I actually picked this CD up solely because of the name:  Raidohead... it sounds like a cool band!  (I know thats not always the best way to chose a CD!)  But I was lucky this time and I actually LOVE it.  <br />In summary, Amnesiac is a great album mainly because there is more variety in their songs and the experience will be even better if you have OK Computer and are ready to buy Amnesiac.  If you do have OK Computer, dont hesitate to buy this!  If you've never heard Radiohead, this is a great starter!
B00003W8NM|5.0|i bought this dvd a month ago and watced it for the first time it is the most interesting, funny, well written, well acted, movie i have ever seen definatly worth a buy edward norton is great, brad pitt is amazing, helena bonham carter is hilerious i love the end and the overal feelings it left me with definatly a must have in your dvd collection.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie was a nice surprise for me.  I was dead set against even renting this movie. Am I glad I did.  While I haven't seen Reese Witherspoon in many movies, she is very good in this one.  It is the perfect light-hearted movie with an encouraging theme for such serious times as we find ourselves in.    Reese shines as a student who goes from a fashion merchandising school in CA then goes to Harvard Law school to get the man of her dreams.  Her portrayal of Elle is great because,  she never comes off dumb as stereotypes suggest. Au contraire. She comes off as independent, smart and very savvy in the wiles of womanhood.  Bravo! <br />This will go good with the rest of my DVD collection.  It will come in handy when I need that pep talk that says....GO GET IT!
B00005OM4N|5.0|I own all of Britney Spears cds but it's her latest release that proves we are gonna be seeing alot of Britney for a very long time.  On her new self titled album Miss.Spears has never sounded stronger,funkier,or more in control.  She starts us off with her sexy first single &quot;Slave 4 You&quot;,then gets edgier with songs like &quot;Lonely&quot;,&quot;I Love Rock And Roll&quot;, and &quot;Overprotected&quot; which all let us know that Britney is no longer a little girl.  The tracks that really stood out to me were &quot;Boys&quot;&amp;&quot;What It's Like To Me&quot; (where we hear a very recognizable Justin Timberlake doing some hot background vocals) where I have to say Britney just sounds like a total badass chick!  There is also a beautiful ballad &quot;Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman&quot; that shows us that our little Brit is quite capable of taking care of herself.  To me &quot;Britney&quot; is this era's &quot;Control&quot; by the icon herself Janet Jackson.  Bottom line,I Am Britney-Hear Me Roar!
0451204530|3.0|Very choppy with historical references to a point of being confusing (WWII, Space Race, Cold War scattered throughout). Character development very weak and outcome in many ways very predictable. Did like Billie!<br />Felt like pieces of several other novels and movies somehow taped together. Found myself racing through the plot and simply disregarding the other fragments which had no added value. I know Follett is more capable then that. <br />Take a walk on the beach, clean the slate and use the type of firepower you have.<br />You got to be kidding me - swimming out to sea
0671027379|2.0|What nonsense! Could not possibly be more far fetched. This book had a great premise and is very easy to read but falls apart very quickly. Under water volcanos? They exist I guess, but come on with this ending! There is also a large mistake at the end that is rather easy to pick up on. I will not give the ending away (which, unfortunatly, seems to be a growing trend in these reviews) but some of you will figure it out.<br />Move on to more worthy books.
B000002ULO|5.0|Although this Cd has been out for a while now, I don't think it's ever had the recognition that it deserves.  I have been a rabid fan since 1963 and it definately is some of Paul's best work.  Please check it out if you haven't yet.
B00005OWIU|3.0|A couple of nice themes, but vintage Williams this is not. Then again, considering the film itself is lacking ideas, it's not surprising that the soundtrack is too.<br />Save your money and buy the staggeringly good Lord of the Rings soundtrack instead.
B00001NFCY|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Higher&quot; I wondered when Pearl Jam went back to basics.  The entire album is moody, deliciously played, and filled with complex lyrics that will make you think.  It is a little reminiscent of the Seatle Sound, without screaming half as much.  If you love rock, this will blow you away.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Well, like a lot of people, I was worried about Howard Shore doing this movie. But what an INSPIRATIONAL choice it turned out to be. I can't imagine anyone else doing what he's done for this score. It just doesn't have that hallmark sound that you know you would get with a Williams or a Horner score. It is so fresh and exciting, with its own sound, that gloriously brings middle-earth to life better than I ever expected. Even without the movie, this would be the best thing to have come along for Tolkien fans in many years as a companion for the books. It just captures everything, the simplicity of Shire life, the gothic fear of the nazgul, the dark sense of history, the beauty and wonder of Rivendell, and the other-worldly, slightly sorrowful feel of Lothlorien.<br />There are simply no weak tracks. But if asked for my favourite tracks, I would list 'The Prophecy', 'Concerning Hobbits', 'Many Meetings', 'The bridge of Kazad-dum', 'Lothlorien', 'the great river' and 'the breaking of the fellowship'. There are just too many highlights!! This is definitely my favourite score of all time. I didn't think the Star Wars scores would ever be beaten, but they have been. If Shore doesn't get an oscar for this score I will be furious. And if the movie lives up to the score, it will, without a doubt, be the greatest film of all time.

B00003CX5P|2.0|A great movie shouldn't have to rely on outside material or previous knowledge (ex. sequals, prequals, books, etc), it should just convey its message on its own.  This movie isn't a great movie and neither is it any good.  This movie relies on previous knowledge and old characters.  Oh I can understand why we have Obiwon, Anakin, and a short appearance by Yoda.  They are requirments in the Star Wars epic.  But why do we need to have an appearance by R2D2 and C3P0?  Why do we need such simplistic hooks to draw us in?  They are totally unneccesary characters that don't add value to the story.  Add a new character with Jar Jar, obviously to draw in the kids, and you got a horribly annoying cast of characters (Anakin was another majorly annoying character).  In the preview comericials we see extensive scenes of Darth Maul.  He only is on for about 10 uneventful minutes.  Oh we get a good battle scene with him but the character wasn't fleshed out enough.  Another character that deserved more explanation was Obiwon.  Personally, I belive the movie should have focused on the development of Obiwon rather than the annoying Anakin. Another bad thing about the movie was all the pseudo-religious and genetic talk about the origin of Jedi Knights and the Christ-like birth of Anakin.  I don't mind stuff like that but the information was out of place and didn't flow and seemed too corny.  But I can't say I wouldn't get this movie.  I'm a diehard Star Wars fan and hopefully somebody will get this for me as a gift.  It was okay better than some no-story action flicks out there.  But it was neither great or good.
B00005N5VO|1.0|C'mon people! How fun is it to watch a racist, lewd, borrish, and dumb person beating up people for no (...) reason. As little as possible.

B0000026KQ|5.0|This is definatley one of Beck's best albums. Before I go on, let's clarify that. Jeff Beck's best albums, IMHO, are: Blow by Blow, Wired, Guitar Shop, and You Had It Coming. <br />Like on Jeff's new release, You Had It Coming, he serves us with some raw guitar with funky beats and great stuff to listen to. It's great to listen to in the car. As always, Jeff's solos are timeless on this album. Where Were You is worth the price of the album alone. It's Guitar Shop's 'how did he do that!' song. <br />As with all Beck releases, his genius and emotion are served at great amounts. Savoy, Stand on It, Big Block....they are all great songs. As said before, Where Were You is the standout. A Day in the House is REALLY fun to listen to, it's really funky and portray's Jeff's humour as well. It's a great album.

0446310786|5.0|This book is one with both style and substance. The story itself<BR>is compelling, but the writing is also great. This isn't a dumb-downed John Grisham-type popular novel, nor an overly pretentious John Updike &quot;literary&quot; story. The voice of Scout is perfect and it is very rare to see a child portrayed rightly. Unlike other books, the children are neither adults in small bodies nor treated as human larvae unable to understand the world. The things that Scout doesn't understand are the things about this world that don't make sense: racism and injustice. This is one of the handful of books that are close to perfection.
0375701427|5.0|This is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it.  However, if you plan to read it, please steel yourself for a very dense, emotionally gripping experience.  &quot;American Pastoral&quot; can be very disturbing.  If you're like me, you won't mind this sort of intellectual disturbance; but make sure you're in the right mindset for it (this is not a book I would recommend to anyone who is feeling particularly depressed).<br />I found that it was a little slow in the beginning, but as I kept reading I couldn't put it down.  The story, in fact, is one that the narrator (a writer) is &quot;making up&quot;; but as the book goes on and you get deeper into the plot, that detail is forgotten.  Instead, you are led to concentrate on &quot;the Swede&quot;, a man befuddled by life's imperfections and by his own personal tragedies.  <br />This book is very well written and I really enjoyed it, in a masochistic sort of way.

B00005PJ8I|2.0|Cast Away (Robert Zemeckis, 2000)<br /><br />Okay, I have to get this out of my system right now. &quot;Castaway&quot; is ONE WORD. Not two. ONE.<br /><br />And now, on with the review.<br /><br />It has been a painfully long time since Robert Zemeckis made a good film (Peter Jackson was responsible for The Frighteners, Zemeckis only lent his name); depending on your point of view, that could be Death Becomes Her, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Back to the Future, or if you're _really_ a purist, Used Cars. Cast Away was the great white hope, the movie that would bring Robert Zemeckis' career back from the grave he'd dug with such abominable tripe as Forrest Gump and What Lies Beneath.<br /><br />Sorry. No luck.<br /><br />In two and a half tortuously long hours, Zemeckis leads Tom Hanks through Christmas dinner, a plane ride, three raft trips, another plane ride, a taxi, and an SUV. And while there are a few other supporting players in the movie (Helen Hunt, a woefully underused Chris Noth, an even more woefully underused Lari White in her first big-screen appearance since the Ben Cross vehicle The Unholy twelve years before), make no mistake-- this movie is about Tom Hanks and His Ability to Act. Because of that, the only relationship in the movie that actually makes any sense is that which Hanks forms with his well-known pal Wilson, the volleyball who keeps him company during his stint on the island. (In Zemeckis' favor, the volleyball never does develop a voice. I feared that for about an hour.)<br /><br />Given that the movie IS about THaHATA, one wonders why we really needed that hour or so of frame time that surrounded THaHATA. What's Helen Hunt doing here? Despite her role as Hanks' wife-to-be at the beginning and the yardstick we are (presumably) supposed to use to judge how the world has gone on without him at the end, her relatinoahip with Hanks is far less convincing than Wilson's. Like Noth and White, a good actor in a bad role.<br /><br />Trimming forty-five minutes of frame would have made this watchable, at least. As it stands now, rent it if you like Tom Hanks and have a coupon for a ninety-nine cent rental. **minutes of frame would have made this watchable, at least.

0385505833|5.0|Laughing out loud at the situation the main character gets himself into, I found myself identifying with his disdain of the commercialism of the holidays, yet lacking the courage to do anything about it as he tries to do. I couldn't put it down. To be perfectly honest, (and perhaps blasphemous) I tend not to read Grisham's works knowing they are likely to be made into movies in short order. Now I may actually forge ahead and read his next novel before it makes it to celluloid. Total chuckles.
B00005LLK8|2.0|Billy Elliott (Stephen Daldry, 2000)<br /><br />The surprise hit of 2000, and I can't for the life of me figure out why. Daldry throws scene after scene of unmitigated emotional manipulation at us without ever really bothering to connect them. Plotlines begin and disappear (mostly to accentuate points of character; it's easier and more effective to do so without introducing subplots you don't plan to do anything with), characters are developed and then never realized, ambiguity reigns in areas where definition cries out for exposure, and the soundtrack is a horrid mishmash of songs that may have been appropriate where they were, had the movie's subject matter been about the same things as the songs were (most notably The Clash's &quot;London Calling,&quot; which lent a great deal of weight to what was, at best, a minor scene).<br /><br />As with Cast Away (ONE word, not two...), a director took a fine cast of characters and refused to let them come through. The most heartbreaking example of this is Debbie (Nicola Wilson in her screen debut), the daughter of Billy's dance teacher and a possible love interest-- until she disappears from the movie without any explanation.<br /><br />Could have been much, much better than it was. **
B00005NB0H|4.0|I agree with the other posts and think this reissue is great. However, instead of releasing a double CD containing the 1995 reissue, why not release LIVE AT LEEDS (Part 2), a single disc containing the songs from Tommy?

The book didn't live up to its hype.<br />The ending was quite good and I liked how the individual stories of each of the characters came together in the end.  As a matter of fact, the ending alone is worth the price of the book (Myrna and Ignatius deserve each other).<br />I found myself feeling embarrased for Ignatius throughout this book.  After Toole described him, I felt like I had to go take a shower.  Any other who can inspire that kind of response is worth a read.
0743420373|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J Stanley and William D Danko is sumed up by the title. it portrays the true life of a millionaire as researched by the authors. they talk about the lies of millionaires, their financial issues and the misperceptions about them. stonley and danko do a great job at analyzing the millionaires of today. unlike the &quot;big spender&quot; misconception many of us have, they portray them as regular people who save their money consistantly.<br />its a very interesting book. it does broaden horizons on the millionaire issue, but its mostly meant for people who are looking to become millionaires or learn about finance. i would definatly recommend it to these people.
B000059HCJ|4.0|This film begins innocuously enough but gradually becomes somewhat difficult to endure, and this is intentional.  Aronofsky has masterfully woven the visual, aural and thematic threads of Requiem into a tight, captive dynamic meant to be as excruciating for the viewer as it is for the characters.  (Ever wonder what Alex in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was being forced to watch?)  Yet the consensus seems to be that this is primarily an anti-drug film, the bad taste it leaves in your mouth is explained as some kind of &quot;scare-you-straight&quot; tactic employed by the director.  Don't believe it, drugs are a sidelight here.  Which is not to downplay the devastation they wreak on the lives portrayed.  But the truly frightening aspect of Requiem is the hollow relationships on display even before drug addiction becomes the uncontested villain.  We begin at zero humanity-wise and it progressively gets worse, relationships that cannot stand on their own are actually reinforced (in that emotional interaction/bonding occurs) precisely because drugs introduce a sick passion, a direction for lost souls to pursue.  When a certain character takes to turning tricks for her fixes, it makes her less ambiguous; she finally has something engaging to do.  Each character has some kind of self-prescribed or imposed deficiency that precedes and exacerbates his/her drug problem.  This alienation is the most realistic aspect of the film, not the depths they sink to.  The bleakness, the oppressive absence of connectedness, almost makes their flight into oblivion understandable.  The most disconcerting aspect of Requiem for a Dream is what we allow it to show us about the things we value.  Recommended, but not for everyone.
B00005QDW5|2.0|I believe Pink Floyd is a very creative, original, talented band. However, I think this collection is very disappointing. I like many of the songs on this album and the artwork is amazing, but I don't like them all. Far from it! I'm glad that classics like &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Us and Them&quot;, &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; (the entire epic), &quot;Great Gig In the Sky&quot; appear on this compilation. They deserve to be there. I'm also very impressed that they included as many songs recorded during the Syd Barrett era as they did. They are often forgotten by radio and the buying public. BUT, there are also many Pink Floyd songs that are not on this compilation that should be. What happened to &quot;Brain Damage&quot; from DARK SIDE OF THE MOON? What happened to &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; or &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; from WISH YOU WERE HERE? What happened to &quot;Not Now John&quot; from THE FINAL CUT (which is an underrated song and album)? There are also songs on this compilation which SHOULD NOT be there. For instance, why in god's name are there ANY songs from DIVISION BELL? That was Floyd's worst album and not a high point in their career. In fact, it probably ruined their career. If you're going to include anything from DIVISION BELL, choose only &quot;Take It Back&quot; (not on compilation) which is the best song from that album (which isn't really saying much). I would have easily chosen &quot;On the Turning Away&quot; and/or &quot;Dogs of War&quot; from MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON, instead of &quot;Sorrow&quot; (which I think is quite boring)? I like a lot of the songs on this compilation, but all in all, it is very disappointing.

B00005LOUP|5.0|Taking Dr. Seuss's legendary 1966 cartoon classic &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, to the big screen was a pretty big risk.<br />But the passion of all those involved was captured and a newer story for both child &amp; adult evolved.<br />Ron Howard was the perfect Director for this mission &amp; who else but Jim Carrey could bring &quot;The Grinch&quot; to life?  The town of Whoville and its occupants were colorfully brought to life.  The Grinches Mt. Crumpits lair was too.<br />The Widescreen DVD provides us the BIG PICTURE and the gorgeous set designs and the colorful land of Whoville!!<br />The cast was perfect.  Narrated by Sir Anthony Hopkins.  The three stars of the movie to me was &quot;The Grinch&quot; (the unbeleivable Jim Carrey), Cindy Lou Who (a delightful 6 year old - Taylor Momsen) and Max the dog (Grinches only true friend until Cindy captures his heart which is &quot;two sizes to small&quot;).<br />The extras abundant and great Rhyme quizzes, so pay attention!<br />This movie is true to; Dr. Suess, The Grinch, Whoville, the children and now the adults who enter the world of &quot;Dr. Suess&quot;.<br />Enjoy this new version (along with the original animated version) of the &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Ok I know Incubus is a great band. Don't get me wrong I love them! Especially &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. I love that album! So it's safe to say I was expecting that kinda music on their next album. But thats not what I got. This album consists of really slow songs that kinda drag on and on. Especially &quot;Mexico&quot;. I think it is safe to say that this album is pretty much nothing like &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, so if thats what you were expecting, like me, then you'll be dissapointed. But if your in the mood to mellow out to some slow love songs then this is perfect! But for hard rock and maybe be classified as &quot;Angry&quot; songs.. listen to their previous albums.
B00003CX5P|5.0|When I originally saw this in the theaters (opening week, of course), I was somewhat disappointed.  When it came out on DVD, I rented it and liked it better.  I bought the DVD and have viewed it several times since then.  Each time I like it better.  There is much more to the story than meets the eye (and Jar-Jar gets less annoying).  Although the transfer isn't the greatest, it is still good and better than some theaters.
B00005RIKD|5.0|I had fun listening to this one.  I sat on the edge of my chair for the duration of the album, headphones clamped around my ears, adrenaline pumping, revelling in the transformations these pieces had gone through.  When you love something and know it by heart, it can be either inspirational or slightly traumatizing to see it continue to evolve.  Well, I wasn't traumatized a bit.<br />This album puts Sting's range of styles and influences together in a playful way.  Kipper's entrancing synth textures and Manu's dead-on percussion (along with contributions from many other musicians here) give each song a whole new life.  And Sting, well, he still has his sexy voice, his charismatic energy, his habit of perpetual self-reinvention, and everything else intact.  Lucky dog.<br />Every time Sting shifts his style with a new album, I suppose he alienates a few listeners.  I can't believe some of the ridiculous criticisms I've seen from people who don't like Sting's experimentation or just have a grudge against Sting himself.  Bah.  Whatever!<br />I bought the album in Paris.  I didn't realize that my European location entitled me to an extra track (&quot;Mad About You&quot;) until I read these reviews.  It's a sweet bonus.  But my favorite track?  &quot;Fragile.&quot;  Ahhhh.  The variations and synth textures injected here are fun.  Er, maybe fun isn't the best word.  It's fascinating, and even educational.  Yes.<br />The whole album is a tasty lesson in musical reinvention.  Yum.
6305132984|5.0|Those who have nothing will do everything in their power to protect it, even if all they have is territory, in which case they will claim ownership by planting a metaphorical flag in the middle of it and marking the boundaries.  And, forever after, anyone invading their \\"turf\\" had better have a good reason, because within this imaginary domain a peer status is also established, and to some-- especially the ones at the top of the pyramid-- this becomes all they have or will ever hope to have in their entire lives.  But there is one thing that will ultimately, at least for some, supersede this delusional monarchy, and that thing is universal:  Love.  Which is exactly what happens when a young couple from different sides of the street fall in love, in the landmark musical \\"West Side Story,\\" directed by Robert Wise, with staging and choreography by Jerome Robbins.  The streets of New York City are the setting for this contemporary version of Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" the drama of which plays out within the confines of a microcosmic world which encompasses a sparse few city blocks and is ruled by rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, who are constantly vying for territory and whose soul purpose in life is protecting their turf.  Tony (Richard Beymer) is a former Jet, once one of their leaders, in fact, but has left it all behind in an attempt to get on with his life.  His best friend, Riff (Russ Tamblyn), however, is still the leader of the Jets, who are currently embroiled in their ongoing fight with the Sharks.  Maria (Natalie Wood) is Puerto Rican, and her brother, Bernardo (George Chakiris) is the leader of the Sharks.  And when circumstances bring Tony and Maria together and they fall in love, it sets the stage for tragedy on a grand scale, all of which is captured on the screen in this film, the most celebrated musical of all time.<br /> When a movie earns ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director (Jerome Robbins also received a special award for choreography), it clearly indicates that this is a film of extraordinary merit.  And this one is-- by anyone's measuring stick.  Told through the magic of music, presented through the dramatic and driving Oscar winning songs and score of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, Shakespeare's tragic love story becomes a transporting, memorable experience that is at once a sweeping visual extravaganza while at the same time an intimate chronicle of the romance between the star-crossed lovers, Tony and Maria.  Lavishly staged, the film evokes a true 1950's sensibility while retaining the agelessness of the passion at the heart of the story.  The production numbers are dynamic, from the quietude of the enthralling and poignant \\"Maria,\\" and the perky, uplifting \\"I Feel Pretty,\\" to the energetic \\"Dance At The Gym\\" and the thundering, dramatic strains which accompany the rumble.  This is an example of filmmaking at it's best, brought to fruition through the talents of Wise, Robbins and a superlative cast and crew, whose many and varied individual contributions are too lengthy to mention here.<br /> This may not have been Natalie Wood's greatest role, but she is nevertheless unforgettable as Maria.  She is charming and beautiful, with riveting, dark eyes that speak volumes about her character.  Her accent is passable, if not perfect, but most importantly her natural ability as an actor enables her to create a very real, believable person in Maria.  There's an endearing vulnerability about her, yet in her eyes you find the pride and determination that makes Maria strong.  It's a solid performance, and just one of the many reasons this film was so well received.<br /> This was without question Richard Beymer's day in the sun, career-wise, and his portrayal of Tony is credible, but fairly lackluster.  If a weakness in the film could be singled out, it would be his performance; still, he does well enough, but in the end his work here is average, to say the very best.  As his buddy, Riff, Russ Tamblyn comes across much better, and makes the most of showcasing his considerable talents in what is one of his most memorable roles, as well.<br /> The performances that really steal the show, however, are turned in by George Chakiris as Bernardo, and Rita Moreno as Maria's friend, Anita; both of whom deservedly received Oscars in the Best Supporting categories for their work here.  Chakiris, with his dark, good looks has never been more convincing or better in any role, and he has a commanding presence especially in the production numbers.  And Moreno is in a class all her own as the fiery Anita; she dominates the screen whenever she is on, especially during the dance at the gym and in the rousing \\"America.\\"  She is such a vital presence in this film, and along with Chakiris, more than helps in bringing the music and story to life.  <br /> Also in supporting roles that add so much to this film and demand to be singled out, are Tony Mordente, as Action; Tucker Smith, as Ice; David Winters, as Arab; and Eliot Feld, as Baby John.  <br /> The additional supporting cast includes Simon Oakland (Lieutenant Schrank), Ned Glass (Doc), William Bramley (Officer Krupke), Bert Michaels (Snowboy), Susan Oakes (Anybodys), Gina Trikonis (Graziella), Carole D'Andrea (Velma) Jose De Vega (Chino), Jay Norman (Pepe) and Gus Trikonis (Indio).  An emotionally involving story underscored by a blood-stirring soundtrack, \\"West Side Story\\" is without question one of the all time great movie musicals, thoroughly entertaining and presented with the kind of flare that is rarely even attempted anymore.  Within the genre, it's the best of the best, the realized vision of a group of extraordinary artists.  Earning Oscars, as well, for Cinematography, Costumes, Art and Set Direction and editing, this is a prime example of the true magic of the movies.
B000002H6C|5.0|Personally, i find this metallica's best album from a thrash point of view.  Most of the songs are fast and furious, except for &quot;One&quot;.  Incredible tone by Hetfield (no bass required) and the rest of the band races neck and neck with him in the talent arena.  Metallica really stepped up its viciousness and explored new themes on this incredible album.
B00005OWIU|2.0|John Williams has written the score to over 160 TV shows and movies, and the laws of statistics would dictate that no matter how good or bad he is, he?s bound to write a winner once in a while.  Rarer still are those times when John turns out film-music which is nothing short of genius (i.e. &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;Schindler's List&quot;).  His usual fare, however, is entirely too predictable, entailing a catchy theme - most likely recycled from earlier in his career - and small cameos by two other, minor themes.  This whole package is then shoved down moviegoers' throats.  The Harry Potter Soundtrack is no exception.<br />John Williams pushed no envelopes with this score, as his butt was firmly planted in his own, tired idiom (sans the Darth Vader March):  A haunting, tinkly little melody, oft repeated by blasting french horns or other such brass? lots of fanfares and screeching, swirling strings.  The only problem is each track, with few exceptions, is the same as the next.  I would posit that it took Williams one weekend and two bottle of red wine to write the score from start to finish.  Once he got the prologue theme down, the rest was autopilot.  <br />This is not brilliant film-scoring, but the music is catchy.  Buy it if you want it.
B00001IVOF|5.0|Mobb Deep are some of the most lyrical underground cats in the game. The Infamous was tight but this one really hit home. Havoc's production is incredible and Prodigy's thorough delivery is off the hook. My favorite tracks are G.O.D Father III,Give it up fast,Nighttime Vultures and Extortion. This is another classic album from the Infamous Queensbridge crew. One Luv...
B00005N9CV|3.0|Aside from my title and rating, I won't say anything more about the music here. Plenty has been said by others already. I just want to point out, for those who may not know, that the &quot;collectible&quot; edition with 2 bonus tracks, which some sellers here are listing for more than $20, is really just a Target exclusive which you can buy at regular price at any Target store. (The bonus tracks are &quot;Charmed Life&quot; and &quot;The Man w/ the Bag,&quot; both currently heard in Target ads.) <br />I just hate to think of some unsuspecting person getting burned. Be careful, don't pay &quot;collectible&quot; prices until the thing actually goes out of print.
B000002H33|5.0|I just bought this the other day, and already it's my favorite album. I now own 4 'Tallica CDs(ride the lightning, black album, reload, and master of puppets), and MOP is definately the best of them. I mean, it is just so damn good. <br />Battery: cool acoustic intro, then speed on guitars and drums. Hot damn, this song is awesome.<br />Master of Puppets: title track. In my own opinion, an OK song, but nothing special.<br />The Thing That Should Not Be: my favorite on this album. Heavy and simply just a kick-@$$ song.<br />Welcome Home(Sanitarium): amazing,incredible song with great lyrics.<br />Disposable Heroes: An OK song,in my opinion probably the worst song on the album, but still good.<br />Leper Messaih: great song about a false prophet or teacher or something like that.I really like this song.<br />Orion: amazing instrumental. I don't think it's as good as The Call of Ktulu(from RTL), but it's still an incredible song.<br />Damage,Inc: fastest drums I've ever heard,not only from Metallica,but from anyone! WOW! This song is fast and heavy.Good way to finish off the greatest Metallica album ever, and maybe the greatest album of all time.
0140434259|3.0|A Jane Austen fan, I was disappointed with this book.  The language, the style of writing was not in contrast with her other works, but the characters and plot did not interest me.  Marianne was decidedly a young woman whom I had no interest in.  She was too wrapped up in her own little world to be a girl who deserved the compassion which Austen tried to ilicit. Besides this, Marianne and Elinor's prejudices made them seem as ill-bred as the company they ridiculed for being such.  Although I liked Elinor for her honesty and compassion and hated Willoughby and Lucy Steele because of who they were, I was so disappointed with the conclusion that these three did little to save this book.  My recommendation: read Pride and Prejudice or Emma instead.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|I was immediately intrigued by the commercials and clips when this movie was released, but I'm one of those who never seem to get to the movies.  So, I kept my eyes open for its release on video, at which point, I snatched it up and brought it home.  I was not disappointed.  This is the kind of movie they just don't make anymore.  Nowadays, you can usually watch a bit of a movie and predict the end.  I tried to do that with Frequency, but it just didn't work.  Every time I THOUGHT I had it figured out, they changed something in the past, which changed something in the future, making my idea of the ending not possible.  I never did guess the ending and was thrilled and surprised when it came.  I was also thrilled to have watched a movie that could keep me in suspense right up to the end, not to mention a movie that was about nice people who loved each other in what some would consider a &quot;mundane&quot; lifestyle.  There are no penthouses or personal jets or other typical elements of modern movies.  This is about real people in extraordinary circumstances.  <BR>     For those who have lost a parent, this movie is about miracles and wish-fulfillment.  We cheer and cry that these two find each other over the years.  Watching the movie, I didn't like John, the son, much at the beginning, but I watched him soften and become more likeable as he gets to know the father who he lost as a child.<BR>     There are so many aspects of this movie that you just have to see it to catch them all.  In fact, you may have to watch it a few times to catch all the nuances and all the levels of the script.<BR>     I suppose you've guessed by now that I STRONGLY recommend this movie!!
014100018X|3.0|Chocolat was thoroughly enjoyable and a delight to read until the entire premise was undermined by Ms. Harris creating &quot;a need&quot; for the lifestyle of V's mother--fleeing capture for the crime of kidnapping. Until the kidnapping revelation, both V and her mother were individuals all should expire to emulate (ie, Individuals having the ability to enjoy life and to recreate life and its enjoyment for others.)  I wish I had fallen asleep reading and accidently skipped the page!!!
B00005MAM2|1.0|Myself and several of my friends love this film and were eagerly awaiting this collector version on DVD. As soon as the DVD began we knew something was wrong. They changed the English voices! When you have watched the original dubbed version many, many times you get to love those characters with those voices. Changing the voices is like destroying a work of art. Imagine if Disney redid Snow White and changed the voices? Imagine how stupid that would be. Well that's what you get here. A sad decision. I am selling my collector set and looking for the first DVD release with the original voices. Let me say, my friends and I were sadly disappointed. Bad job, bad disc.
B00005JKES|5.0|Well it's certainly better than anything on at the moment. I'll be buying it, and I hope  they go ahead and release the second series too.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I had to be forced to watch this movie in English.  After years of watching (hearing?) good anime nearly destroyed by bad dubbing, I voted for subtitles.  I'm glad I was outvoted!  I can't comment on the translation, but the ease with which the voices fit with the charaters, and the excellent phrasing really impressed me.  Later I found out that Neil Gaiman wrote the English script, and thought, &quot;no wonder!&quot;.  (confused?  read Neverwhere, or Stardust, or the Sandman series)<br />The animation and story of course are wonderful, and other reviewers have covered them in better detail than I could.  Just thought I should put in a word for the fine work put into the English version.
B000056TKD|5.0|If you've followed the fortunes of the Boston Symphony Orchestra only casually, then you'll probably be thinking that, over the last half-century, this orchestra has had only two music directors: Charles Munch, followed by Seiji Ozawa. (If you were to go back yet another quarter-century, you'd throw in the name of Serge Koussevitsky.) But there was a decade, from the early 60's to the early 70's, when the BSO was led first by Erich Leinsdorf, a fine opera conductor whose strengths did not translate particularly well to the concert stage, and then by William Steinberg, who led it all too briefly for a few years (1969 - 1972). Regrettably, Steinberg made only a handful of recordings with the BSO, and this was probably his finest.    For me, Steinberg will best be remembered for his traversal of the Brahms symphonies on Enoch Light's Command Classics label, and for this Boston recording of Gustav Holst's \\"The Planets.\\" Long a favorite piece of British music for me, I believe I've owned (or at least heard) all of the recorded performances by Sir Adrian Boult (long considered the \\"owner\\" of this work), as well as critically-acclaimed recordings by Bernard Hermann, Andre Previn, Sir Malcom Sargent and Leopold Stokowski. But this Steinberg performance immediately went to the top of my list when it first came out on LP thirty years ago. It has also been critically acclaimed by that all-too-British publication, the Penguin Guide, which seldom holds American recordings of British music in such high esteem, particularly when every British conductor of any merit whatsoever has recorded this work.    Now, with its reissuance as part of DGG's \\"The Originals\\" series, Steinberg's performance is back up there, on the top of my list, getting its fair amount of playing time. I don't believe that any other conductor has provided a \\"Mars\\" with anywhere near the visceral excitement that Steinberg supplies here, or the heroic \\"swagger\\" of the Elgarian \\"nobilmente\\" theme in \\"Jupiter.\\" In \\"Saturn\\" one can feel - if not hear - the organ underpinnings at the close of the movement, and again in the allegro section of \\"Uranus.\\" The ethereal mysticism of \\"Neptune,\\" with its wordless chorus, is gauged very well, with a satisfyinlgy realistic fadeout at the end. All-in-all, a true showpiece for the virtuosic work of the BSO soloists, sections and full ensemble, captured in vivid sound.    The Strauss companion piece, at first glance an odd partner for the Holst work, is not really a strange discmate at all. \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" - like \\"The Planets\\" - requires virtuosic solo, section and ensemble work. Joseph Silverstein, long the BSO concertmaster, is about as fine a violin soloist in this work as you're bound to hear. And, lest one forget (and how can one?), the Strauss work begins with the famous Introduction for brass, organ and timpani, so that in a sense it is the use of the organ that provides a point of continuity, so to speak. Unlike far too many recordings of \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra,\\" in which the organ is either \\"overplayed\\" for dramatic effect or is not appropriately in tune with the orchestra, the balance and intonation here are nigh-perfect.    Probably - no, make that definitely - the best archival record we'll have of the brief association of Steinberg and the Boston Symphony. At a time in the relatively recent past when it could easily be said that the BSO was one of \\"the big five.\\"    Bob Zeidler
B00005OM4N|2.0|My 10 year old loves Britney.  I bought her the new CD and was very disappointed with the lyrics.  They are too suggestive.  I would like to warn other parents that this CD crosses the line.  If you are buying this for a child, you might want to think twice.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Even though the critcs were against this movie it is still worth watching. I cannot imagine, that anybody will not like the opening scene in the cafe, where Travolta thinks about movies and makes up his own definition. It is good, simply. Apart from that, the story itself is going through like an usual Thriller. Maybe not terrifying enough, but still what you expect. If you see the movie for the first time you will nevertheless be impressed by the turns the story makes. Especially when it comes to the end. It is for sure not a movie with a chance for an oscar. But still it is a good genre movie and can also get the certificate &quot;popcorn worth&quot;. I have seen it now three or four times and still like it. I would buy it again.
B00005JKOV|5.0|This is a movie that MUST be seen.  Rarely does a movie come along that challenges you - the viewer, and assumes you have the mental capacity to enjoy it.  This is a rare find indeed (except for those of you that like jerry bruckheimer films), and I am truely complimented.  I was affected by this movie for days after seeing it, and upon further contemplation remain enthralled. I don't wish to give away the plot to those of you who have yet to see it, but if you enjoy good movies (and you know who you are), this is one that's NOT to be missed!!
B00004NHCC|5.0|Subtle Sarah<br />There's no one like the young Sarah Vaughan; on this album she has a beautifully smooth and supple voice (in addition to her famous \\"head tones\\").  She's not quite as operatic or showy  (the long tremolos, for example) here as on some of her work. Despite the relative understatement, however, her tonal changes and swoops are dramatic.<br />She's wonderful on \\"Lullaby of Birdland,\\" scatting as well as Ella, and she excels on \\"September Song,\\" almost defining the vocal ballad. The great Clifford Brown has a sweet extended trumpet solo,  rapid and soft at the same time.  While I'm not a fan of jazz flute, Herbie Mann adds dimension to the album (and is used sparingly), and he  stays away from pyrotechnics.  \\"He's My Guy\\" has almost an R and B sound, with an excellent sax solo, and memorable work by Brown and Jones.  But, ouch... there's a high-pitched flute solo that I could have done without.  \\"Guy\\" is one of the faster songs on this album of ballads.<br />There's an excellent selection of standards here, from \\"I'm Glad There is You,\\" to \\"April in Paris\\" and \\"Embraceable You,\\" with subtle comping by Paul Quinichette (ts), Jimmy Jones (p), and Joe Benjamin (b). \\"I'm Glad There is You\\" is tender and romantic, and Sarah provides some tremendous vocals, shifting tones in mid-stream and adding tremolos to good effect. Her sentimental \\"April in Paris\\" is perhaps the best version I've heard- she elevates its emotional power without saccharine effects.  \\"Embraceable You\\" is not quite as appealing; Brownie's trumpet would have increased the impact. While I can never get enough of Clifford Brown, there's enough here to satisfy, especially his full-ground, powerful, cuttingly smooth work on \\"Jim,\\" \\"He's My Guy,\\" and the aforementioned \\"September Song.\\"<br />A slow romantic album to be savored, this 1954 (not 1955) date is indispensable to fans of Ms. Vaughan. It's intimate, largely understated yet very effective, and is worth it just to hear Clifford Brown's accompaniment, let alone Ms. Vaughan.ccompaniment, let alone Ms. Vaughan.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem For A Dream, from the aclaimed director Darren Aronofsky,has created yet another film which makes us question our own lives, your friends lives, strangers lives, and life in general.  After i saw Pi, and i heard Aronofsky was making another film, i did a little looking around and found the DVD the Requiem for A dream.<BR>        The story revolves around 4 main characters who all want better lives, but they just make their lives worse in the process.  This is something which holds ur attention from start to finish.  Thihs movie is really a downer, and a real change up from your conventional drama story.  The feelings of the characters are almost felt by the viewer because of the incredible direction and sound, it just involves you.<BR>        Never before have I seen such a movie that plays with your thoughts and feelings so well.  They want better lives and it ends up worse than it started for them.  So you think if it would have been better if they didn't try in the first place, but then you think that they wouldnt have mentally grown as poeple if they never tried.  It's a movie that challenges your knowledge too, your knowledge on friends, and just the world overall.<BR>       Not to be mistaken for the next uplifting middle aged mothers drama, this one is different and doenst have much base for comparison.  Just see it.

B000050XEI|5.0|The song &quot;Only Time&quot; drew me to the world of Enya not to long ago.  I figured since I loved that song I'd try the whole CD.  And I was sure shocked as to how peaceful music could be!  Even though it is a little short, the quality of what is found on this CD is wonderful.  One of the songs &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; is completely in Latin, which me as a past latin student was a neat experience to hear the language put to music.  This is must have for anyone who enjoys peaceful, artistically done music.
0446604844|5.0|This was the first book I read from David Baldacci. I couldn't put it down! It's a great book full of suspense and unanticipated action! <br />It's rare that I feel the adrenaline rush while sitting on the couch and reading, but this time I couldn't wait to turn the page! If you like suspense books and are into reading, fraud and hackers you must pick this up! <br />I am definitely going to be a loyal David Baldacci reader...
B00003CXXI|5.0|So far the best movie of 2001.  It has great charm, wit and wall-to-wall laughs. Eddie Murphy's portrayl of the Donkey is classic. Mike Myers gives Shrek his usual fun, lighthearted and Scottish brand of talent. Animation is excellent and raises the bar.  A must have for all ages!
0789723107|5.0|Steve Krug practises what he preaches in this book. It's very accessible, with simple language, great graphics and clear instructions. It re-inforced my gut feeling about the sites I work with - they're not simple enough.     This is a great book for those facing their first 'web building' experience, and an essential tool to keep the rest of us in line!
B00000I14Z|5.0|70 minutes or so of classic mingus from the studio. Not a bad tune and great playing from this 1959 classic. Three bonus tracks no less. A slice of genius
B000002BBY|4.0|i hate oasis. i really do. of all the brit pop bands of the mid 90s oasis is the only one i cannot stand. except for this album. the quality of the songs on morning glory are almost unmatched by any band of the 90s. Don't Look Back in Anger and Wonderwall are probably the best/catchiest pop singles played on the radio since the beatles.

B00005QIPH|5.0|I like this.  This is a bit of a cliche, but I hear some velvet underground in this (the same is also true of most any halfway decent band to come out of the woodwork in the last 25 years).  Specifically this is similar the later Velvet stuff like Loaded and VU.  you might also find punk, Iggy Pop, and Pavement type sounds in this.  Last Night almost has a rockabilly beat to it.  Whether or not this sound is the result of happenstance or design I cant say.  Suffice it to say that the Strokes have a good punk rock/garage sound with a rythm that can be both hopping and wistful.
B00005OM4K|5.0|Maybe you're looking at this boxed set of CCR CDs, wondering if you should buy it or instead focus on the \\"greatest hits\\" CDs.  Or maybe you're thinking of purchasing all of the individual albums in the form of the remastered CDs that were released in 2000 (or if you're like me, you already did.)  I'll make the decision easy for you: buy this box.  You'll end up a lot happier in the long run.<br />Here's why:<BR>Creedence Clearwater Revival officially released 7 studio albums and 2 live albums.  Of those 9 albums, 8 are exceptional:  8 classic albums that rock, rattle and roll.  8 albums that have no filler.  8 albums that you'll enjoy listening to repeatedly if you're a rock and roll enthusiast.  (The ninth album, Mardi Gras, was the last CCR studio album and is neither up to the standards set by the other 8 albums nor is it the worst album ever released by a major band, as originally reviewed by Rolling Stone magazine; the worst I can say about it is that it's average.)<br />Don't bother with the \\"greatest hits\\" CDs.  There's too much good stuff left out.  For example: `Ramble Tamble' off of Cosmo's Factory and `Effigy' from Willy and the Poor Boys are only two of the classic CCR tracks that don't appear on the compilation CDs.  They're just as good as Proud Mary, Bad Moon Rising or any of the other hit singles (the first time I heard `Ramble Tamble,' I couldn't believe my ears.)  Even though CCR is considered a singles band, their albums are amazingly cohesive; listening to each album in its entirety and in the original order makes for a more pleasurable experience.<br />You could buy all of the remastered albums on CD, but that's a bad choice for a few reasons.  <BR>1. Live in Europe has yet to be released in remastered form on CD (as of November 2001) and the original CD sounds horrible.  You'll get a remastered version only in this boxed set.<BR>2. The rarities: All of disc 1 of this boxed set is devoted to tracks from The Golliwogs and Tommy Fogerty and The Blue Velvets.  While not all of these tracks are up to the quality of the later CCR stuff, most of it's great rock and roll.  Also you won't get parts 1 and 2 of 45 Revolutions Per Minute outside of this set.<BR>3. The price: Even though this boxed set is a bit pricey, you'll still save over buying the complete set of remastered CDs.<br />So what's so great about this set?  First, you're getting everything (and I do mean everything) in order on 6 CDs.  The Pre-Creedence stuff comes first, then all of the albums in their original order, and all of the tracks come just as they did on the original albums.  Everything's remastered and sounds terrific.  The two live sets are full of energy.  The booklet contains many great essays and many great pictures.  Honestly, even without the unreleased stuff, this set is exceptional.  Just having \\"everything Creedence\\" in one spot, sounding so crisp and full, is worth the price of admission.<br />Bottom line: If you don't have a complete CCR collection already, and can spare the money, BUY THIS SET.  You'll end up wanting it in the long run, so you might as well make things easy on yourself and just start here.
B00005QIPH|5.0|absolutely amazing- nothing like it- completely original, and an ingenious masterpeice- BUY IT NOW! you wont be disappointed.<BR>You cant really classify it as one type of music- but you can try-  Here we go- its like old skool punk (note the k), but not so raw, some chilled tracks which are tre catchy and fun to listen too! If you havnt got it already- buy it coz you wont regret it and i guarantee be one of your fav albums- of all time!<BR>GET IT OR ELSE YOU WILL DIE! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
6300249867|4.0|Okay, the story is preposterous and technologically dated, and some of the dialogue is melodramatic in a retro kind of way.  That said, BLACK WIDOW still makes good viewing because it remains true to itself and the premises it has set up, and Debra Winger and Theresa Russell do a smashing job on their characters.  It also has an interesting style, managing a noir atmosphere even while filming a considerable portion of the story in the bright sunshine of Hawaii and dressing the leads in the blues and red-oranges of '80s fashions.<br />Debra Winger plays a bright young unattached woman in a drab, stultifying life as a statistics accountant for the federal government.  She does not openly indulge in self pity, but when she identifies a wisp of a possible crime in the statistics she compiles, she sells all her possessions and quits her job to pursue the case on her own.  The case surrounds Theresa Russell's character who Winger believes marries older men and somehow precipitates their deaths to reap their inheritances, what is called a black widow.  This is all established with swift efficiency, as is the guilt of Russell's character.  The suspense lies in if and how Alex will corner her black widow, who is equally intelligent.  The two make a sensational pairing, circling around each other, getting closer and closer.<br />Leonard Maltin's movie guide says the film doesn't deliver the big pay-off.  That depends upon what kind of pay-off you are looking for.  I happen to think it did deliver.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Wow... just when I thought nothing more could be done with the sight-gag-laden genre-satire flick, 'Scary Movie' ended up being a pleasant surprise! Although I'm not terribly familiar with the subject matter being parodied (the 'Scream' flicks, 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', etc.), I did manage to bust a gut more than a few times. So, even if you're not all that caught up with those 90s-glamourous-&amp;-fashionable-twentysomethings-playing-glamorous-&amp;-fashionable-suburban-white-bread-teenagers-getting-stalked-and-killed-one-by-one horror flicks, I'm sure you'll be more than entertained! <br />Also included are a few shots at 'The Matrix', 'Blair Witch', 'The Sixth Sense', and those unbelievably annoying 'Wazzzaappp!' beer commercials. There's the usual visual gags that you've come to expect from the genre, as well as a surprisingly large amount of uncovered male naughty bits for the flick to get a mere R-rating! Um, which is cool if, er, you're into that kinda stuff, that is, ahem. Oh yeah, plenty of cannabis humor as well! Wait'll ya see the aquarium bong! But in my opinion, the best parts involved Doofy, the- um, 'special' brother of one of the unfortunate victims-to-be. His lack of prowess in the grey matter made for some real howlers here!<br />Oh, one more thing: don't forget to check out Doofy's, um, solo romance scene at the end of the closing credits!<br />'Late!

6305364648|3.0|True to his previous hits \\"Aliens\\", \\"Terminator 2\\", and the \\"Abyss\\", director James Cameron brings a lot of ambition to this action-oriented spy thriller. The scale and technological complexity of the action sequences are both exciting and awe-inspiring to watch. Unfortunately, the plot (involving Ahh-nuld as a top secret spy juggling his double life as a married man with an international terrorist arms smuggling case), is rife with cliche. From Jaime Lee Curtis' enthusiastic, but often embarrassing turn as a mousy-yet-frustrated housewife, to Tom Arnold's role as the out-of-shape, wise-cracking sidekick, no stereotype is left unexplored.<br />However shallow, the movie is tongue-in-cheek enough in both dialog and style to wipe the cynicism from all but the most stubbornly stiff of moviegoers. <br />Those viewers looking for an exciting popcorn film with lots of eye-candy could do much worse than \\"True Lies\\".

B00005QIPH|5.0|As is my way, I'll keep this short.  I purchased this album with trepidation.  I was very wary about all the hype I'd heard surrounding the band.  Sure, I really liked the 'Modern Age' EP, but I wasn't sure the Strokes could pull off a whole LP worth of killer material.  They do.<br />The songs are short, punchy, and on the whole, rather tense.  The guitars seem more interested in serving as rhythmic instruments rather than spewing out tired riffs.<br />Anyway, I'm keeping this short, so...  If you're an old Velvets or Stooges fan, give this set a try.  Sure, it may not be 'as good as they used to make it,' but it's pretty (...) close.
B00005KB9X|5.0|Im sitting under a palm tree, sipping cold drink from my glass, letting the cool waves of the Caribbean Sea touch the tips of my toes... hearing Bob Marley and the Wailers. I wonder if I should get up and dance along Lively Up Yourself... but Im too lazy for that. But when So Jah Seh comes, I start singing along...<BR>This music can make you feel good like every good music can. This was Marleys break-through album, and I can really understand why. Good music is universal and it lives forever. So does this.

B00004WKII|5.0|Now its proved that good music lives forever. This Box Set is not maybe the best way to start if you dont know anything about Jimi Hendrix. This one contains rare and alternative takes, but its best to listen to the original versions first.<BR>About the takes: I just fell in love with the alternative take of &quot;Burning Of the Midnight Lamp&quot; where Jimi plays harpsichord, and also with &quot;Title #3&quot;. It was also interesting to hear how &quot;Little Wing&quot; developed to be as beautiful as it is now. The takes are very interesting and the booklet is great too with rare photos of the Experience.<BR>Thirty years after his death they managed to put out something like this. Its a tribute to him. So wed never forget.
B00005RIKD|5.0|Sting comes back with this live recording made on September 11 (he respectfully dedicates it to the victims of the tragedy). This time around he revisits tunes from all his periods (The Police, early and late solo material) but with a very jazzy feel to most of the songs.<br />What can be said about this album, that has not been said about Sting at some point? It's brilliant: he grabs his songs and virtually reinvents them, to the point where they sound almost like different songs. This is the case with almost all songs in this recording which, like all previous Sting works, is impeccably recorded and produced.<br />Particularly enjoyable I found his beautiful rendition of the Police classics &quot;Don't stand so close to me&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot; as well as the tracks included from his least popular album, 'Mercury Falling' and the mix of &quot;A Thousand Years&quot; and &quot;PerfectLove... Gone Wrong,&quot; much in the same style of his earlier live double-album. Interesting results his Traffic-like version of his very own &quot;If you love somebody set them free&quot;... Grrrrooovy!!!! New tracks anyone? Yes! &quot;Dienda&quot; in the style of his interpretation of the Zappa song, &quot;The Idiot Bastard song&quot; which some lucky people were able to hear back during some sessions he played in Chicago several years ago.<br />Overall, one of those jewels that oughta become part of your musical collection.
B000002LOM|2.0|Without Johnny Marr to compose and perform the music, Morrissey suffers noticeably.  Here, &quot;Our Frank&quot; is a standout, one of Morrissey's best solo tracks (and with good, dramatic accompaniment), and &quot;Sing Your Life&quot; is likewise strong.<br />Beyond that, however, the album is a dreary wasteland, with only 2 other even bearable tracks (&quot;There's a Place ...&quot; and &quot;Driving Your Girlfriend Home&quot;).  Unlike some earlier reviewers, I don't feel that just because Morrissey sings it, it's automatically wonderful -- a good tune, varied instrumentation, and meaningful lyrics are also necessary (and too often lacking here).
B00005RFAI|3.0|Even though I am not a huge fan of Pink's previous album \\"Can't Take Me Home,\\" I decided to give her new album a try.  I was a little disappointed at what I heard.  \\"Missundaztood\\" is a typical sophomore album from a not so typical singer.  The album contains songs and lyrics as Pink tries to portray herself as a liberal with all types of problems.  The lyrics seem to come straight out a distressed teenage diary; unfortunately Pink does not fit the mold.  I remember Pink from her hip-hop days of her first album.  She should have at least had a few songs with hip-hop flavor.  It would have been awesome to hear her with Redman or Jay Z, but I guess I can hope for it on her next album.  The weakest link on the album is \\"My Vietnam.\\"  It exploits Vietnam as she tries to relate her struggles as a million dollar recording artist to the battle some people are still traumatized with.  Also as a faithful Jimi Hendrix fan, I was outraged she tried to sample his \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" rendition at the end of the song.<BR>However, the album does have some strong points.  The best dance track on the album is the TRL hit \\"Get the Party Started.\\"  It is an infectious track I could not stop playing.  It is almost a throwback to the eighties dance hits with a little bit of techno.  Unfortunately, it is the only good dance track.  \\"18 Wheeler\\" is a song Pink tries to empower herself on.  It has a catchy beat with fun vocals on top.  If one listens close enough it almost sounds like the leader of the female empowerment vocals, Alanis Morissette.  The best beat on the album is during the song \\"Just Like a Pill,\\" which also sounds a little like a Morissette song.<BR>All in all, I should have left this album in the store.  It is for hardcore Pink fans without much love for the hip-hop or TRL crowd.
B00005KHLV|5.0|Tony Leung is a journalist in Hong Kong, who rents a room with his wife in a family apartment. Next door, Maggie Cheung has done the same thing with her husband, who is almost always away on business.<br />As part of Kar-wai's game plan, neither the wife, nor the husband, is seen. They exist and are talked about, but never introduced.<br />Both Leung and Cheung's characters are painfully polite, which means you don't know what they're thinking. Even when it becomes obvious that their other halves are having an affair, it takes ages for either of them to respond. The idea of an emotional outburst would be unthinkable.<br />The film is so subtle and slow and internalized that it crystallizes into a thing of beauty. Longing has been choked by a thousand years of acceptable behavior. The cut of Cheung's dresses and the sheen of Leung's hair take on an unexpected importance in what appears to be Kar-wai's experiment into the purity of unconsummated passion.<br />By now this one is the most beautiful movie I had ever seen.<br />Every shot is like a poem. Each picture is a work of art.<br />I couldn't help myself from repeating the scenes again and again just to make sure i hadn't miss a thing.<br />A masterpiece.
B000059MEK|1.0|This album is terrible.  .. The sound of the last track fading away to silence is definitely one of the most comforting sounds in music released in the last ten years. Each and every song put such boredom and disgust into me so that I longed to hear the hated, annoying hits of N SYNC and others. Anyone who refers to themselves as a fan of techno, dance, electronica, or house should be greatly ashamed of Daft Punk, especially of their album &quot;Discovery&quot;, which utterly desecrates techno as I have come to know it.<br />The first I ever heard of Daft Punk was their big radio single &quot;One More Time&quot;. I knew from the first few seconds how horrible the song would be, but compared to the rest of the album, &quot;One More Time&quot; is stellar. The bass may thump on these tracks, and the two French DJ's might be able to spread vocoder synthesized vocal lines across the album with shocking unoriginality, but the constantly repetitive drum beats, vocal samples, cheesy blip and synthesizer lines, and horrible production make those lone two factors not matter a single bit.<br />Just about every track on the album is more than similar to the rest of the songs. I had trouble remembering the difference between any of the songs at a later recollection, probably due to the fact that the percussive parts are nothing more than a drum machine pounding out a single bass drum with bass that would only be impressive for a lame rap song bumping in the background, all covered by beeps and horrid synthesizer effects. In fact, most of the tracks don't even change throughout the entire song. &quot;High Life&quot; and &quot;Veridis Quo&quot; are the best examples, showcasing annoying computerized vocals and the exact same keyboard riff repeating itself across the entire track. Some electronic artists can get away with making a good song out of a single synthesizer line. After all, take a look at New Order's &quot;Confusion&quot; off the Blade Soundtrack (an awesome techno song,mind you). But some artists just shouldn't be making music at all, such as Daft Punk brightly shows us. The most horrid of instrumental defecation comes on track 12, titled &quot;Short Circuit&quot;, which contains a keyboard line that makes me long for the sound of a car alarm or nails being scraped down a chalkboard. Out of all the waste, &quot;Too Long&quot; made me cringe the most, being the closing track and clocking in at exactly ten minutes, I was literally begging for the song too end, as it tries to pull of a soul-like vibe but only comes off as poppy and pitiful like the rest of the album.<br />To be blunt, every track on this release is horrible. The best (and most listenable) portions only come in the form of PIECES of songs, such as the first half of &quot;Superheroes&quot;, the wah-laced guitar solo in &quot;Digital Love&quot;, and the elevator music sounding &quot;Nightvision&quot; which is the only full track that doesn't make me feel like I'm at some horrible club that I would never enter or watching warm-ups for a high school basketball game.<br />Though some people may think Daft Punk is great techno, they sound more like Eiffel 65 crossed with The Village People, then laced with the &quot;Macarena&quot; hit of years ago. After finishing listening to this, I had to put some Crystal Method in my CD player just to remind myself that good electronic music still existed. Avoid buying this at all costs. It will surely ruin your entire day and corrupt your view of music with its upbeat garbage and mindless clutter.
0446677450|4.0|I am a final year marketing student in City University of Hong Kong.  I found this book influenced me very much.  In the very begining, the author asks us not to focus on job if we want to earn money.  It asks us to focus on the skill of the job.  The concept &quot;study hard and get a good job will earn more money&quot; is not suitable in this century.  It just makes you to pay more bills later.  That is the &quot;rat race&quot;.  Actually, in the real life, my father and mother ask me to study hard for the purpose to get a good job when grow up so that I can earn lots of money.  I believe it is true and never doubt this concept.  This view is very common especially in Chinese society.  After I read this book, I really doubt whether the original concept is true or not.  This book does not ask people not to work hard and lazy.  It justs ask people to work for learn but not work for money.  The author asks people to work hard not for the job but for the skills.  He thinks that there are four skills that you should have if you want to earn a lot of money.  That is financial knowledge, investment strategies, market and law regulations.  If you can use those skills smoothly, you have the ability to earn lots of money.  He also uses lots of his personaly experience to illustsrate the concept.  He also lost money in his investment but he emphaize this experience brought him to success.  This is a book that I highly recommend to other youngster.  If you work for learn, you will have a better future.

What i like about her is that her dance music is different from others, mainstream but at the same time unique. i think ghv2 is ok just that it doesnt have other hits like the recent club play no 1 Impressive Instant. i dont mind if it doesnt contain news song cause its coming out soon next year. so if u r a fan u will have to buy GHV2 cause u will have to wait for erm........ another ten years b4 the other one comes out again

6305171769|4.0|Finally, a sequel I can fully enjoy.The classic Michael Myers is finally back.It's a big relief  from Halloween 6.Personally, I think the idea that Michael Myers was being ordered to kill by an ancient evil cult is very stupid.This movie has the same feeling as the first two.It is also not pure carnage wich makes it more interesting than sequels 4-6. The beginning where we hear Dr.lommis' voice speaking the lecture from the first film is excellent. The one flaw that I think was so so so so important was we barely ever hear the original theme song wich is very suprising and depriving.It should also have been a tad longer too.However,  this detered me little. The fact it brought back <BR>Lauri Strode is great. The scenes where they brought us back to the first film like the closet scene in the beginng were also great.I also liked the fact that Curtis has a naive son who does not fully understand Michael's horror or invincibilty, it is great. Now the next generation can experiance Michael's terror.  The ending is ingenious, but if you haven't seen the film I won't spoil it for you. It definitely lives up to the original in thrills,chills, and sheer delight. This is a miraculous sequel and it really lives up to the original Halloween legacy.I would reccommend it to all fans.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I had only two problems with the movie---<br />(1) Why didn't they just make the kid 13 (his real age) or at least 12-- it was very difficult to believe he was just 11 as the story puts it-- at least not here in the U.S.  ??<br />(2) In real life, Northeastern England, mid-1980s... could people not even say &quot;Pass the butter&quot; without saying, &quot;Pass the<BR>----ing butter!&quot;  ??  I fully accept that kids use 4-letter words until they wear them out or get bored with them, but wasn't this just a tad overdone in &quot;Billy&quot;-- especially for the adults???<br />I think what struck me most was the *reminders* of elements in other movies-- for example:<br />*Kid yells at parent to stop beating sibling. (&quot;A Home of Our Own&quot;)<BR>*One last lingering look at the old homeplace. (&quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;)<BR>*Father finally accepting his son being different. (&quot;October Sky&quot;)<BR>*The eternal struggle of labor against big business. (&quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;)<BR>*One boy accepting the *affections* of another, even<BR>  though he really doesn't understand them. (&quot;This Boy's Life&quot;)<BR>*Boy being sent out into the world (by his ballet teacher) to<BR>learn about life. (&quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot;)<br />If you have watched &quot;Billy&quot;, I am sure you can think of other examples.<br />I LOVED the accents, but had to watch the movie a second time with captions for the deaf enabled-- to know what the heck they were saying in many spots.<br />I wish I knew what kind of success this movie had here in Texas-- my guess is that our pistol-packin',  football hero dads would say, &quot;Well, okay for him I guess-- just don't let it ever happen to MY boy!&quot;<br />Interesting that they auditioned 2,000 kids (and almost gave up) before they found a kid who could act AND dance.  Jamie Bell was fantastic as Billy.<br />Many very touching moments in the film-- the boy trying to clean the spray paint from his mom's grave marker;the grandmother being left behind;  the father willing to be a *scab* to earn money for his son's trip;  the miners having to go back to a job at the same or even less salary (been there, done that, bought the t-shirt-- it is a lousy feeling!)  Those are just a few examples.<br />The extra DVD material was very interesting and helpful! This one richly deserved all the praise it received-- <br />Gene in Amarillo
6304233639|1.0|If Fort Knox held ideas instead of gold, then we safely assume the the makers of ID4 stripped the place bare.  But I guess if you steal enough ideas, you can make it look original.  Here are a few of the ideas I wish to point out:<br />1.  Large city-sized spaceships floating over the world's major cities.  Sounds like something that either came out of the 1980s television series V or the classic science fiction novel Childhood's End by Arthur C. Clarke.<br />2.  The insectile shape of the alien beings themselves are taken from the ALIEN movies.<br />3.  The fact that the mother ships are impervious to even nuclear weapons was stolen from the great 1950s version of War of the Worlds.<br />4.  The fighter pilots are little more than caricatures from Top Gun, a horrible and derivative film in and of itself.<br />5.  The Area 51 scene was done much better in a lousy film called Hangar 18.<br />But if stealing ideas was not enough, the producers had to go even further by insulting the intellect of anyone over 5 years old.  Ask yourself these two questions:<br />1.  How could a fighter pilot, no matter how well trained, instantly learn to fly an alien fighter craft?<br />2.  How could a human designed computer system transfer a virus into the alien central computer?  You don't have to answer since Apple was quick to commercialize here?<br />I shouldn't bad mouth this movie so much.  Blockbusters like this - and Armageddon - are made for one purpose alone: to make money.  If is derivative, empty of all meaningful content except for computer generated eye candy, and manipulative; then so be it.

B00005OWEG|5.0|Now that the film is more complete, it is probably less perfect, which may be why I like it better. <br />The completed version, the original of which provided the symbols for my nightmares (I was draft age during Vietnam), is less univocal in its grim assessment of life as a war with self.  The notable additions are the comical and sexy material that was deleted. Some of the additions, notably the love scene, are monumentally bad ideas (i.e., the wheezy music and cheesy sentiments). At times Sheen, who seems made of angst in the original, shows a face that is out of character, as if he were suddenly grinning at the camera, Tom Jones style. <br />Coppola's additions have brought life to this film, which makes it seem shorter though he added almost an hour to an already long movie.<br />I watched it last night and will watch it again.
B00001OH7U|5.0|When the ever-changing persona of David Bowie morphed into the sly, disco-ish blue-eyed soul singer heard 1975's Young Americans, many thought that the androgynous rock star had dumped the sinister ambiguity and self-destructive bedlam that laced albums such as 1973's the Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and 1974's Diamond Dogs, but such was not the case. By late 1975, Bowie was already examining the mechanics of that sleek, stylish music in order to configure a way to show his own vindictiveness and despair with its chemistry. He found his method during the coked-up, late night recording sessions that sprouted his 1976 masterpiece, Station to Station.<br />Bowie's scheme is similar to that which fellow musical alchemists, Pink Floyd, employed on their outstanding release, Wish You Were Here, a year earlier. The silky, electronically enhanced tracks initially seem expressive and gracious, yet the theme of absence plays such a large role that a motorized feeling of sadness and isolation strongly permeates. On Station to Station, Bowie, in his most soulful voice, sings of golden years that have not yet arrived (\\"Golden Years\\"), romantic proposals that receive no response (\\"Word on a Wing\\") and an impassionate relationship full of intellectualizing and hesitation (\\"Stay\\").<br />On the magnificent, sprawling, mechanical title track, the absence of compassion and humanity defines the Thin White Duke, a persona accumulated through Bowie's flirtation with fascism (On the Young Americans tour, Bowie gave an adoring crowd a fascist salute and was caught with totalitarian literature on the Germany border). The Duke is a bitter, affection-starved, fascist misfit who leads his \\"European cannon,\\" sulkily \\"throwing darts in lover's eyes.\\" \\"It's too late/to be grateful/It's too late/to be late again/It's too late/to be hateful/The European cannon is here,\\" Bowie sings of his emotion-squashing protagonists.  It is an excellent way to begin the calculated, withdrawn feel of an excellent, unique album.<br />Station to Station was born of an unusual mix of influences and inspirations: soul music, cocaine, personal strife, fascism and sleek, computerized recording techniques. It is one of the oddest, most complex formulas of any rock album and THE oddest and most complex to work so well. The album's aura of mind alterations, personal trouble and lack of compassion blend together into an aroma of chronic numbness while sleek, almost danceable music keeps the work infectious and assessable. His fresh, complex and brilliant approach delves into isolation and inhumanity like no other in his career.
B000059S9M|5.0|This is a totally unbeatable album and if people dont like this then they have something wrong with them! Anyway this is the review for all the songs.<br />Standing on the edge - I liked this song more at first but now i realise why some people say this is weak. Still OK though! 7/10<br />Buck Rogers - I've loved this song from the day it came out and never got tired of it! Great chorus 10/10<br />Piece by Piece - Nice mellow song and cant think of much else to say! 8/10<br />Seven days for the sun - 2nd release from the album and i love it. Very fast and loud lyrics from Grant which is great after a song like Piece by Piece. 9/10<br />We Cant Rewind - Great song. A bit in between Mellow and hard. Its nice and good chorus 9/10<br />Turn - 3rd Release from album and its grown on me so much. At first i did'nt much like it but now its one of my favorite tracks! If you notice they always play it on eastenders in the background! 9.5/10<br />Choke - Not one of the best tracks but as you listen to it more it gets better. Some good lyrics though. 7.5/10<br />Oxygen - A favorite song by many listeners such as my mates. Its great for a mellow 1.  9/10<br />Tell all ya friends - This is one of my favorites and when i first heard this i totally enjoyed it! A great fast song which is the shortest track on the album. 9.5/10<br />Under the Weather - A bit of a depressing loud song really but very interesting. Nice chorus.  9.5/10<br />Satellite News - Fantastic song. It takes a while to get into the chorus but it is 5 minutes long! This would have to be my favorite along with Buck Rogers i think. Easy listening song.<br />Bug - I didnt much like this at first but then I got into it quite a lot. My Dad does'nt like it but who cares! Not one of my faves though. 7.5/10
B00001OH7V|3.0|In the late seventies, David Bowie changed modes from feisty glam rock to synth-powered artrock, starting with two boldly pioneering masterpieces, 1976's crafty Station to Station and 1977's crestfallen Low. The next installment of this phase in the rock star's career, \\"Heroes,\\" also released in 1977, does not fully maintain the excellence of its predecessors.<br />The disc suffers from two main flaws. First of all, the songwriter is weak. Songs such as \\"Sons of the Silent Age\\" and \\"Joe the Lion\\" suffer from jumbled wordplay and lyrical blah (\\"Joe the lion/Went to the bar/A couple of drinks on the house and he was/A fortune teller he said/\\"`Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are'\\"). Secondly, \\"Heroes\\" features an uninspired repetition of Low's formula in its predominantly instrumental second half. Low's somber air gave its side of murky instrumentals direction. With the exception of the gorgeous \\"Moss Garden,\\" the instrumentals of the less focused \\"Heroes,\\" attempt to grasp the distraught aroma of those from Low but merely flutter in a null succession of icy notes and soulless computerized gloss. \\"V-2 Schneider,\\" \\"Sense of Doubt\\" and \\"Neukoln\\" are unremarkable at best and irritating at worst.<br />Even with its flaws, \\"Heroes\\" does provide a handful of excellent tracks including the funky opener, \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" the visceral finale, \\"The Secret Life of Arabia,\\" the frantic \\"Blackout\\" and the epic title track, featuring Robert Fripp of King Crimson's breathtaking, windy guitar work. Another good point about \\"Heroes\\" is its well-produced, finely tuned sound. Bowie and coproducer, Tony Visconti, obviously revised the tracks several times, making sure every instrumentation sounded completely three-dimensional. They chose excellent cohorts in Fripp and keyboard/synthesizer player, Brian Eno, two artists renowned for their experimentation with musical texture. Still, no party provides the soul the album is sadly missing. Despite featuring a few notable tracks and being a practical bible of how to record music in an age of expanding technology, \\"Heroes\\" fall short of the expectations set by its predecessors. It is respectable, but I would recommend investing in Station to Station and Low first, and then perhaps \\"Heroes.\\"
0446608955|4.0|At first glance you think this a is story about teenage love. But as you read on, you come to see that Landon and Jamie are no ordinary teenagers. <br />Upon first impression, Jamie seems to be a bit of a recluse and anti-social. But Nicholas Sparks has a way of revealing what's beneath the surface of this young woman's character, a theme that has become his trademark in all his novels. In this book, one comes to see that Jamie is wise beyond her years, her strong faith withstanding. Landon is conflicted with teen peer pressure as his feelings for Jamie become increasingly endearing with each passing day. <br />&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; could also be entitled &quot;A Gift to Remember&quot;. As you read on through the ending, you will see why. <br />Have tissues in hand while reading this book.
B00001OH7O|3.0|The biggest surprise about David Bowie's 1971 release, Hunky Dory, is that it is an upper. After the distraught, quasi-psychedelic folkrock of 1969's Man of Words, Man of Music and the macabre, blistering grind of 1970's The Man Who Sold the World, Bowie engineered a funky poprock, full of dreamy piano-playing and juicy basslines, for Hunky Dory. Sometimes the style is a nice fit. The Elton John-ish jangle of the hit single, \\"Changes\\" and the rollicking nightlife drama of \\"Queen Bitch\\" make for two of Bowie's best songs. But the buoyancy of Hunky Dory's sound sometimes causes it to suffer from weightlessness, especially on its first side. \\"Oh! You Pretty Things,\\" \\"Kooks,\\" \\"Life on Mars?\\" \\"Fill Your Heart,\\" and \\"Eight Line Poem\\" are often sappy, overdramatic, unmemorable and generally feature Bowie sounding too sweet. To prevent his androgynous personas from becoming wimpy or flaky, Bowie usually constructs them with an ugly streak (Such as the self-destructive urges of Ziggy Stardust from 1972's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust or the fascist malevolence of the Thin White Duke from 1976's Station to Station). This added dusk is not present on Hunky Dory until its very last tracks when Bowie mocks a legendary pop artist with \\"Andy Warhol,\\" pays tribute one of his gruffer idols on \\"Song for Bob Dylan,\\" summons sharp, Lou Reed-inspired power with \\"Queen Bitch\\" and becomes quite eerie with the folky, squelching of \\"The Bewley Brothers.\\" But it is too late to completely save the first Bowie album to target the poprock pleasure center of its listeners.
0896600580|5.0|To say that you can spend hours browsing through this wonderful collection is an understatement.  This is a book that can be savored over a lifetime.<br />It shows the progression of Rockwell's art from his early, almost Victorian style covers, to his most famous illustrations, to his political portraits.  It always annoys me that people claim he is an illustrator, not an artist.  Simply because these pictures tell a story should not detract from their artistic merit.<br />This volume has them all.  From the beautiful, awkward, girl at the Mirror, Doctor's appointment and countless others that are not as well known, but still great!  So many of these paintings allow us to learn more about America (Can you get much more American than Norman Rockwell?).  His GI- Willie Gillis is truly everyman during WWII.  We seem enjoying a hometown newspaper, on leave, with his comrades, and finally as a student on the GI Bill.  So many ideas are timeless.  The chronicle of a day in the life of a boy or girl seem to embody childhood.  Commuters on a platform captures the rise of suburbia.  THe one of a son sitting with his father and dog about to leave for college captures that bittersweet moment on the cusp of adolescence.<br />The sunlit, yet dusty, Marriage Liscense is generally recognized as art, but others should be too.  I hope that with the recent Rockwell exhibets a new generation of Americans will appreciate this wodnerful artist who captured so much of our lives!<br />This is a great addition to any collection- you will never tire of looking through it!
B00001QGPS|4.0|i dont like east coast rap that much.  only for 1 reason tha beats.  this album would have been among the top 10 of all time if the beats were tighter.  methodman is one of the tightest lyricist out there.  redman is one of the funniest and creative.  they're a perfect combo.  but unffortianately this album was like a combo meal,  but without the drink. meth bein the burger, red bein tha fries, and the beats bein the drink. get this if u like east coast rap.  if u from the west coast it will grow on u.
0553573403|5.0|This series really reminded me of why I started to read fantasy novels in the first place. Wonderful, realistic characters with motivations the reader can sympathize with, were a pleasant break from the childish caractures I found in books by Goodkind and Jordan. Also unlike Goodkind and Jordan, these books have maintained their pace, excellent writing style, and absorption level throughout the series. Jordan and Goodkind are enjoyable writers, but Martin is a master.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|ok, they left out some major songs and they put in some pretty bad ones, but give me a break, they still kept some of their greatest. i could have used strawberry fields forever, anything of sgt pappers and white album especially, they should have left out the ballad of john and joko, that song is terrible. this is still a great buy. you get all of their early songs and then the cd changes at about the same time the beatles changed, at about elenor rigby, which is my favorite song by the beatles personally, so yes, this is a good buy, especially for early beatles fans
B00005A1PR|5.0|This was my theme album when I moved to a new state. This sister really speaks to me. Its helps to know that their are other oddly coifed, dread head hippie sisters out their that are conscious of the universe and thinks about love and committment and are just plain happy to be alive. Its wonderful. You need this cd. Did I mention that she can really sing? <BR>Smiling.<BR>Sunbeam_dj
B000020617|5.0|If you are new to the world of the Foo Fighters and were raised in the 1970's, you will love this album.  This is old fashioned rock with drums, bass and guitar.  Dave doesn't need to waste his time - our yours -  with leads or for that matter harmony vocals.  Sonically, it is a giant with the bass drum and the bass dominating the rhythm.  The guitars are subtle, distorted and contain just enough reverb/delay to cut through the mix.  The vocals and melodies are with few exceptions excellent and reminiscient of the Beatles and Eagles with a good dose of punk to keep an edge.  If you think all the \\"new\\" music is rap and (...), buy this and you'll change your mind.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|A[...] Lenny, baby, I just love you. I miss his locs. Anyway. The album really is a greatest hits. Its really good for a long road trip when you need some gritty raunchy guitar to reverberate though you torso and give you the energy you need to keep on to your destination. Its really good stuff. Add it to your wishlist or buy it now.
B00005OM4K|5.0|This boxed set contains absolutely EVERYTHING that Fogerty and Co. put out on record, including some amazing early stuff when they were still slugging it out on the small time circuit as the Blue Velvets and the (gasp) Golliwogs. The early recordings have that naive derivative quality possessed by every great garage band. The thing that makes Creedence different is that they were able to rise above and beyond their Beatles/Kinks/Them homages, going on to forge a completely unique style of music. This is music that is timeless and essential to anyone who wants to understand what real honest no-frills rock and roll is supposed to be about.  And, um, Mr. Fogerty?  How about a new album sometime this century?  (update:  Thanks for Deja Vu All Over Again!)
B0000549B0|5.0|This fine film is a great addition to the world of DVD, and it IS IN BLACK AND WHITE, NOT COLOR, as Amazon has it listed. I just received my copy from Amazon yesterday and to my surprise and relief it was in B&amp;W original format. The 5 minute commentary by Jimmy Stewart in 1990 with video montage is a nice addition as well. The picture quality on the DVD is good, and of course, the movie is wonderful. I won't go on about the story line, as many other good reviews have already documented that aspect, but I would like to state that Harvey is definitely 6 foot 3 1/2 inches, as I just finished the movie less than 24 hours ago (&quot;lets' just stick to the facts, now&quot; !), although Stewart indicates that he felt he must have been 6'8&quot; since he had to look up to him. Jimmy Stewart's subtle, thoughtful performance gives a surreal quality to a film that feels mostly like a well done stage play, but has an edge to it that is hard to describe and should be experienced by any movie lover or person interested in thinking about life, familiy, and one's view of reality. A must for the DVD collection.
0393316041|5.0|I was a bit put off at first at this book's bare-bones, almost anti-literary prose style (not realizing it was transcribed from informal speech), but after a while I began to admire its artlessness. It's really like nothing else I've read before-- refreshingly so--, and I strongly recommend it. Had it been published a century before I would have guessed it the inspiration for Mark Twain's A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT, for Richard Feynman is ingenuously Mark Twain's Yankee.<br />Read also Richard Feynman's THE CHARACTER OF PHYSICAL LAW, Mark Twain's A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT, and (while I'm at it) Paul Creston's PRINCIPLES OF RHYTHM.
B000058T5E|3.0|ok heres my review..this is not one of those cds that i put in and instantly loved..with that said ,it is still a good cd.after several times of listening to it ,it is getting better.nadia really catches my ear.mr. beck is an awesome guitarist,so therefore he must contantly push the envelope and so he has with this cd..loose cannon is another great song!alot of this music is unsettling, that was one of the reasons for my lower rating..some of it was close to nerve racking..but in saying that i believe in fact that might have been the goal they were reaching for.i must applaude mr.beck for his use of modern tecnology cause he is keeping up with the times and not in a comercial (sold out)way..i dont think he will ever give us what we want and expect from him i think he will always surprise us and demand that we appreciate him for the great guitarist he is!the cd closes with suspension,another hauntingly beautiful song.<br />so i would recommend buying it,but dont expect to love it right away.
B00005R2M3|1.0|If you like Shakira's spanish albums (a lot) be prepared for a big change.  I love her spanish work so I bought this with out even listening to it.  Mistake... and I can't return it because I opened it.  I suggest listening to it before you buy it.
B000002KYR|5.0|Guitarists, I know you probably already own this as well as their Tres Hombres and Deguello albums, but just in case you forgot, this disc COOKS.  Billy Gibbons' tone sounds like a '69 Mustang and if these hooks and riffs don't get your toes-a-tappin, nothing will.  Check out &quot;I Got the Six&quot; and &quot;Got Me Under Pressure&quot; especially.  Pounding, classic, ageless rock.
B00000JPHF|4.0|This is a great movie, but if you are looking for the best screen adaptation, this is not the movie for you.  This was created in the 1930s and was geared more for the horror aspect.  The film even begins with a word from the producers warning people that what they may see will frighten them.  Our levels of tolerance have changed quite a bit since then.<br />Some of the differences seem cosmetic like Dr. Frankenstein's name in the movie is Henry rather than Viktor as in the book (but, Universal Studios does keep this consistent throughout its movies).  Oddly enough, Dr. Frankenstein's friend is named Victor here, but Henry in the book.<br />The dementia of Dr. Frankenstein is debatable in the book, but you can't doubt, with Colin Clive's performance, that the doctor is mad.  When he is \\"convinced\\" to kill the Monster, you get the feeling that he really can't go through with it.<br />The Monster's rampage does not seem as malevolent as you would suspect.  In the movie, there is no hint of a wish kill for revenge's sake.  Here, the monster either kills accidentally, or kills for self-preservation.  The Monster does go to Frankenstein's wedding, but does not kill anyone.  The film will end shortly after.  From reading the book, you will know that there is a lot not covered.<br />Boris Karloff's performance is well worth the time (a little over an hour actually) to watch this movie.  Only he can convincingly show you the re-animated corpse come to life.<br />Just to see the movie that took the Frankenstein mythos to greater heights, get this movie.  It is an enjoyable film.  Although not the first movie adapted from the book, it is the best known.  If you want to see a film adaptation of the book, I would recommend Kenneth Brannagh's movie.
0446608955|5.0|This is a very good book. A Lot of books I read are very dissapointing, but this one won't let you down. I thought it was a very sad book and I am still puzzled over the ending. If you are even considering it you should go ahead and buy it.
B00005QDW5|5.0|On studying the tracklisting of this CD just before buying it, I was struck with the notion of how well represented was 30-plus years of Floyd on this double-cd compilation.  In my opinion the only other compilations that come close in terms of great music and extremely fair representation of the band's outputs are Zeppelin's 'Remasters' and Marillion's 'Best of both worlds'.  But back to Pink Floyd and this compilation.  After listening to it continuously since buying it I'd have to say that this album should please both new and old fans alike.  For the new fans who just want to have some of the best Floyd moments in their collection but can't afford all Floyd's albums then this compilation is a fantastic choice.  However, for older fans like me this compilation is a great sampler of Floyd's music. Some might argue that older Floyd fans will already have all this material and I fully agree with them.  If I can talk for myself though, unless one counts 'Dark Side...' 'The Wall' 'The Final Cut' and occasionally 'Pulse' most of the other Floyd albums in my collection have been gathering dust.  This compilation immediately whetted my appetite to dust them off because quite frankly it is incomplete.  I agree with those other reviewers who complained about how 'Atom Heard Mother' was ignored.  But there are so many other Floyd gems left out.  Some of my personal favourites such as 'Fearless', 'Have a cigar', 'Run like Hell', 'Mother' and 'On the turning away' have been left out and why is the underrated but still-great 'The final cut' so under-represented?  It's great to have 'When the tigers broke free' on this compilation but why couldn't there have been a couple more rarities such as the full version of 'Pigs on the wing' as it appeared on guitarist Snowy White's excellent 'Goldtop' compilation?  But all in all, all these complaints are just minimal and this compilation should serve as a timely reminder of why this band are loved by so many around the world.  Excellent album all around then...shame about the omissions but anyway this cd made me rediscover all the old albums.  Gotta hear 'Atom Heart mother' once again to see why it was omitted...

B00004T37H|5.0|this is the best anime movie there is out there you have to get it watch it over and over
B00005OM4Q|5.0|From beginning to end, I really loved this movie.  Its cast alone is enough to please even the harshest of Cameron Crowe's critics. Patrick Fugit plays a naive but completely understandable precocious aspiring teen writer.Billy Crudup plays the brooding and unexpectedly accessable lead guitarist of the vaguely &quot;Allman Brothers/Led Zepplinesque band, Stillwater.  Jason Lee, who in my eyes truly cannot do any wrong, plays a hilarious foil to Crudup's character, trying so hard not to fall into his guitarist's shadow that every effort he makes not to pushes him more out of the limelight.  His performance is truly groundbreaking and I don't mind saying that he's got even the rest of this awesome cast beat!  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the overly knowledgeable editor to one of the magazines Fugit's character is writing for and gives sage advice to him while still being a vulnerable little nerd who knows way too much about music, while kind of hating musicians at the same time.  As with most of his portrayals, he has a way of stealing his scenes very subtly.  Kate Hudson does an adequate job of pulling Fugit's character &quot;into&quot; what he's supposed to observe from the &quot;outside.&quot;  I prefer the more suble performances of Anna Paquin (an Oscar winner, you will remember) and Fairuza Balk.  They play just as convincingly the &quot;fan&quot; roles, or truly, the groupies.  My only real regret about this movie is that they don't use Anna Paquin more.  She has been so good in so many things lately (e.g.--HurlyBurly, and she was even excellent in the X-men movie, however little it allowed her to show off her acting chops).  Anyhow, with an outstanding cast and very good story writing, this movie really pulls it off.  I was so disappointed that it didn't walk away with the best picture Oscar.  So often, a movie with a &quot;less serious tone&quot; such as this cannot win that coveted honor.  Well, in my opinion, this one is right up there!
B00005QG9J|1.0|After seeing them live about a month before this cd came out I was pumped up and ready to hear it. Expecting S.C.I.E.N.C.E 2 I got &quot;Brandon sings the blues&quot; instead, it makes me sick that the band iv'e followed for over 5 years have sold out to a bunch of teenage girls who will have forgotten them when the backstreet boys bring out their next single. Hope this CD made you rich fellas because the fans of your early cd's will be more wary when they buy your next one!

B00003CY5I|4.0|This is an interesting entry in the heist movie genre.  Very few explosions or gunshots intrude on the plot.  The characters aren't exaggerated, but are made of real flesh and bone.  They don't have mannered quirks, and their shadowy pasts aren't rolled out in excruciating detail.  Rather, we get subtly drawn character studies, where the past is alluded to out of necessity, not as a crutch.  And the heist itself, the planning of which encompasses almost the film's entirety, is complex and logical, while still providing multiple opportunities for true suspense.<br />The cast is staggering.  How often do you get a chance to see the best actors from three separate generations together at one time?  And they all do fine jobs.  Relish this rare opportunity.<br />The knock on DeNiro here, and frankly I think people are reaching when trying to find a flaw in any of his performances, is that he &quot;sleepwalks&quot; through the movie.  True, his Nick is not a flashy man.  Even though he owns a hip jazz club and is a noted thief on the side -- two supposedly glamourous occupations -- he is very low key.  But that's a necessary character trait.  He's learned that to be thoughtful and deliberate is the best way to ensure that his risky moonlighting job is not so risky.  Watch him in one of his first scenes with Edward Norton's character: Norton's Jack, a young upstart thief, lays out his risky plan in all its intricate detail.  Nick just stares off to the side, never making eye contact, but carefully considering what he's hearing without any distractions.  You can see DeNiro in deep thought here.  Pay attention to that, and I guarantee you'll find his character fascinating.<br />Norton is DeNiro's equal in every way.  His Jack is a know-it-all punk, a character we've seen time and time again.  But Norton somehow manages to make him a unique creation.  Jack's got a fiery intensity, and he's whip smart too.  But he knows that he has a lot to learn, and is quite willing.  And he's not a perfect thief-machine; he knows that things can go wrong with the plan, and even though he's ready to improvise, you can see his nerves jump when they do.  Witness one scene where he's serving as a lookout for Nick, and all of the sudden a policeman emerges from inside a nearby store.  Jack jumps into gear, quickly trying to divert the policeman's attention, but breathing and sweating heavily the whole time.  The showiest part of Norton's performance is his role-within-a-role work as Brian, a retarded janitor.  Brian serves as a cover so Jack can discretely study his target, the Montreal Customs House.  Jack as Brian provides some of the film's funnier moments, as the audience knows that his stray comments are really subtle digs at his oblivious co-workers' ignorance and incompetence.<br />Marlon Brando is lively, even though he's long from being lithe.  It's uncomfortable watching this gargantuan man walk into a room (remembering the thundering physicality of his &quot;Streetcar Named Desire&quot;/&quot;On the Waterfront&quot; years).  But once he's settled into a chair, and free to use his voice and his hands, you remember why he's generally considered the greatest actor of his (or any other) generation.  Compared to Nick's conservative character, Brando's Max is an entertaining and eccentric creation.  He's quick with a quip, and more than willing to tell those around him exactly what they want to hear in order to get his way.  You can't get away from the fact that he's fascinating to watch.  Too bad his role wasn't bigger; the film could've used more of his energy.<br />Angela Bassett barely even registers.  Well, to be truthful, she does fine with what's she's given.  But I can't remember a more superfluous character in a suspense thriller.  She has no function, either for exposition or motivation.  Some would say that her character offers drama, in that her ultimatum to Nick gives him opportunity to re-consider doing this last job.  But he was alreadyre-considering his decision.  So she's really just reminding him that he's re-considering!  How redundant.  It seems that the filmmaker's were just throwing a bone at convention, assuming that every movie needs a romantic interest.  If her character were cut completely, the story would not change one iota.<br />It was great to see a Canadian city (granted not a Canadian city that I'm overly familiar with) get such significant face time.  Montreal worked wonderfully as the setting for the heist, it's old world charm providing interesting visuals; it's labyrinthine streets providing further opportunities for something to go wrong.  Although, hearing DeNiro and Brando stumble through their French dialogue did provide some moments of unintended comedy.<br />&quot;The Score&quot; is not the greatest heist movie ever made.  In fact, its story is quite run-of-the-mill.  What makes it a quality movie is its patience with the plot (credit to director Frank Oz; who knew this ex-Muppetteer had such a class touch?), and it's legendary class that delivers a series of absorbing performances.
0553573403|5.0|First of all, I can't believe the number of poor reviews this book, or the series for that matter, has received.  I recently finished the third book in the series, &quot;Storm of Swords&quot;, and can't wait for the next installment.<br />That said, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; re-introduced me to the fantasy genre.  The writing style is superb, if a little non-linear.  You really have to pay attention to what's going on since each chapter is written from a different character's perspective, as well as at somewhat different points in the timeline.  But, I find that as part of the draw of the books for me.  Also, don't get too attached to any one character, they tend do die with swift brutality and without warning (for the most part).<br />This, the first installment of the Song of Ice and Fire, reads as almost purely midevil, yet it foreshadows the wild magics to come.<br />Comparisons to Tolkien?  I think not.  But I think this series has the potential for greatness in its own right.  At three installments (some reviewers have stated there will be six?) it's been a great ride so far; but, the proof will be in the reading, que no?
0684833395|5.0|The book Catch 22 by Joeshph Heller is a book about a piolt in WWII.  The main charecter is named Yossaian.  This piolt is very paranoid about alot of things.  Also through out the book he trys to get out of flying missions by doing various things. A couple of things he does is fake being sick.  Also he fakes being mentally insane. <BR>  This book is different from any other book i've read. There is a unique yet talented style of writting i've never encountered before.  In the midst of all the chaos of war the author still seems to throw in alot of humor.  It is also a different sense of humor based on simple concepts.  When I first started reading it, I was thinking too hard to understand the humor, I thought there was a deeper meaning to alot of it.  After confusing myself a bit I learend that I just have to take it for what it is and judge it at face value.  At the end the humor is more one big joke than many little ones.  My advice to the reader is to just read and accept, then later it will make sense.  An example of this humor would be on page 33, &quot;I did it to protect my good reputation in case anyone ever caught me walking around with crab apples in my cheeks.  With rubber balls in my hands I could deny there were crab apples in my cheeks.  Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands not my cheeks.&quot;  That is a perfect example of humor you shouldn't try to figure out.  There is nothing to figure out.  That part is just telling you about the personality of the charecter Orr.<BR>   Overall it was a very good book. The only possible drawback is that the begining is slow moving.  You might get frustrated with the book, but just keep reading, it gets better.  The possitive of this book far out weighs the negative.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Simply the best movie I've seen all year! The ending was astonishing, it's really on a par with the best of Alfred Hitchcock movies. Like Hitchcock, the director of this movie didn't make it easy for us and if you like that kind of thing, where you have to involve yourself in the movie, you should really enjoy &quot;Memento&quot;. We all pretty much have heard that it's about a man without the ability to make new memories caused by an attack in his home, who's out looking for the man &quot;John G&quot;, who caused this, plus raped and murdered his wife. The first thing that really struck me was how he used tattoos, wow, they were weird! They're all over his body, and they remind him of important things about this &quot;John G&quot;, and also things he needs to remember every day, like &quot;Eat&quot;! He takes Polaroids snap shots of people, cars, etc to remind himself where he lives, what <BR>car he drives, and information about the people he has to deal with. His name is Leonard Shelby and he's played by an actor named Guy Pearce, who I remembered as being so good in L.A. Confidential. He doesn't dissappoint in this film either, his performance is Oscar-worthy to me. Then there's Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, and they play people who are important to Leonard, but we're like Leonard, we don't know if we should trust them or not. In the beginning the story telling was confusing because you see a scene, then you have to wait for the next scene to know what happened before that, so it unfolds in reverse order. Don't be fooled, that doesn't hurt it, it helps. You see, we need to be just like Leonard Shelby to get the full impact of the events that are revealed when the movie ends. I'm glad I read the other reviews because they prepared me for this, so I went in with a positive, not negative attitude about this unusual plot structure. Original and refreshing movie, it's great!!
B00005R2M3|3.0|People compare Shakira to irreverent Alanis because they can't see an unique artist when they hear one. Shakira is one of a kind and her music and voice far surpass that of Alanis, the one-hit wonder. <br />Her new album is fine work but it lacks the strength of her previous records. It is the result of producers, translators, and writers who know nothing of Latin music and love to pretend they do. Her voice is overwhelmed by too-strong beats and is unnecesarily computer-manipulated; her poetry translated to english, turned into merely, in her own words, &quot;the language of advertising&quot;, and not the absolute truth it really is.<br />For those that want to hear the real Shakira, check out Shakira Unplugged. You will not be dissapointed.

B00005NWLO|5.0|Having the original vinyl album along with the Allmans live at the Fillmore, the Who live at Leeds and Bob Marley live at the Lyceum, I was so thrilled to buy them all again in the expanded editions, Lynyrd Skynyrd had always been my ace in the hole, even when we compared albums in the seventies.<BR>I bought the re-issued &quot;One more..&quot; and have just been blown away. All the songs sound fresh and new, the quality is as good as my original album (no digital flatness allowed), and I cried again when I thought of the plane-crash, I don't wonder what they might have sounded like now, I just feel that this quality of playing would never be bettered, the additional tracks, and extra bits between tracks make the concert come to life in my own house, especially played loud!<BR>Buy this album, play Lynyrd Skynyrd to your friends, kids, parents, who-ever, don't let this pass you by. Love and peace!
0440234743|5.0|I read the book The Testament By John Grisham, It was a page turner! Along with the rest of John Grisham's Law books this is the best so far. The point of the book is that Phelan, an owner of a major law firm kills himself and leaves money for several wives and kids everyone is familiar with. He also leaves some for Rachel Lane who no one has ever heard of. They hire Nate O'Riley a just-out-of-rehab-ex-lawyer to find Rachel to give her eleven billion. Eventually he does find her and offers the money, thats when he finds out about her, she is a doctor. I have also read the Firm and there were subjects in The Testament that was familiar. It was the fact that it was a law book and mystery in a way. Like the mystery in The Firm was what is going on within the firm and in The Testament, where and who is Rachel Lane?  <BR>Nate then finds out she has changed her name to Rachel Porter. Rachel read the papers carefully and said &quot;I'm not singing anything, i dont want the money.&quot; PG.310 I thought that it was a very bold thing to do. Besides there are no banks around to store the money. She was happy where she was, with her people. She has been so much in her life, and reached god in a way most have not. What would she do and want to do with eleven billion dollars? She even told Nate she doesn't need money for medicine or supplies. This book is not for everyone it can get boring here and there and may take time to read since it is so long. Although there are alot of funny parts in the beginning and it gets exciting toward the end it is a good book in my opinon.
0385493800|4.0|If you are a John Grisham fan then you will know this is one of his greatest books ever.  Once you are ingulfed in this story of life and inner love then you will never be the same.  The charictors in this drama have all got somthing in common with the people you would meet in the street.  from the start in Virgina to the lands of the Pantanal you will feel yourself wanting to go to the places he speaks of.  With twists in every tale and life and death becoming one you will know what this book is all about.  Life and how we live it.
B00005NB0H|5.0|The original Live at Leeds contained 6 songs (Young Man Blues, Substitute, Summertime Blues, Shakin' All Over, My Generation, Magic Bus) while the remastered version version added 7 more (Heaven and Hell, I Can't Explain, Fortune Teller, Tattoo, Happy Jack, I'm a Boy, A Quick One While He's Away).  There are also import versions of the remaster out there that further included Amazing Journey/Sparks.  That's the version I had when the Deluxe Edition was released and, it was so good, that I decided to spring for the Deluxe.      The Deluxe version has Disc 1's song list the same as the non-import version of the remaster.  Disc 2 is then a live performance of the rock-opera Tommy.   All of the songs from the studio version are here with the exception of Cousin Kevin, Underture and Sensation.  While the Keith Moon sang Cousin Kevin and Underture (a good song, but largely based on riffs similar to other songs) are not missed in the overall performance, Sensation would have been nice to have.  Nonetheless, this disc shines as the raw energy of a live show comes through without a sacrifice in the quality of the recording.  Some people complain about the order of the songs not matching the original release, but not only did that not bother me, it was unnoticeable in terms of its impact on the story (Pinball Wizard and Tommy Can You Hear Me moving up two slots each were the only changes).      Overall, this disc was worth the price of the Deluxe Edition.  Given a choice of listening to it or the studio version of the same, I'll reach for Live at Leeds every time.  Your decision of wheather to buy the Deluxe version or the previous though may largely depend on your view of Tommy.  If you liked Tommy, even if just a little bit, go for the Deluxe.  Otherwise, if you never cared for Tommy, the one disc version may be best for you.  Still, if you go that route, try and get the remastered version that includes Amazing Journey/Sparks.  These are two of the best songs from the Tommyperformance and Keith Moon's drumming, in particular, is fantastic.     Carrying on with Disc 1, as good as I think Tommy is on Disc 2, I'd say Disc 1 is even better.  The strength here lies in the non-Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy songs.  While still pretty darn good, I can't say that I Can't Explain, Substitute, Happy Jack, I'm a Boy, My Generation and Magic Bus are as good their classic studio counterparts (not many songs ever could say they are).  However, the live versions of Heaven and Hell, Tattoo and Fortune Teller are easily 50x better than the studio versions.  A Quick One While He's Away, Young Man Blues, Summertime Blues and Shakin' All Over also stand out and are much much better live than in the studio.  Throw in the aforementioned phenomenal Amazing Journey/Sparks (for the not-Deluxe import versions), and this disc is easily worth the price of admission.      Overall, both discs give a great glimpse into why many view The Who as one of the loudest, greatest live acts ever.  It's The Who as they're coming upon their peek, and a great quality recording to boot.  Myself, this is my favorite live album.  I think it's fantastic.    Lastly, I'll through in a word about the packaging for the Deluxe Edition.  In terms of the CD case, it's cardboard based.  While many the cardboard cases seem to not wear very well over the years, not this one.  In addition to a plastic cover, it's just solidly put together.  From day one opening it up, you discover that it's deluxe in more than just name.  It's very well conceived, from the quality of the materials to the linear notes that can be found in a 30 page booklet that includes stories about the Who, Live at Leeds, Tommy and the songs from Disc 1 as well.      Five stars, beginning to end!
B00005QDW5|4.0|To a true Pink Floyd fan, the idea of a `best of' collection is a strange one, at best. Floyd albums are meant to be heard in their entirety, not split up into individual tracks. Still, the folks at Capitol thought this was a good idea, and to a large degree--it is. The band's catalog is too big to fit all the `hits' on a single disc. Yet even with two CDs, there is still a lot of material that should be included here that is oddly missing. <br />On the other hand, there are a number of tracks here that are aimed squarely at the longtime Floyd fans, like \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"Jugband Blues\\"--both from the band's second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. All the tracks are studio recordings. There is nothing taken from Atom Heart Mother, Obscured by Clouds, Ummagumma, or the band's live albums. Everything on Echoes has been previously released in the US (with the exception of \\"When the Tigers Broke Free,\\" which was available on a promotional single several years ago).<br />The strangest thing about this compilation is the order of the material. Supposedly sequenced by the band themselves, the songs are all over the place in terms of when they were recorded. \\"Us and Them\\" (1973) precedes \\"Learning to Fly\\" (1987), \\"Arnold Layne\\" (1967) and Wish You Were Here (1975). You get the idea. Some of the segues work quite well. \\"Keep Talking\\" sounds great going into \\"Sheep\\"--surprising as that may appear. Diehard Floydians should also take note that some of the tracks included here are appearing in edited form--specifically \\"Echoes\\" (which is missing a full seven minutes), and \\"Marooned\\" (cut down to just over two minutes long). The best track editing appears during \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond,\\" combining parts 1-7 from the Wish You Were Here album.<br />Keeping with the Floyd tradition, most of the tracks segue into each other. The 32-page booklet contains lyrics to all the songs (that have lyrics), plus loads of photos of the band. Sound quality throughout the set is excellent, as you'd expect. So what's the bottom line? If you're already a Floyd fan, I'd put this under the `cool to have' category. If you're just discovering the band and you're on somewhat of a budget, it's a good place to start--especially for the early material. Otherwise, pick up Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. That's the true best of Pink Floyd.

6305776369|2.0|Mary Katherine Gallagher is an uncomfortable, uncool, venemous Catholic schoolgirl who dreams about stardom and dating the school stud.  This film does its part to uphold the proud tradition of (bad) movies derived from SNL material.  Molly Shannon does great prat falls, but there is little else to recommend this bizarre, armpit-sniffing character.  The plot is nothing and goes nowhere.
0684833395|5.0|As a high schooler, I would recommend &quot;Catch-22&quot; to anyone who isn't intimitated by larger books. This book is a novel about war and its prospects, morals, and the effects it has on the people within it. The narrator focuses on the events occuring in the camp of Pianosa, located on an island off the coast of Italy. The main character, Yossarian, gains morals and fights the system during World War II. It is very good a keeps the reader's attention. It's a nice variation from most dull high school reading, and I would rank this book right up there with &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;. If you are a high schooler looking for a challenging book, I would most certainly recommend &quot;Catch-22&quot;. (Didn't that sound like it came straight out of Reading Rainbow?)
0385505833|3.0|This wasn't the worst book I've read, but it also did not live up to the marketing. Grisham took the predictable, easy way out.  For such an established writer, I was surprised the editors did no fact-checking.  Most people know the Peace Corps is a two-year stint.  Many know you do not serve with four other volunteers in the same village - you are most likely all alone.  Some even know that the Corps has indeed lost volunteers in the past thirty years; hopefully their families won't read this, because that's a pretty offensive mistake.
B000002NJS|5.0|Maybe it's where we all are at at a given moment in time, but I went back to Ray of Light after the September 11th tragedy, and I found consolation and grieving both within this album. I feel that each song is a small gem constituting a great piece of work by America's pre-eminent pop star. Next to Britney Spears, Brandy and other wanna-be's, Madonna has the &quot;legs&quot; to remain on the top of her game. But lest we think it's all a cynical marketing ploy, if you follow her own life story, each of her albums is a reflection of her own life journey. I am not sure how Music fits into that picture, but all the previous albums parallel events of Madonna's personal life pretty clearly. <br />Most of us would agree that Madonna's motherhood had a major impact on her music making at the time of &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and its recording. I feel that her music's generation comes from that experience. That's why the level of feeling is so palpable in a song like Frozen, and the sense of wonder and simultaneous bewilderment come through in the title cut. No matter what you feel about her as a person, the album Ray of Light is an authentic masterwork from the one woman who survived Pop Music's vissitudes and multiple low points in the 80's and 90's, and has lived to tell new and more provoking stories. <br />I can't help but think that Madonna will be rocking into her 60's, just like the fabled Tina Turner strutted her considerable gifts and wondrous person well into her 60's as well.<br />Dance on Madonna!
0312119038|5.0|In &quot;Through the Narrow Gate,&quot;Karen Armstrong gives a poinant description of the 7 years that she spent in a convent. She entered an especially austere order with precepts based upon the military, predicated upon Victorianism, upon the misoginy inherent within the patriarical structure of the Catholic Church, upon a revered masochism, and upon a form of brain washing meant to destroy the ego of a novice, supposedly in order to fashion that novice's personage into a more humble, more devout entity.  Ms. Armstrong herself is not harshly critical of the Church or of the particular order, but readers no doubt will come to these crucial judgments themselves. We can only rejoice that such contorted religious training has been abolished.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Wow! You know Rock is in trouble when one of the hottest bands of the year is fictional. This band, created by Jamie Hewlett, the creator of the Tank Girl comic, and his London roomate Damon Albarn, the lead singer of the great Brit band Blur has struck a cord with the nation with a style that erases everything we expect from pop music. They had an interesting idea in creating their fictional band. The members of Gorillaz are 2D, who is basically the animated Damon Albarn himself, Murdoc a slightly insane metalhead bassist, Noodle, a ten year old Japanesse guitar goddess, and Russel the drummer who is seminly posessed by a dead rapper.<BR> <br />The videos are cool, but the music is cooler with songs like the singles, \\"Clint Eastwood\\", and \\"19-2000\\" rocking their way into MTV's and pop radio's rotations. Other songs on the album such as \\"Dracula\\", \\"Latin Simone\\", \\"M1A1\\", and\\"5/4\\" are wonderful songs that are like nothing ever heard before in pop music. However, the artists involved with the music are just as cool as the songs if not cooler. Damon Albarn provides the main vocals, but Buena Vista Social Club's Ibrahim Ferrer, Tom Tom Club's Tina Weymouth, Cibo Matto's Miho Hatori, rapper Del the Funky Homo Sapien, and hip hop producer Dan the Automater all lend their voices and music to the most interesting patchwork of an album we've heard in a long time. The genreless songs that make the album great include Cuban jazz, rap, dub, rock, punk, power pop, electronica, alternative, hip-hop, country, movie soundtrack, and celtic influences.    <br />Remember the days when this album could have been produced by a real band? When artists like Beck, Cornershop, Garbage, Cibo Matto, Blur, Sublime, Prodigy, and Bjork were making music that refused to be defined by a genre, and actually sell albums? I wish that I could hear more of this kind of genre mixing from the mostly ordinary (stuff) heard on rock radio today. Say yes to music that doesn't fall into categories. Support music that breaks the rules!
031286504X|5.0|The book has a good, unique story.  Robert Neville is the last human on earth and everyone else has turned into a vampire.  During the day if its sunny out, he can go about to get supplies and kill the sleeping vampires. At night he has to lock himself into his house and hope the vampires don't break in and get him.<br />This book it different from other books, the writing style is simple yet very visual, you get a picture in your head every page of the book. The story is unique and good if your a horror.<br />I enjoyed the book though, I'm just not a big fan of horror so the book didn't grab me.  But I could see how anyone interrested in this type of fiction would like this book a lot. There is suspense and action and drama all mixed together with a good story.  So if you are a fan of &quot;living dead&quot; horror, you can't go wrong with this one.<br /> &quot;Sound; a murmured rustle in the air. Robert Neville coughed weakly, then grimaced as the pain filled his chest.&quot; from page 152.  That is a good example of the description, it not only gives a good image of how he looks but also of how he feels.<br /> But if your not a fan or horror then this book will probably not get your attention.  There is lots of small action which does not pull you in eather. But fans of horror will probably eat up all the horror and suspence.  Give it a try though, you never know.

I'm baffled by this sort of aural pollution, but I know that there is no way anyone would get signed on the basis of this rubbish if they didn't have a 40 year career behind him. I am 19 years old, and I like some of his 60's albums along with \\"DESIRE\\"; maybe if I were a burnt out ex-rock star I would have sympathy for this album, too.
0805062971|5.0|The title of this book is Fight club. It is by Chuck Palahniuk.<BR>This book is a Fiction/adult-action.<BR>The main character (His name is never mentioned, because you are not your name)leads an average but boring life and is craving something more. As he flies from city to city he meets all sorts of people until he meets an interesting individual named Tyler Durdan who introduces a way of life new and unusual to the main character. As the main character looses everything and needs someone he is left with nothing but to call Tyler and live with him, this sounds simple enough but Tyler drags him into the world as Tyler sees it.<BR>     In my life as a reader i have never read anything even close to Fight club. This book really stood out to me because of the mature nature and situations of the book. This book made me think more than another book ever has.<BR>    Personally this is my favorite book because it makes you think about what you believe and how you are living.One of the repeated sentences in the book that stood out to me was &quot;That old saying, about how you always kill the things you love, well, it works both ways.&quot; This quote can be found on page 184. I enjoy the authors style and message that it is not until we have lost everything, that we can truly be free. I extremely like everything Tyler says, does, and is about. His ideas of doing what you want to do not what society or your parents tell you to do amaze me.<BR>    Even though I loved the book I agree it isnt for everyone. For one, I don't think this book is appropriate for younger readers. I don't think this would be a good book for people who can't imagine that there are other beliefs besides theirs. I think people looking for answers in their own life should read this book. It really makes you think!

0385505833|5.0|I have already passed my copy of this book on to three people, all of whom enjoyed it every bit as much as I did. What a treat....a real Christmas gift from John Grisham. And if his name was not on the cover, I never would have guessed that he wrote this wonderful little gem.<br />Every year I buy a family Christmas book for us all to read...some years it is a pop-up book and other years it is something more serious. This year's book is &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; and I think it will produce a lot of food for thought and some good discussion.<br />Although this book was full of humor and irony, I still felt the palpable tension as Christmas got closer, the feeling of being overwhelmed that many of us feel as the holidays approach. Even though the Kranks had decided not to celebrate Christmas, they still were under a lot of peer pressure from their neighbors, which created a lot of tension in their lives and gave Grisham an opportunity to show his humorous side (for example when the Kranks were hiding inside their house to avoid the carolers, the rooftop scene, and especially when Luther was &quot;borrowing&quot; his neighbor's Christmas tree).<br />In the end, we see what the real meaning of Christmas is and why all of the trappings of the holidays are not what makes it worthwhile. Anyone who has ever been a parent will understand the decisions the Kranks made.<br />Well worth reading every year, I believe, to remind us of what is and is not important in life.

0767903811|1.0|Bill Bryson is a funny writer - but lately he has franchised himself and over extended his abilities. This is a collection of fairly predictable, albeit sometimes funny, newspaper articles he wrote for a local newspaper. Nothing is original and nothing hits home on the mark... it's like your cantankerous uncle came home drunk and started blathering on about nothing.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I would give the movie 4-1/2 stars, because while I enjoyed the barbs and send-ups and concept, I'm not into gross-out humor.  Normally I round up when I'm between stars, but there is one very disturbing problem with this DVD edition --  the thirteen games and Revoice Studio don't work on Macs or DVD players -- majorly lame! -- so I rounded down instead.<br />The extras that *are* accessible to all of us are very good: an HBO feature about the making of the movie; interviews with the cast and filmmakers; funny fake character interviews; filmmakers' commentary; a trailer; the progression of characters as they were developed; and some very interesting (and sometimes creepy) digital goofs that result in missing body parts, etc.  You can watch the film with English, Spanish or French audio and subtitles.<br />This is a great example of what can be done with the DVD format, and if you don't mind toilet (and booger and fart and burp) humor, it is essential.  (If you do mind toilet humor, try the even more spectacularly belled and whistled Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs DVD.)<br />Strongly recommended.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|You could never accuse the guys at Disney of being on the cutting edge of progressive social thought, but they sure knew about fun -- and the current crew augments that same idea of fun with the latest technology by coming up with the best bells and whistles I've seen on a DVD.  There are two discs to hold it all -- pretty remarkable when you condsider that the movie itself is only 84 minutes long.<br /><br />The movie looks and sounds great .... a beautiful restoration.  Images are sharp, sound is clear.  You can listen to the original mono soundtrack, or an improved digital track in English or French.  If you choose French, even the opening sequence of a printed fairy tale book appears in French.  Pretty cool.<br /><br />The extras include Streisand singing 'Some Day My Prince Will Come'; a karaoke edition of 'Heigh Ho'; a 39-minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Angela Lansbury; audio commentary by Walt Disney himself, pieced together from archived materials; an animated short used to test some of the animation; and Dopey's Wild Mine Ride -- a great little trivia/puzzle game -- and that's just the first disk!<br /><br />The second disk is spectacular -- there are dozens of elements here, but I will mention (what I consider to be) the best: storyboard/film comparison; scenes deleted from the film (including a great scene of the dwarves making Snow White a bed, with comments penciled in by an animator); camera tests; featurettes about the voices, audio sessions, restoration of the film, and artistic concepts -- layouts, backgrounds, character sketches and development; publicity materials (posters, photos, trailers, radio commercials); and a timeline of the history of the film *and* Disney studios.<br /><br />The amount (and quality) of extras is truly incredible; and there is a well-designed print brochure, as well as on-disk tours of the material, to help you find your way around.<br /><br />This is a great version of a wonderful film -- and an exemplary use of the DVD format.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ended.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Though I'm more familiar with Howard Shore's score contributions to specialized genre offerings the likes of Tim Burton (Ed Wood) and David Cronenberg (Videodrome) -and fine scores, all- I really must say that I am wholly impressed by both the scope and the arrangements that Shore has applied to the soundtrack to this, one of the most eagerly awaited films of recent memory. From the mysteriously moody opening track 'The Prophecy' to the gentleness of 'The Council of Elrond' to the stirring 'The Bridge of Khazad Dum', this is one of those rare film scores that immediately impresses the imagination as it transports it to far away lands of magick, danger, sacrifice and glory. If Peter Jackson's film is anywhere near as effective as Howard Shore's score, our young boy wizard may be soon de-throned in the box office! 'Lord of the Rings' is a must own, whether your forte is film scores or classical/operatic composition. And by the way, the lesser priced version of the soundtrack is the same as the 'Limited Edition' version, the only difference being some standard CD ROM material and snazzy covers. The music's the thing after all, so my recommendation is to go the route of the 'Un-Limited Editon' and save the few dollars you have left over for those extra movie tickets on 19 December! :)
B00005QZWI|5.0|I've listened to this soundtrack several times since I've gotten it, and I just received it today.  I was amazed at how the music clutched at my emotions and imagination.  I could just imagine the hobbits scurrying about Hobbiton, the fearful Ringwraiths chasing Frodo, the journey through Moria and Gandalf's battle with the Balrog and his fall.  All of this I could imagine through this movie score, and the movie isn't even out yet!  I would rank it a level slightly higher than de Meij's great classical Lord of the Ring's-inspired work.  I surely hope this signfies how powerful this movie will be.  I am a firm believer that a soundtrack can make or break a film, and Lord of the Rings seems well on its way already.  I just can't wait now for the actual movie to open in theaters.
068484267X|5.0|It would truly be a shame for anyone that has come across this personal memoir to not read it for it will most definitly touch and perhaps change your life forever if you do. Frank McCourt has ironically richly rewarded my life by the telling of his life growing up in Ireland that was everything but rich and certainly not rewarding. However, the unbelievable suffering and emotionally excruciating pain he went through never stopped him from making himself a better man. He chose the high road in life and filled his mind with knowledge and wonder, always desiring to learn more. He has taught a powerful lesson in this book, and that is no matter where you come from, no matter what circumstances shaped your life early on, you can still achieve your dreams and heart's desires...you just simply must never give up.
B000002H6C|5.0|The first post-Cliff Metallica effort was the best without him.  Justice is awesome without a doubt.  This album is definetely the most angry and intense Metallica album on the market, and will make any fan of heavy music happy.<br />Blackened is as good of an opening song on an album as you will find.  ...And Justice For All may seem long, but it is full of powerful material.  Harvester of Sorrow and Shortest Straw are among the heaviest songs I have heard by anyone, period.  To Live is To Die shows great diversity, and Dyers Eve is just out of control.  And, oh yeah, ONE!  (if you don't know ONE, get this album immediately and see what you are missing).<br />GET IT!
0812550757|5.0|The name of the book is Speaker for the Dead and it was written by Orson Scott Card.  It is a science fiction novel.  It is about the planet Lusitania which is the home of the first sentient alien species known to man since the formics.  Humans are studying the piggies, the aliens, to learn about their culture and way of life, although they can share nothing of the human knowledge and technology.  The Speaker for the Dead, Ender Wiggin, also responsible for the extermination of the formics, comes to speak the death of Marcos Ribiera, and in doing so begins a sequence of events that cause the colony to rebel against Starways Congress and eventually become friends and allies with all the piggy tribes.  <BR>       I thought the book was very enjoyable to read.  The characters were all well developed and the plot untwisted and fit together nicely with everything that was happening.  My favorite character was Ender because he was just so understanding towards other people could fix things that were seemingly unfixable.  This quote shows how he has the ability to fix things,&quot;Mother, he's not what the Bishop said.  He's good.&quot;  He also brought the egg of the last hive queen, of the formics, in existence.  The formics had been almost wiped out by Ender when he commanded the human fleets at a very young age.  They leave behind an egg for Ender to find and restore to life, which he does on Lusitania.  <BR>     I definitly liked the book and would recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction.  The only drawback would be because it is science fiction and science fiction isn't the most popular genre.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Great DVD and Great Movie. I personally don't see why people don't like this movie. Jar Jar to me represents the kid who's wierd or different like me. (...)So what about caribean and chinese accents. These aliens need some accent. Usually they're given british accents. This DVD has great features and the deleted scenes are to die for. If you love Star Wars you'll love this DVD
B000001ELP|4.0|I remember that when I first bought this album back in 1985,<br />I was expecting the worst and being pleasantly surprised when I<br />found out how GREAT some of it was! There are definitely some<br />horrible songs on here, like ODYSSEY, on which Paul Stanley tries<br />to sound like an opera singer and fails miserably and DARK LIGHT,<br />which features a very silly vocal from Ace Frehley. On some of<br />this, however, KISS rock out like they haven't in a while,especi-<br />ally on the album's blistering lead off track( at least on the LP<br />version), THE OATH, which is the best song on the album and fea-<br />tures one of Paul Stanley's strongest vocals and has one of their<br />most complicated guitar riffs( or licks, i still can't tell the<br />difference)! I also love the songs ONLY YOU and UNDER THE ROSE,<br />featuring some of GENE SIMMON's most introspective lyrics and<br />finds him singing in his non-monster voice! The story behind the<br />album is a bit silly, but I think this is a very interesting al-<br />bum and it's a HELL OF A LOT BETTER than most of their 80's al-<br />bums, with the exception of CREATURES OF THE NIGHT.<br />  Stay away from the remastered version on cd, which for<br />some reason messes around with the song order! RAAR!!!
0385505833|5.0|My wife never has time to read books but I am going to insist that she read this even if she only reads a chapter a day.  The book lays down an interesting premise and then just when I thought I knew where it was going - it went another direction.  The ending has the spirit of &quot;It's a Wonder Life&quot;.  Thanks to the author for a good Christmas gift for 2001!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I loved this soundtrack, but it's missing a few things.  It needs Like A Virgin, Spectacular, The Show Must Go On, and the Lady Marmalade that is mixed with Smeels Like Teen Spirit.<br />Other than that, it's an amazing soundtrack.<br />Ewan is amazing. Plain and simple.  Nicole Kidman isn't bad herself.<br />I listen to this CD all the time.  I sang along with the movie when I saw it again.<br />there's not much more i can say except,<br />BUY THIS SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000BKE0|2.0|I was the BIGGEST Iron Maiden fan growing up.  From age 10, when I got &quot;Powerslave&quot; for Christmas, to age 20, when I saw IM live for the 2nd time in Salt Lake City supporting No Prayer for the Dying, they were my pet band.  After that concert, the songs on this album grew old fast, whereas songs on their first 5 albums have never grown stale to this day.  I love Iron Maiden, but this album was the beginning of the end of their flowering as the world's preeminent rock band.
B00005Q66T|5.0|BUY IT because <BR>1. It is a collection of some of Madonna's best music.<BR>2. Most versions are different from album versions<BR>3. And it's a collection of some of the best music from the 90's<br />YES it is missing hits.   YES there is no new music.   But you can't hate it for only having 15 fantasic songs and not 17.  <BR>5 stars.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|My husband & I agree (for once) that this is the worst movie we've ever seen! The story line was horrendous. But MY least favorite thing about this movie was the EXTREMELY REDUNDANT use by the little 'computer geek guy' of sterotypical British verbage, (...)
B00005QIPH|4.0|The song &quot;Last Nite&quot; is one that I could listen to repeatedly, but two weeks ago I listened to the cd &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; by the White Stripes (Awesome CD! Get it NOW!) and I have set this cd aside for now. The vocals on this album sound &quot;muddled&quot; or not clear. I think it was done to make the album sound like a classic rock album, but I couldn't help but be annoyed by it. I would like to know what the lyrics are (no lyrics included). Despite the minor faults, this is still better than most of the other cds that have been released this year.
0448060191|5.0|Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott.  This book would be classified as a young adult.<BR>  Little Women is the strory of three sisters.  It shows the trials a girl can face as she grows up into a women.  The book is filled with romance, trouble, revenge and many other domestic problems.<BR>I have read many books that are similar to Little Women.  The Old-fashioned Girl, is another delightful story with a similar genre.  It is also by Louisa May Alcott.  <BR>I really enjoyed the book.  I love Alcott's style of writng.  You are really able to connect with each of the charcters.  I found the strongest connection between Jo and myself.  She is an independent women.  She and likes to be philosophical.  We are very much alike in these ways.  &quot; Jo is our Literary fellow.&quot;  This was said about Jo form her sister Meg.  The whole March family thought Jo was the greatest authoress that ever did live.  I to would love to get such praise for my writings.<BR>However good this book may be it does have its drawbacks.  I feel there could have been several things omitted.  I would recommend this book for those who enjoy stories about women who in their own little ways try to make their world better.
0789723107|5.0|The author, Steve Krug, has a written book that is succinct and straight to the point, and does so in a colloquial, impartial, and detailed yet precise manner.  I've read other books on web usability, and this one was the best by far.  Highly beneficial to beginners as well as experts.  THE book to get on web usability.
B000002U9W|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I think Floyd is a great band.  However, this album is by far their worst and is in the running for worst album ever.  People who say this is great should listen to it sober then they might change their mind.
B00004X01U|3.0|First of all, I love the title track &quot;Music.&quot; I also love the track &quot;Don't Tell Me.&quot; Other than those two songs, not much else on the cd is that great. &quot;Paradise (Not For Me) is interesting, but too &quot;strange.&quot; I wish Madonna would quit trying to copy Bjork and stick to singing hit/entertaining songs like she used to. &quot;It's Amazing&quot; is clearly an attempt to write another &quot;Beautiful Stranger.&quot; I like it, but what happened to the Madonna who doesn't repeat herself. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is silly. I can't imaging singing &quot;I like to singy singy singy like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy&quot; when I reach the age of 42. That takes a lot of nerve; however, it does have a good techno beat. &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; sounds like a throw away cut from the &quot;Erotica&quot; album sessions. &quot;What it Feels Like for a Girl&quot; is a BORING ballad that should have been saved for a boxed set. I won't say what should be done with &quot;Nobody's Perfect.&quot; That vocal effect really grates on my nerves really quickly! If you must buy a Madonna album and you don't own one already, stick with &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; or &quot;Ray of Light.&quot; Those are by far her two best works yet. Despite all of this releases shortcomings, Madonna still deserves 3 stars because it is better than most of the garbage on the radio today and she does try to be creative, even if it is at the expense of sounding &quot;silly.&quot;
B00005LC3Y|1.0|Wait for Warner to wake up and issue a widescreen version. It's hard to believe Warner still gets away with its sleazy practices.<br />With the exception of a few 'special films\\" (like Dr. Zhivago), Warner consistently delivers the absolute LEAST they can get away with: A handful of chapter selections, lousy transfer quality, (...), a dearth of extra material (often none at all), and most annoying: full-screen only format (which loses about a third of the picture).<br />I sometimes buy these Warner rip-offs accidentally.  (...)
B0000027D5|5.0|Lotus was recorded during the heart of Santana's jazz-rock period.  But whereas Caravanserai and Welcome (whose lineup is featured here) are relatively quiet, meditate affairs, Lotus is a fiery testament to a band that was at its peak.  The guitar playing, mixing speaker-frying leads with more avant-garde sounds, foresees the style Pete Cosey would perfect with Miles Davis a year later; and the rhythm section has loosened up to the point were they can switch from groove to groove effortlessly.  Leon Thomas contributes a few vocals (&quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; and his trademark yodelling on &quot;Mr. Udo&quot;) but the music is almost entirely instrumental.<br />  The long fusion jams -- &quot;Every Step of the Way&quot;, &quot;Toussaint L'Overture&quot; and an absolutely bonkers &quot;Incident at Neshabur&quot; --  are definitely high points of this concert.  But you can't overlook the 30 minute medley that closes disc 1 either.  The only real weak spot is Mike Shrieve's long drum solo &quot;Kyoto&quot; (hey, this was the 70s).  If a sound halfway between Caravanserai and Miles Davis's acid funk albums Agharta/Pangaea sounds exciting, you must hear this.
B000002GJ7|5.0|There is not much to dispute the fact that Extreme was one of the most musicaly talented bands to grace the eighties or nineties. Nuno Bettencourts playing and songwriting skills <BR>truly shine on &quot;Porno&quot; The rythym section comprised of Pat Badger &amp; Paul Geary (the brainchild behind Godsmack) was<BR>probably the tightest since JP Jones and John Bonham.As a<BR>lucky attendee of over 25 live Extreme shows, I feel more than qualified to comment and recommend this disc to anyone that<BR>enjoys &quot;art rock&quot; or concept type rock such as Dream Theater, Queensryche, and any other band that is composed of &quot;true musicians&quot; Listen to the disc, if you don&quot;t like it, I'll buy <BR>it from you. Rock On !
B000001Y42|1.0|...then you my friend, live in one sorry state. I mean, listen to how bad these lyrics are, even BEFORE they became Carson's pet! Fred is rapping about skateboarding in Stuck! And fans call this the most emotional song! The only half decent song this band has ever made is Nobody Loves Me, only really because of the opening and quiet parts. I also like the CD's bad recording, except for the fact that the guitar and DJ can't always be differentiated, but it is Wes. Not only that, but Fred contradicts his own words. In Stink Finger, he's supposedly singing about how much his neighbor hates him, but if you piss on his gate, OF COURSE he's going to hate you. And Fred talks about how all of these people copy their band in Counterfeit, but these days, he supports it. And Fred's voice is at its highest on the CD, coming very close to breaking the sound barrier and my eardrums.<br />Not only Fred, but the music is ridiculous. First of all, some fans are calling this punk and metal. There is no such thing as a punk or metal band with a turntablist. That makes them cheesy rockrap. Not only that, but the lyrics are sung in a rappy style. Unfortuneately, this is how modern punk lyrics are sung due to the lameness of the non-mainstream bands these days(Bigwig, MXPX, etc...), but the turntablist thing completely overrules it. Also, none of the actual musicians have talent(Being a DJ doesn't exactly qualify as music). Wes Borland isn't even playing chords here, and he is using a seven string guitar...what a piece of junk, buy a six string. Instead, he plays about two notes. In recent times, he has moved up to about three or maybe even four. But still no chords. Sam Rivers is a decent bass player, but I have a friend who could turn him into chuck roast any day and he's only in 10th grade(And as a matter of fact, his brother is a guitarist that could turn Wes to chuck roast and in 9th grade...as am I). The problem is, he is playing a five string bass. Instruments with extra strings seem so poserous...just buy the normal four string. Still, he's just okay. John Otto uses the same beat in every song and can't keep a consistent bass pedal. Need I say more?<br />So for all of you who say this band was &quot;good in the old days&quot;, my friends, you are wrong. This band didn't have any talent to begin with. It's not even loud. If you want real punk or metal, try Dead Milkmen, Botch, Black Flag, Meatmen, Dead Kennedys, Propaghandi, Tub Ring, or Refused. That is all.
B00001QGPS|4.0|this cd was stuck to my player for several months. never took it out. i still --two years later-- listen to it pretty regularly, because it still bumps. i let my friend hear it and he said: &quot;redman should never do another album without method man and method man should never do another album without redman.&quot; you can hear the chemistry. a couple of tracks falter into the &quot;okay&quot; range, but the majority of it is SOLID.
B0000020C4|4.0|Excellent vocals, lovely tribute. If you like Les Mis is an excellent CD to own.
6305327041|5.0|If you are a hardcore Tarrantino fan, you'll probably like this. If you are a reserved, serious person, you probably won't. Pretty simple huh? Maybe not...<br />I'll break it down room by room. The first room is sort of just to give us the happy &quot;Ted scored&quot; feeling. Sometimes I'd really rather fast forward through this, as the script is sort of silly in this room. But overall, I've seen a lot worse, and remember, we're not taking this film seriously right?<br />The second room is the mistaken identity room that really shows off Tim Roth's ability to act. I have read other reviews that say he is horrible in this. I disagree completely. You can see every emotion the character feels pass across his face, which makes it very humorous. Jennifer Beals does a good job in this section, but like a lot of dialogue in Tarrantino films, you get the strict, rigid scripted feeling. In other words, the actors spit out this long line of gibberish that noone would really say in real life. People have to take the time to come up with these types of speeches. <br />The third room is probably the best, if not a little bit disturbing. I think everyone did a good job in this section, especially Tim Roth when he was aggravated by the children. <br />The fourth room seems to be plagued by bad acting. In my opinion, only Willis and Roth do a good job. Tarrantino is frightfully bad in his dialogue, and that scripted feeling comes back stronger than ever. Meanwhile, you'd be hard pressed to believe that anyone besides Willis is drunk. I think it was a bad case of overacting on the part of the others. Overall, its still worth watching, and the movie is great if for no other reason than Tim Roth (who is terrific in everything he is in -- See The Muskateer, as his acting is the only thing making the movie worthwhile).
B00005RFAI|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pink and this new album reaffirms it.  I have seen her on MTV's Diary and I could totally relate.  After hearing this new album I can see exactly where she's coming from. Very much on the level of Alanis Morrisette and Sheryl Crow, this album is much different than Can't Take Me Home, but no less a hit.  If you love Pink, buy this album.  I haven't stopped playing it since I bought it the day it hit stores!
B000050XEI|5.0|I am a fussy, discriminating, not-easy-to please musician who has played professional jazz trumpet for years. But Enya's music never fails to bring me a sense of euphoria that I don't find even with my favorite jazz or other tracks on a consistent basis. Her music is without a doubt, a gift of the spirit, and her kindred soul always permeates her music. What's truly unique here is that the music of Enya---while so pleasing and universal to an obviously wide audience---somehow escapes commercialism or banality. I suppose when a soul truly and earnestly speaks, it does so without having to rely on gimmickry or superficiality, nor on the primal scream of the banging drum. It speaks deeply, quietly and beautifully to anyone who will listen. Listen to this music.
B00005PJ8I|2.0|OK, I guess if needed to watch this movie in order to be able to spend hours pretending I was stranded on a desert island with nothing to eat but raw fish and coconuts w/ my best friend, the volly ball, then I guess it was worth the two+ hours I spent in the movie theatre induring this dull movie. <br />Or perhaps I was supposed to gain some insite about how the human spirit prevails over all. <br />Unfortunately the interesting part of the story - what drove Hank's character to the brink of suicide - was barely discussed  and then almost as an after thought. If this dilema had been the meat of the movie, then it may have been a testament to the an individual's drive to live. However, since this story line was excluded, the viewer walks away with a vague sense that he spent about a week on the island, and other than getting sick of raw fish, wasn't that big of a deal. <br />And what the heck was up with that ending? (...)
6304806442|4.0|I thought this was a great movie.  I don't have such intimate personal experience, but it seemed to me to show a fairly realistic view of the life of an addict.  I have heard various people say that this movie glorifies drug use.  I think that this is like saying that showing car crashes glorifies driving. I thought the movie was well done and engrossing, though not necessarily entertaining.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|first off, this album isn't one long song like LOVESEXY. the songs do run together but you can skip to individual songs.<BR>     'the rainbow children' is a new creative peak for PRINCE.<BR>anyone that is on 'for the ride' with PRINCE will love this album. the sound is completely new and fresh. just compare this to anything on the radio today. no one takes the kind of chances PRINCE does.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|This movie starts out bad and never gets better. I could not take Angelina Jolie's gaze that she did throughout the movie. All she did was stand around.... do the gaze... and kick some butt. I guess I could say they matched the video game perfectly. But I expected more out of her. Boring, don't rent it and don't think of buying it.
B00003CXFG|1.0|I lost track of the movie when they crashed on the planet. Stopped watching after this, because of one main thing:<BR>Extremely bad acting.<BR>I don't think I have seen worse acting in a movie. So I couldn't bare to watch it any longer, because I felt I was in the middle of a movie where they actually paid for everything except for the actors.<BR>I know this review isn't as throughout as all the other ones here, but there is no more to say about this movie. I recommend this movie to nobody, it just is pure garbage, and can only be unmatched in a garbage pile. Why any people would achieve at giving this movie 5 stars, is beyond my world, in what I call movie quality. Even the somewhat interesting extras on what makes this the DVD version, doesn't help this movie at all. Nope. Please remember to recycle.-
0395177111|5.0|Written By: J.R.R. Tolkien<br />It is a Faiytale Adventure.<br />It is a story of Bilbo baggins, who is a hobbit. One day he finds himself in an adventure with dwarf. After his adventure he realizes he barely excapes with his life and adventures are funner than he thought.<br />In a way this is very much like, The Call of the Wild by Jack London, because Buck and Bilbo were both taken from there home and force to go were they did not want to go; but Bilbo made it back to his home and Buck didn't.<br />If you don't like reading try reading this.<BR>I very much like the style that Tolkien wrote this book in, because it keeps you wanting to see what is going to happen to Bilbo. On page 17, when Bilbo said, &quot;Good morning&quot;. Gandalf asked him what he meant by the phrase &quot;good morning&quot;.  Tolkien makes you think about what the characters say and do. If you have never been on an adventure yourself, you should try going with a Hobbit named Bilbo. Even though Tolkien is a great writer, there are some drawbacks to his style. To you students read this over the weekend because you may not be able to put it down.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Ok...I'm a pretty big Ryan fan...loved his whiskeytown stuff along with heartbreaker. At first few listens there were only 2 or 3 songs that stuck in my head on CD 1. CD 2 has been toted by many as the savior of the album...the songs are good..but I wouldn't throw away disc 1. I had the opportunity to see him live in HOB LA...simply amazing show. Gold is an album begging to be played live. Practically the whole album was played with amazing results. I highly recommend buying this album...more importantly however is catching him live.
B00005QIPH|2.0|First of all, folks, five stars?!  This is &quot;Astral Weeks,&quot; &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; &quot;Axis Bold As Love?&quot; Please reserve 5 stars for classics and destined-to-be-classics. That said, there is a germ of a good band here; right now, they're cruising by on the personality of the vocalist and, as noted, a dose of something which appears to resemble &quot;attitude.&quot; The guitarist from time to time rips off some tasty slop reminiscent of the Stooges or any 60s garage band (good, not bad).<br />Still, there's not too much to recommend this album, song-wise. In fact, I kept thinking I was listening to the same song half the time. They Strokes simply do not rock as hard as they should. Their progenitors--Stooges, MC5, Lou Reed--made up for their lack of chops with boatloads of drive and energy, which this recording lacks. And while I think the singer has lots of potential, he dips into the same stylistic well too much. As does the rest of the band. Yet, for an album this monotonous and derivative, it's not all that bad.  They seem two albums away from a really cool one. Let's see how they fare.

B004I1K2NW|3.0|I used to love The Frighteners and I was one of the few people who actually saw it in cinemas back in the day. Peter Jackson used to be so full of imagination and potential. He started off doing raw, gory horror films (actually broad comedies) like Bad Taste, Braindead, and Meet the Feebles. The Frighteners was his first Hollywood film, and for better or worse, the first film in which his love affair with CGI seized control of his vision.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox (in his last live-action lead role) is Frank Bannister a psychic investigator/con man with a tragic past who uses his ghost pals to scare people and run a fake ghostbusting racket. His hometown of Clearwater is in the midst of an epidemic in which seemingly healthy people are dying of heart attacks but Frank soon discovers that there is a much more sinister reason behind it and tackles the dark forces before they claim the life of his new love interest.<br /><br />The mystery and plot twists in The Frighteners are all well-written and keep it alive (pun intended) for the entire running time without the slightest lull. I honestly do mean it when I say that this will probably remain the best film in Jackson's career. Yes, even better than those tedious, overdone LOTR movies, better than King Kong, better than...etc.<br /><br />So why the 3-star review? Believe me, back when I was a teenager I would have given this 4 stars without hesitation, but I just cannot stand Jackson as a filmmaker anymore. For a director who began making gritty, in-your-face horror with practical make-up and special effects he come along way/fallen far from his roots. Nothing this guy does these days is 'real'. Nothing is genuinely there, tangible, in front of the camera. It's all a CGI and fake, and The Frighteners was the tipping point for that particular trajectory. Even the Lovely Bones, terrible as it was, had CGI enhancements all over, even outside of the 'Heaven' scenes. Nothing is REAL with this guy, not anymore! He needs to go back to making movies with a camera, some 16mm film, and a boom mike if he wants to get any respect from me or scrape back any shred of credibility. The generic Danny Elfman score, which sounds like absolutely everything else he's ever done, didn't help either.<br /><br />Universal took a gamble with releasing The Frighteners in the summer season of 1996 (it didn't reach the UK until February 1997, and even then only for about a week) and it was a gamble that they would come to regret. Summer 1996 was an effects filled season with movies like Independence Day, Twister, and Eraser doing huge business. The Frighteners (much more suited to a Halloween release) had a truly terrible trailer, to the tune of Alan Silvestri's annoying Death Becomes Her score, that made it look like a light-hearted comedy. The R-rating was also joke, and a stupid decision. Jackson cut 14 minutes from the movie to lessen the tone but the MPAA still slapped the movie with an R despite the fact that there really, really isn't anything, even in the 124-minute director's cut that warrants such a rating. Plus, the fact that Jackson shot this in rainy New Zealand (doubling as the Pacific Northwest, I assume) meant that a dreary, drizzly, depressing-looking movie fought for box office takings against happy, upbeat, sunny summer movies, and in a year when America was hosting the Olympics too.<br /><br />Bad move, Universal, very, very bad move.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks good, bringing out the miserable color palette well, in 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound.

B00005QDW5|3.0|Compiling an anthology of the best of Pink Floyd is a fool's errand at best.  Many of the band's best moments are just not as compelling when removed from the context of the albums that spawned them.  Not to mention the fact that the band has had at least three seperate and distinct eras that don't necessarily compliment one another.  The early days (pre-&quot;Meddle&quot; 1971) feature original leader Syd Barrett and his psycadelic influence even after he left the band.  From 1971-1983, Floyd was a Roger Waters dominated concept album band.  After Waters left in 1983, the band has been led by guitarist David Gilmour, and has been merely a shadow of its former self.<br />Though to be admired for liberally including songs from the early days, the album makes a tactical error in not being programmed chronilogically.  For example, the previously unreleased track &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot; appeared in the movie version of &quot;Pink Floyd The Wall.&quot;  It's a fine song, but standing alone outside of &quot;The Wall's&quot; story line it doesn't have the same impact.<br />Overall, there is nothing wrong with the music on this collection.  Of course, it could also have included about a dozen more songs, but then it would be of unweildy size.  Hardcore fans probably already own most, if not all, of the material.  Those just getting to know Floyd would be better off purchasing the original albums, starting with &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall.&quot;
B00005QW4K|3.0|Although still quite stupid and completely wacky and crazy. Bruce Campbell is eccentric and totally over the top as Ash and this movie is basically a one-man-show. We are treated to scene after scene of Ash banging his head, falling over, getting beaten up, banging his head etc. This poor guy never stops hurting himself, how does he put up with it.<br />But at least he finds love in this movie with Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) so his mind is taken off the death (and possesion) of Linda in first Evil Dead. Hailed as a hero by the 14th century mortals we can like Ash a lot more than we did before. He is still a clumsy oaf but you just love him. Clumsy oafs can sometimes be much more appealing than muscle-bound killing machines.<br />This new DVD is the Directors Cut and features a dull cover art and a lame insert card but it doesn't matter because it's an &quot;Official Bootleg Edition&quot; so it kind of fits. There is a Commentary (the same one that was on the Limited Edition), storyboards and deleted scenes. So this is still worth the money to the fans.<br />But be warned, the added footage is of workprint quality with very poor blacks, massive grain and sub-VHS colors and it really marrs the pleasing quality of the rest of the movie. Anchor Bay should have tried to correct this somehow.<br />The DVD is in Dolby 2.0 surround and is windowboxed at 1.66:1 in anamorphic.
0679746048|4.0|It is difficult to imagine that somebody with this condition could dig as deep into herself as Susanna Kaysen has done. This is a multilayered book. I read it again after reading The Courtship Dance of the Borerline (by Walker) (AKA Boy, interrupted??) to try and get a sense of the chaos. Girl is certainly a book to read more than once, and to read in different moods (relaxed, hyper, exhausted etc) Doing so sheds different lights on the story. Like the Courtship Dance, another excellent memoir is the movie Gia (for Jolie fans)
6305263248|5.0|John Frankenheimer didn't have a lot of credibility in his last few years. His final film was the rather crap Reindeer Games, with Ben Affleck, and in 1996 he gave us the utterly terrible Island Of Doctor Moreau. However, he did do Ronin in 1998, which makes up for absolutely everything.<br /><br />It is a detachment from glossy, MTV-directed, Hollywood action movies. If you want trash, like Bad Boys 2, then this isn't for you. Ronin returns to the gritty, rustic and deadly serious actioners of the Seventies, much like Frankenheimer's own French Connection 2.<br /><br />The title refers to Samurai warriors in ancient Japan who were left with no cause, or purpose, if their master was killed. They'd roam the countryside, pretending to be thieves, beggars, even madmen and hiring their skills out to the highest bidder. Much like the lost, wandering freelancers that make up our cast of characters.<br /><br />Robert De Niro is Sam, an ex-CIA agent (or is he?), who bands together with a ragtag group of similar ex-spies for a \\"no questions asked\\" job with what appears to be the IRA. First we have Vincent (the wonderful Jean Reno), as a French agent who knows where to find just about anything you want. Spence (Sean Bean) is a gung-ho SAS dropout who is waaaaay out of his depth and ends up jeopardizing the whole mission. Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard), an ex-KGB spy who knows his gadgets and another American called Larry (who is rather disposable). All of these men are led by Deirdre (Natascha McElhone), a young Irish woman who answers to Seamus O'Rourke (Jonathan Price), an IRA boss who is in a lot of trouble with his superiors.<br /><br />Still with me? No? Well I'm gonna continue anyway. The group's mission is to steal a metallic briefcase from the Russian Mafia. The contents of this case are a mystery; all we know is that a lot of people are willing to pay mucho plento to get their hands on it.<br /><br />As if the set-up wasn't tenuous enough, there is immediately too much suspicion within the group to bear. And the already complicated plot is thrown into endless chaos as double-crosses, double-double-crosses, secrets and lies screw things up in a big, big way.<br /><br />It sounds tough going, but it's not really. I'll admit I didn't really like Ronin when I first saw it (or the second or third for that matter), but it's one of those movies that creeps back on you. Frankenheimer's direction is so flawless and masterful that every frame of every scene flows effortlessly The acting is so well rehearsed and the cast so well chosen that even in every gesture, idiosyncrasy and subtle glance you can read into the characters' hidden motives. It takes a good number of viewings to decipher Ronin, but when the story is this well done, who cares? Since its release there have been few action films that have come close to its intensity. Some, like Bourne Identity/Supremacy try to emulate its bleak tone, but don't match up. Supremacy has a car chase that was desperate to beat Ronin's, but is far too flashy.<br /><br />That's also the ace up it's sleeve. About 80 minutes into the film, the second car chase is a juggernaut of film-making. Never before and probably never again for a long, long time, has there been a car chase so completely mental. No Michael Bay 1000 cuts a second, no slow-motion, no stunts silhouetted against the sunset, just sheer, relentless adrenaline, as DeNiro and Reno tear up the streets of Paris. It's the centerpiece of the movie and a perfect example of what REAL action film-making is.<br /><br />Elia Cmiral's score is the other utterly perfect aspect of the movie. Simultaneously lonely, seductive and mysterious, it surely is one of the best themes ever and anyone with sense would go out and buy the soundtrack CD right away.<br /><br />Ronin is perfection from beginning to end, from Frankenheimer's strong, imposing direction to David Mamet's script, riddled with cryptic dialogue and double-meanings.<br /><br />No one can denyRonin's importance as a real action picture. No one can watch crap like xXx, or 6 Fast 6 Furious, and claim Ronin to be a bad movie. It has enough, maybe too much, integrity and intelligence to shame anything that comes even halfway close. If you're sick of action flicks, or films in general, where the audience just sits there passively and is fed information, then Ronin is the cure.<br /><br />It may sound like a bizarre comparison, but it's on par with Lost Highway, as one of those movies you have to figure out in your own damn time.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks merely okay with a 1080p transfer. The film was shot in Super 35 (the credits incorrectly claim anamorphic Panavision) and was intended to look drab and miserable, so it's hard to fault the transfer. The DTS HD-MA sound design is loud and aggressive. There are no extras, which is stupid considering they already existed.

B000006IUQ|1.0|Awesome movie, no doubt about it.  But I already have the VHS version, and am not going to spend ... on a no-frills DVD of this movie.  Where are the extras?  Commentaries?  A featurette on the bear and his training for this film? When and if this film deservedly gets a specialized DVD treatment, then I will upgrade and be able to enjoy this highly recommended film on DVD.
B000001EKX|5.0|This inexplicably is one of the most poorly reviewed of KISS's early LPs. I don't get it because I've loved this album for years and the only thing I can think of that justifies this criticism is the less than great production quality. What makes this album indispensible are the songs. They are all catchy hard rock songs written with the humor and enthusiasm of a young band on the rise, before they became a corporate entity. Classics are bountiful such as the title song, \\"Got to Choose\\", \\"Let Me Go, Rock n' Roll\\", \\"Watchin' You\\" and my all time favorite \\"Parasite\\". I also love the one-two pop punch of \\"Mainline\\" and \\"Coming Home\\". Ace Frehley's contributions in writing and playing really stand out, especially \\"Strange Ways\\" and Peter while not a songwriter as yet contributed his spirited and trademark raspy vocals to both \\"Mainline\\" and \\"Strange Ways\\". As strange as \\"Goin' Blind\\" is you can't help but admire the sense of humor that Gene brought to his songwriting and that is what makes that song so great. If you are a KISS fan then I know I'm preaching to the choir when I say \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" belongs alongside the debut as a true representation of what made KISS a great band, good songs.

630575067X|4.0|&quot;Star Wars, Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; is one of those films where I was, in a strange way, more satisfied by the trailer than by the actual film. A &quot;prequel&quot; to the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy of films, &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; takes us several decades back in time in relation to the action of those films. As with the earlier films, &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; transports us to a world of science-fiction adventure involving robots, exotic aliens, and epic space battles.<br />The plot of &quot;Menace&quot; involves a young boy named Anakin (who will grow up to be the Darth Vader of the original trilogy) and young Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. They become involved in a starship blockade of the planet Naboo, whose heroic queen seeks to save her people from invasion.<br />&quot;Menace&quot; has many admirable elements. The cast is very good. I was impressed by young Jake Lloyd in the challenging role of Anakin. There are some truly spectacular action sequences. Although the pod race (a sort of high-tech chariot race) is a prominent episode, my favorite action sequence is a thrilling scene of robotic heroics outside the skin of a starship during battle. The set designs, costumes, and special effects make the film a stunning visual feast. And the musical score superbly combines classic &quot;Star Wars&quot; motifs with some newer elements.<br />But despite all this, I found the film to be strangely underwhelming. I was also disturbed by creator George Lucas' use of violence in the film. As in the original &quot;Star Wars,&quot; Lucas seems to cheat by presenting us with a sanitized version of war violence. Whereas in the first film faceless masked enemy soldiers were shot in large numbers, in &quot;Phantom&quot; our heroes dismember and &quot;kill&quot; huge hordes of robot soldiers. Lucas seems to be making mass slaughter bloodless and &quot;fun.&quot;<br />This robot carnage is particularly disturbing in connection with the film's rather trivial treatment of the issue of slavery. Although robot troops are killed by the heroes, our two friendly robots (R2-D2 and C-3PO, also seen in the original trilogy) are treated as virtual slaves, even though they seem to be self-aware beings. Although the freeing of human slaves is presented as a relevant (although underdeveloped) issue in the film, no concern seems to be given to the situation of these intelligent artificial life forms. I wonder -- what would Mr. Data from &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; have to say about all this?<br />I noticed one big difference between &quot;Phantom&quot; and the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. The originals always struck me, whatever their flaws, as films for the whole family. &quot;Phantom,&quot; on the other hand, often feels like a film made specifically for kids; it seems like Lucas is taking his adult audience for granted. Too many silly elements mar the film for me. Consider the much-despised &quot;Phantom&quot; character Jar-Jar Binks; although I didn't hate this character as much as some fans, by the end of the film his idiotic antics were really getting on my nerves. Yes, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is an exciting and visually impressive film, but its flaws leave a bad aftertaste.r trivial treatment of the issue of slavery.

B000002H72|5.0|For someone whose early musical roots lie (embarassingly?) in 80's glam rock, hearing the Pixies for the first time really threw me for a loop.  My brother put &quot;Doolittle&quot; on one day and I was like, &quot;Who ARE these guys??!!&quot;  Gone were the gawdy guitar solos, the extended drum fills, and big hair of bands like Poison, Winger (Come on, admit it.  You all liked these guys before, right?), Warrant, etc..., but I LOVED every minute of it!  The album's opener, &quot;Debaser&quot;, was a real revelation to me with it's opening driving bass line introducing the shrieking guitars and chaos that would come in soon after.  The song sounded so frantic and I didn't know what Black Francis was singing about most of the time, but it sounded so right.  &quot;Tame&quot; came next and it just about imploded my brain because it starts off subtly with another driving bass but suddenly explodes with insane guitar stabs and Black Francis's howls of madness.  Song after song kept me riveted to the stereo and soon after, I put away the music I had been listening to and listened only to this album.  The Pixies, with this album especially, really opened my eyes to new kinds of music that didn't involve hair spray, lipstick, and spandex.  It was strange, intelligent, wondrous, and above all original.  Their sound has influenced countless bands (most notably Kurt Cobain and Nirvana who said when they recorded &quot;Nevermind&quot; they were trying to make a Pixies album), but none have come close to their combination of soft to loud aggitated guitars, catchy bass licks, and Black Francis's unique singing style.  Long live the Pixies!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Now, I love O.K. Computer (obviously, I gave the damned thing 5 stars, didn't I? *grins wide*) very very much. My fave Radiohead cd out of all of the one's they've released here in the US. But there were some songs that just didn't, you know, click. \\"Electioneering\\" for one. Then \\"Climbing Up The Walls\\" (and a little bit of mad spinning chaos for \\"Airbag\\", but I still like it). Maybe because these songs were too chaotic for me. Maybe they were too chaotic for the rest of the album (in my opinion anywho) But that didn't spoil my view of the album one bit. Gotta love the lyrics, gotta love the vocals. *smiles*<br />And now, just the song reviews, ma'am. *grins*<br />Airbag: Mad spinning chaos, perfect for entering the bath and running the water (I actually listened to this album for a period of time when I took baths, singing along 'twas fun).<br />Paranoid Android: What got me addicted to this album in the first place. Haunting, especially during the second part, paranoia, power. Gotta love it.<br />Subterranean Homesick Alien: Eerie. Alien. Spooky. Uptight, uptight! Very haunting too. Especially the opening notes and the closing ones.<br />Exit Music (For A Film): Kind of charges up the adrenaline, at least for me. Plot to escape. We hope you choke. Wonderful. Soothing. *smiles*<br />Let Down: Sad. It is very sad, at least for me. You can hear wings fall with this one. Not as loudly as with \\"No Surprises\\" however...<br />Karma Police: The first Radiohead song I ever heard. I spent summers listening to this one. Wonderful track. Wonderful. Frightening end part. Always shook me.<br />Elecioneering: Aaaack. Scary. *shivers*<br />Climbing Up The Walls: Madness. Chaos. Spinny.<br />No Surprises: Feverish depression. Suffocation. Carbon monoxide. No surprises, please...no bad ones anyway.<br />Lucky: I always had this thought that if the song \\"Lucky\\" were a person, they would be an upfront, no bull, truthful and with attitude person with a melancholy twist, blurred groovyviolence.<br />The Tourist: This song saved me from madness at one point. I am honestly saying the truth here. I was ready to crash and burn and this one pulled me from the airplane soaring at a mad thousand feet high.<br />All in all...grand album. Grand. Five stars. No matter the three other songs. No matter. It all makes up one good GOOD album of some of the greatest music humanity has ever made. *smiles*<br />\\"Hey man...slow down...slow down...idiot...slow down...slow down...\\"
1587990717|3.0|I found this book to be interesting, relatively informative, and fun to read.  Taleb's honesty combined with his arrogance make for many amusing anecdotes.  The reader will get an interesting viewpoint of random versus deterministic components of life, but when it comes to explaining his beloved Monte Carlo modeling, he does not inform us that its main limitation is that the inputs often must be guessed.  Even educated guesses sometimes make for unreliable results.<br />In addition, I find that Taleb criticizes scientists without making the distinction between real scientists and those who call themselves scientists and those who the media call scientists.  Real scientists are certainly the more IMprobable to be quoted in our society.  He also seems to equate mathematical modeling with science, and he confuses amplitude and frequency in his example of filtering noise.<br />This book, however, is well written and well worth the read.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore has done an amazing job creating a world in which a person can be immersed in without the aid of visuals.  Having read The Lord of the Rings, I feel, quite vividly, the setting, action, characters, and mood first expressed by Tolkien in this epic tale through the musical score.  The movie to follow has an amazing reputation to live up to, but this soundtrack only confirms the flawless interpretation from book to movie expected by every moviegoer, fan, and hobbit alike.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|I watched this at the movies. I've played all of the Tomb Raider games. The games were new and innovative for their time, even though they became repetitive with each new installment. This movie should be called &quot;Angelina Jolie - Tomb Raider&quot;. I like Angelina Jolie don't get me wrong, but most the production money must have been spent on Angelina Jolie and the FX. Then they picked up some B-rated cheap-o guy to write it. Buy a better movie like one of the Indiana Jones or The Mummy. At least those movies have a better plot.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Original? No, not hardly. Yes, it has been done before, and better. But catchy? Yes. The &quot;hit&quot; everyone apparently knows thanks to overkill play, &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; is indeed very catchy. Admittedly it's a decent song, but yes it does become tiresome, especially when you turn to the rest of the CD looking for variety and instead find 9 songs that all sound the same. Some of the songs are done fairly well, but it really is quite repetative, not to mention wholly unoriginal to begin with. One song I do kind of like, if for no other reason than for it almost sounds different from the others, is the hint-of-country-music-influence trend-following &quot;Good Times Gone.&quot; Even that, though, teeters on the fine line between fun and stupid. All in all, not worth buying in my opinion. Of course, I didn't care much for &quot;The State&quot; either, so if you liked their debut cd, you'll probably like this one too.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is one of the best put together DVD's ever, and, without a doubt the best DVD in my collection (which includes Fight Club, another fine movie and DVD).  The picture and sound are both of the highest quality, but unfortunately I have only a crappy 27 in. TV and no surround sound system.  Therefore, when I watched it over my friend's house (he has surround sound and a nice TV) it was really breathtaking.  <BR>   THE GODFATHER I is, in my personal opinion and the personal opinion of many others, the single best film ever to grace the silver screen.  It also has the highest rewatchability of any movie I have seen and I have seen quite a few.  You all probably know the plot, but for those of you who don't, it is basically about a crime family, the Corleone Family, from New York.  It begins with the now famous Wedding scene where the whole story is set up and characters are introduced.  From there it goes to what probably is business as usual in the Mafia-business deals, various murders, family problems, etc...  It culminates in a wonderful scene that intertwines several murders (I won't say of who for those who don't know)with a baptism (I love how the priest says &quot;Do you reject Satan?&quot; and then as Michael answers yes someone is killed and so on).  I suggest that you watch it with someone else who has already scene it because it may confuse you a little the first time and also it is fun for the other person to explain the parts of the movie.<BR>   THE GODFATHER II is a continuation, of course, of the first Godfather.  It picks up the story about 7 years later and tells the tale of Micheal Corleone running his family in I think the 50's and also of young Vito Corleone (Micheal Corleone's father played by an also young Robert De Niro).  Some people I heard have been slightly turned off by all the Italian and subtitles used in the young Vito parts, but, being Italian and having taken 2 years of the language, I had no problems with it.  Don't worry though, except for the coming to America part, it is filled with all the great action as the 50's era part of the movie.  I love the part where Vito stalks Fanucci and then kills him with the towel wrapped around the gun as an makeshift silencer.  In the 50's part, Micheal Corleone is becoming almost evil in his coldness and ruthlessness, to a point of doing something that I can't ever imagine doing myself.  Al Pacino is in top form in this movie, but I think that John Cazale's performance was even better and should have won an Ocar.  I hate the fact that he always goes unnoticed in reviews of this movie.  The &quot;It ain't what I wanted!!&quot; scene where Micheal disowns Fredo (sorry for giving away a plot point) is perhaps the best example of dramatic acting ever.<BR>   THE GODFATHER III.  There are about a million reviews that pretty much say that this is the worst movie ever.  I disagree.  Yes, Sofia Coppola did not belong in that role (or any important role).  Yes, Joe Mantegna was poorly casted in the role of Joey Zazza (if that's how you spell it) even though he wasn't as bad as Sofia.  Yes, the plot wasn't as good as the first two.  BUT, look what this movie is being compared to.  Two of the best movie ever to come out.  Just because this is a good movie as opposed to a masterpiece like the others doesn't make it bad.  It is not bad.<BR>  The special features are many.  There are several documentaries, many deleted scenes, commentaries on all 3 movies, etc...  The bonus disc will keep you busy for hours after you have already seen the films.  If you like these movies, I suggest that you also see Goodfellas which is in the same vane as this and is also one of the greatest movies ever.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Original? No, not hardly. Yes, it has been done before, and better. But catchy? Yes. The &quot;hit&quot; everyone apparently knows thanks to overkill play, &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; is indeed very catchy. Admittedly it's a decent song, but yes it does become tiresome, especially when you turn to the rest of the CD looking for variety and instead find 9 songs that all sound the same. Some of the songs are done fairly well, but it really is quite repetative, not to mention wholly unoriginal to begin with. One song I do kind of like, if for no other reason than for it almost sounds different from the others, is the hint-of-country-music-influence trend-following &quot;Good Times Gone.&quot; Even that, though, teeters on the fine line between fun and stupid. All in all, not worth buying in my opinion. Of course, I didn't care much for &quot;The State&quot; either, so if you liked their debut cd, you'll probably like this one too.

B00001OH7N|5.0|Bowie is certainly one of the most literate musicians ever to put pen to paper.  For Man Who Sold The World he has written several somewhat related songs, many of which are presented as visions. That is one of the unusual things about this disc is that there is no consistent perspective. Each song is sung by a character in the song and each character gives us his vision. And each vision is very different, some of them quite bleak and dark and all of them uncertain. The visionary is a theme Bowie returns to from time to time but even the visionary is not certain if the vision he has had is true or just a vision of no import, so the world of the record is eerily subjective and relative and uncertain. Bowie has already written lyrics that would be a little disturbing to read, especially if you read each one after the other,  but add to that the music which is a combination of heavy cold metal guitar and odd instrumentation and you have the same effect adding music to a movie has. Everything is deeper and  richer and more evocative and the vision worlds all seem completed. There are some haunting melodies and sounds throughout which create very vivid and moody settings. Metal music alone isn't frightening because usually the lyrics are not that strong, but metal does have power in its chords, here you get the rare combination of a poetic minds words and metals heavy chords combining forces and it is a heavy and heady mix. There is an occasional just for fun rocker thrown in there like &quot;Black Country Rock&quot; but for the most part these songs all sit like Ravens on your windowsill. Many people tried concept albums but this is one of the few that actually deliver something. The oddest thing about this record to me is that he rarely performed any of these songs. He did &quot;Width of a Circle&quot; in the live Ziggy show but it didn't go well with Ziggy material. These songs work best when all heard together. I think this may be my favorite early Bowie record. I think its best not to try and &quot;get&quot; each song but let the atmospheres and suggestiveness of the lyrics and music work their subtle tricks on your imagination each time you play it.nk its best not to try and &quot;get&quot; each song but let the atmospheres and suggestiveness of the lyrics and music work their subtle tricks on your imagination each time you play it.
0345448898|5.0|These books are the best books that I've ever read. They are also the saddest. I cried for two days and still can't get those books out of my mind. The main character of atleast the first book (other big characters are there too) is a girl of about 11 or 12. She's stuck in the middle of this war between worlds (this book's more of a philosiphical book than a fantasy or sci-fi though it's sort of like both of these kinds of books.) I have a friend who read these books too, they're about her favorite ever. If you don't read these books I truely feel sorry for you. You aren't a true human being until you read these books. I am thirteen and it's really hard to get me to like a book. I read at least one or two books every two months and I know I'm a good reader but it's hard to get me to enjoy a book. I loved these books! They're the best books ever, though they will affect you a lot. Beware, they aren't just blah-blah-blah every day books. They're fun, exciting, page turning books also, though. Thanks for reading my review.
0385505833|4.0|John Grisham breaks from his usual genre of mystery and drama to spin a story on the lighter and more humorous side in &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;.<br />Thanksgiving is passed, and the principal characters, Luther and Nora Krank are seeing their daughter, Blair, off at the airport.  She will be spending a year down in Peru as a volunteer in the Peace Corps.  This will mark the first Christmas without their daughter, and both parents are overly remorseful.  Nora especially.  Still, Christmas must go on, and Nora knows she has much planning to do, much to prepare for; and, thinking about all the time she must spend getting everything perfect, she shudders in contempt.<br />On his way to work, Luther passes a travel agency, and goes in for a look.  He is amazed to see all the vacations being promoted.  And when he thinks of the more than six thousand dollars he spent on Christmas last year, it does not take long before he gets up the idea that he and Nora ought to skip Christmas this year to indulge themselves in one of these three thousand dollar cruises.  Further, skipping Christmas means skipping the traffic jams, the crowded malls, the long and endless checkout lines, the price gouging, the parade of charities always hitting him up for donations ... and, think of the money saved!  Luther is sold.  But, will his wife be also?<br />Nora is more than apprehensive at first.  She is outraged he would even bring the subject up.  It's unconventional, untraditional.  Buddhists don't celebrate Christmas.  Neither do Hindus.  Nor Jews.  The Kranks are none of those, and they DO celebrate Christmas.  However, after some persuasion about the time and aggrivation which the holiday always brings, Nora begins to weaken.  And the brochures Luther shows to her is simply too much.  She finally agrees.  They will skip Christmas this year.  Every thing is settled.  The plans are made.  What could possibly go wrong?<br />Well, little things do begin happening, quite suddenly.  For instance, when the owner of a card and stationary store, The Pumpkin Seed, calls Nora asking her when she will order her Christmas cards, she explains to him she will not be buying cards this year.  The man is literaly shocked, and more than annoyed she will not tell him why.<br />Another instance is when the boyscouts come to the Kranks home.  It is a tradition that each year the Kranks but a Christmas tree from the boyscouts.  So, when the leader confronts Luther at the door, and tells him he has his tree waiting for him, he too is put in shock when Luther tells him they will not be buying a Christmas tree this year.  He and his troop trudge away, bewildered, and suspicious.<br />Other little things occur as well, and soon the entire town is abuzz, and talking, and wondering just what is going on with the Kranks.  Nosey neighbors begin spying on their home.  While they are putting up Christmas lights, decorating their trees, busily preparing for the christmas holiday, the Kranks are not.  It all seems rather curious.  The Kranks can't be left alone for two minutes without someone coming up to them, or calling them, and asking what is going on.<br />The final straw comes with the Frosty The Snowman display.  Each year it is a custom, but more at mandatory, to set up a Frosty display atop ones roof.  A prize is handed down for the best decorated street, and Hemlock, the Kranks street, is used to winning.  So, while all the other neighbors, save one, labor to install Frosty, it is becoming apparently obvious the Kranks are neglecting their duty to the town.  Growing concerns arise, and as the neighbors suspions grow, Luther and Nora are forced to hide out in their own home, fearing what the people would think of them if they ever found out they were skipping Christmas.<br />And yet, things only get worse for the Kranks.  Their best laid plans are falling apart as suspicions mount.  The people are becoming more on edge, more tense, especially those used to profitting off the Kranks during the Christmas season.  It's all the town can stand; all these little things which don't add up, which don't make sense.  The town must know once and for all just what is going on which the Kranks.<br />Will Luther have the strength to confront the town and tell them the truth?  How will the town respond?  Will Luther and Nora Krank take their ten day cruise?  What else can possibly go wrong for the Kranks that hasn't already?<br />&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a delightful story, filled with a kind of humor we are not used to seeing from John Grisham; and, as well, a kind of insight into the human mind.

0385505833|2.0|In my opinion, most of the charactars and situations were not believable. Nora Krank is too nasty to Luther to have you believe they have a happy marriage. Personally, if I were Luther and she treated me the way she treats him,, I would visit a lawyer rather than take her on a Cruise. The premise is great, but the story was dissapointing.
B000002VCU|5.0|I've been listening to APP since I was 6 yrs old (I'm now 30).  This is the first album I listened to (thanks to my older brothers) and it is what I use to judge everything else (an awfully high expectation).  If I had to choose one album to take to a deserted island, this is it.
1558216847|5.0|I literally could not put this book down once I picked it up.  I read it cover-to-cover in one sitting.  I also recommend Dorit Whiteman's recent book, Escape Via Siberia, which also tells an against-all-odds WW II survival story but provides a richer historical context.
0684800713|3.0|This was a well detailed plot, another by Ernest Hemmingway.  The simplicity shone through and caused the novel to loose some of its romantic charm.  Though in theory a romantic novel it is lost in the groups escapdes with different individuals.  A truly depressing tale told by Jake, the nararator, is a twist through his strugle to find his masculinity while on his wilderness excursions.  To read this book one must have a stout stomach and enjoy the unexpected.
B00005B6N7|1.0|This unsubtle attempt by Americans to claim credit for capturing the Enigma machine, probably the single most important event in the war, is frightening. I could talk about the bad acting and directing, but those aspects of the film pale in comparison to the enormous insult to the memory of those who actually performed this feat and those who worked on project Ultra. Anyone who cares about history will be disgusted that with the war over for only fifty five years, those who would like to rewrite the history books are already gaining credibility in Hollywood.
B00003CXXI|3.0|The characters are so amazingly realistic they could be almost live-action, especially Princess Fiona. But I feel sad for her fate as well as Shrek's. In the very beginning, Shrek was a HAPPY loner who enjoyed leading his solitary life out in the swamp and Princess Fiona was such a cool, self-confident young woman who could do some dazzling ninja stunts. But they both SUDDENLY begin needing love and a domestic life together and there was that pesky old donkey to push it along. What's more, the poor girl suddenly turns into a P-E-R-F-E-C-T wifey for the dirty, crass, and disgusting ogre who eats fecal matter and human eyeballs! What's more...once a beautiful young human lady who can look out for herself, Fiona is now a dowdy old trollop with weight and self-esteem problems. And...and she's also destined to carry bratty little Shreks of her own.....*shudder* So please, ENOUGH of the Disneyesque politically-correct happy-family sentimentality that NO ONE can lead a happily single life without the need to be flattered and fawned over despite your ugly, frowsy appearance! Sheesh.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Pablo Honey was pretty weak<BR>The Bends was brilliant<BR>OK Computer was mind blowing<br />Now you're left with Kid A and Amnesiac.  After OK Computer, fans were left wondering how could they follow this up?  You have a group of people who will praise anything they do.  You have a group of people who love to criticize, saying they're just trying to be weird.  But take a step back from the initial response and really give these discs a good listen.  Kid A flows beautifully and really shouldn't be broken down track by track.  Amnesiac, while still a 4 star album in my book, does not have the flow that Kid A did.  But one must understand, this is basically a b-sides collection.  If you break it down track by track, the songs are more structured than Kid A.  Every song is great with a few exceptions.  &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; was a track a initially disliked, but it's hypnotic pounding grew on me.  &quot;Morning Bell&quot; is good, but this interpretation is a disapointment compared to it's counterpart on Kid A.  Finally, &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; is the &quot;Treefingers&quot; of this album.  Really just filler with no ultimate purpose that I can see.  But in my mind, with these exceptions, every other track should be viewed on it's own (as opposed to a whole like Kid A), and each is wonderful solid Radiohead.<br />Also, if you look at this from the bands perspective, it is a huge responsibility to follow up what has been perceived as one of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time (VH1).  To follow with something equally musically diverse as OK Computer, but keeping it fresh and original is no small task.  Radiohead pulled it off brilliantly with Kid A and Amnesiac.  The proof is in the increased fan support (35,000 + saw them live in Chicago)

0440219078|1.0|The title of this book is The Giver by Lois Lowry. I think that this book was written for younger kids because I'm 15 years old and I did not like it at all.<br />This book is about a kid that lives in some society that is made up. The kid is waiting to turn 12 for this special meeting, to go see the giver. So he sees the giver and runs away.<BR>I do not read many books unless I am forced to read them for school. And this book is different then the other 2 books I remember reading because, it is a whole different type of book.<br />I did not like this book at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone even if it is there grade level because it puts false thoughts in people's heads. This is what I think and nothing is going to change that.
B00005ATQC|5.0|This is an interesting, intriguing movie.<br />It is not meant for chidren, not so much for its language, nudity or exotic (and sometimes bizarre) sex scenes, rather it is an adult film that stars adults, concerns itself with adult situations and problems, and is meant for adults.<br />As such, I recommend it for adults looking for an adult experience at the movie theater.

B000000WA4|5.0|While there is certainly a LOT of music on this brilliant double CD and 28 tracks spread out over almost 3 hours is a lot for the average listener to digest and absorb in one sitting, given the proper time and attention, &quot;Mellon Collie...&quot; is an extremely rewarding listen. While not every song here is first-rate, the sheer breadth of the material and the reckless bravery of the band makes it all worth hearing. From the light, plaintive piano playing of the title cut, to the walloping rhythm section and James Iha and Billy Corgan's slashing power chords on &quot;Zero&quot;, Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot; and &quot;Here Is No Why&quot;, the album never loses momentum. Even slower numbers (&quot;Tonight Tonight&quot;, &quot;To Forgive&quot;) have a surging power to them, they're gentle and beautiful, but not wispy.<br />Disc 2 is full of winners as well (out of it's 14 tracks, &quot;1979&quot; may be the most well known, but my personal faves are &quot;Thirty Three&quot; and &quot;Tales of A Scorched Earth&quot;). Mesmerizing.<br />This seminal release is a must own for any serious rock collection. A Classic.
B00003CWN2|3.0|I had found the movie a bit boring and Hillary Swank didn't fool me at all about being a boy.  Maybe it's coz I have seen her before on tv as a girl and I could not think of her as a guy.  I didn't thought she looklike a guy.  The movie is only base on the time she was in Falls City, when she meets Lana Teisdel, her friends and when she was rape and murder.  I had wish to see more about Teena life before, about her family.  I don't think this movie tell the real story of Teena Brandon, it was more fiction then anything.  It's not a bad movie but it's not also a good one!
0767853636|5.0|I don't know why everyone is so down on this movie. I understand that if you've seen the original play and then the movie(which deviated greatly) that some disappointment is to be expected, but come on!  Despite the differences, &quot;Annie&quot; the movie is still a great movie and the plot line is very apparent. A millionaire invites an orphan to his home as a publicity stunt and endsup falling in love with the little girl, wanting her as his own daughter, but she's never forgotten the parents who left her behind at the orphanage.  Anyone could see it's a simple plot, but a good one.  And as for Miss Hannigan; I felt that when she saved Annie from her brother, she was redeemed and that's why she was on the elephant.<BR>I've seen the Disney version of &quot;Annie&quot; and I couldn't get the same warm feeling that I got from &quot;Annie&quot; the movie.  Perhaps because I saw the '82 movie as a child or perhaps because I've never seen the play.  Whatever the reason, &quot;Annie&quot; is the tops!
B000002BUY|5.0|Like the title of my review suggests, this quite possibly be the best album I have ever heard. When, not if you purchase this album, you are going to get the complete packedge. Nothing is taken for granted and I was taken completely by suprise in this their first offering. Normally, a band takes 1 or 2 albums to get it right, but Incubus raises the bar for everyone else with this outstanding offering.<BR>THE GOOD: 1) SLICK PRODUCTION: Like I said before, nothing is taken for granted here. From recording to production, the entire team seem to be on the same page. Everything is smooth and the music reflects that. Nice job team!<BR>2) SONGS: Everyone is a classic. From &quot; Vitamin&quot; to &quot;Summer Romance&quot; there is something for every fan on this album. If you like the hard stuff, then the opening 2 tracks will please you completely. If you like the smooth stuff, check out the end tracks. If you like the funky stuff, then the middle is for you. This album is diffently made to please and transcends all genre's. <BR>3) BRANDON: This guy is in a league by himself here. From his vocal range, which is completely amazing, to his song writing ability this guy can do it all. The rest of the band complements him very well and there seems to be great chemistry between them. He might very well be the best, young talent out there today and will certainly propell this band into the super star catagorie.<BR>THE BAD: 1) INSERTS: there are a few inserts of songs that do not make sense and hurt the flow of the album. I understand that they are a throw back to the younger days of the band but, no pun intended, shed your skin here guys.<BR>   You will not be sorry with this purchase and this album is one of the top 5 of the year. It seems with the release of the second album on the horizion, everyone is now saying &quot;Incubus who?&quot; Don't miss the boat on this album it is a &quot;must have&quot; for any collection.
0380817683|3.0|Maybe I'm just in the wrong age group to read and appreciate these young-single-aimless-girl novels like BJ's DIARY and now RACHEL'S HOLIDAY. The books themselves are well written and interesting, but the lives they portray are sometimes irresponsible and often irritating as well as descriptive of lost souls. When Marian Keyes writes about Rachel's childhood events, it's like I'm right there with her. I can feel the heart pounding and suspense over whether Rachel will pull off her candy caper. Keyes also writes Rachel as a middle child very well. There are traits that go with that position inside a family, and I think Keyes knows that position well enough to be right on target with her description of it. But that kind of insight doesn't answer, for me anyway, how Rachel ends up botching a suicide attempt, and why she approaches her &quot;holiday&quot; recuperation the way she does. I also question Rachel's perception of her mother. Rachel and her siblings all lived together from the birth of each one, so it seems farfetched for me to believe that Rachel could have missed her mother's treatment of her other siblings so completely that she blocked out all but her own experience. All this means is that this book needs some clarification here and there. It's still a good book, and I would read Keyes' work again based on the writing she displayed in RH.
B000001FI7|5.0|I suspect many musicians around the world wish they would of wrote or was part of this album.  They were not the first to do this kind of thing but they were the first to do it so well that everyone had to stop what they were doing and notice.  If its not a part of your music rotation it should be.
0385505833|5.0|I was so excited to read this book. I was really looking for a light hearted book to read in a short period of time and found it. I think Grisham did a wonderful job of picking out just what we would all like to do instead of going through all the Christmas mess. I love Christmas, but hate the shopping and everything else that goes with it. I recommended this to all my friends because it just so perfect for this time of year.<br />As I was reading this book, I was really picturing this on my TV screen and hope to see it turn into a TV movie at some point. It would really be a lot of fun.

I was just about 3 yrs. old and had heard the story so many times, I could say it word for word by memory.  During the years while moving, the book was lost.  I always wondered what happened to my book. In 1975, after I had children I wrote a letter to Golden Books to see if I could get a copy, but they couldn't help me.  About 6 yrs. ago, my sister-in-law was at a flea market and found a copy for me.  I now read it to my grand daughter.  I still enjoy the book, and love the illustrations.

044100590X|5.0|This book is simply amazing. The storyline itself is interesting and somewhat easy to follow, but beneath it all, is the deep politics of Dune that function on so many  levels. Impossible to grasp it all on your first read, but so beautifally written, I couldn't put it down. It has wonderful ideas within it, my favorite of which I still recite to this day when I am afraid. \\"I must not fear, fear is the mindkiller...\\" For any reader, particularly sci-fi lovers, but as I see it, it appeals to all. Not an easy read, but very rewarding in all aspects. A must! <BR>
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Flat out, Fiona Apple is my idol, a songstress of unmatched talent, my musical messiah.  I discovered her about two years ago, seeing as how when she first came out in '96' I was 14 and into the usual pop/rap scene.  Since then, I've become more selective, a little older and a little wiser and I've learned to appreciate good music when I hear it.  <br />I kept hearing things about her and how she was such a creative lyricist so I dl'd a few songs from &quot;Tidal&quot; and a few songs from &quot;When The Pawn&quot;. I admit, Tidal was more accesible to me at first, I instantly liked 'Sleep To Dream', 'Sullen Girl', 'Shadow Boxer' and of course the hit song 'Criminal'.  In my opinion, &quot;When The Pawn&quot; is much more challenging music, much more difficult to understand.  But it is by far the more superior album.  This is the one I have grown to love.  <br />Highlights on the album would have to include 'On The Bound' (my personal favorite track, which suggests fun times in the title but the song is really about being totally unsure of everything in your future except the one person you insist you must have in your life at all costs on you will certainly lose your sanity; I also like this because Fi wails with such passion, it's like you can actually feel her shaking), 'To Your Love' ( sort of James Bond feel, plus I love the lyrics of the first verse) 'Paper Bag' (a classic piano ditty on speed about obsession and which features Fi at her best lyrically), and 'The Way Things Are' (a song about believeing that you cause nothing but trouble for other people and you are better left to your own devices).  Other favorites include 'A Mistake' and 'I Know'.  But there are no weak tracks here.  <br />My only qualm is she takes such a long break between albums and only gives us ten tracks.  Here's to an album by summer of 2002 and fifteen tracks!  But however long it takes, I will be grateful because she doesn't have to produce any music. This album changed my soul, theway I judge good music and the way I write.  It really is a treasure.

Jem and Scout pass the time playing with their friend Dill and trying to persuade the local recluse, Boo Radley, to come out so they can see him.<br />When a black man is accused of raping a white woman, Atticus is given the case -- he is the only lawyer who will make even a cursory attempt to defend the man, who is obviously innocent. He and his children are ridiculed and even threatened, but he uses the situation to teach Jem and Scout about justice and the unimportance of race.
B00000D9TK|5.0|I have only been a fan of Celine Dion's music for a few years now, (as I used to think her music was too sappy), but her vocal skills are amazing and she has become a favorite of mine. This CD is one of her best. Celine has also composed the best Christmas CD on earth - \\"These Are Special Times\\". Even if you aren't familiar with Celine's music you owe it to yourself to buy this CD.
