B0092MCQZ4|5|My daughter loves this iron.  It gives her such pretty curls.
B00FZ29ICO|5|I saw a frend se one of these for her son who had a cold.. I bought one for flu season, as I do not take flu shots.. this.. used with the proper essential oils.. has kept my family well all season.. AND.... the colors are very cool to watch too! ;)
B00GTK90R4|5|Great Eyelash curler!!!
B0015NZ6FK|5|I recently purchased this for my girlfriend and she loves it!  She is a very light sleeper and has tried numerous masks in the past.  Some have worked well, but this is, by far, her favorite.  It is puffy and soft, and wraps around the ears as well, blocking some noise and keeping earbuds in.  I highly recommend this to all sensitive sleepers out there!
B002GENWU8|5|crazy good! I put it on my tips to have blonde tips, note that my hair is close to jet black, once you put it in your hair, you can almost see it changing black to blonde, and I left it on my hair for about 15 minutes or whatever it said on the box, and I showered right after that, and what do you know, right when I dried my hair, it was blonde!! the only downside is that it comes w a very llttle amount of product, I barely had enough for my tips, so a box will definitely not do if you are planning on doing your whole hair. but it definitely wont damage your hair, the way other dyeing products would. its much calmer with a heavier result. The product is amazing, I will definitely keep coming back.
B00R1WOYC0|5|Just arrived and I was dying to try it....it is amazing!! My skins feels great!
B004BQXPF6|5|Aquage Biomega Moisture Conditioner works so well to moisten and calm my hair.  I am caucasion and have thick, long hair that is course with a lot of body. Without this product on my hair I do not have the control I need. It smoothes and calms my hair and cuts down on styling time.
B0051UOTBK|1|the item seams to be good but they forgot one of the clips. I will let you know how they handle the problem
B00G4I2VL8|5|Perfect! Love it!
B004C6DTZ6|5|Nice and heavy. Good for beginners. Makes you more conscious of not applying a lot of pressure.
B00GYS68BC|5|Very pretty
B00LZ60Z26|5|The hold lasts all day while still keeping your hair malleable. Gives a sweet texture to your hair to give it more dimension, more lines and detail while still looking smooth. Gives your hair a very slight shine.Smells good: like pine; the smell will diminish after your hair dries.<br />This is not for people that want max hold. That being said, best stuff I've ever used. I buy a jar every other month. It's also hand made in Tennessee.
B0049LUI9O|4|works like a dream
B0035LCSKQ|4|Ok, synthetic hair but for the price it's doing the job, my first use of the face brush and some hair came off but still decided to keep it for further treatments , cuz the price is so good:)
B001ET76EY|5|Perfect!
B001ABLKK2|1|Consistency was like watered down jello.  A complete waste of money... no better than plain water.
B00IBEZIXQ|5|This brush is great! My 6 year old is constantly complaining when I brush her hair. We tried this detangling brush and it worked great! We tried it with dry hair, I'm going to try it on wet hair in the morning. She was excited when I ordered this brush and after using it she said it makes a huge difference. So it passes my 6 year olds test!
B0000535UM|2|Not impressed at all. It doesn't give my hair that clean feeling. Doesn't foam well and too pricey for such a small bottle.
B007ROD3AG|4|I wish I had gotten one if these years ago!!! I can sit in a chair and watch tv while my hair is drying. The motor is quiet. I know what I'm getting my daughter for Christmas!! It was very easy to assemble and operate.
B00F7QDK36|5|Works well
B000GGHRYK|5|After exhaustive cross comparisons I believe Plackers are the best out there by far.  Seems like most brands I get through half my teeth and the string breaks!  Plackers I will admit I use several times.  I know some people will say thats gross but I use it and throw it on my desk or in my dash and keep using it for days till I just throw it out but honestly i could use it a million more times I bet!  because the plastic is so tough it does not make the best toothpick on the other end but I have good toothpicks but  great flosser is hard to find and this is it.
B0013VY4AM|3|I prefer Paul Mitchell skinny serum. This product doesn't feel like it penetrates as deep which says a lot bc what I like most about the skinny serum is how light it is. Definitely feels like a very superficial, light, not lasting shine effect and nothing more than that. If that's what I was looking for I could get my $4 silicone spray from the kinky hair section at Walmart
B001GV2P3C|5|Crew makes an awesome product I use this with a pre shave lotion and my straight razor just glides, couldn't be happier.
B003BQ5B0E|5|My hair stylist recommended this product to me to help me with frizz after a shower.  I love it!  This product works wonders!  I don't blow dry my hair.  I let it air dry and it still works.  It doesn't keep my hair straight, it just contains the frizz which is all I wanted.  :)  If you hate frizzy hair, this product is for you!
B00JMI33BO|5|This stuff has changed my life when it comes to my teeth and gums. A friend of mine turned me on to this and I was a little skeptical when I first started using it but I am a believer now. My  teeth are more healthy and solid than they ever have been in my adult life. My gums use to gush when I flossed or brushed hard, now I barely see any blood. I had a sore spot that would really  feel hot and cold if I didn't use sensodyne. It's now like I never even had that. The taste is average at best but a little mouth wash after I brush and I am good. I have even noticed that that plaque build up behind my front teeth.. you know that spot the dentist usually goes out really good, feels like I have no build up at all.  Two things will happen when you start to use this. Your teeth will get really slick, and for about a week or longer your teeth will get really sensitive, but once you get through that stage they feel great. I am a believer now.  Also a little goes a long way, the flakes are kind of big so just break it down put in on the tooth brush and you are ready to soap up and get a good brush. I found for me that an old fashion tooth brush worked better than my nice electric.  I will be using this stuff forever.
B001DO0JYE|5|My hair doesn't know what it wants to be: not quite straight, not quite curly. One of my favorite looks is the wind-blown sea-water dried look after I've been to the beach. I'd heard that there were products out there that simulated this effect, and I decided to purchase this one to see if it did the trick.  It sure did: my hair got nice fat waves, nicely defined without being crunchy. It's definitely wavier than if I let my hair dry without the product. And if I put a small amount of texturizing paste on my hands and dust the ends of my hair with it after using this product and diffusing, the result is really amazing.  I'm a little confused why people are so worked up about the smell... I didn't find it very strong, and honestly don't notice it at all once it's dry.
B006WVCDVU|3|I bought this dye aiming for a light to medium brown hair color and I saw the box said \\"Medium Amber brown,\\" so I tried it. I always think red tones are pretty. However I just finished my hair and there is NOTHING brown about it. It turned out a washed out red color. I always try to make my reviews good and don't talk bad about products but I am kind of disappointed :( Now I'll have to dye my hair again soon because it didn't even cover all my dark blonde. (And yes I did the foam right!)
B000V8BL0Y|5|This product is next to impossible to find in the US so getting it here is a blessing.No other product keeps oue hair styled yet doesn't make our scalps itch or my wife's flake. We love to find a company and service that treats us with respect, protects the items for shipping and gets them here as quickly as possible. We will continue to order from this company and to use the Osis shape wax. It is truly the best product for shine, hold, style and cleanliness of any products on the market to date.
B000HS6O64|5|Sorry for the pun, but when they're that easy I figure it's a command from On High.  I've had this thing about a month. Mostly, I agree with prior posts. I like it for hair, beard, and scalp. It's invigorating to give my head a quick massage in the morning, almost like splashing water in my face. The brush looked a little clumsy to me, but grip and control are good (I, also, have large hands).  I wanted some stiffness in the brush, but didn't know how much. I'd have to say it's 'bout perfect in that regard, because you can adjust it from painful stab thru smooth glide by changing the angle of attack of your stroke.  I have noticed a few bristles on my t-shirt. I don't if that's a concern or normal, but I'll let y'all know if it becomes a problem.  ---edit 11 Jan 2014--- The brush is still doing fine.  ---EDIT 16 Jan 2016--- Still doing fine
B00HDPM7Q0|1|Box was severely damaged when received. Product seemed to be okay. Used it once and expected it to work well for gel polish but the product did not have the quality I expected. Hopeful for an easy return process.
B0064FMPUS|1|Not work ..do not purchase this item
B005ML8VXA|2|Even though this product has natural ingredients that is beneficial for the hair, it is a bit too oily for me. However, I may try using it as a sealant after moisturizing.
B005PR0KH6|2|This perfume had gone bad and smells awful.  Obviously will not be using it.  Cannot blame the seller as the bottle was sealed and there would be no way to tell.
B005MXCHHO|5|Great
B00012NNBK|5|As I stated with the lotion, this is a good product to use if you have dry skin!!!<br /><br />This product was recommended by my podiatrist of all people!!
B0054LHI5A|5|It's so helpful!
B0046MK34G|5|Ok
B003NRYG4S|5|Terrific product
B00IY2DW10|5|Packed well
B00QXIDW2G|5|I purchased this product because my beard gets brittle at a certain length and I was hoping this would condition it and allow it to grow longer.  The product comes well packaged in a burlap pouch, and has a very manly feel.  The good news, is that this product works exactly as designed.  The bad news, is that it has been usurped by my 18 year old...I will be getting another bottle for myself!
B002UEGTUE|5|Love it the very best
B0050HO9MI|5|When I recently decided to give safety razors another shot after several years of living with a beard, I was looking to ease back into the process with an inexpensive product.  To be honest, I didn't have the highest expectations given the price point, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  This razor is a good size and feels very comfortable and solid in my hand.  It has just enough weight to give the blade good contact with my skin without the need to apply additional pressure (a real failing of multiple blade modern razors that leads to irritation and cuts).  The safety guard appears and feels to have an appropriate length and orientation, and the fittings definitely produce the proper angle on the blade itself to give a nice, close shave.  After nearly a month of using the razor, I've not cut or irritated myself once.  Shaving has become a pleasure again thanks in large part to this inexpensive, but quality razor.
B003OELYFO|5|I am surprised at how well this product works to fill in the bald spots and make my hair look thicker.
B004CCU9K8|4|Great curler love that it heats up and does a great job. Had the same model and lost it when my bag was stolen. No other model was anywhere near as good
B00AI0W3VQ|5|I use this everyday over a light moisturizer and add a touch of primer.  It covers well including some dark spots and redness.  I add  blush, lip gloss, eyeliner  and eyebrow pencil and I am good to go for the day.  If I am going out in the evening I will add a bit of powder to set everything and except for the lip gloss it all stays very well without the heaviness of foundation.  I am in my 60's so this is BB cream does a lot.
B004NESVZU|4|I love this oil for holding down flyaway hair pieces.  It also is great for shine and softness if you have dry hair.  I only have to use a drop or two so even though it is an expensive product it lasts a long time.
B002CVTVVY|4|After reading reviews on Consumer Reports and Amazon, I am confused about replacing my old e series Sonicare.  It has been pooping out lately and when I changed the brush head this morning, it failed to work.  Even when I switched back to the old brush head.  So I was checking out replacements online, bothered though that I still have two brand new brush heads for the e series.  After reading all the back and forth, I pulled out my old brush and gave it a careful cleaning underneath the brush head--and it now works!  I'm going to keep it until it fails or I've used up my brush heads and then see if there is more clarity about what kind to replace it with.  Thanks everyone for all the info.  The 4 stars is for my old Sonicare brush.
B000CECSAO|4|I like OPI nail polishes.  I thought this would be much more opaque than it is....I was going by the photo in the ad.<br />It is quite sheer.
B006YPWORW|5|I am a crazy person when it comes to my oral hygiene so when I found out about these I just had to try them. They get all the leftover tongue goop that your toothbrush leaves behind. This works 10x better than the back of any toothbrush that comes with a tongue scrubber.
B003983I1S|5|I used this Fusion ProGlide Styler from a program run by Gillette. These blades give me a smooth and precise shave. I will never use any other blades for my styler or razor. Gillette is the best brand I have ever used.
B0023XF60Q|3|I have been wet shaving for about 14 months. Here are my pros & cons:<br /><br />Pros<br />Inexpensive<br />Does provide a decent shave<br />Its cheap enough to at least try out for those still experimenting<br /><br />Cons<br />Tends to waterproof - wet shavers need to be careful<br />Not that silky smooth razor glide<br />Oil and soap/creme mixture will quickly clog DE razor crevice - rinse often<br />Its oil - you may have to re-clean your hands and face pores if your skin clogs easily
B000LNG1RC|5|This soap is the same one I have bought for years whenever I was visiting the UK.  It's formulated so it doesn't dry out the skin as do most soaps.  Nor does it irritate skin with stinky perfumes.  Recently I tried Oilatum under the same name and brand but from a Hong Kong retailer.  It was absolutely a different disgusting soap.  Stank of cheap scent.  The ingredients were totally different.  I threw all the bars in the bin.  Only buy it from the UK.  I wonder if Stiefel Labs is aware this HK retailer is selling a version of their soap that is not the original Oilatum.  Buyer beware!
B00FRMH9OQ|5|I tried the silicone sheets and those didn't work, but this I noticed a difference right away and so did my husband.
B0027VCNGO|5|excellent!!
B009GIOVKW|2|I got this because I think skin exfoliating system is definitely useful to shed off some dead skin layers and keep my healthy skin glow. I didn't really care which brand because exfoliation happens with any frictional motion on your skin - with either rotating or vibrating brushes.. so I decided to go with something more economical. I kind of regret not buying a different brush system because there's something wrong about this brush's rotating system (see below for detailed explanations). I give 2 stars because only brush that's useful is a gentle facial brush (normal facial brush is too harsh) and I will not recommend this to others.<br /><br />I might be terrible at explaining here but if you post a reply to request further explanations, I will to provide any information as detail as possible. I will also update to fix my review to clarify anything that's important for this review.<br /><br />There are cons and pros about this brush (some physics terms included):<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Decent price<br />This electric brush has a nice design (adequate size, nice colors etc) for it's price.<br /><br />2) a body brush and and a pumice stone are also included<br /><br />3) AA battery included - don't need to charge and don't need to worry about  losing a charger (that happened to a friend who owned a clarisonic brush system)<br /><br />4) facial skin feels so good! - I use make up removing oil to dissolve foundation and sunscreen on my face, then I use this brush system + cleansing form to completely clean my face. My skin feels very smooth so I think it's working well.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) facial brush<br /><br />  A. First time users - Start with a facial brush for sensitive skin type. My skin was red and kind of itching even though I tried with a soft facial skin brush first day. I didn't rub my skin with the brush hard so I guess it's because it was my first time..?? make sure you use it really gently if it's your first time. Also make sure it's wet enough and you added soap too.<br /><br />  B. Use a hairband and be careful not to touch your hair with the rotating disk so it doesn't pull your hair. Because the outer disk has a high rotational velocity, it will pull your hair in and you will see your hair being rolled into the motor part of the brush system. That happened to be once even though I used a hair band..<br /><br />2) Body brush<br /><br />It starts okay if you brush skin that's easy to reach. I had no problem with using it for my thighs, knee, abdomen and neck area. Body brush will not work very well for your back and non-flat area (armpit or back of your knee)  because the body brush's diameter is much larger than a normal facial brush so it creates a larger rotational velocity on the outermost brush part. If you look very closely, the center of the brush doesn't do exfoliating action much because it rotates on the same spot (therefore no force - DO NOT put your facial cleansing foam/body cleanser/soap on the center of the disk because bubbles will not form = no cleansing!). So you have to run your brush on your skin to make sure you exfoliate your skin evenly. When I tried to brush my back with the body brush disk attached to the system, it was really hard because I couldn't apply the brush disk parallel to my skin surface (who is so super flexible when trying to reach their own back?). I couldn't control the rotating speed (only one speed available) so the torque coming from the outermost part of the rotating disk prevented me from guiding the brush to the region of my skin that I wanted to exfoliate.. The disk was bouncing off my skin surface, not exfoliating. Of course I tried to press the disk down on my skin surface, but the friction got too strong and it started hurting me.<br /><br />The idea is good, but the brush disk should not be larger than a facial brush or it is hard to control..<br /><br />3) Pumice stone disk<br /><br />To use this, I would turn off the brush system, and just use thepumice stone manually to rub the disk on callus on my wet feet. The disk will not rotate on your feet properly even if you turn on the brush system. Because the frictional force is larger than (pumice is rough.. so is your callus) your disk's rotating force (and pumice disk is tiny). It will not work well at all on your thick dead skin layers on your heel (because callus on your heel is not flat and it's rough). I tried to use it several times with the rotating pumice stone but I had no luck. I don't think it's because I'm clumsy. I think using a normal pumice stone on a stick works much better....<br /><br />Too long, didn't read?? Read below:<br /><br />Overall, I think it is good enough for the facial skin cleansing (make sure the disk is wet and don't apply your soap right on the center of the disk where the rotational force is nearly 0), but its rotating system has some fundamental issues so it's not really good for a big brush disk or a pumice disk which generates more frictional force. If you want to use it for your body, use the normal (not soft brush for sensitive skin) facial brush to brush your body for curved body area or your back. For the pumice stone disk... eh turn the system off and rub it on your feet manually.. I might update this review if needed.<br /><br />*I'm curious to know the rotating brush system's rpm as it feels slow.. I used a new set of batteries so there might be a possibility that I received a defective one.*pumice stone manually to rub the disk on callus on my wet feet.

B00HLZI3R4|5|Affordable, easy to use and creates longer/thicker eyelashes. This is my new favorite!
B002HWS7UY|5|Although the cape is rather cheap, it is made with strong material that should last a long time. I am very happy with it.
B00HNSSAQ8|5|I've always been using this foundation it works great its easy on with no damage
B001RQLU8M|5|I've used this product for years, along with the shine serum.  This is a great finishing spray after styling your hair.  It gives a great shine and softness.  Great smelling too
B0038TVHGG|5|I used to suffer from dry, frizzy hair until I found this product and its coinciding conditioner at my local drugstore. Shea Moisture products are always cheaper at Target or your local drugstores so be sure to look there before buying on Amazon.<br /><br />This shampoo immediately makes my hair feel so soft and I love the way I can control my hair after using. The smell is very easy to get used to and the shampoo does add a little bit of volume to my hair. I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner.
B00JFSET0A|3|My one major problem with this product is the smell. It smells awful!<br />It has a very chemical smell that I can not get rid of. I have shampooed the piece, sprayed it with perfume and left it outside overnight but nothing will get rid of it.<br />Also I know that the description says Black to Green but the image shows a deep teal to light teal and the product itself is definitely black to bright blue.<br /><br />Not my favorite product but definitely not terrible. I would probably buy another if it didn't smell so horrific.
979077530X|1|love the cologne but was very disappointed it was not a spray so I will have to use more and wont last so long
B00GNA9W5A|5|I have very fine hair and many brushes won't grab it well once it's dry. This I can use as a brush or to remove bumps with the dryer when I wake up with bed head!
B002UIZE8I|1|not at all like the former REAL polo sprays i've bought.  no box; no problem.  smelled like cheap/shelf-life expired aftershave poured into a dirty ash tray; big problem. this is first negative review i felt compelled to write.  a sad waste of my money.
B0016AJAA4|1|Difficult to use. Ever harder from one eye to the other (You would have to use your left hand for your left eye otherwise you cannot see what you are doing). Save your precious cornea! Just came back from doctors office. The surface of my cornea is torn in flaps and may take weeks or years to heal. I'm trowing mine in the trash as we speak. Should have thrown it away the first time I poked my self. This company should be sued. Then again I was s$#@*d enough to use needles close to my eyes, what was I thinking? I might as well have used the tip of a knife to separate lashes.
B00JTPI496|1|without result
B00BC38TWK|5|I love OPI, I've tried other brands, some more costly, some from the drugstore, and it just seems to wear better.  I seem to be obsessed with blue and purple shades... I usually wear five different colors at once so keep changing them every season, OPI.
B000050FDQ|5|I have used corded shavers for 20 years.  The rechargeable ones never seemed to have the same power as the corded models.  When my last remington died, I gave this model a try.  It works exceptionally well easily matching the power of any of my corded razors.  While there are alwasy a few stray hairs that you have to touch up with a razor with any electric shaver, this Braun dramatically limits the amount of touch up necessary to where most days I don't bother.  The cleaner, while it appears gimmicky, is really nice.  It does a great job and leaves a nice smell on the razor.  You also don't need to use it every day.  Battery life is also very good.  I'm averaging about three weeks between charges.    Update:2010 still using the same shaver.  Unbelievable.  I have to hand it to Braun.  I have never had a shaver last 7 years.  Still going strong and am still very happy with it.
B00CWZ0BLE|5|This was just what I expected it to be. No frills but it definitely get the job done. I will be purchasing another.
B000LUXO5C|5|I have very dry skin and usually develop rashes and blotches if I use any lotion with a bit of perfume. My daughter gave me a small container of Camille Beckman Glycerine Rosewater and it worked magnificently for me. I couldn't find it anywhere and someone told me to try Amazon! I am now buying the 32oz refill everytime I run out! Thank You
B00S4ACJFW|1|Way smaller than I thought they were.
B003U63WXS|2|Doubly disappointed. Not only did this arrive with a broken cap that enabled the contents to spill into the padded envelope, but it smells nothing like cedar or even wood for that matter. The scent is reminiscent of sports scented deodorants- not very natural at all.
B00J2APCKC|4|I tried the Venus & Olay razor thanks to a campaign run by Venus. This razor was AWESOME. Smooth and silky legs without shave gel or lotion. Cuts out the mess of shaving while still producing great results.
B00QHL5V4Q|5|Greaat product good value & shipped real quick
B001OCE342|1|If you are blonde, DON'T use this stuff.  It turned my hair an awful shade of pumpkin!  Straight back to the store for this stuff!
B00LBFA3D2|2|I like the deodorant, but it was sort of broken when I received it. Therefore it scratches my skin and really, really stings!
B003OJMQCO|5|I have fine hair that is like cornsilk.  This works well on styling my bodyless hair.  I put it on my wet hair and then blowdry.  You neeed to brush it out unless you want stiff looking hair.  But then your hair is set for days.
B00HHNGZX4|5|Love this perfume always have. Shipped fast.
B00HSE4WJG|4|Very nice variety of brushes. Extremely soft tips. With bristles ranging from stiff to softer.<br />Application is great
B000Q6D0AA|5|good
B00DIP4G4A|3|The lift is truly great, but the way they stick on: they poke out in places and it does not look smooth under the surface, the whole point is to avoid wearing a bra, but I would not recommend it.
B008CEDY5O|2|The size is too small and make me feel dry because of \\"Benzyl Alcohol\\" ingredient inside!
B00P1NBKSW|4|I've never tried any volumizing products, but I have somewhat fine hair, so I thought it would be interesting to try out. I ended up hating having my hair volumized, but this product worked really well, so I am giving it 4 stars.<br /><br />This product is applied in the shower after you've washed and conditioned your hair. You then rub 3-5 pumps through all of your hair and let sit for about 5 minutes, then rinse. Blow dry and style as usual.<br /><br />Once your hair is dried you can easily tell the difference. I lazily blew dry my hair till it was almost dry then stopped, and as soon as it was totally dry I could see a difference in volume. Of course, I could also feel what the product did to my hair, which is make it very hard to brush. I understand that is normal for this type of product (part of how it achieves the volume), but I have very long hair and it did not feel good -- in fact it made my hair a bit frizzy and it felt damaged for some time after. Trying again with only applying to the scalp helped a bit, but I've decided that I am better off without volume.<br /><br />It took three shampoos to return my hair to normal, so the 7 day label depends on how often you wash your hair.<br /><br />Overall, this product worked and lasted as advertised and was very easy to use. The bottle is rather small but it still contains a decent amount, especially if you only have to apply it weekly.
B001T8S7T8|4|It is a great deal for the price! The travel one comes in handy on trips. They are just normal hairbrushes and I've had no problems with them. For the price, you can't go wrong!
B004I6O3LO|5|This leave in cream is seriously nourishing for my hair. I use it straight after the shower and when it sets in, my hair is incredibly soft.
B001H88JEI|5|Previously, I used a bowl diffuser to give my curls lift.  But the DevaFuser has replaced the bowl diffuser easily. I love the way it can dry the curls at the base of my scalp to keep the curls consistent all the way down my long hair. Because I have long hair, it would normally be that 3/4 of my hair was curly while the top 1/4 was not as curly due to the weight of my hair.  Not with the DevaFuser!!  And yes, the adapter does work as it fits my non-Deva hairdryer nicely.  I also tried the spray that came with the DevaFuser along with my DevaCurl Angell and it works great.  Adds a lovely shine to the curls and gives them a bit more lift and tightness without any sticky or heavy mess.
B002729JTM|5|I have been wearing invisible retainers since a couple of months now and my orthodontist recommended me Retainer Brite for cleaning up the retainers regularly. I just soak my retainers in water along with one tablet for about 20 minutes and it cleans up perfectly fine. It does what it is expected to. 101% recommended.
B00HHDX4AQ|1|Ugh... Smell struck me as yucky nasty definitely not happy.<br />Smell is such a personal thing... So hard to say if others would like this.
B001CS8BJ6|4|Portable with clean shave. Better on dry shaving. Blade gets stuck with wet shaving ones it dries up but can be release when you open and close the blade. Long battery life when using once a day.
B00AHF1GK6|4|Solid. Not the greatest in the world, but they get the job done.<br /><br />There is a little tug and pull right out of the package. Not much, but there is some.<br /><br />Still, these are much better than the 'dollar store' options out there ... and even some of the more costly brands.<br /><br />Would recommend.<br /><br />I received these as part of a promotion for the brand but it is my civic duty to give an objective opinion on them.
B007I00FQE|5|It's difficult to find coverage that looks natural so I keep trying different products.  Now with the BB creams in the market, I decided to try this and I like it a lot. Aside from it being my foundation, it does good things for my skin (as I understand), it also photographs well (meaning it doesn't look like I'm wearing cake makeup in photos.<br />This is my second tube and I still like it.
B003LSEQPI|3|Brush leaves hair smoother, however the bristles tend to get caught in longer, thick hair. Some are already breaking off.
B00O2MLUV0|5|Nice thick plastic with a bit of bend. Not the hard brittle stuff. Good size too, they hold all my super thick curly hair. I saw a cool little apparatus in a drug store that was a clip like this with a ponytailer built in over the front to do an updo with, but it was like 6 or 7 bucks. I got these on the cheap, and just stretch my own ponytail holder across the front and it works just fine!
B000GHVJ8E|5|very good. excellent.
B00L2RFR58|1|This product had no effect on my skin. I returned it.
B009XPRZJW|4|actually this was given as part of a gift and the recipient is quite happy with it. she likes it.
B0079RQ0EM|5|Great color very soft and matte with pigment  I have olive skin and it warms my complexion!<br />True color as seen in review .
B0079R6BD2|5|I love this shampoo. I use it every day and I take [[ASIN:B00Q5KMX5O Mynoxidrin - Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Formula Nourishes and Strengthens Thinning Hair and Promotes Hair Growth!]] with it. I have been using both of them for about three months, and I am shocked at how great my hair looks. It does not fall out anymore, and it looks super healthy. This combo is the absolute best thing I have ever seen for hair loss. Could not be happier .
B00I0UG4PM|4|I was skeptical when I first tried this product, what deodorant actually works for 48 hours? I was not a big fan of this particular fragrance. It was a bit overwhelming, but I got used to it as the day went on. I sweat a lot! So I figured that I would put this deodorant through its paces. I was dry all day. Even the next morning, I did not wake up sweating, like I normally do. I was impressed with how well it worked. It lasted well over 24 hours for me. I was not willing to go another day, to see how long it really lasted for me, as I was very happy with the overnight results! I have switched my deodorant. I WAS PROVIDED SPEED STICK GEAR TO ME AS A MEMBER OF INFLUENSTER. I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.
B0012D87UO|5|This product is well made, solid, sharp, and easy to use.  It's worth the price and looks like it will last forever.
B002RGRJC2|5|my iron etc is normal. next step is scalp biopsy . ..i have done the biotin. it does work. my hair does grows fine. ...thats not a problem for me. I'm growing weak fine hair with no elasticity, breaks off or falls out by the roots. spend more energy money into keeping my hair and the length. also thyroid is fine.<br /><br />Moroccanoil hair product line is divine and 'ITs a 10' is 2nd best on my 3c,4a,4b  hair texture<br /> compared to Amika, nexus, terax, photo, frederic fekkai, giovanni, joico, affirm, dudleys, shea moisture, Design essential etc. ..<br /><br />i also use aloe vera leaf juice and lil bit of lime and black tea from distilled water mix carrot seed oil, rosemary oil,basil oil with Eqyss conditioner to moisturize but have to refrigerate after each use. to keep the aloe vera fresh.  seal with coconut, grape seed oil,  overnight.<br />also invested in Kent combs (believe they are seamless smoother on the hair and durable. )<br /><br />might be just bad DNA although my family has long thick hair on both sides. maybe i got the bad DNA. anyhow for my hair type its makes my hair feel and look better in conjunction with daily natural hair routine.<br /><br />i alternate between 2x week between ' Is A 10' AND Moroccan hydrate+repair system. only regret is. taking so long to try it along time ago. I LOVE line systems!
B000E3FEC2|5|excelente producto
B00UU31BQ4|1|WARNING DO NOT BUY THESE!  They are NOT heat resistant in ANY way. Just went to use them for the 1st time and got 2nd-3rd degree burns!!!!!
B007VMT2T0|5|This is a lovely scented, great body wash and shampoo combo. I don't have alot of room in the shower so having 1 bottle that replaces 3 potential items is a plus. I am very picky about lavender products - some just do not smell like real lavender, and this product gets my scent seal of approval.
B00C96SOHE|5|Excellent
B007P5J18A|5|that's my first time to use this production. i have no idea about others, but my experience is a positive one. Thanks.
B0012JK7OM|4|A while back I decided to try the serum and loved it!  My hair is incredibly thick, coarse, naturally wavy and dyed.  Since the serum works magic in my hair and Paul Mitchell is cruelty free, I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner.  Unlike the shampoo and conditioner I had been using previously (Organix Teatree and mint), I only had to use a small amount of the Paul Mitchell brand.<br />I come from Greek/Italian heritage and I have tried so many different brands, even brands geared towards women of color and I've never really been satisfied with anything until now.<br />This product sort of lessens dry time...I really haven't noticed too much of a change there, but I didn't purchase it for that purpose.<br />The major downsides of Paul Mitchell products are:<br />1.) Price.  It's expensive...It's basically 2-3 times more expensive than your average hair care brand.  But if you have the money to splurge, go for it.<br />2.) The scent/smell.  I have a really sensitive sense of smell and this stuff has a fruity scent to it.  I am not a fan of fruity scents.  If it were a minty or even a floral scent it would be better.  It smells a bit like Garnier Fruitis.<br />To me the reasons to buy it are:<br />1.) It sort of saves me money.  Instead of buying up 2-3 bottles of conditioner at a time and using a quarter of a bottle everytime I wash my hair...I think I've used maybe an eighth of a bottle of the Paul Mitchell brand and it's been 4 washes.<br />2.) It's cruelty free.  Paul Mitchell doesn't test on animals and I prefer putting my purchasing power towards companies that don't torture animals and don't use tax payer dollars to afford such torture.<br />Something to consider:<br />Before dropping the dough on this particular line, make sure you have the right hair type for these products.  Ask your stylist if they'd recommend it for your type of hair.  This product is NOT for everyone who thinks they have thick/unruly hair.  And make sure you only use a small amountand rinse it out cleanly.  Some reviewers have complained about the residue and if you use to much of any brand there will be residue.  And also beware of who you purchase from.  ALWAYS check to make sure the seller is a reputable and licensed seller of the line/product.  There are just too many counterfeiters out there these days.
B003CJ1Q2W|2|I was glad I bought this little one for a low price than buy the big bottle or a gift set, because I honestly didn't like the smell at all so I made a good choice we purchasing this. I love everything about it just not smell.
B003ZWP7QM|5|These are great for extended travel (2 to 3 weeks) for my shampoo and conditioner.  Also, the cap stays on and doesn't leak like those pour spouts.
B001AMRQ2W|4|For the past 25 years I have been using Remington foil shavers--most recently the Remington MS3 3700. I was always happy with them, but nothing mechanical lasts forever.  I had never used a rotary shaver before getting this Norelco 8240 last month.  I have to say I am reasonably happy with it.  Plusses include (1) It is VERY quiet, much quieter than any of my Remingtons, (2) It shaves close enough to satisfy me--almost as close as my Remington foil shavers, (3) Easy to clean.  Minuses?  Nothing big. (1) The unit has an awkward shape that makes it harder to hold in my hand, (2) The rotary shavers have a bit more trouble shaving hard-to-reach spots like under my nose.  But I am glad I bought it, and I would gladly buy it again.    By the way, I would have gladly bought the Braun Series 7 at over $200, but I was turned off by its overly-elaborate cleaning \\"system\\" that requires the purchase of special cleaning fluid.  Seems like Braun has made cleaning a much bigger deal than necessary. I don't want to have to park some special cleaning stand beside my bathroom sink.
B007R1Y5Y2|5|Great Perfume, manly , strong and long lasting..... I would recommend this one to all strong perfume lovers, you will not be disappointed....
B000851N9E|4|It is super thick and stays exactly where you put it. Very water-proof. After swimming/surfing in ocean (salt-water and waves), it remains intact. I was impressed by that. I wish I could afford to use it on entire body. It leaves a white cast even when rubbed in good. But it is great sun protection
B0030O3VRW|5|It makes my eyeshadow brighter and it lasts. The more you put on your eyes (as a base) the more vibrant the eyeshadow turns out. I wish they sold it bigger .
B002H61LIU|5|This soap is great, with a very subtle scent. Like all Dove soap bars, it doesn't leave your skin dry. But the scent of the other ones is stronger.<br />I wish I had seen they had this package at Bed, Bath and Beyond before I bought it from the seller at Amazon (beautyline). They sell it for $14, not $20!
B00U68N9AO|5|This tool is easy to use, and works faster than other brands I've tried. This set is a great value with all the extra pads that come with it!
B0049XOHB2|5|Stays on and does not run into creases around lips.  Its the only<br />long lasting lipstick I have used that stays on and doesn't flake.
B000BIZSXA|3|I like this product, however, it's not worth the $$.    I find Nioxin, for dry & colored hair is just as good.
B000HA3CXK|5|This is the best product I've ever used. Fine lines have disappeared and after a few weeks you can really feel a great improvement in your skin.It seems to be odorless and doesn't feel oily like other products have.
B00NN6QQW4|1|This item did not change or enhance my eyelashes whatsoever. After a month of consistent use, there has been no change.
B000RJUZMW|5|Always wondered why my dad used a Double Edged razor, now I know! I purchased this razor a year ago and have enjoyed it ever since. I like the length of the handle and the extra weight . I used disposable razors in the past and there is no comparison in how close the shave is. The quality is top notch and I see no reason why it won't last a lifetime.
B001282G2E|5|I purchased this cologne when I lived in Florida years ago.  I have also purchased this in Hawaii.  Love it and am happy I found it online.  No other fragrance is quite like it, and long lasting.
B001CT09VS|4|Nice, vetiver smell that doesn't overpower.  The scent lingers longer than I expected for the price point but definitely is not all-day as a more expensive EDP or parfum.
B00CC0G7LW|3|A little greasy and doesn't smell quite the same as the bottle, but will get you out of trouble...I carry it in my purse
B00KU8FYN0|5|I can't vouch for the long term effects of this product yet (I'll update my review later), but I've used this product for a few days now and my hair smells really good and does seem shinier than normal.<br /><br />The shampoo smells amazing and lathers better than most shampoos. My hair was neither oily or dry after using this product, which was nice.
B003H146PY|5|I want to thank you for producing such an amazing product, normally I'm a skeptic, but WOW this stuff really works as advertised
B000HGLL3C|3|My husband wasn't too impressed with this. He likes these rough stones to use on his heels or whatnot else. It didn't really thrill him though. We have found better products elsewhere.
B006UUTNCU|5|I know this sounds crazy but I have been using this for only a few days and I can already see a difference. I would recommend this to anyone. I have tried others with hardly any results. So glad I found this one!!
B000PJ705O|5|I don't see how this could go wrong. Make sure you get the correct one. I got the wrong one, then reordered the correct one.
B0096A4JPM|5|Thank you
B009WDQOVU|4|Pretty good product, i like that it's from a small business, cruelty free and very basic ingredients. The only set back is that it has to be warmed a bit before it is able to spread on. Otherwise, I really like it and would buy it again! Definitely more for people who would rather have a non-chemical, natural alternative to major brands.
B001KYQBUI|5|This is the only scent I wear and I was pleased to get it with no SH applied. Garden Botankia usually only offers free ship if you spend a certain amount and this allowed me to buy only what I wanted at this time.
B00HOHLKY2|5|The Vitamin C serum has really improved the texture of my skin.  I was skeptical about whether I would see any results, but I had heard about using Vitamin C serum on Dr. Oz and I thought I'd give it a try.  After using it for about a week, my skin looked brighter and more even toned.  After about a month my skin is softer and looks and feels hydrated all day long.  I love the results.  I'm in my 50's and there aren't many things that really work.  This does.
B00DVMXFIS|5|Perfect for what i need! Does a great job!
B00IEG2K2S|5|good quality
B0087TVKXW|5|I HAVE BLEACHED THIN HAIR AND THIS MAKES MY HAIR LOOK SHINY, FEEL THICK AND MAKES IT VERY MANAGEABLE!!!<br />LOVE IT!!!
B00HHR0SYW|5|Great stuff. soaks right in your skin. no greasy feel, and is fine for my sensitive skin. ill definitely be ordering more. A little goes along way so it lasts.
B003UKM90Q|1|Battery is dead!!! I charged it 24 hours each time for 3 times. And every time, the battery can last no longer than 30 seconds. Very poor product!!!
B00C7DYBX0|4|Good product.
B007JGZX3W|5|My favorite for years and very dependable.  Does not build on my hair depsite my daily use of the spray and makes my very fine hair stiff, but not too much so.
B000IVC46E|5|Our baby has hearing loss, and keeping her aids in is a struggle. This keeps them attached without irritating her sensitive skin.
B00305C86G|5|-unless you really care much about the \\"brand\\", (but for the fragrance, no one can really see the brand when you are wearing it.) and for the fact that it does smell like polo back (or even better?umm) anyway it smells really cool, and it lasts really long. even after you wash your clothes, you can tell the aroma's top middle and low notes, and that's the sign of a well made perfume.
B004W1GRKK|5|Fast results and cleared skin without over drying to much. I used morning and night for a week and after only spot treatment.
B007PY4QV8|1|Was expecting something different. Its just made of plastic and doesn't look like it'll be comfy because of the thick weft (which looks like melted plastic).
B004OHQR1Q|5|amazing set for such price! I use them a lot for my polymer clay creations, I totally recommend this set I'm so glad I found this!
B009B7E450|4|I have wavy hair that is often over straightened by a flat iron. It leaves my hair super silky and shiny all day. It keeps frizz and static down completely. Smells good too.  My only irritation is that because my hair gets oily after a day, this product speeds up the process. If you plan to spend a few days with it in your hair without washing it, I don't recommend using it unless you skip the conditioning process.
B00E68O4JU|4|When I ordered this product, I have to admit I was a little skeptical... But I was surprised that it really works! It was weird at first to get the hang of it, but even on the first try it produced that perfect curl! It did tangle my hair a few times, but all I needed to do was release the handle and I can easily pull the hair free with no issue. My hair is very long, down to lower back, and it had no problem taking the hair in. I would suggest those who have frizzy hair like myself to run a flat iron over the hair to get it nice and straight, and it makes it easier to separate sections of hair. I have read some find the product too heavy, but I had no problem holding it. Took me only 15-20 minutes to curl all my hair. Would definitely recommend.
B0037MK6AW|5|Excellent product; my face feels refreshed and supple after I use it.
B000UVWGGA|1|I use to love this product before they changed it and the container. Please make it the way it was. PLEASE!  o_O
B004DK0UDA|5|Great price for 25 different stamp plates with 10 designs on each plate - tons of artistic nail design options!  Easy to use!
B004Z40048|1|You get what you pay for. If you're looking for something overly dramatic that could never be worn for everyday use, then the look of these are pretty good. They practically blinded me, though. I felt like I was wearing 10 lb lashes! I feel them when I'm blinking and when I'm not. Could barely keep my eyes open with them. I wore them once to take a picture and took them right off.
B0014NXLEY|5|I've been wearing Rive Gauche for over 30 years and I still love the smell.  People still comment on what a wonderful light smell it is even after working all day.
B00N30PV5I|5|I love the hair products and decided to try the Skin Butter.  Nice fragrance, softens rough skin.  Glad I tried it.
B003PP0CPU|4|I've used before and especially like to use the tube of Dermitage for applying on face before applying regular base make-up - allows base make-up to glide on effortlessly and smoothly.  Product arrived promptly and as advertised.  Would recommend to any woman at any age.
B002VA4LNO|5|this is one of the rarest creams that feels non-greasy and dry. Gives a fair coating on your skin. smells nice. COming the healing marks problem, i didnt observed a very significant effect. But its a nice moisturizer with good smell and quality.
B00J8DU3M0|5|Great bargain. These are great brushes and cute. Shipped fast and have all basic brushes needed.
B0037HP9OA|5|This is a great product. Still working well after 2 years of use. The blades are still sharp. Very easy to use. Highly recommended.
B000EZOC1O|3|It's an abrasive plastic wash cloth. Nothing special about it honestly.
B000XE6G5Q|1|didn't smell well, you could tell it was old. just threw it away. waste of money. should of known better
B00QT14EB0|5|amazing, stuff it works
B000LGJ5MM|5|Loved it and the body lotion is great also! can't believe they don't make these anymore
B001MA0QY2|5|I purchased this Flat Iron for my very picky daughter.  She has fine but curly hair.  She said it worked better than a Chi and she really likes it.
B00GUJJFRY|2|It wasn't what I expected. And took forever to get to me.
B007SGP1J4|3|Works as well as Xfusion or Toppik, but found it tends to clump more and clogs my pump/spray applicator.  One plus is that it promotes recycling of the other hair fiber brands containers.
B00J3S2PYY|5|I have always loved this body spray.  It lasts all day.
B001BQXV4O|5|My husband was very happy with this gift. He hadn't been able to find this for years, and loved it when he wore it. He said it smells just like he remembers. It made a great Christmas gift.
B003XRZQ42|5|Love this product.
B004FKJA5W|5|I have used these for years.  Good product!
B0014B0G8K|5|Quality product! I use castor oil for many natural home made beauty products. It works great as an oil cleanser for the face as it helps clean the skin and draw out impurities and leaves your skin soft and balanced and happy. I recived this item quickly and it was packaged safely. I will buy again and would recommend to anyone.
B00176F2BS|5|My favorite curling iron ever. Perfect curls. Perfect tool. Buy it.
B002VA4LMU|5|I've not even been an every night person but I do think my spots are fading. It might be the sun has tanned them away.....I'll let you know in the fall. It feels very greasy going on but absorbs quickly and I tend to be oily. Smells great, The only  drawback so far is it is ! Huge jar and that's not really a problem.
B000VCOS5K|3|I thought it would be bigger but I did not read it right. Smells great though.
B00JITDVM8|5|Bought this for my 93 year old father. It was easy for him to use.  Gave him a close shave.
B000AQE7K8|5|How nice to get a relaxing massage in front of the TV. <br />I love it.
B000KK53L6|5|I bought this for my daughter and she says it really works great. She has not had success with much else.
B004SVBGW8|5|Excellent product!! I've been using it for three years, and it has worked perfect on me. Highly recommended.
B00OPAYPDO|4|very good!!!^^
B0028K3J6C|5|I discovered the Olay Purifying Mud Cleanser by accident a few years ago, when I was shopping for another product. The Olay cleanser turned out to be better than the product I was originally shopping for. It accomplishes a seemingly contradictory goal, namely it both cleanses one's face thoroughly, even when one wears heavy sunblock as I must do, yet it does not dry the skin! It is a fabulous product, but I cannot find it in any pharmacy. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.
B001BSH2E2|5|Items came as advertised and I am very satisfied with them.  The rest of this is added to satisfy Amazon's inane length requirement, which I am too busy to fulfill.
B0006PQ6HK|5|This is the best creme we have used for my feet and my wifes over all body creme. It is thick and the pump does not work well, but to scoop with the fingers and work in, it is certainly a great cream to use for all kinds of purposes.
B004LCHAM4|5|Different scent than other brands of sandalwood shaving cream. Fresh feeling sensation after the shave.
B00BJEOITU|4|I'm still learning how to make the hair completely smooth, but I love the fullness I get with the brush. Perhaps my hair is not quite long enough yet. I will keep using the brush until I have mastered it.<br /><br />Elizabeth
B00NTJBMFQ|2|Good value, but doesn't fit my LG g3 very snug.
B008RODQFM|5|Just Love it
B000AUIFCA|4|Fits nicely in the Oral-B Professional Floss Action. As I guess it should as it is made for it. Great product that I will keep buying as they wear out.
B000YJ2SKM|5|I have extremely dry skin and have been looking for a cleanser for sometime which would not make me feel not wanting to wash my face because of the after effects of feeling really dry. I finally found something this I am loving. This is a perfect cleanser for me. I use couple of pumps of it every evening after removing my makeup.
B00NMMHIYE|5|I love this colors  will buy different one's soon
B002PBACLY|2|I have thick curly hari and this product felt like it was drying out my hair when it was in, but it washed out completely and my hair felt OK afterwards.  It was as silky as the other reviews said.  I will go back to Joico.
B003FOG1JW|5|Ive been using mixed chicks leave in conditioner for a long time and decided i wanted to go a more natural route.  I was very skeptical as to if i would find something that was natural and that would keep my curls shapely and defined. So I happened to stumble across this product and reluctantly decided to purchase it. To test it i did my normal routine as i do with mixed chick. I washed and conditioned my hair then applied the product. To my astonishment it looked lovely in my hair!!  I am mostly american indian mixed with liberian and i have very soft curly/wavy hair that is very picky about what is in it. So to my amazement it defined my curls and had a decent but not hard hold in my hair. And when it dried it didnt leave my hair hard and crunchy like mixed chicks, not to mention i am very comfortable with everything in the ingredient list. So, if you are not sure about purchasing it i advise you to pick up this little treasure whereas it is a lot less expensive than mixed chicks and a lot better for your hair and scalp.
B00Z8A3XWY|5|Great quality. Very easy to work with. Definitely my favorite place to buy from.
B0026IBSVE|5|Works great wish I'd bought this years ago.
B0070Z7KME|5|Works great.  A friend of mine's family raised race horses and she told me they used to get it for the horses and used it for their own aches and pains.  She said her husband and father only used this for all sorts of pain.  So I decided to try it when I saw if here on Amazon.  Actually, I was purchasing something else when i saw it and decided to order it also.  It is great.  I don't have many aches and pains but I twisted my knee the other day and the pain was terrible.  In a couple of day, it was gone.  I used it in the morning and evening only.
B00GMP318A|5|Excellent!
B00NBCD7MW|5|I tried it for a month so far. I really like it. It is summer and it is muggy out at times. Make up can easy run in this weather. What I found with this product is that it does not clump when applied as instructed. It did not run in the muggy weather. Also it lasted most of the day for me. I also liked that it is easily washed off when I was ready to remove it. I will continue to use it because it does make a difference between other mascara that I have used. It makes my eyelashes look bigger and fuller and it does not look fake. I am so happy I found this product!<br />Irina B.
B0063I3RTE|5|My boys love this smell and you can't beat this price.  Highly recommend any of the EO products.
B0047PPO0U|5|This is by far the best concealer on the market as far as I'm concerned. It has a creamy application and it last most of the day. I have used this for a couple months now and I will continue to purchase this product. Love it!
B00G1VF7G4|5|This lip gloss is more like a liquid lipstick...creamy, well pigmented, and long lasting.  This Australian brand of cosmetics is very impressive! and I want to try more of their products.  A little pricey, though, but worth every penny!
B003JJYT92|5|This is my favorite perfume - what's not to like?
B003987CL0|5|Prior to this razor, I was using the Gilette Mach 3 turbo which gave me an ok shave. Sometimes it would give me one of those shaves where you can run your hand over your face and neck and it feels like a newborn baby.<br /><br />With the Fusion Proglide Power Razor, I get that perfect shave everytime! I have really sensitive skin and really thick facial hair.<br /><br />Gilette is seriously the best a man can get.
B00519BC8O|5|This conditioner has done wonders for my hair. Only takes a little bit and leaves it shiny and manageable without weighing it down.
B006SMO9SI|5|LOVE CLINIQUE - LOVE GETTING IT THROUGH AMAZON -- ALWAYS COMES IN AS EXPECTED AND ON TIME -- WATCH THE FREIGHT CHARGES - FOR MULTIPLES THEY CAN SNEAK UP AND STEAL THE DEAL
B000P20U7G|5|Excellent. All ways a hit. Always makes other co workers say.&#34; Who smells good&#34;<br />Always fast shipping. Excellent product well worth the price
B00150IN3K|5|I love this cream and have used it (and the daily cleanser) for 2 years since I first got it from a dermatologist. I find the scent neutral. It feel smooth and non oily. It's for sensitive skin or skin prone to redness
B00NQHFGMG|5|This product is one of the best products I've used on my face (& I'm now 75 years old)...so that's a real plus for your serum.  It makes my skin look dewy and wrinkles have greatly diminished because my thin skin actually appears plumper...which creates a much more youthful appearance.  I've tried so many products for my face and this is one that actually makes a positive difference!
B008NXU5M4|1|stinks like deodorant or worse
B00FH692PQ|5|Nice
B00GWBR5N6|3|I was soooooo excited when I seen this invention!! First of all...what thin lipped girl wouldn't JUMP at the chance to buy a $20 pout?! It's safe, there's no hazards of ending up botched or having allergic reactions, you can carry them in your purse, and you can secretly pretend that you are Angelina Jolie with your perfect pout!.......Downside......yes *sigh* there's a downside. The first couple times I used them I had pouty lips for like SIX HOURS, but now they barely last for 20 MINUTES (I do not use this product very often). I use them BEFORE doing my makeup because they leave this terrible red ring around your mouth like you got into a fight with a vacuum hose and lost. By the time the red ring has subsided, so has my pout :/<br />  Honestly though, I think the $20 is worth it. Every girl has different results. And this is a great way to see what your pout would look like if you did want to get your lips filled.
B00147FGJ8|5|Works Great! Nice smell
B0068G8DTA|4|Works.
B00HY0GTQ8|5|I love this product.
B009WRYFB2|5|My girlfriend LOVES this cologne. And it arrived on time
B00SKDDNK8|4|really soft. could be a little stiffer. keeps me out of trouble when i am out of town away from home.good quality . the free lube is nice
B0029F2WAU|5|This is the small container, but for the price I can't complain. I love Bare Escentuals.  I can take this when I travel, will be perfect.
B00G9AQZIQ|5|I love these gloves.  They stay snug on my hands even after repeated washings.
B003C1O1ZE|1|Useless....does not hold anything. Just stay away.
B00871KOQO|3|These are great some of them are a little thick and uneven but for the most part there nice.
B00404NS4M|5|My sister is a Daddy Yankee fan so when I saw this perfume I thought it was a great Christmas gift. She really liked it the scent is very nice.
B0002Y0X10|5|made very well.
B003OSQZAO|5|Absolutely Love this rune bag. Beautiful and whimsical.
B00KYW8CY0|5|When I tried it, it went on rather smooth, not greasy at all. There was no filmy residue after drying and it didn't make my skin break out whatsoever. I am very happy with the results and recommend this product to anyone looking to care for their skin!
B00KQ4TGHS|1|This was just water with a green tint. I think its a fake. I had a sample from a spa and it was totally different.
B008IGPF5I|5|love it
B00F008GFQ|5|Amazing product!!! I definitely recommend for everyone!
B000SKYS1Y|5|I have used this product before and rate it extremely high. However, with this order, it has been 31 days and I still have not received the product.
B0013VBQ5I|5|I HAVE USED THIS MASCARA SINCE IT CAME OUT AND HAVE HAD NUMEROUS WOMEN ASK ME WHAT I USE ON MY EYELASHES THEY ALWAYS THINK MINE ARE FAKE. TO THEIR SURPRISE AFTER THEY USED IT THEY KEPT SPREADING THE WORD HOW GREAT IT IS. IT IS NOW A \\"SHAME\\" IT WILL NOT BE CARRIED ON SHELVES OR ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES WHEN ALL THE SUPPLIES ARE EXHAUSTED HERE.    WHAT A SHAME IT IS THE GREATEST MASCARA ON THE MARKET. BUT NOW LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IT WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE ON FOREIGN SOIL.
B009GEUPDS|3|I use this Day & Night for almost 3 weeks now and I can tell that this product makes your face squeaky clean and it smells great.The brush it didn't do anything aside from vibrating it onto your skin. The bristle was kinda hard and it doesn't really circulate. Overall, I don't think that it is really working for my skin though lately i have been getting these pimples, blackheads here and there and its annoying coz its painful too. =( so, I don't think that I'm going to try this again. By the way I received this Olay Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.
B00U8MEW90|4|I've only been using it a week, so I can't comment on the longterm effects. However, it has a great creamy consistency, feels amazing on, and my skin feels clean yet soft afterwards.<br /><br />Honestly, I was a little skeptical with the price being so low, and when it came in the mail, the package said it was from China. That's really odd to me, and at first I was hoping it would be made in the US. But if you think about it, the Dead Sea is in the Middle East, so it wouldn't be made in the US either. I guess this means that any face mask can me manufactured in China or another country and just distributed by an American brand. So I shouldn't judge the mask by this fact.
B004T19PAC|5|I've been using this for a couple of years now. I have dry hair and this has helped me ever since. It smells really nice and not I overpowering.
B003XUROEY|2|Just like the old Cher commercial where she opined \\"if a great body came in a bottle, everyone would have one\\", Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Anti-Wrinkle cream promises more than it can deliver.  After several days of use, we found that beneficial results were minimal (possibly even a placebo effect); however, the heat and redness from the retinol were apparent with each application.  Face it - there is no remedy for facial wrinkles in a bottle.
B001H88JEI|5|I absolutely love the defuser- the fingers enable you to really dry the roots and get lift. I have hair that wants to fall flat on top - so i use the defuser whether I am going to wear my hair curly or straight. No more flat top for me !!!
B00MPXP8AW|5|Best shea butter I've used; good quality.
B001B80FTQ|4|Somewhat difficult to maneuver around my ingrown toe nails. When I finally get it in the right place does a good job of filling down the ingrown part of my toe nail.
B008QMWV7E|5|I love this!  Smells great!  There are no hazardous chemicals  and makes my skin soft. Does not cause breakouts either!
B0015UTZH8|4|Received in time. First tried this in a Bahamas hotel. Was thicker though. This seems a little less moisturizing and watery. But still wonderful smell. I use another lotion under it to get real moisturizing. Not sure if I'll buy again. I may just have to go to Bahamas again for it.
B00G8OQODY|2|This product did almost nothing for me after using the whole bottle. My dark spots look the same. No fading of any spots at all. Maybe my 40 something year old skin is just more stubborn about releasing the hyperpigmentation. My skin did not have any reaction to this - positive or negative so I guess I am glad it didn't make my skin worse. I won't be repurchasing. I felt that the vitamin C serum I used was better.
B00GW1HKHW|4|Shockingly, this cheap little thing really does work.  I've been playing with it on all sorts of areas.  I've noticed in just 3 uses that my scars are slightly better, and the little fine lines near my eyes & above my upper lip have lessened.  In time I can see this really working some magic.  I originally bought this after seeing a youtube video where a woman was using it to plump up her lips. It really works for that as well, and the bigger lips lasted about a full 48 hours then went back down to normal for me.  I suspect they increased in size due to the irritation of the needles, but whatever, I'll take it.  Hopefully it will work long term as well.  The only negative would be that after a few days the areas I rolled over got a bit itchy (except my lips, they were fine) and I couldn't stop scratching which left me with some little scabs.  If I had some sort of anti-itch cream it would have fixed that, but I didn.t  I assume that's just my skin healing itself, so it's just a minor irritant.  You can plan on your skin being red for several hours afterwards if you roll lightly, and a few days if you use a bit more pressure.  That little cap they give you to soak the roller in works, but every $$$##%@@ time I use it, I spill it.  They need to come up with a better cup that doesn't tip over so easily, but that's just a minor issue.
B00DLN5RQA|5|Love it!  My brows only needed a little filling in, it works beautifully.
B0037LOQQI|5|Highly recommend! not shining, suitable for all skin types, even oily skin. Will buy again!<br />Highly recomended! easy to aborb to your skin.
B00DLRNSSK|3|hello I bought this products because of the high reviews. honestly I haven't seen a big difference in my stretch marks  maybe it depends on your body type different products work for different people and things but as for me maybe I would have to continue to use it to see a big significant change I been using it for 3 weeks so I say to each its own it may work for others but I am dark skin African American and was using it to get rid of the stretch marks I gotten from pregnancy maybe the 100% honest thing that will work is probably laser removal I will continue to use the product till the bottle is gone why not otherwise its just a waste of your money guess I'll continue searching until I find the right product for me.
B006C8BKRG|1|I have been using Schick Quattro blades for 3-4 years.  They gave a close smooth shave with little or no skin irritation.  The life span of the blade was great.  Some seemed to last over a month before needing replacement.<br />Now, we've got the Quattro Titanium.  What happened???  They're more expensive and the blades are much duller right out of the box!  What edge they do have is gone after one or two uses!  I've tried to bear up under the discomfort and pain, but I've had it.<br />This is an over priced, poor quality product!
B007XN2NMK|5|I had been using Sexy Curly Hair products before finding their &#34;free of &#34; products.  I was excited till recently my hair turned into a rats nest of unholey stuck together gobs of silicone!<br /><br />Since using Devacurl No Poo and the Conditioner my hair has returned to normal, even better more curls and more shine!  Stripped clean of the silicone after a few vinegar rinses followed by these two products. Got curly fine/mixed race hair?  This might just be a miracle!
B006IBM21K|5|The product arrived on time. It worked perfectly as soon as I turned it on. All the bulbs worked.<br />Works great with Opi and gelish gels (those are the only ones i've tried yet). Also, you can use the ventilator to dry regular polish of your nails.
B0002L93N2|5|Great for loose wave on long hair or subtle bend on medium length hair..<br />Heats up quickly for efficient styling.
B00IMLLW6A|3|I have used the product several times and it seems to be working ok.  I wasn't sensitive to the product.
B007M81A6Q|4|I never used a cc cream before but since I go into the sun and needed a sunscreen and moisturizer I figured might as well try it - fast delivery , price was in range of the going market, highly recommmed seller ot all parties -
B0060PA7A2|4|I was a little skeptical when I ordered these nail tattoo stickers. Once I used them my worries were no more! I used the stickers on my toenails and it looked great. I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 because I ripped part of the tattoo when I pulled it off of the backing so be very careful when using them. I will definitely order them again. I only wish there was more of a selection other than flowers maybe some type of design that has multiple colors.
B002XQ1XDM|5|My Co-Workers tell me &#34;I crawl up jesus's *** crack every morning before I come to work&#34;<br /><br />*disregard any religous offense, this is a direct quote that does not reflect my personal beliefs
B0078DXM2A|5|great product, leaves your hair so soft.
B00288BVOQ|1|This was a reorder from last year, and expected same product (s). I received 1 for $10.77 this reorder and received 3 for $9.49 last order. The $10.77 is $3-5 dollars MORE expensive at Walmart.Make sure you read the product description closely so you DON'T GET RIPPED OFF!!!
B000X2W6LQ|1|When I opened the package a small plastic bushing fell out. This is the piece that goes between the metal rod and the metal bracket allowing the two to slide smoothly against each other. I tried to reattach it but it was too loose to stay in place. Immediately placed back in box and sent back for refund.
B00FZUUTRO|5|I LOVE these masks! Great product!
B00RFY3C2C|4|The 5 in 1 CURLING IRON from Xtava is pretty cool.  It has 5 different interchangeable ceramic curling iron barrels that click into the handle.  The handle has a lock feature so you don't have to worry about the barrel coming out while your using it.  This curling iron set comes with 3 of the clip style barrels and 2 of the clipless wand style barrels.  The sizes range from .3 - .74 of the the narrowest want style barrel to the 1.25\\" of the clip curling iron.  These give you so many options.  I can create corkscrew curls, waves, big curls for body and bounce, ringlets, and even straighten my hair.  While I love the diversity this set gives me, I am surprised by a couple things.  1) There is only 1 heat setting - on.  Most curling irons have a multiple heat settings or a least a range of low, medium and high.  2)  None of the barrels have a cool touch tip.  I've been using curling tools for any years.  A cool touch tip nowadays is pretty standard.  If it does not have one then it comes with a heat(silicon) glove.  This does not come with a glove either.  Fortunately I have a spare kitchen one I can use.  I do love the long 8' cord and 360 swivel cord.  A lot of twirling goes on when curling hair so it's nice to not have the cord get all tangled up during the process.  This iron also has an auto shutoff feature.  This iron gets hot and will give you lasting shiny curls quickly thanks to the ceramic tourmaline technology.  I like that it comes with a  eat resistant bag for safe storage and carrying.  I do have to not there was small tear in the outside covering of my bag.  Just cosmetic though and along a seam.  Nothing that affects the usefulness of the bag.  I received this item in exchange for my honest opinion in a review.
B00FAANC8W|5|Love this product!  I have brown eyelashes, but the tips get really light. Also, my bottom lashes are all very light. I got the blue- black. I was worried thinking it would be blue, but it is not at all, it is just the deepest black they offer. The results were good! It doesn't look like I have mascara on or anything, just more defined lashes.
B008I2IKJK|5|fits my toothbrush great item and price
B00X7GKOQE|1|very disappointed.  I tried to tint my brows three nights in a row, and nothing!  I even left product on over night and no difference whatsoever.  I've used this product before with good results, but probably won't buy again as I afraid of  getting a bad batch  - bummer :(
B004WP3VNM|5|Nice scent, worked well in the bath. I woul definitely purchase this item again.  And plan to do so soon.
B007P1T7H4|3|A good portable razor.  Flex screen not quite as fast as rotary heads, but eventually cuts the stubble.
B004EE1EC6|3|My biggest dissappointment is that it does not have auto shut-off.  I didn't realize this fact the first time I used it so it was on all day.  I don't remember the last time that I had a curling or flat iron had to be turned off manually. Otherwise, this iron heats up fast & flatens well.
B009EE9JFK|5|I love how this product cleans my hair! It leaves my hair very soft to the touch. I use it from head-to-toe!! I have gotten my husband using it now and he doesn't want to use anything else!!
B002AMUF38|5|This fabulous cream has been a staple of my skin care regime for many years now and I can't live without it. And Amazon's price can't be beat. (Nordstrom and Bloomingdales charge $130 for this!)
B00EJIKSRE|5|very good
B000E39M48|5|I have used to use orange ginger version (kept my stomach calm through pregnancy)... but was ready for a change... the peppermint is great! slight tingle, nice and smooth, and lasts forever! My new favorite lip balm!
B00N9D8PES|5|I really like the way this feels on my skin. I'm hoping to see great results!
B004BMZSIC|4|I am new to Luminess Air it is a pricey product but I am new to using it.  I recently was laid off and called Luminess Air to tell them it was a hardship to be billed $69.99 for 5 months (this is not mentioned in the infomercial at all) Lakasha was very nice and friendly.  Very understanding too!  She said she is waiving 3 payments for me due to being out of work and she is sending me new colors as the ones that come in the initial kit were not my shade for my skin type.  I appreciated the great customer service however at no time was I advised that an additional $34.06 will be billed to my account on top of the $69.99  I am out $104.05 on erroneous billing from Luminess without my consent!  Very deceiving company and they do not disclose this.  I am cancelling this account and highly DO NOT RECOMMEND LUMINESS AIR. Thanks to them I have to dispute with my bank.  Very underhanded deceitful company Stay Away!!!
B00BJA5MOE|2|Looks nice and I like the rubber, it makes it easier to use, but it felt like the clipper was going to come apart the first time I used it and it did fall apart the second time I used it. So I guess you get what you pay for.
B008X9T0B0|4|GOOD
B0036QTJDO|5|Great product!! My hair dye has lasted longer than ever, my hair always feels and smells wonderful, and I only have to wash my hair every 3 days or so. The leave in conditioner is a must product!  My hair has less frizz and has a salon-look even when air-dried :-) Tip: make sure you thoroughly wash out the shampoo and conditioner when washing your hair so it doesn't over grease.
B00KQGP83C|5|Great wig but very full and longer than I thought it would be.
B00EFUYD7M|5|Sensual, subtle, inviting is all l can say to describe this perfume. It's the type of perfume that one would want to sniff every now and again because it smells so divine. I would definitely recomend this to anyone who loves a sensual, mildly sweet and lingery perfume. I spray it once in the morning and it lasts all day. I can smell it on my clothes and even in my sheets when l go to sleep. Definitely will buy this again!!!
B005ALWE1M|3|Its ok. Hurts!!
B003UKKHB4|5|Excellent toothbrush.  I had an older version of this and replaced after a few years.  Would highly recommend!
B005DXDTAM|5|Good!
B002EP9OUG|5|Great value
B00385WMJ6|5|I couldn't figure out where brick and mortar stores have these, so bought one here. What can I say... It's a shower cap and it works just fine.
B00778DQW2|2|Eh - this model is not as good or effective as slightly more expensive models in terms of cutting efficiency or comfort.
B002FKQDYK|3|Smooth great price. It feels soft on skin perfect color for my face.. I order it all the time..
B00112HRTI|5|I have always loved this shade of lipstick, it is Amazon that I am no longer happy with. I have the printed out reciept that shows I ordered 2 of these, and when I wrote Amazon, they just must have passed it on to the store that they sent my order to, and they just sent a base email that stated they only got an order for 1. It really hurt my feelings, and I had always trusted Amazon for years, now I don't!<br />  Sincerely,<br />  Brenda Rivosecchi
B005VSXUQM|4|I haven't used this product but once and I really don't have a good feedback to give.  I like the way it smells but as far as Aphrodiasic, the jury is still out.
B002VD54J6|5|I love this fragrance. After smelling it on another person, I looked for it and I am so glad to be able to find it on Amazon at less pricing than on the website. It has a very clean and light citrus scent that does have long staying power. Just what anyone would need as not to overpower your surrounding.
B007GFVK6A|5|I've been a Lancome customer for MANY years & to this day contribute my skin, which I'm very proud of, to using Lancome products from the days in which I was taught the importance of using good quality creams & lotions.... :)  I can't say enough great things about Lancome Absolue as it's perfect in every way & high end quality which speaks for itself... Non greasy, feels great & above all it actually performs the way it's described to do.....  Wonderful product!!  To be honest, I usually have purchased all of my Lancome products at the cosmetic counters at major departments stores & have always paid much more the amount I did on Amazon.  Actually, I shop on Amazon & saw that they offered Lancome products & when I saw the prices I went for it.  This was my first time purchasing cosmetic items from here but it won't be the last.....  Additionally, I received this product much faster than the ETA for had it within 3-4 days of ordering!  Outstanding service & price for Lancome products that are indeed, in my opinion, the top of the line!  I also ordered my Lancome Renergie products from here, again you can't beat the price.... As a longtime Lancome customer who admires & appreciates the quality products Lancome offers, I highly recommend them for my skin is living proof that it works..  My only advice is to 'start young' using age appropriate Lancome creams  & don't stop for you'll never regret it as you get into your 30's; 40's; 50's; 60's and on & on..... Your skin will be & is the payoff !! :)
B00027DMI8|4|I have been using this for about a month and a half. I started out using it every other day because I had read the reviews about irritation until you get used to the retinol.  The irritation is annoying because there is burning and itching but not unbearable.  I am past the worst of the irritation and now I use it every night and I am going through the skin flaking stage, it's like you got a slight sunburn and your skin is peeling in some areas. I use Olay Night Cream in the morning after I wash my face (I know it's for night) and the ROC before I go to bed. My skin is much brighter, my freckles and an age spot that was on my nose has almost disappeared.  The wrinkles around my eyes have lessened which really surprises me, I'm not used to a product, especially an age defying product, actually working.  I don't look drastically younger but my face does look better.  I don't know how long it will last, but for now, I am very satisfied with the results of this product.
B0059NA3MI|4|I bought this BB cream, because I have really dry skin. When I first used it, I thought it was too dark, but the second time I used it I waited about 10-15 minutes to dry, and found that it matched my skin tone really well. So, I would recommend waiting after you apply it. I found that the product does moisturize well, but it feels a little heavy on my face. On the other hand, it would make an awesome tinted moisturizer on days you don't feel like wearing a lot of makeup. The bottom line--- the price, and the moisturizing aspect is enough that I would buy it again.
B00ID579WQ|5|I decided to buy this and give it a try.  I'm very impressed with it. Easy to use.  Best price I found.
B005SPESLY|5|Absolutely love the way my hair looks.  This kit was a life saver - my hair was frizzy and looked unprofessional and constantly like I'd just got done jogging in 100 degree weather.  I hated it! I read the warnings on here first and proceeded carefully.  My hair is colored frequently, so I left the mixture (which is pretty much just relaxer - you'll definitely recognize the perm smell!) on my hair five minutes less than the directions specified.  I had a little melting scare during the come through and immediately rinsed the solution out.  It's been a month now and I am still very happy with the end results.  It's straight, shiny and looks a 100 times better than it did before. People have complimented me on it. The most important thing to remember is do NOT lose track of time and leave it in too long.  Way better to err on the side of caution.  I think that anyone who tries this sort of thing at home has to be aware of the possible consequences and remember that you can always do more, but that you can't UNdo over processing.
B005UL3LVY|5|I love all of them. They're smooth and pretty, the colors are great. I would definately buy them again, for a gift or for me. In comparison to other brands I can find on my city, I prefer Shany's!!!<br /><br />Only one of them had the lipstick in the lid.. but well, they came all the way to Mexico, and it's not a big deal, I mean.. I only had to put it back.. and presto!. I don´t know why people spect them to arrive in perfect conditions after all the hours of traveling. Better buy them in a store..
B000HQ3WW0|5|I'm very happy I found these gowns online!   Before finding it here at Amazon I tried some massage related catalogs but they were way too expensive.     My patients get neck and back massage so the back opening is perfect for them and the price is right! Good fabric, good size, overall great product.
B006RFZ5ZM|4|Pretty good scrub. It's a little rough if you have sensitive skin, but mixing it with water makes it gentle enough.
B003KOQ1NI|5|I love this MK lipstick.  The color is one that will go with any color you're wearing.  It stays on longer and does not leave my lips dry.  I would certainly buy another lipstick like this.
B00JTTHI2Q|5|I love them! I wasn't able to get the same chape in my eyebrows and now thanks to this stencils my eyebrows looks great!!!!!!
B001DI0ZSK|4|This is a wonderful curling that does exactly what I need it do.  The chord is long enough to where I don't have to use an extension chord.  The temps are nice for natural or hair extensions.
B005HJTTM4|1|I bought these trying to save a few bucks in replace of the Konad or Monster Bundle plates and Im mad that I did.  When I received them, they were in clear packages that had the brand name cut off each one.  I took one out to look at it and the metal disk was so razor shape, it sliced my index finger and pretty deep at that.  I took a look at all of them and all the images are so shallow and blurred due to the small size of them.  The full images will not even fit on my adult thumb all the way.  I tried to do a return and the seller canceled my return.  I also emailed them asking for THE MANUFACTURES name.  These are DANGEROUS plates and if young girls are going to use them, they can really get hurt and cut from the sharp edges.  They will soon have a lawsuit on their hands.  DO NOT BUY THESE!  Spend the money and get the good ones!
B00KCTER3U|1|sorry but seen no changes
B003DZXC36|5|I have light brown hair and very sparse eyebrows.  Other reviewers have said they thought this had a reddish tint, and I don't see this at all and consider it neutral in tone. It may be too dark for those that have very light to light blonde hair and brows.  I love that it goes on easily without tugging, looks natural, and has the clear gel on the other end of the tube.  Someone else stated she didn't like putting glue on their eyebrows.  Maybe she received a bad or expired product because I have used this for 2 years now, and the gel is definitely not glue-like.  It is clear and lightweight and holds hairs in place without being sticky at all.  I absolutely love that it's an all in one pencil on one end and a brush with gel on the other end.  I consider it to be water resistant, not water proof.  But really, what make up is totally water proof?<br /><br />I recently tried a couple different highly and highly rated products when this product was temporarily unavailable and switched back to this when it became available.  I buy two at a time now to make sure I am not without.
B01173VRAU|5|&#34;This is a gift for my sisiter who said this brush is so adorable and convenient.  If she in travel, carrry this one is enough!! Thank you!!&#34;
B001TH8Y60|3|My first thought about this product was what a odd idea.  Ok I will review it for amazon.  I really didn't expect it to work and the brush is very firm, way too firm I suspect for many people.  At first I thought there would be no refreshing taste but eventually it does get there.     While it is better than nothing I will not be using this product in the future.
B00MQGSU2G|5|It is heavy. I think it will be fun to wear for Halloween.  A lot of hair.
B00J88OIMQ|5|I love this product! I'm always on the lookout for moisturizer and I think I've found the one that works for me. It really does melt on your skin and leaves it feeling soft and well moisturized. I highly recommend this product.
B0034BV6KA|3|I'm only giving this 3 stars because it stopped so many times due to the blades getting stuck every time a small piece of lint ball was too big to move underneath them and into the storage compartment.   Pros:   Lightweight even with 2 batteries  Does what it says  Extremely affordable   Easy to empty out and clean  Cons:  Small space for lint, fuzz, etc. to enter into storage compartment.  Fuzz catches underneath blades too often due to buildup of pieces that aren't able to go into storage compartment.   If you have several big areas to run the fabric shaver through, you have to shave the area several times to remove almost all lint, fuzz, etc.  I used the fabric shaver the day I got it in the mail and on 4 badly fuzz covered sweaters caused by purse straps. Once I finished, you couldn't tell there was any fuzz there in the first place.   So far so good.
B00I3PZ8QU|5|This has been the best anti-wrinkle and aging product I have yet to try and the fact that it is in a pill form and gluten free is only an added plus. I first learned about this product on Dr. Oz and then after some research, decided to go with Nutragene Formulas due to their ingredients and guarantee. I am so happy with this product and will continue to use!
B004DTPKNQ|5|I use this for my 2 and 4 year olds. It smells great and doesn't contain the nasty ingredients that other kids' shampoos contain. Washes and rinses well. Doesn't leave the kids hair greasy either. I use it with the Yes to Carrots conditioner. I also use the Yes to Carrots hair line for myself. I love it!
B00WV074XS|5|I LOVE IT! This lotion smells fantastic and makes your skin feel great!
B00008BNZ4|5|Best investment I've made.  Wife cuts my hair and I've saved enough to buy 10 of these.
B002PR2GLM|4|I have used the more expensive brand of Argan oil that comes in a blue box before settling for this. I stumbled upon this at a local Sally Beauty supply store and thought I'd give it a try since I didn't want to shell out another $40 for the other brand. I compared it to the other product and I can say it works as well and it is much cheaper...you can get four of these for the price of just one of the moree expensive product. For a savvy shopper like me, this equals tamed hair and happy wallet :D
B00GR0EI9Q|5|My friends call me Sasquatch. I'm not tall and I don't have big feet. What I do have is an exceptionally hairy body. When I take off my shirt, it looks like I'm wearing a sweater underneath. If it was just my chest, that would be one thing but the hair on my back is even thicker and my butt cheeks...you don't want to hear about my butt cheeks. Most of the time, I let the hair grow. Removing it is such a pain and when it grows back it's horribly itchy. But once in a while, like before my recent trip to Hawaii, I shave my back so I don't scare anyone at the beach. Actually, my wife does most of the shaving because it's rather difficult to shave own's one back. So, I got the Schick Hydro 5. My wife usually uses my safety razor but she now prefers the Schick Hydro. With the safety razor, it generally requires several passes, a lot of rinsing, and a change of blade. The Schick Hydro 5 did it much more efficiently. She still had to rinse the hair out often but it took much less time and didn't require a blade change.  I even trimmed the neck area below my beard after she was done with my back and it was still a smooth, comfortable shave.
B0009SV1XS|5|Happy with product but did not realise that postage from the UK to New Zealand was going to be more than the actual purchase. Oh well you learn by your mistakes. But as I said really happy with the product
B004AME6K4|4|This really works well, ,my hair can get pretty tangled (relaxed) hair.<br />I would recommend this on all types of hair you can't go wrong
B003UTE4NM|5|Love!
B004DB3KXG|5|Bright!
B006GQYSGE|4|I have a son on chemo who has lost his hair and this razor has been a blessing both physically and emotionally. It's smooth and quiet.
B00BTTQKFK|2|Exspensive
B002C741NQ|5|I read the reviews before I bought these clippers. I was a little hesitant to buy them based on what the few negative reviewers said. We used them on our three year old son last night and I am so impressed. He was terrified of our last set of clippers. They were painful and loud.<br /><br />His haircut with this set of clippers turned out so nice. At first he was terrified of getting his haircut. We had to kind of hold him against his will to start. But as soon as my husband started swiping the clippers through his hair he relaxed and started having a good time. He let us do the whole haircut while he talked and talked. He said the new clippers were nice ones and he wanted to keep them in the house.<br /><br />My husband cuts my sons hair and I was afraid this set would be awkward for him since its a smaller design for ladies hands but it wasn't awkward at all. I highly recommend these clippers to anyone who is looking for a nice set but is unsure what to buy. If you are extremely picky and are used to very high end clippers you will probably find something wrong with these clippers, but I honestly can't understand how anyone could find any reason to complain about this set of clippers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />~ Very quiet. Sound is comparable to, but slightly louder than an electric toothbrush.<br />~ Lightweight for easy maneuvering and control.<br />~ Cordless. Gives you the ability to cut anywhere you want, even outside, and to move freely.<br />~ Self sharpening blades and uses no blade oil.<br />~ Instructional DVD for a true novice hair cutter.<br />~ Comb tips are designed very well with rounded tips and plastic that has some give, which provides extra comfort.<br />~ Charge indicator light tells you when unit is fully charged, also when there is only enough power left for one haircut.<br />~ Accessories: Nice quality. Scissors, cape, comb, blade brush, adjustable guides, instructional DVD, and nice storage case.<br />~ Versatile and inexpensive. This unit is worth every penny.
B002NHUXVE|1|The item I received was very small. I could not get any bottles into the elastic holders. It definitely would not hold 14 bottles. It would hold more like 4, maybe.
B0095JFWK0|5|I and my 5 year old daughter have naturally curly hair.  Brushing is always a point of tension as she often has tangles.... This brush has saved my sanity... so good at gently busting through tangles, my daughter no longer fights getting her hair brushed.
B000VEQLHQ|5|08.03.2015 My mirror was delivered.  I am so happy!  Thank you ever so much!  With my bad eyesight I am able to apply light make up@
B00AXRBAEA|1|I have heard great things about B&B creams,and I trust Loreal for quality products.  My first tube just arrived.  No one said it was highly perfumed.  I just smeared a bit on my cheek to test the color,and my gosh, the smell is overwhelming, and is still making me almost gag.  I will have to wash it off without  leaving it on long enough to find out if it makes my skin break out.  I am SO disappointed.
B000VRTE9A|5|Its thick, so you dont have to use alot on your face. everytime I use it I only use two drops. Removes scars and hyperpigmentation. Pure vitamin e oil. Dont use this as a moisturizer for the face, it may break you out. Use this product after you are done putting moisturizer on your face. It removes hyperpigmentation and scars in weeks, if used everyday, morning and evening. Gives skin a glowing and smooth look.
B00B6L2OX8|5|these are great!!!!
B0007DHMBK|5|Yay, no allergies!!!  The color is great.  It's easy to use.  The wait time is not too long and, best of all, zero allergic reaction, which is a real plus for someone with highly sensitive skin, scalp, etc.
B001AN0YR0|4|I'm new to eyebrow tinting, so wasn't sure what to expect but now I'm hooked! I was so worried about the color, it goes on really dark, but after rinsing, it's a perfect match. It saves me so much time vs trying to pencil in sparse areas every morning. I'm not certain that it last 6 weeks but I use a strong, detoxifying face wash that could be why for me. One time is to purchase an angled eyeliner brush. This makes the application easier and flawless. I experimented on my lashes, that I do not recommend. But on my brows I did not experience any sensitivity. The medium brown looks natural in all lighting. I was afraid it might have a funky hue in the sun but it doesn't. Looks great.
B00FFCMEZC|5|Really good quality butter! I order from this company a lot because I feel that I'm purchasing quality. My man's father had a really bad case of eczema from Chemotherapy, his skin looked like that of an alligator and he could not find relief to get any sleep. I purchase these butters and made a body butter and in about a week and a half, his skin was totally clear from the dry patches that he had previously suffered from. I was trying to help him sleep, I didn't realize that it would clear his skin in this manner. Thanks to the company for putting such a great product out there.
B00DRPUN2A|5|Never stop selling this! I have used this porduct for years and can only find it on line. Thank you
B00B7UPNQS|5|This product left my hair feel smooth and silky even when it was still wet (I wasn't sure I had it all rinsed out).  It took my unruly hair and tamed it to something I felt was wonderful and luxurious.  I recommend using the shampoo and the one-minute recharge with it for the maximum effect.
B000EVEKLA|1|I use Grecian formula and decided to try this for a change of pace. I used it once and my hair smelled horrible for two days despite my washing it each day. If you care enough to eliminate your gray, you don't want to smell like this stuff.
B000JIK45Y|5|This is a great fragrance.  Similar to Escada's Ibiza Hippie.  It's French, and is a good low price alternative to the Escada brand.  Price range should be between $25-40 for a 2oz. bottle of EDT in America.
B0016KM5YC|4|When I use this stuff, it doesn't really change color as much as it says it will, so it can be hard to tell if it's working if you just judge based on that requirement. I could tell if it was working based on how my skin felt. Chemical hair removers always leave behind that kind-of tingling residue, you know the feeling I'm talking about. Lather this around until that feeling goes away.<br />The product does do its job well though. My skin feels loads better after using it, and I know I don't have to worry about what those chemical residues will do to my body.
B00LXHCFR0|1|The conditioner was ok. But the shampoo...my hair went so dry and twined together after using this
B005AY7XZ6|4|I have been using it for about 3 weeks and have lost only three pounds, but that is by doing NOTHING else, no diet, no increased exercise...so I think it is working. I find that I can't finish as much of my meals.  Taste good too!
B006PANYDE|5|Beautiful, year round color that is soooo flattering.  Love it.
B003BMPCMK|5|Great deal! Buff Puff quality
B00JI5JEV4|4|Good firmness of bristle with the brushes.
B0030YLW0K|5|I really like this toothpaste. I don't breakout from it and it does help keep my teeth white along with regular whiting routine.
B003JMWRCK|4|Helps me limit nail biting.... great product I would really recommend this to anyone who has a nail biting problem
B000UK2W4C|5|Good product that all should be using.  My daughter in law is a DDS and speaks highly of these toothbrushes.
B00JGCU9BS|5|First off, this bottle is super cute and a little blingy but not too much.  The rhinestones definitely won't fall out and the bottle is non-slip and fits very comfortably in my hand.  The mist covers a large section of my hair although it's not an abundance of water...it's truly a fine mist.  There are no leaks, so far which can be a very annoying thing when you just want to spritz your hair and water runs down your arm from a faulty sprayer.  The only issue I might have with this is if I had paid $14.99.  I think that's a bit steep even for this bottle. Otherwise, it's a better than many I've purchased at a lesser price.
B004XJPMHU|5|These Tassi's are absolutely great, especially getting ready for work in the morning.  Would definitely purchase again.
B00DZVKHXG|5|I love using automatic things. This curler makes it perfect for me. Wrapping hair around typical irons is too much of a hassle and hazard. I have thin, long hair so the low level works great for me. My curls hold really well.
B006L0ZQ5M|5|works great thanks
B001F51QQG|5|Ruminator said it best: \\"These razors have been getting the job done for me for over twenty years. You may try the next greatest razor, but you'll always come back to the original Good News razor. No pivot, no slime, and skin as smooth as a bowling ball.\\"  (And without the knicks & cuts that the old original single-blade re-useables give me.)
B008RALJ50|3|I purchased this when I was just about totally incapacitated due to broken bones.  It made my hair look a little better but not totally clean.  My hair looked as if I just wet it with water rather than doing an actual shampoo.  Better than nothing I guess.  What little cleaning it did accomplish did not seem to last long.
B002CKYZMK|4|This is a good multifunctional brush. Oddly enough, I don't use this brush to apply foundation. I use it to apply concealer to blemishes, under eye concealer, and face masks. It performs all of these tasks well and I never experience any shedding when washing the brush. I wouldn't recommend using a flat sided foundation brush like this one for applying foundation because it takes forever and leaves streak marks down your face that take extra time to be blended out. If you are looking for an inexpensive foundation brush I recommend elf's stippling brush or powder brush. The powder brush is another great multifunctional brush that applies powders, blush, and foundation flawlessly. Do not buy this  brush off Amazon! I did and felt incredibly dumb when I went on elf's website and found the brush for one dollar. Elf is always having great sales online and you could buy several brushes on their site for the price you would pay for this brush on here. Also, don't expect this brush to be a miracle worker. Have realistic expectations. It's a one dollar brush.
B005UGVIQ4|4|I attempted making my own mascara and this was exactly what I needed. I would recommend buying the small funnel that is a suggested purchase as it is hard to fill. I used a plastic bag with a hole cut in the corner and it was a bit messy
B005QG52F6|3|It makes your curls pop but beware putting too much on. Your hair hardens and the product will flake and I don't mean minimum flaking, I'm talking a freaking blizzard here.
B002RW9C3A|1|this is okay. not impressed by any of the FAB products. Won't buy again.<br />oatmeal mask is good, the rest - I'm all set w/. Does nothing special .. already moved on to a different and see better results for me.
B00TKS5Y3Q|5|Bought this nail clipper set for my 14 yr old son and he really likes it (much better than the clipper set he had).  Worth every penny to see him finally taking care of those toenails!!
B000F4USF8|4|Don't listen to all these people complaining that the plastic beard trimmer breaks after 10 or 20 uses. They are either idiots or way too hard on the product. I've had this product for years and the plastic piece was just fine and never cracked or broke. If you use it as intended and don't drop it or smash it or hard on it then you will never have a problem just like the majority of these people who love it. I will say that I am buying a replacement because my battery just died but I've had it for years so I'm not hugely mad or concerned about that. If I would've kept the receipt from target Panasonic says they would've fixed it for me under warranty or something but I threw away the receipt so that's my fault. I do have one major complaint though and that's why I would give it either at three or four stars and that's the minute sure tremor that extends outward. Not the main trimmer but the miniature one. I think this miniature tremor is designed for fine exact trimming of beard and mustache us so you can get something really close on the edge however when you extend it it's equal and the links to the main tremor and so when you go to try and use it it's too close to the big trimmer therefore it is totally useless because you will end up cutting off hair that you don't want to cut off because the main large tremor ends up touching your beard are your mustache or your hair instead of the small tremor on my. That is a huge design flaw. However I get around this by just taking off the plastic guard and using the main large trimmer on any fine meticulous trimming. I also just use my Gillette fusion razor on the backend which has a single blade used for trimming in the bottom and top of my beard to make straight lines. Overall I would highly recommend this Panasonic product mainly because it lasted me for years, because it has a Thone of flank settings, because you can use it dry or wet, because you can use it plugged in or cordless, and because it comes with a brush toclean it and oil to keep it well oiled. This is been the best product I've ever bought for trimming my beard and I have all and probably three or four over the last 15 years.
B000P22TUW|5|smells great
B000XVTYS0|5|I really loved this razor. The five blades are wonderful and they work better than other five blade razors because they don't have those annoying little wires running up and down them. I really love this razor, although the cost is a tad high for disposable razors, but I find they last a bit longer to make up for the cost.
B003CYKOD4|3|This product works well, using just a capful in the bath water. The foam lasts throughout the bath and it does not leave a ring. I do not, however, like the aroma and will not be reordering it.
B0035AM9JM|3|Not as whitening as I thought they would be from the ad.
B0061DPB04|5|It might not work for everyone, but I know it works for me. Especially during the summer. My favorite shampoo of all time!
B0034QW0J6|5|This is by far the best mascara I've ever used: my lashes are loooong and it doesn't clump.  I have backups just in case I can't find it anymore!
B009L13NQC|5|In all my years of wearing perfume, never has anyone ever commented on the aroma till now.  Waitresses in restaurants, people in offices or stores, all ask, what is that great smell.  It's Cleopatra, by Tocca!  I can't smell it on myself, but others do.  I love it.
B000P22TIY|5|Great price, it is the real thing and a large amount of it.
B0051B5IV4|5|I have used the sodium laurel sulfate free toothpaste for years.  I doesn't have that foaming agent in it and if you get canker sores or herpetic lesions on your lips you will get much less (if any) while using this toothpaste.  A side effect is it tends t whiten your teeth.  Just saying.
B00027C9CS|5|So I have been using head & shoulders most of my life...never had an issue with dandruff exactly but I do easily get dry skin so I liked to take precautions. I never liked the cost of head & shoulders though nor the smell but I heard that peppermint is an all natural dandruff aid so I figured I would give it a try. WOW I am glad I did! The smell is incredible, not too overpowering, if it was I wouldn't use it. My hair & scalp feel amazing & I know it is thanks to this. I did a test...I started using this shampoo & noticed a difference, went back to head & shoulders for 3 days & my head started itching after using it & then again went back to this & my head felt better...I think head & shoulders & other dandruff shampoos actually make the scalp worse..
B00IDWP4IA|5|Dries very quickly, skin feels tighter and not as red and blotchy, citrusy smell grows on you. Customer service that follows up on product purchase. Will purchase this serum again.
B006UET4XE|5|I've been trying to find a nice liquid eyeliner to use and I stumbled upon this. It leaves beautiful bold lines! It dries up pretty quickly and lasts the whole day for me! I use this on an everyday basis. It's really nice for doing make-up in the morning, so if you're looking for a helpful liner to get your day going, I recommend this!
B008S6IQP4|2|After four months the wires broke and it stopped function. The reason they broke is the swivel chord mechanism was nearly dis-functional.
B00EJR25N0|5|I have major heel pain and the powerstep has been perfect for relieving it when I walk!
B000N758A2|5|This stuff is truly amazing.  I have thick, wavy, high-and low-lighted hair--a recipe for snarls.  Before using this stuff, and having tried everything from Aveda to John Frieda, I could barely get a comb through it.  A few days of using this serum, and I can get a comb through no problem, my hair doesn't frizz in the humidity, and it's shinier and healthier than it's been in a long time.  The really impressive thing about it is that the benefits don't seem to wash out--so many conditioning/detangling/frizz-free products seem to come out with shampooing and leave my hair in the same condition it was before, if not worse, but this actually does condition my hair, and I don't even have to use it every day.  And, as the other reviewers said, it's got a wonderful, toasty, sweet, beachy smell.  Definitely recommended.
B00CJ1YFZY|4|If you've ever been to a Spa/Mani-Pedi Salon, you know that the providers have their own rasp/tools. However, this is really unsanitary if they don't disinfect and clean in properly. So, my advice is when going for a pedicure, bring your own tools so that you know it's a safer alternative  to heavily used pedicure tools. This is helpful especially when you are going out of town and you are not familiar with the practices of that establishment. Better to be safe from infection, then get sick.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lightweight<br />-Durable<br />-Softens even the most troubled feet<br />-Fits in my portable tote bag<br />-Great to travel with (checked in bag only)<br />-Easy to clean (just make sure to use a new toothbrush for cleaning so you don't scratch yourself)<br />-2 in 1 product (now you don't have to buy two)<br />-Great on stubborn calluses (after I had foot surgery, I had to contend with a callus under the ball of my foot. This is great for minimizing that issue)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Instructions not in English (packaging was in Korean).<br /><br />About the Seller:<br />I ordered my #1 Foot File Rasp and Corn Callus Remover (2 in 1 Product) from EDK Distributing on 7/21/13 and it arrived on 7/24/13...on time and neatly packaged. The seller also had sent properer verification as to when the product would be delivered and when it shipped. Although the instructions on the packaging was in Korean, I am thankful that a day after I received my 2 in 1 pedicure tool, I was given more detailed instruction via email. This gratuitous product was provided commensurate for my unbiased review and equitable opinion.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />To the Seller: Please provide an English insert with instructions when shipping this product.<br /><br />To Potential Customers: This is a convenient tool that you want in your household if you want to keep your feet looking good and feeling soft. Hope this helps!
B001GIOW3G|5|No breakouts with my breakout-prone and sensitive skin.  I suggest mixing it 1/2-1/2 with your regular moisturizer, as a little goes a long way!!  No greasiness...and face feels baby smooth and soft.
B0083XGNWK|4|These gloves shipped and arrived promptly. They fit comfortably. $7.95 a pair was more than I wanted to pay, but I could not find any competitor.
B0015NZ6FK|5|This is perfect!!!!
B0011DIXJU|3|Inconsistent quality. My recent order was a little bit softer than it's supposed to be. Thus making it harder to style my hair
B005SM8CT6|2|This polish is the most expensive in my nail polish collection and in my opinion it was NOT wort it. it looks really nice in the sun but indoors it looks pretty plain, like a gray/lavender glitter polish.
B0012J30LY|5|I grew up using Elizabeth Arden's face creams, but it was just getting too expensive. While my skin was soft, I was still experiencing break outs, so I searched for a new option. After trying many high end creams, I gave Olay Regenerist a shot...I mean, all these positive reviews couldn't be wrong right? Nope. I've now been using the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for about 3 years and love it. I use it every night before going to bed and my skin is just as soft as it was when I used other high end creams (but I'm spending about half the price!).<br /><br />It's a creamy compound and goes on to your skin silky smooth, not greasy or too thick. I've tried both the versions (with and without fragrance) and I've found that I actually like the light fragrance. My husband actually likes the scent (and he's super picky!) as well. If I forget to use it a couple nights, my skin feels dry and gets flaky, so it's definitely doing it's job. Not to mention, my skin doesn't break out as often! Win-Win-Win. Give it a shot, if it doesn't work for you, at least you're not out $50+.
B00GMXIZE2|5|I love this product! I had two brown sun spots that are seriously fading after only a few weeks.  Make up goes on so smoothly after applying the product.  I highly recommend the serum!
B0054GM0D0|5|This is one of the best trimmers and facial hair removers ever and I have tried a few. It is good for facial hair removal, trimming, and all personal grooming. My sister has one too and we both recommend them. We absolutely love it.
B0081PG3MA|3|lightly tinted and goes on smoothly with minimal oiliness, but gave my sensitive skin itchy red bumps within a few days of use.
B003V9N1RQ|2|i dont like the smell at all.
B0000532RE|2|Unfortunately, I must be in the .001% of the population who have hypersensitive skin.  The normal aluminum chlorohydrate products give me no problem, but I can last about 2 days on this before  I get a rash.  C'est la vie...
B00TGB6EN6|5|Love these NYX Wicked Lippies Lipsticks!!!!!!!!!! Love the colors!!!!!!!!!!! I got myself quite a few in varies colors. This Wrath is one of my favourites!!!
B004UQ6Q62|4|Works well for quick shave on my face, but not well on my neck. I have no problem using a blade for my neck every other day, so overall I am satisfied.
B004U3XNMA|5|very creamy..<br />good price
B000NBQUNW|5|The Benecol chews are totally delicious.  My doctor recommended them, I haven't had my cholesterol checked since I started talking them so I don't know yet how well they work, but when I do I'll add to this post.  In the meantime as I said they are delicious, you don't know you're taking `medicine' at all!
B000GDC4IM|4|This is the second time I have ordered Murad Shield Age Spot Lightener. I have certainly seen an improvement and lightening of the dark age spots I have on my face. I still must use cosmetics to cover the dark areas but my skin has improved.
B006R8AB0I|2|Smells good, doesn't last.
B001IZ0V7S|5|Great! Love it!
B002EBX3V6|5|On Time, as expected
B00J2APS60|4|Husband loved these razors didn't love the replacement price
B004PX6K20|5|I have to apologize in saying this didn't heal....it did/has!  I put on my feet every night & they are getting smoother & smoother.  In my case it's somewhat of a miracle.  It does take a couple of weeks to do it's magique so be patient.  My pedicurist remarked how well my feet looked.<br />It arrived as promised & I do feel price was good for the size. I don't know about her other products or scents.  This scent is strong so it would interfere w/my day or evening perfume.<br />Great buy, better purchase.
B005EIIAPA|4|Great black eye pencil.
B004H3QCPS|4|My doctor recommended this product.  I'very been using it twife daily for several months. Seems to help.  I use every morsel from the tube because it's pricey.
B005MEFCKM|4|I have been using this along with a few other products and noticing a gradual/subtle change.  I use this a few times a week and apply moisturizer daily.  The combination has made a difference that I can see.
B003VUL8IY|1|The cap broke and couldn't go back on.I could smell the scent of the mouthwash even before I open the package. Now I couldn't return it because it's flammable and the cap doesn't work anymore. Disappointed....I hope someone could tell me what to do....
B002BTV3AY|4|So far it's a fine products....
B001VEK1IU|1|I ordered this item for my Braun Electric Razor expecting it would perform as well as previous replacements I had purchased in the past. I Was Sorely Dissappointed!!! It does not cut the whiskers, rather it plucks them!!! This item is of Extremely Inferior Quality! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!
B00HDZGF4K|4|been using the vitamin c serum and the hyalaronic acid serum both for a couple of weeks now - not extremely careful about which i use - i grab one of the serums out of the drawer and apply it in the morning before moisturizer - so definitely not an exact science but whether it is the combination or one of the other, i do notice that my face is smoother and color is more even - will continue using them as they are easy ti use and give noticeable results
B007MF5UOM|4|I must start by saying that this item was bought as a gift for my granddaughter who is a &#34;Hunger Game&#34; fan and have therfore, not used any of the polish.  I know that my nail salon uses China Glaze polish, so I'm presuming that these will be good.  I just the idea of one for each of the districts!
B000277P5E|3|Everybody's gotta shave right?  started buying stuff like this online since it's cheaper here than in the store.  work and look exactly the same.
B0026921KK|5|Can't say enough about them
B00C77HSAE|5|It's the best sun protection product out on the market. Being a golfer I'm out in the sun a lot. I love the feel of the smoothness when applying to face. My face never feels dry & never sunburns.
B00U68N9AO|5|This curls really well. I was surprised at how much better it works than my previous eyelash curler. Something in the mechanism just seems more solid and curls my lashes with almost no effort.
B002SYXHTC|5|First of all, I received this crazy fast! This product was first used on me by my stylist and I absolutely fell in love with the scent and the way it made my hair feel. I bought this immediately after getting home and it came two days later! I am absolutely thrilled with the seller and the product! Definitely recommend if you have unruly hair after a shower
B001ET73GA|5|Hi-<br />  I have been using this Avalon Shampoo as a face, head, and bodywash for whenever I travel to  hotels (40x+  yr.) for the past three years....it is generally far better than what is there and it \\"wakes-me-up\\" with modest mintiness.  At home, I often use a few drops to wash my face.  Despite, it's label as a \\"Shampoo\\", it is mild enough for my face.  The only other brands that have this peppermint in good quantity are the Dr. Bronner's which is very strong,  a Walgreens brand (Rosemary/Mint large) which is cheaper and good, and the over-priced expensive designer brand, which will go nameless.  I like the container because it fits into my tumi toiletry bag pocket, does not leak, and is not too insanely over-priced.  I use the Walgreens more at home to cut costs.  I use the Dr. Bronner's to REALLY wake-up...it burns if left on for more than 15secs or so undiluted....great for deodorizing those annoying underarms.<br /><br />  BTW they also sell this at Whole Foods Markets along with the other type.....I also like the lemon or orange extracts.  The have it labeled in different bottles as bodywash, shampoo, handwash, etc...but I think they all the same and get whatever is cheapest.<br /><br />  SInce Whole Foods is quite a trip from my house, this Amazon 3-pack deal is great with the shipping (save on gas).  Oh, Trader Joes also used too or does carry some Avalon products but now I am not sure.<br /><br />Hope this Helps!<br /><br />-Paul
B000GLRREU|5|I floss, rinse, get my teeth cleaned regularly and do all the right things, yet the Waterpik leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than anything.
B001W2N3OA|5|Been on these for almost two months, no side effects, feeling great! Highly recommended products that covers ALL necessary bases.
B006HT0AK8|5|Came uber quick! love the simplicity if it. Takes off make up and all other skin clogging residues.Noticed skin to be brighter and clearer in 4 days!
B003U05566|5|So long as I don't forget to wash my face with this, then I don't break out. I've been using this since 2008 when I was aggressively sold one by a pretty lady.
B00NV6Y9FW|2|Not &#34;mixed&#34; colors. One orange and the rest were light blue. I needed a variety of colors and assumed there would be more than one or two colors. Great price--if you don't care what colors you get.
B0014LL3FK|5|I love this lotion; it leaves my skin soft and smelling wonderful.  The scent lingers all day.  Shipping was exceptionally fast, although the packaging could use some padding.
B003UNPS0Q|3|Don't really notice any big difference with frizz or dry time. But it does smell really good. So I guess it could be worth it to some. I do have pretty thin hair, maybe someone with thicker hair would notice a bigger difference.
B0042L0CUQ|5|Excellent!
B001BO0KMC|5|love it.  Hard to find this size in the stores.  Great for adding slight wave to hair or taking the frizz out. Not as harsh as a straight iron.
B003GCWJFS|5|i dont normally write reviews but i just had to for this product. Now i use MAC cosmetics yeah i know expensive but i love/need the coverage it provides. I had been looking for a palette now for a while and yes MAC does have palettes but its expensive as hell and a girl can only spend so much so i went looking for something on amazon and came across this. Now i looked at the reviews people were giving it and the one thing i saw was that people complained about the size of each color being too small, I didnt really care about that as long as its pigmented then its fine. I cheked out the other palettes that they had but fell in love with metal mania. I just got it today and let me tell you the colors are fabulous!!!!the colors are about the size of a dime but they are sooooo pigmented that it makes up for it, it glides on smoothly and it feels like your wearing nothing at all. I was wearing a purple on my eys when i recieved the package and decided to try on the purple in the palette it looked vibrant and sexy lol, i didnt even have to add alot it complimented my skin tone very well.<br /><br /> If your looking for a palette that can go from day/night, isnt too bright and can probaly match every outfit in your closet then go for this palette. Its great I'am getting one for my mom now lol
B001DNE3KQ|5|this baby is noisy, but nothing cuts as close. i am coming off a braun. it was ok for a foil, but this baby rocks. it is very light weight and easy to hold. i cant believe how close a shave i get. much better than a safety razor or any other electric i have owned or tried. very much worth the money. hands down the best!
B00BLYSPOM|1|It was broke when I received it  going to try to return
B000OGBLQ2|5|Deff my favorite !
B00O5120B2|3|Product is prolly good, I just don't like the smell and now I can't return it because it's to hazardous they tell me
B002ZGZQ8S|5|I have always stuggled with my dark circles and was very tiered of people asking me if I was tiered..lol...this cream is amazing I have not been asked that since i've been using this product. It made a huge difference. LOVE IT!
B000ULAWO8|4|great once a week mask that is strong enough to cleanse pores but gentle enough for sensative skin. great for oil control and even better when mixed with the Ayur-Medic Moisture mask.
B0002UFA7Q|3|This was the first product I bought from Bliss and it was somewhat of a disappointment. The product bottle states that it is \\"Bubbling\\" Bath and Shower Gel. That was certainly an overstatement as there were very few bubbles in the bath. If you want a true bubble bath look elsewhere. The smell is pleasant enough but there are many bath and shower gels I own which are a lot creamier and smell a lot better. It all depends on one's preference.
B00D8G4FJU|4|I bought these for my S.O.  The only difference with these blades versus the ones that he had purchased at a local drug store is the lubricating strip is more narrow. So, it took him a couple of shaves to get used the difference.  Now, he says that they are just fine and are very sharp to give a close shave.
B00005AUIE|5|Good
B005C2N8IC|5|The 4-pc set (sold at Target) was given to me by someone who received it as a gift and they did not want it. I've been a Dove facial care person for years, but, I have switched to using this product exclusively. I had no expectations or knowledge about the product. After a couple of months of use (only 1 bar of soap--that I'm still using--and the balancing moisturizer--I've not opened the other 2 items included), my skin is RADIANT, unblemished, and baby soft. I did not have severe acne. I would describe my 'before' skin as blemished, especially around the chin; a few spots on the cheeks and even less on the forehead. I can't remember my face feeling this way before. The moisturizer makes your skin feel velvety silk and gives it the look of having on a light foundation.  Makeup glides on more evenly when I use. I've noticed a distinct difference on the days that I use only Dove--not bad, just not as soft and no glow. I will continue to use these products and I highly recommend them.
B0000VC1WE|4|Although it did improve the razor's performance, I think the razor had been dropped too many times and this was the primary cause for it's decreased performance.  By decreased performance, I mean that the razor was causing razor burn and/or outright cuts in my skin.  Trying to adjust closeness didn't help.  That said, this was still the best electric razor I've ever owned.  I upgraded to the newest Panasonic razor, and it was very disappointing in comparison.
B0010VSUI2|5|I bought this straightener a couple of months ago and I don't know how I lived without it!  I spent $150 on a chi a couple of years ago and thought it was a great straightener, but the chi has nothing on the croc.  I have fine hair, but it's very wavy and now I can have straight hair in about 10 minutes.  I live in Hawaii where the humidity is crazy, but I haven't had any problems with my hair frizzing out even if I work out!  This is the best. . .EVER!
B004V42GUS|4|A good product for the price and very pleasant to be in the vicinity of anyone wearing it. It was a gift and well liked.
B00HHFYHPA|5|This tiara is very elegant and the young lady recipient, who received it as she was honored as an Honor Star, looked absolutely beautiful.
B0000532VC|3|Ok for a refresher. Has no antibacterial in it so if bed bound your not cleaning germs. Thickness is great and can microwave. Price a little high
B000UMG5AW|3|It's ok.  It smells good and all, but doesn't seem to be original.  The smell doesn't last long.
B00O8B9WV0|5|Best applicator brush, and amazing lasting eyeliner - seriously, if I don't take off my make up the night before, it still looks amazing in the morning!<br /><br />I first received this eyeliner as part of a monthly make-up bag subscription (ipsy). I LOVED it! I do a cat eye line, but the skin underneath my eyebrow covers my eye lid, so it's tough to find products that won't smudge by the end of the day.<br /><br />This eyeliner is absolutely perfect! The applicator brush is the best I have used, and I've tried most eyeliners at Sephora and MAC. Since I live in Canada, I couldn't find the Elizabeth Mott eyeliner to replace. I bought 2 others in the meantime. A Deta v T. from Sephora and the best liquid eyeliner from MAC. It just wasn't the same!<br /><br />Then I finally found this eyeliner on Amazon.com. As a Canadian citizen, it costs quite a bit more to have it delivered to me, but it's worth it.<br /><br />If this line ever hints that it will get off the market, I will be extremely sad.
B00C84PTA2|5|Awesome deal!
B00GW1JBU6|5|I love love this product!!!! Can be used as a room deodorizer as well
B00A20OQYE|4|these were simple and so the brush part came apart on one occasion but for the most part they work okay
B004GYQM6C|5|Excellent product
B00JJ4PAYO|3|It's ok takes a while for it to dry, it rubs off on your clothes, and sheets. It has a great color, it last a little bit over a week. One of my cups that came with it had a hole in it and I had to throw it away. It took 6 hours for it to dry that was a little disappointing.
B000F63TW0|5|I love the way my skin looks and feels once used. Leaves my skin with a smooth glow
B0012UEJ1S|2|I gave this 2 stars because I suppose it does work. I have light brown (colored) hair with blonde highlights (naturally dark brown hair) and this did make my color brighter and more dramatic (a bit too blonde maybe) BUT it didn't matter. It dried my hair out more than anything ever has! I tried everything, lots of conditioner before I applied it in the shower, conditioner while my hair was still wet after shower and never rinsed it out, I tried using only a tiny amount, (I have long hair) no matter what, my hair was so dried out and coarse it was horrible I hated it.
B001MA0QY2|5|Love it. Exactly what I was expecting. Delivered in a timely manner. One satisfied customer.
B0049LUI9O|5|Works well
B008VG8UQG|5|I love this shade of purple so gorgeous. It is deep and metallic and beautiful. As with most OPI products, my manicure lasts a week and with this shade I wish it had lasted longer. This is the perfect purple for the Fall/Winter seasons.  You will not be disappointed.
B00HQPSFXG|5|great product.
B00N4PM5T2|4|This is a beautiful blush set.  The colors are very pretty and easy to apply. I prefer my blush to not be as intense,these aren't, but if you like a more intense blush, you can easily build these colors up.  I swatched them with my finger, and they were only slightly chalky.  There are only three matte colors, the rest have shimmer in them. I prefer the lighter pink color. The white color, I can use as a highlight, but that is the only one that really lacks pigmentation.<br /><br />Sample provided
B001DNE3KQ|4|Update Dec 2016: I've been using this razor for nearly 4 years. It still works well. I changed the blade and foil set together a few months ago. I think the battery life has fallen a bit. But everything works. LCD, trimmer etc. Compact and no fuss. I'm glad I didn't spend any more to get a fancier razor. I still recommend the razor.  Original June 2013: I have always used a blade and shaving cream and I continue to use a Gillette Fusion razor. I needed a razor to keep in my laptop bag for those days one gets up too late for a proper shave.  I researched a lot before picking up this razor. Ultimately I wanted something that was cheap to maintain (replacement blades/foils), comfortable and durable. The durability bit is still to be tested, but it is a comfortable razor to hold and it is not too noisy.  Just to get the hang of it, I have been using it everyday and I get results as good as a razor and blade.  That said, if I start with a couple of days of growth (say after a weekend), the razor takes some time to give good results. I have to go over some areas repeatedly to get desired results. Given the time it takes, one is better of using a plain razor and shaving cream.  I would recommend it as a backup shaver. Will update this review after some time (Panasonic mentions 30 days) to see if extended beard growth can be handled more effectively.
B000GEGG12|5|I recieved my polish in about 3 days! I don't even know how they got it to me so quickly! Great transaction!
B000H68J2S|1|This broke almost immedaiytely in a way that was unrepairable.  The pressure of the watter forced the tube our of the connector to the piece that goes into your mouth.  I look at it sometimes (don't ask why I haven't thrown it out yet) and think, man, wouldn't this be nice if it worked?  ::sigh::
B00AM7BSXO|5|great
B000HK1OOY|5|Excellent product that I've been using for years.  Very pleased with this gentle and effective soap, even more so that is completely free of any scent.  On rare occasion, there is sometimes a little bit of eucalyptus that gets in the produce on the line from their eucalyptus soap.  Otherwise, very happy with this
B00CFZJN2Y|3|I was very excited to purchase the cool tec shaver, as I was hoping it would be the \\"magic bullet\\" in my desire to get a clean, close shave with minimal irritation.  I should start however, by saying that I've been using electric shavers for the better part of 30 years.  I've stuck closely to foil shavers as rotary just didn't work for me.  I have got a quick growing dark beard with a lot of grey.  I have used many Braun's including the Series 7, which I feel is still the best Braun available.<br /><br />I am currently using a Panasonic ES-LA 63, which in my opinion, may be the best shaver out there for the price / performance.<br /><br />On to the review of the Cool-Tec.  Firstly, this is a series 5 shaver as noted on the box.  That's not a good thing when you need a very high speed shaver to get the tough areas that even the Series 7 had challenges with.  The Cool-Tec, is a larger shaver and comes with the cleaning system from Braun, which I am less a fan of after using  the Panasonic which I simply wash out under the sink.  As for actual shaver performance, for me it is a middle of the pack shaver.  It definitely had its challenges getting the tough hairs on the bottom of my neck and just under my jaw line.  Although you feel the cooling action of the aluminum bar, its still no replacement for a  good pre shave lotion like Lectric Shave or an actual shave gel or foam which I currently use with my ES-LA63 with great results.<br /><br />So hoping for no irritation - that is not the case with this shaver.  As with any shaver it takes a few weeks to get through the irritation period, however as I have purchased many electric shavers over the years, I know within 1-2 shaves what the shaver will be like in this regard. Braun suggests not using any lotion or pre-shave and that just didn't work for me.  I had massive red blotches on my lower neck area.<br /><br />I did ok by my chin and upper lip area  however that was tempered by the fact that it took quite a few more passes to get it to that level.<br /><br />Again, comparing to my Panasonic, it was no match.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I will be:<br /><br />1.  Returning the Cool - Tec<br />2  Sticking with the Panasonic brand as its 13,000 RPM motors work a lot better for my beard.<br /><br />If you don't want a wet shave, I would go with a Series 7 well before buying the Cool-Tec.<br /><br />Also, I would highly recommend Kiehl's shave lotion as it does a tremendous job coupled with the Panasonic shavers.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00E1HI7J4 Kiehl's Since 1851 'Close-Shavers Squadron' Brushless Shave Cream]]
B00TK8I1W2|5|I LOVE this brush! I use it for cleansing and it works perfectly. The box it came in didn't look great and I thought the brush wouldn't work for long, but I was wrong.
B002MGN72I|5|Wonderful Shampoo....wish you had the 32oz bottle.  Will only use this shampoo on my hair. Used to buy it at Saks Fifth Avenue
B00CGWFCNU|5|Smells great and the smell actually lasts!
B00FRDPOVU|5|This shampoo has everything I needed! Great fragrance, rich lather, clean rinse, and does, indeed , leave my hair feeling like it has more volume. I have very short, gray, thinning hair and keep going back to this product. It does not weigh my hair down with that coated feeling. For me, conditioner is over-kill, so I have never tried theirs. I have used the Fakkai Full Volume Mousse, but it does not have enough hold. If is effective, light and has that divine fragrance, but just not enough of whatever keeps hair in place.
B002AJI4SE|5|WHEN YOU HAVE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR - WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY<br />5 MORE WORDS NEEDED FOR PUBLICATION  - ONE - TWO- THREE - FOUR-FIVE
B006GKHIHQ|4|I like them, they are a bit to long for me but thats no problem, my only issue is that when i received them the packed was all banged up and a pair of the lashes were messed up.
B00FZODNVY|5|Make u slap you mama  delicious
B00AXDSNEE|4|GREAT
B00BDTEKNK|5|Love anything by Mally.  I have used her eye liner for maybe five years and everyone, everyone asks me who I'm wearing! Since she's makeup artist to all the top actresses, I guess it's easy to see how she developed makeup that works!<br />I became aware of her on QVC and she also has a site.
B004C84XWC|5|Love both these products, wish they would make the dark brown of the eyeshadow solo as it is super color and goes great with almost any other eyeshadow colors.  The only thing I might say for the eyeliner is it does smudge a bit, but otherwise great application and I like it.
B005V2UHIW|5|This is a wonderful product.  I'm very happy with it.  It arrived quite quickly too.[[ASIN:B005V2UHIW Eucalyptus Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]
B006GQYSC8|5|This is very smooth saver. Battery is very long lasting so far. Convenient to hold. Recharge in short time but you can not use it when it is plugged in. I recommend this product.
B007B5D9C8|5|Easy to apply, colors are natural looking. Does not smear easily.  One is light enough I use it to fill in my brows.
B003ZYK4F4|5|One of the best colognes out there
B000BCN0H2|4|Nice quality soap, well milled, long lasting.  I don't mind the scent of seaweed, so fortunately this strong scent doesn't last long on the body.
B003WYB1BI|5|I love this flat iron; it makes my hair shine and heats up very fast.  I had a flat iron I purchased from a discount beauty supply.  Then I up graded to this one at the recommendation of a coworker and noticed a considerable difference in the look of my hair.
B0009V1YRS|5|Everybody in my family has one. My sisters and cousins. Their hair is helthy and brilliant after years of use. You just have to use it properly, not to damage your hair. My sister's hair has changed, it is almost completely straight when it dries up by itself, before using the Chi. (After about 4 years of use). I got it for may daughter, and I hope it will do the same for her!!!!
B00BVIMJMW|5|Nice lotion , I mixed it with virgin coconut oil And it make my skin look good
B000FVVVQ6|4|I liked this, but it was a bit expensive, I thought, considering I could only get about 7-8 masks out of the bottle.
B003QTAZVG|5|Arrived quickly! Great product.
B00163JVJQ|5|I purchased this serum and was very happy with the result.  I turned fifty this year and started seeing some damage to my skin including fine lines in my forehead.  This product has been very helpful.  The lines are now a lot less perceptible.  I am pretty happy.  SJL in New York City
B003FV7PRC|1|Didn't work.<br /><br />I had ingrown hair on my tri-weekly wax part and the dark spots left behind them. I followed the instructions to the T and still I would get ingrown hair but it did do something for the spots. Nothing great but something but for the money, I expect better. Will not be buying again.
B008BWPCIY|5|Just got the piercing today and I just pierced my own tragus. Piercing is so cute and the right size. Came a day early. I have ordered from this seller three times and I have no complaints.
B000052Y6A|5|I am afraid that I really cannot speak to how good this product is because I lost a good bit of mustache fighting a grass fire but if I remember I'll update the review when it grows back.
B00O6HV822|5|Very good
B0063I3RNA|5|Love it. Smells good. Easy to use pump. Great for sensitive skin. Highly recommend.
B000GI0VEQ|5|Curve has the best smelling perfumes and cologne! Great product! Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it :)
B00EL3KPKM|5|I have bought so many different hair pieces and extensions, etc. This is by far the best fit, the best made and the best colors to choose from of any website or store I have been in from Florida, Alabama, Japan, China, New York, Nevada, and several more places I have purchased hair from. This Henry Margu is the best.
B006BD93M6|5|I am very fair skinned and the girl at the tanning salon recommended this lotion to me. I saw a difference from the first visit! Everyone was commenting on how tan I looked. I have never tanned this fast and got this dark before! I thought I was going to have to go a million times to the tanning bed like I usually do to get tan but not now! I am definitely buying a bottle! Smells great too!
B002I4Z6TG|1|I bought this December 2013 and it lasted less than a year! It worked really well straightening my hair but for something that expensive, it should last a few years. I messaged the sellers and go no response whatsoever. Not worth it.
B009VXY05S|5|excellent used for all occasions, gives a perfect finish
B00L9RWWYA|1|Not worth the price!
B001LFEVSK|4|I found that 10 minutes is not long enough to open and penetrate the hair structure. I left it on my hair for 45 minutes to make sure that most of the red is removed. I also added &#34;Red out&#34;  drops to the mixture. Regular hair color is less expensive and  works just as well.
B004YRPRQ2|4|Love it good quality make me feel beautiful and sexy kind wait to order another style the product is good Thank you
B0077LAJT2|4|Great value.
B00ERWRBY0|4|good,but outcase is not very well
B007XZS214|5|Great product
B009SUHZKQ|5|After using this product along with the Shampoo, I have to say that I have begun to see the differences. My hair really feels thicker and I am more confident to run my fingers through my hair without fear of losing some hair strands. It leaves my scalp feeling refreshed and when I step out of the shower, I can see my hair is shinier and it just feels healthier. One major thing I've noticed with this product is how much easier it has become to use my comb and actually comb in the style that I want because my hair has become more manageable. I definitely recommend it.
B000IF3D38|5|This is a great, lightweight hair dryer. I have very thick Hirt hair and this dryer dries it quickly and nicely.
B00443RJ4O|5|Because the color is darker than expected, I mix it slightly with another Bare Min product. Works great.
B007SGP1J4|1|This stuff is not compatible with topik the med brown looks green and people have noticed that also and its weird and clumpy don't buy.
B00T7WNHK2|5|I have sensitive skin.  I have been using a competitor's product that has always worked ok for me, but it was great. Their product has a cooling sensation that was tremendously soothing.  The product lathered up very well. The can is great as it is not made out of metal so no rust and the twist cap stops the extra gel building up.   I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.
B00FNYBBQU|5|I absolutely love this bra.  The fit is perfect and it is a wonderful push-up!  The color is so bright and the rhinestones really do stay on for many wearings.  These are the only bras that fit me and I was so excited to find this one on Amazon at such a great price.  The seller was so wonderful to work with and the package came much sooner than expected.  It is a hard bra to wear under a lot of tops since you can see the rhinestones through the fabric.  Overall I absolutely love this bra and would recommend it to anyone.
B001J6O38O|5|Very good just I want
B00BEUAZTG|4|I bought this for my boyfriend and he likes it! He has been using this product for a good number of years to keep the acne away and it works.
B007RI1BUQ|5|I love this sunscreen.
B004GV4T56|4|I am still getting used to this product. It takes me just one or two pumps of the product for my hair and a little goes a long way. If you are not used to the product be careful about how much product you distribute in your hair.  I put the pumps in my hand and rub them together before distributing throughout hair. If your not careful you can make your hair greasy. I love that this product tames frizzies and keeps my hair heat protected.
B009ROXYFS|2|The bags material seems to be cracking in places where it moves the most, such as the flap area on top of the bag. Also, the shoulder strap is a great length for me but it's to stiff to wear for hours on end. I've take this bag everywhere I go for 5 months now but I cant anymore because of how bad it chafing my neck and leaving black marks. I like this bag's print design but the materials to make it and strap need major improvement!
B00AOTPVS8|3|I was hoping to get a little help with the bags under my eyes....it is an okay product.  Cool and soothing.
B0009MFUPO|5|As usual these blades make a super clean cut just like the originals that came with the razor.  High price for small parts but a lot better than a new razor for both pocketbook and environment.
B003JCKPF6|4|This stuff is so great and smells wonderful.  You definitely pay for it.  If you tend to use a lot of product in your hair (for spikey hair or Mohawks or something), this may be too much for you.  I only use a pea size each time so it lasts awhile for me.
B00FIUITDM|5|Terrific carrier oil for using with essential oils. It is cold pressed which isn't always easy to find.
B001BJJ7DU|3|The big big minus on this razor is that it is 110V only. While in hotels outside the US, you frequently find 110V outlets, there is no guarantee that you will. Other then that, it is nice and compact. Why don't they make USB chargable shavers :)
B001AEL2UM|5|Two thumbs up! My hairdresser used to apply Sebastian Colourshines after my chemical treatments, which I would receive every 5-6 weeks.  It looked sooo shiny,full and rich!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have moved and have not found a hairdresser as good as she is in my current city. I do plan on requesting the use of this product when I locate a new person.
B004VM968U|4|Works great on blemishes, but does not provide great coverage for under your eyes.  Good product. I did have a hard time finding a pencil sharpener large enough for the pencil.
B00THD5P3I|4|Nice healthy glow.
B000PW7K38|3|It was fine DO Not send me any more emails about this
B0007CXQUW|5|These work great
B000GOIJWG|4|I ordered this wheelchair for my Mother, and she is very happy with it. She did say that there was some kind of issue with one of the footrests. I will check that out when I see her again.
B00AYHSFBU|5|They're so cute and a good size. I really loved it and my friends were asking where I got them
B000JNQSIQ|5|These are great.  I received them and had to try them out. I oil the blades and started to cut. They cut so smoothly,  my boys had no issues with any pulling or catching of hair.  Sharp and quick.  I would highly recommend. They are solidly  built.  Very happy customer.
B0017XCDFY|4|Love the product makes my skin glow.
B000C2365C|5|This is my signature signature scent. My children won't allow me to wear anything else. I can't tell you how many times I am startled by total strangers asking me what I am wearing! That it is wonderful. It is a classic and won't break the bank.
B002I4W8NS|5|The lotion made my skin the softest it's ever been. The scent on all the dolce Mia products is very smelly in a good way then it absorbs in your skin and the scent goes away to a very lite scent.  I think the customer who found it to strong didn't wait the 10 mins. It takes to absorb the best<br />Lotion I've ever used.
B000J175MG|5|Works immediately. Gets the red out. Don't use too often though. You don't want the rebound effect.
B007YBU4HW|1|I recieved the item BROKEN and though the item smells good, it tastes like nail polish remover.
B000C2372O|5|This is a great way to get introduced to almost the complete line of the royall fragrance line.  There are 5 different fragrances, these mini bottle give you 4.  This is a great way to see if you're really going to smell like an orange grove with the mandarin, or a Jamacian distillery with the bayrhum.  The nice thing is, you don't!
B001IAINFU|2|The black color is not a dark black but more like a dark gray. Although I can get some length with this mascara, the texture of my lashes becomes kind of rubbery and they are floppy, they will not hold a curl.
B005VSXU30|5|A++++
B0002DO3NK|4|It's very sparkly that's for sure. It makes a nice smokey eye for the evening. A little too intense as a day look for my taste though.
B00BFFQMBA|5|I used every kind of hair vitamin out there. Most made me sick or didn't help at all. These vitamins pills were easy on my stomach. It helped with my extreme hair loss. I saw shedding slow down after only a week. I am very pleased with this brand. I have referred a few of my friends to try this product. I am a sold as a customer
B00MY5ISZI|3|It's good for medium skin tone. Not great for dark skin.. you must apply lotion before using it.
B00006592X|5|If you are a woman and you need this above the neck, I sympathize. The women of my family have had the same issue and honestly. I think most women have the same problem. Electrolysis did not work in this facial area and could never work, because the pain involved in treating the area just under the nose is enormous and intolerable. I epilate the area twice a week and it is of course not a pleasant experience but it only lasts a few seconds.<br />Smelly and nasty hair removal creams do not work very well. take a long time ( 15 minutes) and irritate the skin.
B003EDFJYC|1|This listing is false.  They sent one little ponytail holder for the amount they charged.  We ordered again and they did the same thing.....they are all going back.  Lousy customer service !!!!!!!!!!
B006LAFU8U|3|I recieved the bottle but looks different from the ones in the store and application bottle different from the one in the picture I just hope it works and thickens n grows my edges because also the oil looks a tad darker then ones in store :/
B000Q8ISXM|5|Arrived a day early!  New, sealed, unopened perfect!
B00KI74Z24|5|good purchase
B007CTNHL6|5|I LOVE THIS EYELINER! I USE IT EVERYDAY NOTHING IS WRONG WITH IT. I ALSO BUY IT ALL THE TIME!!! IM IN LOVE! &#60;3
B002T595OG|5|Best long last shadow! From eyeliner to gray cover! it is on till you take it off.
B00D3G6JAS|5|I've always wanted whiter teeth. As I've gotten older my smile started to yellow and look a bit older.  I figured I would try, hoping for just a shade or two and despite past failures using any product due to sensitivity.<br /><br />Now at the end of the box, my teeth which started off white look 4 shades lighter and still natural. I also found a successful way to manage tooth sensitivity.<br /><br />To avoid sensitivity, get some sensodyne and a generic whitening tray at the store. Fill the tray with the toothpaste and leave it on 30 minutes the first few days after you whiten, the around day three you can go down to 20 min.<br /><br />My only suggestion might be to try the advanced vivid. The classic version can be harder to keep in place. So the little extra cost more might be worth if just to make things easy.
B00RC57ND8|4|I like how this works but I have not mastered the curl with it.  I'm not sure that it gets hot enough for my hair but it definitely helps smooth the unruly hair and gives a nice shine.  I was really hoping for the infomercial results but I did not get them. I'm glad I didn't spend the money ordering from the infomercial.
B005PK18GK|1|I received the light and it appeared to be working at first.  I tried swatching several colors of Gelish and the light just quit curing.  The light would turn on, but the gel was not curing at all.  I double and triple cured and it still didn't work.  I returned it and ended up buying the Gelish 18G from another seller.  That product works great and was worth the extra money.
B002LPC8O8|5|What a find!  My husband has been looking for these replacement parts for some time.
B00TXYW3Q8|5|Using everyday and will reorder for sure, thank you!  Update!  I have been using this serum now for quite some time.  I have to say that my complexion has changed for the better, my pores are refined and my skin glows....thank you!
B00005306Y|1|The first time I used it, It was good. It had a nice smell to it. But the second time it started to make me itch! And it burned me pretty bad on both of my armpits. I will no longer will be buying from this brand again. And never would buy color deodorant again!
B000C234ZY|5|Love the smell and it is very easy in scent. I use this quite a bit but very lightly and I prefer it rather then the cheap stuff available at the local stores.
B008MCHTPC|5|This color is so pretty.  It is a pink/coral color perfect for spring or summer.  I'm a Gelish and IBD brand user. I was nervous using EZ Flow since the week before I tried Finger Paints from Sally Beauty supply, that came off in 4 days. It has been 1 week since I did my nails and they are still perfect.  Yes the bottles are 1/2 oz, but for the price, you can stock up on more colors.  I have just ordered Berry Parfait, and I can wait to try it!!
B009HULKLW|5|Great for making curls! Great versatility especially for African American hair. I have type 4 hair (Kinky curly) and these made perfect defined curls with no frizz! Watch a YouTube tutorial before trying! These are better than traditional roller setting!
B000SX4HGM|1|Avoid it ! It is claimed to be without strip, but the wax does not dry enough so it can not be removed easily.<br />This is one of the worst wax I have ever tried.
B003Y0RTEI|5|I do my own acrylic nails and french tips, etc... at home myself and this machine is just as powerful as in the salons.  it is perfect.  You can set it as low or high as you want.  It is a very powerful machine.  I advise anyone who is looking for one of these nail drills/sander... to purchase this one.  it's a great price and after you charge it, it lasts a really long time.  I've had a battery powered and a different electrical one (THAT PINK ONE THAT\\"S ADVERTISED) and this blue one is the ABSOLUTE BEST.  WHOMEVER DOES THEIR NAILS AT HOME, get one of these!!!  you will not be sorry!!!
B0053PWHTO|5|Best product I've found for psoriasis!!!
B004MKFY3W|1|These things didnt work.  I have thin sparse hair, so even though a lot of reviews said it didnt work, I thought maybe since there is not a lot of hair to remove, it may do something.  Wrong... these things suck.
B000ORV3NC|4|Have Type 1 diabetes so test a lot.  This works well when applied to fingertips.  Keeps them softer.  Would purchase again.  Also received a sample of their Buckthorn hand lotion and really liked the fragrance.  May try that next.
B000MVTJJU|5|The colors of this shadow are spectacular. It does take some practice with application because the colors are highly pigmented.
B0050N4ITG|2|If you're purchasing this because it's CG method friendly, don't. It smells nice, it's cheap, and friendly towards the environment, but as conditioner it is horrible because it's so hard to untangle your hair with it. You can still use it but you'll have to use a quarter of the bottle if you intend on untangling your hair. This is coming from a person with thick curly hair though, so if you have a different hair type, perhaps this is for you. Once again, if you're here because of the CG method, you're better off buying something a tad bit more expensive to avoid all that hair pulling.
B000N9Y2D4|5|I have been using Neutrogena Build-A-Tan Gradual Sunless Tanning Face SPF 15 for a couple of years (off and on).  I like how it works and looks.  I also like the sunscreen that it provides.  I use it after washing my face in morning for a few days and then I start using it every other or third day to maintain a natural looking, sun-kissed look.
B001YYHRA2|5|fantastic blades! bought them because i forgot my original pack (the ones that came with my straight razor) at home while i was on a trip. they work just as expected, dont really need to be maintained and last a VERY LONG TIME especially for the price. this may seem weird but i use them for not just my face but my legs and body as well, a new razor would last me over a week, easily.
B002RXCPAQ|5|good job
B001O2N80M|5|Beautiful smell!
B005FOVIH0|2|This gun did not last long.The voltage and or amps to get gun to shade right is very hard to obtain.Musta got too much and blew capacitor and spent more money replacing that then the gun costed.. =( Sorry hate to complain .I know it didnt cost much.
B00T91ZO48|5|This is a wonderful eye cream. It is effective, smooth and makes the skin around the eye look so wrinkle free.
B000M4EI5M|5|Best deal around, good quality filter and they last for many months unlike 1&#34; filters. I will be buying them again.
B000Y10IQQ|1|Tastes great, like berries, very shiny, too. BUT if you're looking for a plumper pout, this is NOT the one for you. It tingles and numbs but that's it. MAYBE a tiny bit larger, say .5%! Definately too much money and no delivery!
B00EPOIZJ0|5|This smells almost identical to the original product!  And since the original is hard to get, and expensive when you do find it, this is now my go to scent!
B000FQ2C7I|5|I wasn't so sure about this scent.  At times I thought it was a bit sweet after a few hours, but then other times it wasn't,
B004DK0UDA|5|Love it work great came in on time enjoying. One had a scare but work good
B00D5TB1LK|4|I really like my contour professional Outop cosmetics
B00C6ND1G4|1|I have been looking for plumeria lotion/fragrance and thought I was getting a deal, but this does not smell like plumeria at all.
B005GMY86O|4|This was my first attempt at wearing red lipstick and I have to say it is REALLY lovely. I'm not interested in the shiny lipstick, I prefer the matte look or the lip stains and this lipstick was perfect for me. As I got it I wore it. Another great thing about it is that it lasts pretty much all day, during meals and other lip-biting situations. It bleeds a lot though so if you accidentally touch your lip your fingers will be red.<br /><br />But all in all, I love this lipstick, will be ordering others, and would recommend it to anyone!
B00LNOV8JO|5|10 star all the way,,,,,its fantastic
B0056IJRV4|5|love this lotion. i put it on after i use the neutrogena sesame oil in the shower.
B001AXYPO8|4|The product Is a bit thick and cakey, but it covers redness well.
B001ET7AHW|5|This shampoo is lush and I always enjoy co washing with it.  My hair feels clean and soft after using it.  I heard of this brand from AfricanExport on Youtube.  What's most important is the PH balance factor. This factor is best for my 3c/4a natural hair type.  I just ordered the mango and will order the Plumeria too.  Keep in mind this shampoo goes a looong way.  I haven't made a dent in this bottle and a second one is sitting waiting to be used. I'm stocking up!
B0069SQNIU|5|I am pleasantly surprised with this oil. Came with some directions/what you can do with it. Directions on the bottle and very pleasant smell and taste. It is great for infections, headaches, sore throats and insect repellant among other great things.
B0000530EZ|5|I have very dry, thick, coarse, curly hair. Was skeptical about this product because of the cheap price, but I had used Aussie products years ago, and thought I'd try it. LOVED IT!<br />Pros:<br />Nice Scent. Light, and fresh<br />Leaves my hair shiny and soft<br />De-tangles<br />Inexpensive<br />Prevents the \\"frizzies\\"<br />Not heavy, greasy, or waxy<br />Refreshes my curls<br /><br />As a side note, I use this product first, after towel drying. I then also use a conditioning balm, and sometimes a bit of gel. I find that I can \\"refresh\\" my curls the second day after shampooing with this product and it looks great. No bed head!
B005GHP5UC|5|Highly recommend this.........use on body, neck and face....helps the lines on the chest and keeps your skin moist<br />and smooth.....good price point - much better than competitors on shopping channels..all around good basic must<br />for beauty regime.
B00596VEP0|4|This is a good cream but am not convinced its any better than the standard shaving gels or foams. It is a bit faster to apply this over the foam/gel.
B005ZAYQYG|4|Love it, super easy to use.  Pulls your hair a little when cutting though and is quite noisy.  Other than that I like it far better than the previous Flowbees Ive had.
B005JNR0ZQ|5|I must join the bandwagon on these reviews.  I normally purchase this on HSN but am glad to have found it here.  When I take pictures with this on, my skin looks perfect and I have far from perfect skin.  This is the only product I can never be without.  More than 5 stars.
B000F4IL7A|5|Love Love Love me some Creamy Molding Wax.. Good  Product..<br /><br />I have used about 4 yrs, and will continue.. I enjoy the way it helps my<br />hair look like, what i want..<br />Thanks,
B004Y9H6SC|2|it doesin't work that well and i can't believe i paid so much for it its horrible and when i dropped it the whole thing just broke and when you sweep the eyeshadow all the colors get mixed together and it looks weird.
B0038TYTSO|5|Love coconut smell and works for my hair.
B0023X8D1U|5|This is the real deal stuff used by Physical Therapists - great for rehab.<br /><br />This is long enough that I was able to get two useful pieces out of it.
B002TYBGUS|5|I Love this product!! It works great in my hair. It's half the price from the salon. I would hight recommend it.
B00NUKBE2U|4|First of all  -  I'm a guy.  I've always had large pores on my nose and, my ears and nose always end up greasy by the end of the day. The  Pro-Nu works fine to completely cleans my face.  You definatly feel the difference.  I also use it on my butt to help keep pimples at bay. ;)<br /><br />Two minor issues.  I would prefer the on/off switch to be on the top/outside of the handle.  A rechargable option would be nice.  I'd gladly pay a few more $$$$ for that.  We'll see how long the batteries last.
B00QLGYIVE|5|These cups are the best glasswares I've bought here in Amazon. The cup feels heavy and doesn't break easily.
B003UKKHB4|5|This seems to be a very good product.  My teeth feel really clean after brushing.  My only complaint is that the button to start it is harder to push than on the Oral-B Professional Care 7500 I had in 2006, but I suppose that is due to the additional cleaning modes on the brush.
B003BWQX46|5|Perfect!  My husband had been looking for a high quality product and these really fill the bill.  I won't have to shop for a while!
B002QAR8QG|5|Smells great.
B00KSLK86M|5|I like that its all natural. The ingredients are great. It does not give my lips a waxy feeling like other lip balms. I don't think the peppermint is overwhelming either. It also comes at a great price. The company really stands behind their product and shows their customers that they truly care. I bought one to give to each of my family membersand they all like it. Maybe I will try their fruit flavors in the future.
B00DTQ12DQ|5|This cream  is awesome. Great  coverage, it works fine as a sun block, its moisture  my very  dry face.I will buy it again ,again, again.I just loved  this product
B003UNMBXS|5|Love the sweet scent it leaves. You probably don't even need to use the perfume afer putting this on :)
B00COX5UPQ|5|This Oil smells wonderful, but more than this, the Company contacted me before and after delivery to ensure I was happy with it. They also send email tips for Lavender uses. What company takes the time to do that? Really appreciate it, plus the Oil is a great value with endless uses.
B004GITYJU|5|I love how my skin feels after soaking in dead sea salt. My skin feels softer. My joint pain is reduced.I will definitely buy more.
B00A1JH3HS|5|awesome
B005CPZHOW|5|I love how my skin feels after every use.
B000UJHRKM|4|The oil has been effective. I like the see-through container, but the open mouth makes it difficult to dispense the oil in small quantities. Granted this oil is not as expensive as others, so most people aren't dispensing it in such a meager manner, but I prefer to use individual drops to target specific areas. When you try to pour it slowly, oil dribbles backward down the neck and body of the container, wasting oil. While I am happy with the oil itself and the price, I have been annoyed by the open mouth. If you apply the oil in a different manner(q-tip, etc.), this may not bother you at all.
B00373FE76|1|Not a very good product, I wasted my money on this.
B003SGRJVG|4|This is a great product.  It detangles and refreshes your hair and make your hair soft and renewed.  Wish I would have gotten a larger bottle.  This would get 5 stars...however, it is too expensive.  Perhaps as the Wen line of hair care products becomes more available (like hopefully sold in stores which it currently is not)that the prices for these products will be more reasonable.
B00LU1V3JK|5|This product really works for me.  I have tried many, many eye creams for puffiness etc., including Chamonix  (which I returned). Body Merry eye cream is soothing, gets rid of puffiness.  I use the cream at night and in the morning before I put make-up on.  I highly recommend Body Merry eye cream.
B00012C0IC|5|Best part: you tip the mirror on it's gooseneck to get the best angle. My only problem is accidentally leaving it in hotel rooms when I travel, but it's cheap enough to just replace!
B004CJR9IG|5|The product is excellent!  My hair started to show some dryness due to my thyroid problem.  Since I started to use this conditioner, my hair looks and feels healthy.  I tried different conditioners, but did not helped the dryness. I \\"love\\" this product!  I highly recommend it!!!!
B001V9SXXU|5|This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It absorbs quickly and doesn't make my skin look oily. I have struggled with dry skin for years and within 2 weeks this has turned it around. I know some people don't like the tub and it would be easier if it were in a bottle with a pump but it's a small inconvenience compared to how much this has changed my skin.
B00HFQQ0VU|4|It leaves my teeth feeling very clean. I must go by feel to use it properly, and after almost a month, I still 'misuse' it on some teeth and have to go back. I can't finish in the one minute marked time but finish after most of the water is used.
B00MG3HKT8|5|I make homemade lip balm, not to sell or anything like that, just some for me, my family, and my friends. I am always looking for new recipes as well as new products. When I got the great opportunity to try this 100% Unrefined Organic Shea Butter at an outstanding price for my honest feedback I was thrilled!! I found a great recipe and the shea butter makes it smell amazing and my lips already feel better. There are so many uses for shea butter that I am so glad I found an amazing one. Thank you Nature Lite Products for a product I feel safe about using!
B0036OJEFO|4|I ordered this a couple of months ago, to help tease my hair when I want to wear an updo. It works as expected but I do wish that the point was more defined. You really can't make a good part with the point. It's pretty much useless. The brush itself is great. I'd love to see this product updates, with a thin metal point.<br /><br />Tip: When teasing your hair, make sure your hair isn't freshly washed. You need to create a foundation in order to build height. Day old (or longer) hair is best. If you must use freshly washed hair, you'l want to get your hands on some dry shampoo, or, a texturizing spray.
B00738I21G|5|I live in Hawaii and have fair skin so I burn easily. I have tried so many different sunscreens sold in surf-shops and always ended up with burning eyes from the run-off or sunburns. This stays on, doesn't make me look white, doesn't run into my eyes and no break-outs---- and no sunburn, not even on my nose after 4 hours on the water on a surf/paddle board. Incredible!! It's become my daily sunscreen.
B004NMTMUK|4|Pretty color.
B002N5MHL0|4|This is a good package, easy to install and saved me from buying a new Panasonic for a while.
B00OJ13DR8|5|Just as expected. Great to find Christmas ones here--they are hard to find.
B005A5N5HU|1|I love Alaffia and Everyday Shea products. They are a staple for me because I am allergic to every other product ever -- but, this shampoo was horrible for me. It didn't feel like my hair was clean, and yet it was dry and frizzy. A lot of hair broke when I tried to brush it. I am also allergic to it, which is strange because the ingredient list sounds like it's good for allergies. It gave me a similar scalp dermatitis as cheap shampoos like Pantene. I think it may be formulated for ethnic hair because I've accidentally tried products formulated for black hair before and it felt the same way on my hair.
B00NSDJV8S|1|Not a huge fan!  Very stiff and didn't bend at all.  Difficulty sticking to eyelids!
B00ARF429S|4|The divice covered my expection and I recommend for many people that they want to give like a present for anybody.
B004V42JH8|5|Fabulous stuff , great price & rapid shipping
B002FOTGFY|4|I tried this for myself for skin tightening but really didn't see much difference.  I tried this for my 14 year old's acne and was amazed at how much clearing happens in 48 hours.  My teen can use it about twice a week and keep his skin almost clear.  He could do a lot better with better skin hygiene and some benzene peroxide.  So, I don't recommend it for anti-aging, but I certainly recommend it for anyone with mild to moderate acne.  I don't think it would work for someone with cystic acne.
B002TPO0W8|4|came in an big yellow envelope, there seemed to be plenty of bubble wrap inside, wrapping the makeup.  I removed the bubble wrapped palette from the envelope, unwrapped it and the palette itself looked very dirt, looked like chalk, didnt think that was a good sign.  The palette is pretty hefty, heavier than my coastal scents 88 palettte.  I opened the palette and realized the outside of the palette was dirty because one of the eyeshadows shattered.  I was kinda bummed. other than that the colors are very bright, there are mattes, and shimmery colors (not overly shimmery).  colorful, bold colors. i swatched only one and it seemed very pigmented.  im satisfied.
B00OZ53BNE|5|First off, it takes quite a while to read through all of the uses for this device.  I was mainly looking to use it for anti-aging , but because I had broken out a bit, I was really looking forward to tying it and seeing if it would make any improvements. I like that they included safety goggles to protect my eyes during treatment. To use simply set the timer between one and twenty minutes(optimal 10 minutes per area), press on to skin or very near to touching. The hardest part for me was simply being able to sit still for 10 minutes. My skin also broke out the first week in using it. Having read the instructions, I knew to expect a period of one to three weeks as the bacteria is driven to the surface and out of the skin. I also like that it comes in a handy storage/travel case and has a one year warranty. I received this product at no cost to facilitate an honest review. My review is based on my own honest thoughts of and experiences with this product, yours may differ. I was pretty amazed at all the issues the SL50 Laser could take care of.  I've never used one before, but I'm loving the changes I'm seeing in my skin! (at at a savings of $1000's of dollars in comparison to the quotes I got when I called my local dermatologist for pricing on laser acne treatment!! Yikes!!!
B008O4D6K0|5|These products are amazing! Been using then two months now and I literally have watched my skin transform! Every day your skin gets better, I don't really even break out during my cycle which is usually the worst time for me. It's amazing!
B00K57XGH2|4|2 of the flowers arrived damaged, but the rest arrived good and where so pretty :)
B0085RZLQ8|3|These are exactly what they are supposed to be, no more or less.  It is difficult to be more enthusiastic than three stars regarding replacement toothbrush heads.
B00935AXAU|5|;)
B00064JGBO|5|So easy to use. The first time I scrapped my toung, I was amazed of all the bacteria and debri landed in the skin. This tounge scraper cleans wonderful.
B00LNEOGWA|5|Small but nice.
B003VDEE0A|5|Sally Hansen Complete Salon Manicure is by far the best nail polish brand I own - and I have over 60 bottles of nail polish.  This one is no different - perfect!  Very pleased with it
B0034KYDRE|5|My daughter loved her makeup set very pleased fast delivery great seller A+++
B00AU7ESUQ|5|I really love it, my husband gave really good compliments, I suggest it for every woman. Try it please we need this item to comback.
B004B1WJGC|5|I'm a huge fan of Starry eyeliners.  Was happy to see this new color..I do like it better than the previous green, it's darker but not too dark.<br />You can't go wrong with Starry - great product at a fabulous price.
B001KYW7KQ|3|ok
B000YC3VHS|3|I gave this bonnet a 3 because when drying my hair with rollers I had to keep turning the air flow around so the whole hair could dry. but I was under the dryer for an hour so it wasn't bad. And it's a big no no if your hair is just wrapped wet. the bonnet kept coming off when it was turned on. Good product but just couldn't give it a 5
B003YJAZZ4|5|First I am a little bias as this is my 2nd Braun shaver with the last one lasting about 7 years with 2 head replacements. I must say that it gives a very close shave for an electric shaver and doesn't leave my sensitive facial area sore or irritated in any way. I know it may seem expensive but if you consider razor prices and that you will be using this almost every day of your life it is more than worth it! Close shave, no irritation and self cleaning is huge. The only thing I wish it had was a place to put the little brush for manual cleaning as they are easily lost. Plus I personally liked the way I could self clean my old one to help the cleaning cartridges last longer this one does not have that feature which can be good if you are lazy or bad if you are cheap and like to save where you can.<br /><br />Bottom Line - Best Electric Shaver I have ever used and have been recommending it to all my friends.
B003VMS0Z6|5|Loved this!!! The pic does not do the blue justice!
B000GHGGKK|5|I love this product.
B001VEK1LW|5|A+++
B0046VGPHQ|5|I'm beyond pale. I don't tan in the sun or in tanning beds so I always go for this. It goes on great and does not leave you streaky! I get a little help with my back but if I can't it never looks like there is a line, it blends very well! I wish it was still on the subscribe and save list though :(
B0002UOYQ4|1|3 pens lasted me about as long as 1 of the other pens. I didn't notice much of a change either....  :(
B005Q37RYI|5|Works the best ever
B001ESE1WU|4|As is sometimes noted with Amazon, there is difference in picture presented and item purchased. There is difference in body BUTTER, body LOTION; same as there is difference in scent between lotion, butter, cologne, perfume, powder, soap. As a skin softener, the lotion purchased has a good softening agent without being greasy. The base scent could have a bit more vetiver for my taste (sorry - olfactory), and the smell of rope is as good as the smell of wet horse, so it comes down to what one enjoys smelling.<br /><br />The 'Nubian Heritage' is a good product with regards to softening, the 'anti-inflammatory & healing' should be researched by the individual. Marketing is what it is.
B000NJHS08|5|Hard to find in stores. Just shipped two packages to my cousin who never heard of them. Have used them for years. Just the right size and doesn't break your hair
B00H92N9BO|2|I have severe creepy crawley pain & it doesn't help that kind of pain at all.
B001VTRGGK|4|GOOD
B0048GTLSO|5|My younger brother Justin has decided to change his image. I'm taking him shopping soon for his 26th birthday  to shop for new clothes at Abercrombie & Fitch. He's been wearing Nike and DC Shoes for awhile. He's tired of  the sporty look and wants to go a little more chic for the ladies, without being too preppy. With that in mind,  I thought what better way to suprise him than to give him Abercrombie's best and most famous cologne ever! Other  than Armani Code and Calvin Klein's Obsession, I've never found a cologne I liked better than this one. It's VERY  sexy and a HUGE turn on for every woman I've ever heard talk about it. It'll be a great new addition to my brother's  new image and wardrobe. My husband is now using Bath & Body Works Twlight Woods, but it pales in comparison. I will  be purchasing him a bottle of Abercrombie Woods FOR SURE for Father's Day. I highly recommend it!
B00028LN1K|4|This soap smells like a campfire - which is okay by me.  My wife isn't a fan, but that's okay too, it's a good base for some cologne, 'cause for dudes, smelling like you've been in the woods beats the hell out of smelling like a \\"creamy peach.\\"
B0000535UV|5|Lathers luxuriously with a light scent. My skin always feels so good after a bath that I just have to share. Get some!
B00I951D22|5|Have used each time I get a new tat and it does seem to help the healing process move along. I would highly recommend this product for after ink care.
B00144PC72|2|when I got this, this pump was not working well.. except this, I would like this shampoo!
B00CWUGX6G|2|The base coat does not adhere well to the nail.
B00021DPNG|1|Let's face it, gals.  Loose powder cosmetics were NOT intended for a take-along compact.   <br /> <br />I'm a huge fan of BareMinerals, but this is the worst item they offer.  I received this as one of my 'free gifts' with my starter kit, and frankly wish they had kept it.  If I could give this ZERO stars, I would.   <br /> <br />You have to fill the compact yourself from your regular foundation powder containers.  This is a tedious and messy process in itself because you're trying to tap-tap-tap your powder into the compact.  You might think you're being clever by prying the plastic sieve out of your regular foundation container so you can dump larger amounts of the powder at once, but this proves to be even more difficult because those sieves are in there pretty tight and you end up spilling the powder once you get it out.   <br /> <br />If you're able to successfully fill the compact, you have to remove the brush, close it, and tap it upside down to shift the powder into the application tray.  When you turn the compact and open it, you'll inevitably spill some of the powder in the process.  It sits in all the crevices between the compact base and inset tray and makes a mess when you open the compact. <br /> <br />Finally, this brush is TERRIBLE.  It's thin and flat and not at ALL designed for the 'swirl-tap-apply' method that we've all become familiar with using BareMinerals.   <br /> <br />For makeup on the go, I have found it much easier, cleaner, and convenient to simply keep a mini-cosmetic bag in my purse with the following 3 items: <br />-Regular container of my foundation powder <br />-Kubuki brush <br />-Compact mirror <br /> <br />Yes, it takes up more room than this lousy compact, but at least I can apply my makeup the way it was meant to be applied, it looks good, and I don't spill/waste powder every time I go to use it.   <br />
B000PJ2QAI|1|I was expecting new product, which should not expire in 5 months from ordering. I ordered 2 jars (better value), and I will not be able to use it by the expiration date. I haven't started using the product because I was finishing up another product before starting this one.
B0046MIEVK|5|great for my hair
B000VTNYN0|4|This hair piece is a perfect addition to my shoulder length.  It gives volume and a bit more length.
B000FFZ28A|5|have been using flat pencil for years found it at amazon ..also at sears....so easy to apply...available<br />in glossy or flat
B003DKO7RG|1|I found this eyeliner on Amazon and saw all the bad reviews about it, but I decided to go for it and try it out. I was very wrong!!! Just like another reviewer said it is a MARKER!!!!I was hoping for a tip that bent with the motion you moved it, but just like a marker it was a stiff end. I did one eye and it was horrible. It was such a thick line it looked costume like. Beware of this product! But if you're looking for a thick marker like applicator then this is the eyeliner for you. I'll probably use it next Halloween (and that's the only good thing I can see coming out of it).
B003FU1HQI|5|I couldn't find liquid Hope in a Bottle, so I got this tube instead.  It turns out to be very handy for traveling (2oz) and I especially like that it has the SPF 30 included. The formulation is very effective and has a light clean fragrance that is almost not there.  Very nice.
B005CB8LUI|5|These beautiful, stylish, and unique clips are not only gorgeous but they are also very supportive! I have thick hair and it is hard to find a clip that is high enough quality to even hold my hair, not to mention add a little bling and class to it! ~Danni
B001KNWSG0|5|Always a favorite love the smell and never greasy
B0014JRRFC|4|I found that the clasp on this is a little difficult for me to use as I don't have a lot of arm and leg strength.  It probably would not be a problem if it weren't for that.  Holds a lot of hair.
B00FITKIDM|5|Very good
B0012MCATE|5|I GOT THIS FOR MY SON AND MY HUSBAND AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, HE WEARS IT ALL THE TIME AND THE PRICE WAS GREAT
B001MA0QY2|5|My CHI burned out after about 2 years of use (everyone in my sorority used it to get ready). Instead of spending another $200 on a CHI I decided to go with the HSI and I couldn't be happier. It gets plenty hot and straightens my hair extremely fast with little damage. I would recommend and have recommended this product to mutiple people.
B0034ZGXN6|3|dark
B003UODZEG|5|Avon Black Suede is a very good cologne and leaves you smelling like a man.  I highly recommend this cologne
B00C0CH8W4|1|Its ok for a beginner set I guess just dont use the ink. One of the guns isnt working right for me even after tuning it multiple times. The ink is unsterile GARBAGE and not intended for use on human skin! every tattoo I did got infected and then the ink faded away. Ive seen henna tattoos last longer than this terrible ink. Hell my kids temporary tattos last longer. If you invest in quality ink you'll be all set.
B004OEE1ZI|5|Great product!
B007PV2JV0|5|I use this product on my eyelash extensions.  I haven't ever tried another brand so I have nothing to compare to, but it does what it is supposed to do.
B000VRYXUU|1|I bought this hair brush as a gift and I only want all boar bristle as mentioned in the website. The brush arrived well protected from shipping.  There is a piece of \\"The Care and Cleaning of your Hairbrush\\" included, with a lot of emphasis on caring for the pneumatic rubber cushion and the plastic handle.  I was very disappointed that there is not a word about the \\"All Boar Bristle\\" which I thought is the real value of the brush - not a word on the box and not in the care instruction! Even though Amazon has a good price on this hair brush, I still consider it to be an expensive piece. The bristles are rather stiff and do not feel like boar's hair - they are more like plastic to me.  I have to return this item and look for another gift.
B0006GZCVK|5|I read a lot of reviews from people who were upset the formula is different…well let me tell you; for me the formula change was a good thing. I tried this conditioner about 4 years ago and had so much damage from it because it was TOO moisturizing. I wear a relaxer and I don't think I used enough protein products…anyway, my hair started out soft but morphed into mush and I didn't understand how to combat it back then.<br /><br />Now I'm more knowledgeable about black hair maintenance and health. This is the only conditioner that actually infuses REAL moisture (NOT cones, sneaky proteins, mineral oils, etc.) into the hair. I could feel the difference immediately. I have been in search of a deep conditioner that would do this for about 3 months- I've tried the expensive salon brands to the drugstore stuff. Everything left my hair tangly, hard to comb, or coated. This makes my hair feel like butter! Just naturally soft and manageable and smooth. I was so leery to go back to it but I'm glad I did. I shampoo and do my protein treatment like normal then smooth small amounts all over my hair in small sections, really working the product into my strands. Then I sit under a warm dryer with a processing cap for about 20- 25 mins then rinse.<br /><br />However- take my advice. If you are relaxed and you know you need more protein in your haircare regiment than most, you MUST stay on top of the protein when you use this or you can get out of balance and cause damage. But keep feeding your hair regular doses of protein along with other healthy hair practices and this will make your mane beautiful!
B005A2M82Q|1|The reason why I chose this particular fragrance was because when I tried it on in the department store, the smell was wonderful. But what really got me was that the fragrance lasted well over a few hours.  When I was done shopping, it smelled as strong on my skin. I have a hard time with perfumes lasting.<br /><br />This perfume's smell DOES not last at all.<br /><br />I am very dissatisfied. N:(
B000VKZMHK|1|This has got to be the worst razor I have ever owned.  I do not have a very tough beard, but just went back to one I used 12 years ago and it gave a better shave.  Noisy, doesn't shave, leaves stubble . . . . .. A total waste of money!!
B004T19PMK|5|This product is great for Curly hair, works great and I leave a little in so my hair isn't so frizzy.
B005HA9ES2|5|This is an excellent brush that works well for fine or thick hair.  Great for wet or dry hair.  The bristles have those little plastic tips on the end for comfort.
B00A3Z2Z1E|5|This smell was amazing!!!!
B0014B93HU|3|I've been using this product for about 2 months now and my hair feels better and stopped falling out. I do recommend this product.
B008OUYXZQ|5|Worked great as Ace's accent makeup for Cold Gin Indy -- make-up covers very well.  We recommend the Mehron Cream Sticks -- white, black and colors!
B00375YE5C|5|very good. my sister love it very match . I recommend to buy this product. it is very good quality and for this prize
B00CD1QU80|4|It works well but it's not the smoothest feel in shavers I've ever had. Still, quite good for the money.
B005LF0QZI|5|Have used these for years, but lately could not find in local stores. The pics do a better job than any I have used.
B007VP8GNK|5|Great product!  Product does as advertised and is useful.  And the price cannot be beaten.  Will buy this product again!
B003RJ165Y|1|Product is not good for oily skin.  It does not remove all makeup from face.  I used a makeup remover after cleansing and my face was still full of makeup.  I asked seller to return product and they told me they would only give me 30% of the price which is clearly BS!  I ended up keeping the cleanser instead and now it is only collecting dust in my cabinet!
B00154OJV6|5|Love it. Leaves my hair so nice with soft curls. Even in Miami weather, I can wear my hair down without worrying about frizz
B0071H6HIE|3|Gift
B000O2QRQ0|5|Made my dry, coarse hair soft, silky and shiny (and smells great too!).    I tried the Fekkai Color Technician shampoo and conditioner and thought they were OK, but not great, but I fell in love with the mask!    I would definitely recommend for people with dry, abused hair!
B001V9LUR6|5|Great product. Hauschka is wonderful for problem skin. Got the set for &#34;impure skin&#34; for my daughter, who was taking antibiotics for her acne (VERY BAD IDEA)  and she dropped the anti biotics and her skin has been great every since. Then started my teenage son on the same regimen, and he never got acne.
B002SICH1C|5|This polish is beautiful.  It catches the light so prettily.  I wouldn't use it by itself since it so light but it works well over just about any color.
B00DM2SBLS|5|Great product. Reliable and fast shipping. I couldn't be any happier with this product. I plan on purchasing more products in the near future! Thanks again!
B004LTZSJO|4|A little smaller than expected but it fixes little fly-aways if necessary.
B002OND3LO|5|I purchased these razors for the new razor I bought and they work just fine. Great quality and quantity for the price!
B00G5WYD6Y|5|Very impressed with quality of oils
B008PJZXT6|5|It really works! Looks almost after I get a pedicure. Amazing.
B000YQ4M5E|5|I am so pleased with this skin care product.  It makes my skin feel fresher and look<br />younger.  The results have been absolutely amazing.  I would highly recommend.
B00E3G8BZ8|5|This  is the best soap i have ever used
B000GFWINQ|5|My favorite mousse because it is Alcohol free.  Defeats the purpose of using mousse when it dry's out your hair and leaves it brittle.  This is great.
B000JNQSIQ|5|Awesome! works wonderfully. worth the money.
B000TN26H8|5|I have used a couple of these batteries and so far they last as long or longer than name brands
B001A3DNXC|5|This is my husband's favorite kind of shaving soap. We were happy to find that we can buy it in the multi bar pack so he is not hunting in the stores for it.  He has even give some away to friends and family who are now converted, too.
B00NO8DT2G|5|I really like the way that these lip balms make my lips very soft and smooth. I could notice an immediate difference once I applied it.  I also like the way that it tastes.
B00LPR2SM0|5|I've never had a wig brush before but I imagine this is what it's supposed to be. The wire bristles are fine and safe and feel really good on my own head too. It's a nice portable little brush as well.
B0018X3XIE|4|I have black relaxed hair that gets dry easily.  This works for me and I'm glad I got this hair dryer.  It's not at all damaging like I thought it would be.  I got smooth hair without the breakage.  The only thing that annoys me is that its not easy to hold. It's very easy to accidentally hit a button when you're drying your hair.
B000VUNFOW|3|Didn't really work, but it felt like it was working bc of the tingling
B00EQZDMBO|4|Have used for 1 year and add a protective coat to my thin skin and moisture.<br />Helpful
B005HR609G|5|Very moisturizing, just as good as JM product and much more cost effective
B003PDBDU0|4|This is the first time I used something like this. It takes a bit of practice but it works pretty well. After one day after I took it off it stayed at the crease. I heard your suppose to wear it for 22 hours a day for 3 months for the effects to be permanent . So if that's true then its a good alternative to surgery.
B002V9RCEU|5|Love it and such a great deal!...goes on great it prevents chipping and has great shine I would buy this again
B002CJBDK8|5|This scent smells so yummy! I want to buy more of it! I'm glad I got to try it out first.
B0002VNYOQ|5|I have already used this on a cut. I am glad to use natural products for health problems.
B00FKDUX18|5|These boxes were amazing!!! I'm going to order more I used them for snowballs a few weeks again and everyone loved them and they were made of gold quality. I wish I would have gotten pictures it was a very busy day. I know I read comments about boxes being damaging I did have a few but we smoothed them out and still used them
B000QU94RE|5|I purchased this product as part of a K-Pak set and this is my favourite product (next to the Reconstructor). It is actually a clarifying shampoo, but it does not strip hair or make it dry. It does an EXCELLENT job of removing oils and styling products. I used it once, and even after blow-drying my hair, my hair was shinny like glass, and I actually had numerous comments from people as to how healthy and shiny my hair looked.I later purchased the Pantene Pro-V Clarifying Shampoo and it does not even come close, So I'm going back to this one. It is most definitely worth the price and I highly recommend it.
B006VHSHLU|4|I like this product for some hair textures. As with any other product it won't agree with every hair type.<br /><br />The reason I like it is because it leaves the hair feeling nice and soft without being too oily (of course this is if you don't use too much). Also helps alot with frizz!!
B003UJHSUI|5|Fantastic product.  Works far better than anything else I have tried and at a good price compared to the other products out there.
B001EJMS92|3|Curlers work fine and heat up well.  The clips dont work at all for me.  They're cheap plastic with poor design.  Im gonna buy some other clips to use.
B00092M2XW|5|I know this dryer isn't the newest model out there, but, on my thin fine hair it's just perfect. Love the settings, it's not to heavy or bulky in any way. Great dryer in very way for me.
B001459IEE|5|i have trouble with the skin on my hands cracking during the winter & this lotion works magic on my hands.  after a use or two, my hands are good to go.  i've tried many lotions and this is the first time i have noticed a noticeable difference from use right away.
B0006ZEVKY|5|Very nice shade of polish.  Flows  on smoothly and dries quickly.  Leaves a nice sheen on nails. Does not chip off.
B0041PTXJ4|4|Very happy with all my Dr. Denese products. This seems lightweight and absorbs into your skin very well. I do continue to buy this.
B000Q8NZHG|5|I have had this brush for at least a year now. It is still in perfect shape and was worth the price. It is my favorite brush and I think it is really nice looking.
B0081E6YSE|3|I have used it for several weeks. And the result was not as good as I expected. My face is a kind of oily. And it does not clear it very deeply. Will not buy it again.
B001U4WFYY|5|I have to say I love, love, love this cream, As I said I have been using this cream for years.  I have tried other eye creams more expensive ones too, throughout the years, but I always find myself going back to my tried and true Avon eye cream, just love it.
B004W2UMDW|5|I was a little skeptical when I found this product, but after Reading reviews I wanted to give it a try. As most of the people the first question is, does it work? Let me tell you they are true and I am not disappointed.<br />After every shave I give it a quick slide as the instructions says and I can notice my blades last a longer time. I have 3-4 times a week. I notice that it last for almost triple the time. I have a sensitive skin and it doesn’t do cuts. Every pass is as the blades are brand new, with still a sharp smooth shave.<br />I still change the blades to be hygiene tho this product is worth the investment.<br />I say give it a try, test for yourself and see and feel the difference.
B00DLRNSSK|5|A friend gave this product to me to try on a scar I have.  After a few weeks of use, I have noticed a marked improvement. It smells pleasant, and I like the fact that it has natural essential oils and extracts in it.  It does not stain, is not greasy, and is easy to apply.  I definitely recommend using it!
B00COWPH82|3|it looks like a mans toupee lol. it's super short,.. cant even style it. does not look like the one on the model AT ALL. but great if you wanna cover up a bal spot. lol
B008U1Q4DI|5|I really think this is a quality product and I would buy it again. Really good!! Loved IT! So happy I got this!
B00BDJH578|5|I have think hair and this product works amazing. Your hair is shinier and has tons of body. Buy it
B001UFZOMS|5|This is by far the best Sandalwood soap on the market.  Unlike other Sandalwood soaps Pre de Provence takes a subtle approach to fragrance.  It is light and it smells good, not overpowering at all.  It has a rich lather and it doesn't dry out your skin.  This is my favorite sandalwood soap.
B001ET7HXO|5|Made in America (I think...LOL, I'm big on ONLY buying American products!!) Good for exfoliating and giving your skin the best possible treatment, at home, that you can!
B00A3BWYU0|1|I can't even get any of these to work on anyone's hair. I had to use them on paper just to see if the color was actually able to be transferred to anything else. Wouldn't recommend these to anyone.
B00MU1TIIM|5|I don't know why all the good colors are discontinued.  It is great that I found this color online.  Thanks.
B005C1C02S|4|I thought the case was a lot bigger, it's about 2inches in diameter. The pieces are small, so you need something to pick it up with and apply. Mine looks like the picture, the amount is great. Maybe not 1200 but still a lot. It will probably last a long time.<br /><br />My only problem, I thought they pieces were flatter. I wanted it to be almost like stickers but they are slightly thick, but not too noticeable. This can be a good thing, though. The shape are cute and the wheel is productive for organization. Overall, still very cute and elegant. Sticks to at least one coat of nail polish, no glue necessary. :)
B006ZA0A5Y|4|Overall I am very satisfied with this product for the money.  Works well for oily skin.  Will definitely buy again!
B00Q1BCVKY|5|love it. can DIY my own mask any time
B003KEBR6Y|5|This compact is larger than I thought it would be but it is very nice!  It would make a nice gift.
B000TAE0RK|5|Best soap ever! Love this product as it is helping to keep my skin clear. It can be drying at times, but I use a small amount of vitamin e oil (cococare 100% vitamin e oil) on my face after using this and it restores the moisture back into my face.<br /><br />The main thing that is appreciated about this soap is that my skin is really clean after using this product. I know that because when alcohol free witch hazel is applied as a toner, there is no residue that is visible from doing this. I have recommended this product to other family members and would highly recommend it to others.<br /><br /> Order was delivered on 8/15/2014 and the expiration date on the soap is 4/2017.
B0017M0FTG|5|This feels light on the face and pleasant to use. It is a great product if you are allergic to most sunscreen ingredients. It would be nice though if it was a little less expensive.
B003R2GDWM|5|I would definitely recommend this product to those interested.
B002YJHXXM|5|I love this stuff.. I think I've ordered it 3 or 4 times.
B00MXHUMSS|5|this isna really cool headband
B00G5L89JM|5|The real deal. Not some cheap imitation. Worth the money to keep your kiddos teeth clean.
B002NE8KL2|2|I really did not like this shampoo.  The smell was horrible!  I stopped using the moment I smelled the stuff and ended up using my regular shampoo to wash my braids.  Maybe I got a bad bottle or something, but I don't recommend this product.
B0028C21DM|2|These masks seem to be designed to prevent your spittle from contaminating other people. They are not air-sealed. They do not protect the wearer from anything. That makes sense in an operating room. I had wanted a simple dust mask to hydrate my sinuses on dry days (the retained moisture from my breath should do the trick). These masks also smell from some kind of chemical treatment, which is normal for many face mask filters.
B002MZ8BK2|5|This little gem is awesome. Every time I do my nails I use this to put cute and unique designs on my nails.
B00BDGSOL2|5|well i have purchased this a while ago, and i thought to give it few month to see what is it like ,,,<br />however i have start to apply this everyday whenever i pass by my room for a month or 2 ,, almost more than 4 times a day ..<br />than i got busy i had it once at night for 2 month .. in total i will say 4 month .. i had a very thin eyelashes due to mascara, glue .. etc .. so i stopped mascara and i had this instead during repairing period without waiting when i will see the result ..<br />i was invited over for a wedding and i used a real mascara this time ,, seriously i could feel my lashes reaches my eyelid closely to my eyebrow .. and from the side i can see curl lashes like it was false lases ...<br /><br />I Diffidently recommend this product BUT if U want faster result I will say  FORGET about it ..<br /><br />but take it from me IT WORKS ..
B008FP6KBU|3|Was not fully pleased with the quality of these brushes.
B003BQ6QXK|5|Works just as it says. Easy to put up, doesn't fog, is everything I was looking for in a shower mirror. When I moved I took it down, and re-hung it at the new place using those 3M adhesives that specifically said they were for the &#34;outdoors&#34;. And the thing is still on the wall.
B000GHVLPU|4|This cologne has stood the test of time for sure, many of today's men are using girly man cologne's, can't tell the difference if it was meant for a man or women, but English Leather, definitely was made for Men...
B002LMBLTY|4|Nice scent, and cleans my hair really well. Nice lather.
B000C235WQ|1|This review is to let you know that I Havent recieved this item. And The Reason That I Havent Called Or Contaced You Is Because I Didn't Print Out The Confirmation Number. And I Dont Have The Phone Number. If You Guys Wanna Call Me This Is My Number To Let You Guys Now, So Please Call Me.  (909)936-3808
B000QU8QS2|3|I find it a little narrow on the top.  It is okay for just shampoo and wash but not if client has color to wash off.  Also water seeps through the elastic.
B00LU1V3JK|4|My daughter is hooked on Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream.  I have been telling her she needs to start applying eye cream underneath her eyes.  She has been taking her youthful glow for granted and not properly caring for her beautiful skin.  She noticed an incredible difference underneath her eyes after using Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream.<br /><br />With 24 hours of using it she noticed a difference.  Initially she was applying it underneath her eyes, but when she discover her eyelids were getting a little dark, she began applying it on her eyelids as well.  The first couple of days after applying it at night, she would wake up with her eyes feeling sticky.  Now it does not happen.  Now her eyes pop above and below.  She is confident with not wearing making when leaving the house.<br /><br />Prior to using Body Merry, she would apply quit a bit of concealer underneath her eyes, now she does not use so much, when wearing make up.  She has been wanting a natural look.<br /><br />Berry Merry ahs packed in cutting edge peptides like Matrixyl-3000 and Tripeptide-5 with an ocean based Retinol and botanical Hyaluronic Acid. They know that's not enough – so they've added lots of antioxidants, organic vitamins and minerals, pure plant oils and botanical actives – Aloe, Witch Hazel, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Vitamin C, Cucumber, Beeswax, Jojoba Oil, Tamanu Oil, Green Tea, Licorice, Eyebright, Avocado Oil, Flax Seed Oil, Rose Hip Oil, Lemon, Lemongrass, Vitamin B5, Lavender and Chamomile (to name just a few!).<br /><br />The cream works well on all skin types and leaves your skin looking and feeling firm, plump and young. My daughter is getting fast and lasting results.<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.
B004VW59DG|5|Got this for my fiancé for Christmas and he loved it! He absolutely raves about it and tells me at least once a week that its the coolest gift he's ever gotten. Super fast shipping and exactly as described! Thank you!
B0013JHGPO|5|Normally I do my own nails with CND Shellac product.  I wanted something to  use for those occasions when I don't have time to do the Shellac process.  I ordered this and clear color and top coat.  They worked just great!  I have not heard anyone else mention this but regular nail polish remover would not work at removing.  I had to use acetone to remove it.  I did not have to soak them but it took a bit of work to get this off.  All in all I will certainly use it when I am off the Shellac for a few days.  It certainly kept the polish on my nails.
B00019DODU|5|I was a little worried getting this brush because I was afraid the plastic handle might effect the quality of it.  But it is a really nice, well-made brush!  The bristles are firmly in place and don't fall out.  I would recommend this brush.
B00ICOJMH8|5|great product!
B00016XJ4M|5|I love this stuff. I use it 1-2 times a day and have bought multiple bottles.
B004Y9L9K8|5|Always love this product.
B000EH2R7S|3|It takes forever to get enough lotion out to condition my son's hair.  I wish this product came in a tub instead.  The product itself is non-greasy, penetrates quickly and does soften his hair.  It doesn't add much shine though.
B007YV2R40|5|I love this and I cannot wait to wear it for my end of month wedding. Reallly good price it's $70-120 at Davids Bridal. This is way better looking.
B0017JR6M8|5|I Luved this perfume the first time I got it for a birthday gift so when I ran out when a looking could not find called nordstrums and they told me go on line and I found it and it still wonderful and I didn't have to live the house!!!!
B000G686U4|5|I highly recommend these clippers for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) I've had them for close to three years and they are just as sharp and cut just as well as when I received them.<br />2) I have very thick and quick growing nails and yet these clippers work great with little effort on my part.<br />3) They have a lifetime sharpening guarantee - pretty amazing!<br />4) They are simply the best clippers I've ever had - I've thrown all the other ones (cheaply made) that I used to have away.
B00BDJ3JUU|1|Not as expected, poor color, poor quality
B00AAGO9RO|5|I've been using Biotouch for years. This color has a nice gloss to it that some clients really like. King of like a liquid eyeliner look. If you like that glossy finish, then jet black is one of the best colors! Before ordering, I was couldn't remember which black I used to use, so I emailed them and they answered quickly. Will def buy again.
B000TFPGP0|5|I have tried many different treatments over the years; expensive and inexpensive and I can say this product is wonderful! It helped me maintain my blonde hair!
B00BQM3S3C|5|For me, it works GREAT! A little goes a long way. Have been using it for over a week and it has helped with my acne and dry skin.<br />I feel like it works better with the argan oil I've been using for almost a month. The argan oil hasn't done too much for my acne but it has helped with my dry skin as well. Both make an effective combo! :D
B000F8FYGC|1|This product smells absolutely HORRIBLE! I used it twice maybe, then realized that I just couldn't handle it. I even sat it out for the girls in my dorm to use... after one smell they all refused. And so it sits. Useless. Gross. Don't buy it.
B00910ZHJE|5|I've done my nails basically every night after getting this. It's so much fun. There's so many colors. This def exceeds my expectations
B00C8YCFU4|5|I'm always looking for new masks to try, and I really love this one. I was excited to try it knowing that it's from the Dead Sea. I always loved every product I owned that came from the dead sea. This mask definitely lived up to my expectations. My skin was super smooth, bright, and extra soft after using this just the first time! It smells really nice, like mint, and goes on real smooth. I love how it feels on my skin. Make sure not to get it too close to your eyes because the fumes can sting your eyes a little. When it was time to wash it all off, I didn't have a hard time. It washed off real nicely and left my skin feeling insanely refreshed. I absolutely love it!<br /><br />*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.
B002LHO8VM|5|This is my second Spa Sister cap and I love it. It's too cute and it dries easily in less than 24 hours. The fabric is nice and soft. One cap will last you for years. My roots do get a little wet around the edges with this model, but I don't mind because I usually wear it curly or touch it up with the blow dryer and flat iron when it's straight. I'm sure if I was more careful in the shower, it wouldn't happen, though.
B00KYWDP1A|4|I love them, there are just a few colors have fall out but not to much so there a great!!
B00512HBQ8|3|I have been using this product every night, making sure my eyelids are free of makeup and squeaky clean, for just over 9 weeks. Sadly I am still waiting to see those long full thick eyelashes many of you are talking about. I have seen a small amount of growth so I will continue to use the product as a little growth is better than none.
B000BIUGRI|5|I was so excited when my B&B Prep bottle arrived yesterday.  I recently started going to a salon where they use B&B products and just loved the results from them and from the samples they gave me to use at home.  I wanted to get some shampoos and the Prep and Styling Lotion for sure but was hoping to find them at a discount.  When I found the Prep and Styling Lotion on Amazon I was very excited.  I used both for the first time last night and see a noticeable difference with how my hair looks and feels.  It looks like it did at the salon which I am not usually able to achieve.  I can't wait to get more B&B items!
B008F05J2Q|4|Good product, but pricey.  This bowl has been growing on me. Good shape and size (a bit large perhaps).  Good that it flares out at the top - keeps your brush handle from hitting the edge. Completely stainless steel. Metal is thin and flimsy. It came with the tiniest dent in it. It will visibly dent the first time I drop it.  The same product with MUCH heavier metal would be the ultimate for me.
B00KS6QQEU|5|Great combs
B0089EFMKW|1|We have had nothing but issues and had to return twice. I went to this company and purchased of of their more expensive units and have had no issue.<br /><br />Stay away from this if your a spa. For the home us it is ok.
B000KQ7X8G|5|Amazing price........Pureology Anti-Fade Complex Hydrate Condition, 33.8 Ounce....You will pay the same price on Amazon that you would pay in a Salon for half this size!~
B00EH9QM16|5|This ships from China so it won't be at your apartment the next day unless you live in China. So long as you pay attention to the shipping dates you won't be disappointed. It came well within the shipping dates ranges. It looked exactly like the picture. It's very easy to attach. It's a great little clip in!
B008ZPOL3E|4|Good one
B002PMLEK6|3|Works well but smells awful.
B005KJ3GAM|1|I bought one at the store and loved it! until stopped working :(<br />replaced batteries, replaced head and thing. Won't buy them again.
B00016XJ4M|5|Seriously, didn't even get the usual PMS breakout. My skin's not super bad, but I usually used to have one or two zits at a time, with the bigger breakout mentioned above. I've been using this toner (didn't use toner before) once or twice a ready most days (I also started using pond's evening soothe wipes nightly, which helped) for the past 11 days, and my skin is completely clear! Highly recommended. Also, pleasant event and refreshing feel.
B001JI3N3S|2|My fault.  I thought this was a different Avon product.  I was looking for the Nail eperts Strong Results.  Guess I wasn't paying attention.
B001QTLNK0|1|This is my second order of this serum. I thought I would see improvement. I feel it has dried my skin.  i may go back to the drug store brand of cream that I had been using.  Sorry, but you asked.
B00H4EX2FK|5|Love this product !! works great on my hair.
B00139PD8G|1|I have been  using this product for over 8 years, I love the real product from Goldwell,....... however this vendor sent me an imitation, not the real thing, it even had a different packaging. At first I thought, Goldwell may have change the packaging, so I open it an started using it........BAD MISTAKE...... Since I open it and use it, it was to late to return it<br />:-(.........It went in the trash.
B0075X0Z46|5|This little gizmo works wonderfully.  I was a little worried about it being batter operated and not rechargeable but the battery lasts for quite a long time.  Haven't had to replace it yet.
B0015474CM|5|I use this when I don't wash my hair for a day or a mid-day pick-me-up to sop up the excess oil as well as giving my hair body and texture as well as a to die for earthy tropical-esque scent. I have to rub it in really well or I end up with little sections of white dry shampoo showing. I also use it on my bangs; I have oily skin and oily hair and spritzing my bangs with this keeps my face from breaking out and my bangs from looking slick with oil. I adore it and have bought it again and again. The only slight draw back is the price, but it works so well I consider it an investment.
B000C1W4HE|5|My wife loves this stuff don't why, but that's works for me, happy wife Happy life
B00R848RZQ|5|I have been using this for a couple of day and I think it's great.  No issues with sensitive skin however the smell is a bit off putting.  I thought it would smell more like Oranges but it does not.  However, anything that will help in looking younger.
B00147FGJ8|5|I love this tanning lotion.  The bronzer really does its job and the silicon additives are just an extra bonus!!!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!!
B0019SWVBI|1|If you are expecting to get a two way stamper,don't order this product it's not what you get.  The seller sends you a regular stamper and scramper, and gets away with it by the way it's titled not by the way it's pictured.
B00CHMWAY8|5|I am totally in love with this great product. I will continue buying itdms ftom this brand. Totally recommended!
B00IKZHJGK|3|hairpins are too large for small heads
B00B406WDY|5|The bottle is full and everything looks GREAT . Thank you!
B006WM8FGG|5|LARGE SELECTION OF HAIR CARE PRODUCTS. THEY HAD WHAT I  WAS  LOOKING FOR, HIGH QUALITY RIGHT PRICE AND FAST SERVICE
B00P1D7IB0|5|These earrings look better in person than in the picture. They are beautiful and fit perfectly. I get compliments on them every time I wear them.
B009YKK78C|5|Loved it. !!!
B00A0IWSIO|5|decided to stop coloring my hair about 6 years ago and let it grow, it is now waist length but of course the ends are the old bleached hair, was having a hard time keeping them conditioned,  this oil is fabulous, applied to damp ends after shampooing leaves hairs soft , silky and shiny without a greasy look...is has a very distinct fragrance  which I really like , would definitely recommend
B0038TWFGW|5|Great products!
B008SQSBJK|5|I like this lip balm very much because it really calms and restores my lips overnight. I have very dry lips. I could even say that I always have at least a tiny crack on them and this balm helps heal and prevent those obnoxious flakes.
B0073B3ESY|5|Fast action.  Pantene s.e. conditions  very well.  It helped with reducing brassy  tones in blond/ gray hair.  Use sparingly  on the gray for a white ...not blue tone.  Hope this helps.  It is the Best of these type conditioners.
B007OZZI9M|4|The main reason i got this was to have it cover the strong smell of coconut from the coconut lotion i was making! At 1st if you smell from the bottle it's really light can barely tell what it suppose to be, but once i had added it to my lotion it had become more notice-able! I think it helped because i heated it to mix well with the coconut oil i was using.
B00EMN0IC6|4|The brush works as expected except it doesn't have the &#34;beep&#34; feature signalling when time is up and you position brush to another area.  Kinda miss having that.
B004EHQ9LY|5|Super
B001T8S7T8|3|I had to buy these after my dog chewed up my last one. They got to my house very quick. there not they best set of brushes but they definitely do the trick.
B001TVURXY|5|good stuff, had used before
B006UUTNCU|1|I have been using this product faithfully for over 3 weeks.  I really cannot tell a difference. I also applied it to a burn I received on my arm a few years ago hoping it would fade out the site.  Can't say I have noticed a big difference.  It may work for some, but I truly am disappointed.
B00013Z0CE|2|Not my favorite burts product and I am a huge fan. This has a funny smell to it, and is very greasy. I will admit it works great, just cant get over the smell and the long lasting greasy effect.
B007ISRNJS|5|I have thick wavy hair and this works like a charm. Tried using the glove for about 2 minutes but tossed it after I realized it wasn't really necessary. Glad I didn't spend more on a super &#34;fancy&#34; wand.
B005JJCRJY|4|As an older person I was looking for a cheek color that would glide on and not pool or cake. This color meets that criteria. I love that I was able to try it in a sample size before investing in a regular bottle.
B000SOMZOW|5|I buy these  black ones by the dozen as well as the blue ones. I love their light weight and fine elastic. I hardly feel they are on. The elastic does stretch out a bit after a while, way before the mask itself. if you were clever you could replace it, but these are so inexpensive....
B005CROADY|1|Very disappointed with this purchase. I have ordered this product in the past and have always liked it. This particular tube was very runny. Just ran out did even have to squeeze it out. I recently purchased this product again from a differnt seller and I am pleased with the product.!!
B003Q6TC6I|5|I have thick wavy hair and the Infiniti helps to smooth my hair without making it look limp and lifeless.
B00AHAWWO0|5|Works very well!
B00KWR2IV0|5|Great product, can't use every day on my fine hair though...
B009DKYB94|5|good
B000BYGBJY|4|My bedroom is navy blue and white, and I'm a bit obsessive about everything i keep on my shelves fitting in with the color scheme, so I buy the white ones and use them for my day-to-day makeup. I keep two at a time and wash them as soon as they start to get a bit grubby. After a few cycles through the washer the lining gets damaged and I buy another to replace it. I've bought three (I think) over the past 3 years (approximately); I travel a lot and carry them in my hand luggage. At this price, I feel I get decent value for money. I just hope they don't stop making them!
B00CE2JC9W|4|Not sure it works or maybe I am doing something wrong. Can be sensitive to the 'needles' so it takes a gentle roll.  I will keep trying it though to see what I think over more time.
B00B9ZQBOO|5|This is definitely one of my favorite collections to date. Gorgeous, bright colors and the application for these minis was perfect. Minimum chipping within a week for me :)
B00ENOB1YI|5|This scent is wonderful. Body lotion lasts for a long time and makes your skin smooth and silky. Love it. Don't hesitate on this one. Its a good deal
B0096SE2YM|4|I really like the consistency of this product and results I get from this product! My hair is TAMED by Super Skinny Serum! What I mean by that is that my colored, highlighted, blow-dried hair that is full of static electricity from the forced air heat this winter is smooth and calmed using this serum. It doesn't weigh the hair down or make it oily or greasy, either. I really trust the Paul Mitchell products that I have tried. They are high quality. I recommend this Super Skinny Serum!
B0000DGBI2|5|I have extremely sensitive teeth and gums and had long ago given up on the idea of whitening as it was too painful for me.    When I found this great sale, I couldn't pass it up. I purchased this at the promo price of $7.50 a month or so ago.    I set aside 2 hours this morning to whiten my teeth which had gotten to a point that I was unhappy with the color even if it would mean a little pain. Boy am I happy that I went through with it!    This product did not hurt my teeth or gums AT ALL. There was no pain during the whitening process or after.  I used the trays exactly as the directions indicated, although I admit that I didn't use as much of the product as they recommended. I cut the gel use in half.    I took before and after shots which I'll be posting shortly at my blog, [ ... ]  and have to say that I am VERY happy with the results.    My teeth don't hurt a bit and they are a full shade whiter. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend!
B00FGGW7KY|5|These bath towels are great! I have been using them for 4 years.  I use them when I shower and have noticed that after a few months of using this with regular body wash that the scars on my face are reduced significantly!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has acne scars.
B002SKY5UG|5|This is my favorite. I use this Curly Pudding as a leave in conditioner.
B00ARTKA8G|4|good toothbrushes
B00LSAGI0W|5|Its an exceptional and great product.My clients love this sticky feet for this style and feet are way to sticky.It is easy to stick on anyone feet but much easier to come off.
B00J2AP9F0|5|This razor is awesome!  Gillette sent me one to try and I am so glad they did.  The Flexball technology is pivotal in getting a better shave(pun intended).  The blades rotate with the contours of the face.  With other razors I have to go other some places multiple times to get all the whiskers.  With the Fusion ProGlide with Flexball technology, I usually on need one or two strokes.  The shave is easy and effortless.  The head is shared with other Gillette razors so no need for buying new heads if you already are a Gillette Fusion user.
B00I4A9PMM|5|It works.  Fantastic... I don't have to wear mascara anymore!  use it daily- never forget a day ... It's worth it.
B0049PLAHE|5|My granddaughter swims five days a week and her hair was a chlorine disaster.  Solved the problem and her hair is even growing again!  Great for damaged hair!
B00QCT02WE|5|As described -- thank you!
B002TSA92K|5|My son just loves this shower gel & the fresh, crisp scent is not over-whelming, and it does not irritate his skin!!!  He's 12, so this is great for young men his age!!!
B001MYLM0U|5|Love this perfume. It's the only one I can wear that doesn't give me a headache. Shipping was fast, and it was bigger than I thought which was a nice surprise. Would definitely order again. Super cure packaging as well. This is the only scent of the Harajuku Lovers that I like, and I'm bummed to see that its been discontinued.
B005XUNG5I|1|I really can't believe all the positive reviews. Complete waste of money. Seriously.  Not like I have e<br />Elephant feet, but this is way too weak to achieve anything. It removes the tiniest layer, and that's it.
B004QWPWJ2|5|lovely
B00ET601H8|1|The ordering process was very confusing. I ended up ordering two of the exfoliator. I thought I was ordering the tan builder and an exfoliater. So I'm very disgusted I have no tanner to use.
B005C1C02S|5|Jewels are great and small.
B00A6FBFSA|5|Bought this perfume last time we were in the U.S. and just love it!<br />Too bad you can not buy it in Sweden, or order on the internet ....<br />I get to buy every other year when we come over to the U.S.
B00FVGS3W0|5|These brushes are everything!!!
B00C8YCFU4|5|Glowing skin after use.
B001ASOD86|5|Love it
B00027D6SE|5|I usually do not write reviews on products, but I had to comment on Bye Bye Blemish. I've only used it for a few days and already have significant improvement. I had some pesky little whiteheads that just wouldn't go away, and after using this for a couple of days they are gone and a huge pimple I had on my check is down half it's size. This was a lot better than I was expecting!! I have tried everything and this has seemed to work the best. Definitely recommend!
B0023AT6R8|3|I have medium hair both in thickness and in dryness. I don't color or otherwise treat my hair but I bought this because I don't like to use a lot of chemicals. This is a safe product. Unfortunately it kind of weighed down my hair. My hair felt weird after washing. It was clean but hard to style. My hair just wanted to lay flat. Tried it for a couple of weeks but then gave up on it.
B002PQ8BQM|5|This really does work. I've struggled with excessive underarm sweat for as long as I can remember, and NO deodorants work. Not even the clinical strength ones! I've tried prescription deodorant but it made my underarms itch so badly that I couldn't use it.<br /><br />These work...I do have to use 2 or 3 a week (2-3 nights in a row), so the package isn't really an 8 week supply for me. But I do notice a huge difference even after the 1st use.<br /><br />One caveat--I DID get excessively itchy the first time. It was because I applied this too broadly--out of the hairline, onto the surrounding skin. I itched like crazy and had to wipe it off because I couldn't sleep. Since then, I'm careful to stay in the hairline, and it's fine. Will definitely be stocking up on these for the summer!
B005OZQSQQ|5|Works great and quick delivery!
B001ET6XNO|1|It seemed to clean well enough and lathered okay with the little amount I was using once a day. But I won't know the extent of how well it could have worked or cleaned as I had to stop its use. The worst thing about this cleanser was that it made my skin incredibly dry. At the time I had a little amount of acne, which the dryness aggravated. I've since found a benzyl peroxide that does work without the excessive drying (and no, I am in no way sponsored to endorse it):  [[ASIN:B00164FKWW Acne.org 8 oz. Treatment]]
B0011294XU|5|i purchased this and it came 2 days before the estimated delivery!! I love this so much..i see some other females who are a little darker than me who had to purchase the C8 also and mix it with this to get their color but thank god i didn't have to. I have a acne scar in between my eyebrows that I'm still trying to figure out how to remove but when i put this on it really covered it and it feels so light on my face. I was always on the edge about Liquid Foundation but i will be buying another one of these.. Its amazing :)
B00HOD80B2|2|I have the shampoo so I decided to buy the conditioner.  For some reason, it smells nothing like the shampoo.  In fact, it smells pretty bad; it kind of makes me gag when I put it on my hair.  Bizarre.
B00UREAGU8|5|This mask smells so good. It smells clean and fresh, which I didn't expect from a mud mask. My face felt much softer after using this. I put it on and let it dry for about 5-10 minutes then washed it off with circular motions to exfoliate some. It smells great and moisturizes a lot. I received it discounted through AMZ Review Trader.
B003NSPOF2|5|Use it every day on my own face. The SPF combined with moisturizer is reason I use it. It makes my skin stay nice. I like it.
B00JUG08YI|5|Excelente product, very easy to manage. Have fun using it.
B000WZK4RW|5|This is exactly what I was hoping for.  The bright grapefruit fragrance with a hint of thyme is so fresh smelling.  The soap quickly lathers and rinses easily without leaving a residue.  I'm guessing that since this is a kitchen soap you might not want a lingering smell on your hands; however, this smells so good I wish it did stay awhile.
B00112HRTI|5|This is my favorite lip color and has been for years.  So you can image how horrified I was when Loreal discontinued  the color.  Thankfully, I'm still able to get it through Amazon.  I'm a red head so this is the perfect shade for me.
B000SLOYO4|5|I picked this up from Whole Foods randomly some time back, and am extremely glad I did!   This is the lip tint that started my obsession with lip tints. It adds the perfect amount of color and redness to my lips, but is subtle enough to blend into my natural lip color. It's perfect for casual situations where full on red lipstick (which I am also fond of) is too much. I do wish this were a tad more moisturizing, but I usually wear Smith's Rosebud Salve over this so that my lips remain moisturized.
B00004U9UY|4|I have used several Crabtree and Evelyn hand creams and this is probably my least favorite because of the scent. As a moisturizer it works great, especially around the nails and fingertips where my hands get dry and crack. The hand therapy goes on very smooth and non greasy but the scent is very strong and spicy, it reminds me of a man's cologne or aftershave.
B00KCFAZTE|4|I like the cooling feeling I get 2hen i apply this serum to my eye area. In a week of use i have not seen any improvement in the dark circles under my eyes but i will keep trying. If i see improvements I will be back!
B00AHU877Q|5|Never tried an under eye roll on before, so my experience is limited, but I'm loving this so far. It rolls on easily, feels great under the eye, dries quickly, leaves no significant residue, and really helps to control the appearance of my dark circles. I know the tube seems small at 0.5oz. but thus far it's lasting a long time with daily applications. I'll definitely be buying another tube once this runs out. As an added bonus, I feel better about the natural ingredients.
B000KMCRWW|5|It's terrific!!! My favorite of all hand lotions. It's hard to find in stores, and I was delighted to see I could get it through Amazon..
B001E771K0|5|I have been using this product for less than a week and my skin is already looking and feeling different!
B00BJ57HR4|5|I LOVE this color... its the perfect spring color with its lavender pinkish hue. The formula for it is great as well.
B004W8MEA0|4|This is a nice little TV combo unit. The sound volume is a bit low on the TV itself but works well when connected to the aux speakers in the cradle. The only con are the batteries as they do not seem to charge well. Again it all works out when connected to the cradle.
B00D063904|5|A bit heavy but quite lovely. Does not look tacky (coming from one who rarely wears makeup and limited jewelry.)
B0057KA3PA|5|I received this as a gift for my 16th birthday. I'm a HUGE Bieber fan so this was the perfect gift! I love the smell, its very soft and floral-y. I want the \\"girlfriend\\" perfume now, too!
B000GLRREU|3|When I see my dentist at my next appointment, I will know if the Waterpik flosser was of value to me.  I am having some problems with water draining out when using.  Perhaps there is a special method for usage that I am unaware of.
B00IJZMXT4|5|Nice. Very high quality.
B0079R6BD2|5|I loved it!
B005XQAFJM|5|kinda watery but still works really well! very pleased
B00FQ0SLUK|5|Best ink there is! I wont buy any other brand!
B0002GTS6E|5|My go-to daytime moisturizer.
B006XWQA94|5|This is a very sheer bb cream. It has just a hint of shimmer to give you a glow. I am in love. I don't wear foundation and this is perfect. It looks small but I only have to use a little bit to cover my whole face. It will last a while. I have very acne prone skin and so far no breakouts. I got the beige tone and it is perfect for me. I am medium toned skin. Also the packaging is adorable. Cute enough that I have it out in my bathroom. Some things that say shimmer on it look unnatural but this is a natural healthy glow. Almost like you are lit up by candlelight. I am experimenting with Korean and Japanese products.Asian women have beautiful skin now I see why. We are a little behind in the USA.Will be buying again!
B0011VUB6K|5|If you love coconut and shower gels/all purpose product this is for you. This is a quality product and the aroma is so nice in a hot shower; it takes me back to the tropics.
B00DU6ZV28|5|I received my Braun Cooltec Solo shaver last week from a program run by Braun but because I had to go out of town I was not able to charge it and use it.  I finally got a chance to use it this week though.  I have been using it for the last 3 days and I have noticed that it gives me a much closer shave than the electric shaver I was using before.  I was skeptical at first about the cooling bar but I really do think that it minimizes skin irritation.  My skin feels smoother, cooler and less irritated than when I was using my old shaver.  I would definitely recommend this shaver to friends and family.
B0007M3Z5S|5|I have about 15 shaving soaps and creams. This one gives a luxuriant lather, smells great and is easily my favorite. It is expensive but worth it. The amount in the tub is on the large size. Will try other Trumper creams.
B003YMJJSK|2|Agree with other that is dries my skin.  One review says this &#34;hydrates&#34; the skin.  I didn't read ingredient list but I think this's impossible, unless it has oil moisturizers like &#34;Dove.&#34;  Also its very &#34;sticky&#34;, like honey.  I would use this after a sweaty day.  I have seen little if any foaming.
B00BDAKY7K|5|Have been using this product for about a year now and it realy helps with my fibermialga pain I use it with L'eudine Blue Relieve relaxing & Soothing Cream
B002HK2GI0|5|Best eyelash comb out there!
B00GJ6NAWE|4|Excellent shaving cream.  It produces a thick, and lasting lather.  Enjoyable fragrance that doesn't linger.<br />I get great results when using a wet shaving brush to pick up some of the shave cream, then using a shaving mug with a few extra drops of water in which to whip up a firm and full lather.
B0006VA0IA|1|After purchasing this brush, my wife compared it to the ones she purchased at the actual Mac store.  The quality of this brush is much less than those bought at the actual store.  The bristles feel much cheaper and my wife definitely noticed a difference and said it was not the same brush.  You get what you pay for with this one.
B00AEIVIGS|5|Just got it yesterday n made some homemade body butter with almond oil n frankensence and ylang ylang mmmmm n my skin just loves it really is a true butter for the skin melts right in
B003UNP20W|5|I bought this for my wife as a gift and she absolutely loves them. This is what she said about these brushes: I love wide variety of brushes. They are stylish, blend well, are super soft and don't shed. Well worth spending the money on these!
B00DYZ7ZCO|1|This is the most overpriced, over rated, underperforming pos that I have ever purchased. The ads misrepresent this product in my opinion.  I had a Norelco which I have had for 15 years and I decided to look for a new razor . I have always felt you get what you pay for and quality is important to me. I decided to buy and try it. Well, I wasn't pleased from the beginning but I decided to believe what they told me that one had to use the razor for several months before your skin would adapt to it. What BS! I tried to return it but it was past the return policy period.  I  am back to using my old Norelco with a set of new heads and it does a much superior job compared to this piece of junk.  IN my opinion, save yourself some money and stay away from this thing.
B0073SBO5W|2|Extremely messy for short hair.
B004KUAB2S|2|I really wanted to love this. Color is super pale. I'm usually between the lightest and second lightest shade of foundation in any brand, and this was just a bit light for me. Best for the palest of the pale. Still wearable for me though. My problem was that it made me break out almost immediately. I have medium sensitive skin, but this was outrageous. Within hours of putting it on I had several breakouts. Thought this was a fluke so I waited a few weeks and tried again. Same thing happened. Tried it one more time after that, and again, 3 pimples by the end of the day. Unfortunate because I was stoked to find something with light coverage and high SPF.
B00FZESMKG|5|I have been using this facial wash for over a week now. My skin feels clean and smooth after cleansing. Smells good too. This does not leave any kind of residue on my skin, just feels very clean. Love that there are no harmful chemicals and is 100% organic.
B001ET7M84|5|After buying a similar product for my hands, I went back to Amazon and found this one.  I use a healing ointment and put these on and go to bed.  My feet feel and look better than they have in years.
B000FS05VG|5|After looking into several reviews on blow dryers, I learned about the Revlon Tourmaline.  All of the reviews were so positive.  I've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are.  The placement couldn't be better on the controls. The price was right as well!  Blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive.  A very good value.
B000NSU04A|5|Just what my old head needed..ha.
B005N7YHGS|1|New wand and already several teeth broken.  It happened with my last one but not as quickly so obviously I am very careful with this one, thinking it is my fault they broke,  and the teeth are breaking off daily.  No one else has access to it.
B000S8HGIS|4|Had HerStyler that broke and liked it so much I bought another. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good and reasonable straightening iron.
B006TJYOL2|4|Pretty good stuff simply because it doesn't break my skin out. ( I have combination skin, and it's quite sensitive) Makes my skin smell citrus-y and fresh.
B006K0Q7V0|5|2 for the price of one, who can resist?<br /><br />I think I discovered this when it first came out...and I've tried many others, but this is the best.  My wife loves it, and coworker ladys thinks its great as well.<br /><br />I spray Lasts ALL day, and night in needed,  :-)
B00KA8SJWS|5|Ok
B000LQMN8K|5|I love this fragrance! Please don't ever stop making it available.
B001ET77O8|5|Luxurious and long lasting.
B000P22UU6|5|So happy to have found it!!!
B00BB3K2QW|4|Great
B0013YXQ58|5|The skin cream definitely helps moisturize my dry skin with almost no irritation, as I have sensitive skin. I use this along with Insta Naturals Vitamin C serum and my skin feels amazing!
B008DWSJ1O|5|I admit I had my doubts but I am very happy with how my hair turned out.  I followed the instructions to the &#34;t&#34; and my hair looks vibrant and so natural!  It shines and feels great.  Don't let this opportunity get away.  You must try it.  I am glad I did.
B005RU65BG|1|This perfume does not have a scent.  I did not like.
B006Y7U4S6|5|Exactly as described:)
B000TAE0RK|5|I use to break out all the time, then I found this soap and I started using it when I lived in California, this soap works great and Ive used it since 2004, going on 10 or so years! A warning: This soap can cause embarrassing moments when you visit other peoples houses and use their showers, because it is a charcoal soap it leaves brown/black stuff in the shower and when you forget to clean it out, people are like....what in the world is that in the shower! And so I just give them an awkward look and leave it up to their imagination! hahahahaha! Enjoy people! God Bless!
B005HIM4HW|5|Exactly what I wanted
B009H17ODE|5|This is the best dental floss. I have some tight spots between teeth. This floss glides through beautifully.
B00N4OZ66M|5|I love this fragrance.  Very fresh and not &#34;perfumey&#34;  Kit was very nice.
B00188BQXI|5|When my first one stopped working (I dropped it one too many times) I tried buying several others (Remington included). I ended up taking them all back to the store and getting on Amazon to buy my original one.  I hope this one lasts many more years.
B00HQOR79K|5|Honestly, I'm not paid to say this or anything, but I have only used these ONE TIME and I love it. My hair is pretty thick to begin with, and after the first wash it literally looks even thicker and full. I love it. For those of you who it didn't work for I'm sorry to hear that. But so far it has worked for me and I love it :)
B004D014BW|5|Easy to apply...works weel. non greasy
B0009MFUPO|4|I used these to replace the heads which were several years old on my Norelco Speed shaver...  Normally, I would just replace the entire razor in order to get fresh batteries and a new motor; however it's becoming difficult to find reasonalbly priced Speed-XL shavers.  I was surprised that after several years of everyday use there wasn't a great deal of difference with new heads.  That said, Amazon had by far the best price for these heads beating even WalMart by $10!
B0057W0MYK|5|There is something in these soaps that makes it possible not to need lotion afterward. Don'T care what is has or doesn't have. All I know is that these little soaps make hands very soft.
B00U6IC4BE|5|really helped my nails
B005DYJS4C|5|Love this product. Works well on my hair and smells good.
B00NK65R5O|5|The product is light. A small dab goes on smoothly, covers well and never feels greasy. My skin feels softer already after a few weeks of use. I have sensitive skin that has not been aggravated in the slightest bit by this product.
B00DP1M6BW|5|It works for me.
B0062GZB9G|5|I have been using this product for a couple of years and love it.
B003ILUQPM|5|Encontré la recomendación de estas placas en un blog de belleza ( El beauty blog de Eli) y desde que las compré estoy encantada con ellas. Es verdad que algunas imágenes no tienen la definición de Konad pero son geniales para tener variedad de diseños a un precio más que razonable. Además me llegaron una semana después de pedirlas. Recomendadas!!!
B00IIECUV2|5|smelt weird out of package but works amazing lol
B00AZKVBYO|5|received sooner than anticipated.  Overall great scent (I'm picky) and it doesn't bother my kids (allergies) when I use it.  Love it, will be a a frequent purchase
B005LF0QZI|3|I bought these and just love them.  Solved a big problem for me, a small gap between two upper crowns which tends to collect food particles in an irritating way.  Great to carry when you are out to dinner, as opposed to trying to use floss in a restaurant.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I liked them too much, and started substituting them for nightly flossing.  Then, one of my old crowns came off when I chewed on an unexpectedly sticky piece of toffee.  My dentist said he could just re-cement it, a great result.  BUT, he said I had something he had never seen in his 40 years of dental practice, that is, a deep groove in the gum between the two teeth.  I think I was just lucky that the old crown's cement had failed, because otherwise I wouldn't have realized that I was damaging my gums.  And, this was on the lower jaw, not the place between the upper crowns where I most often used the brushpicks.<br /><br />So enjoy them, but (my advice) don't use them as a substitute for floss without checking very carefully to see (if you even can) if you are wearing nasty grooves in your gum between your teeth.
B007T9XMTQ|5|I really love this product. Unfortunately Norelco is not making it any more. I will miss being able to use it.
B00FGQ6DQI|3|CAn  someone write a review already? Does it work?
B00461HETO|1|This product is fake they don't work, probably all this review is fake, I tried to get my money back.<br />No body answer the phone or email. Please don't buy this product is not good.
B00132FV8U|4|The aroma is quite pungent. I personally like it; it's musky, manly. My girlfriend does not seem to care for it, which is the only reason it's not getting 5 stars.
B00JNO3UG0|4|This set is more than worth the price. After my initial purchase, I purchased four more sets as Christmas gifts. My wife and I are very pleased.
B00I32AN4K|5|Excellent product that made my hair soft and shiny!
B0085G3KJE|4|Yes
B000C1ZDTU|2|When I got the spray (Jessica Parker's \\"Lovely\\" perfume spray, [[ASIN:B000H70PZG Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker for Women 3.4 Eau De Parfume Spray]] I noticed it was a different color than one I had, e.g. slightly orange like and not the pink tinge of the original one.  In smelling I noticed that the one recently ordered had a definite alcohol smell, whereas the original I had did not.  What a shame.  I am sure this was to cut costs and hoping customers woulod not notice.  Well I did and will not buy again...what a shame because it HAS BEEN my favorite.  I do wonder if the difference is because I bought on line and not directly in a store.  In the meantime, Buyers Beware.  Jonina Weeks
B001KYQ4A0|5|This Caress Daily Silk Beauty Bar is one of my favorites due to the white peach and silky  orange blossom scent.  Additionally, I was able to get the bars for an affordable price at my job.  The lather goes on smoothly on my skin and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I also like that the manufacturer is generous with the amount of soap that the packages come in (due to me going through the soap pretty quick).
B003IL8BQS|5|perfect
B001JL0BWG|5|Wow!  For the price this product is a steal.  I know for my indoor grow room I needed more watts but since I'm quite cheap person bought this instead. The results: planes are growing at a faster rate and strong.  I use it for 1-4plants and it's been providing enough light!
B007MPDZ44|3|Tangled bad
B009VJ0T84|3|They work but it is a bit difficult to open and close.
B001MHMGDY|5|this is the best acrylic i have come across that is not very expensive. adheres to nails really good.would recpommend it to others
B000MAMRHM|4|Hair feels silky and really clean after using this shampoo.  Paul Brown products are all very good.  Love the Hawaiian blends.
B00NBTIB62|1|No stars I purchased 2 of these because while I really liked the product. It was faulty. The first one the zipper broke immediately.  The most recent one. The handle broke.
604113452X|5|This sleep mask is super soft and silky, fits well and comes with ear plugs that are as soft as marshmallows! It even has a small, hidden zipper compartment to keep them in. These are great when you're away from home, have a partner who sleeps with the tv or a light on, or have noisy neighbors among many other circumstances. The only problem I've had is keeping my daughter from stealing it!!
B001U0OQL8|2|This is very strong stuff. If you have sensitive skin, beware! My girlfriend tried to use this and it dried her skin out very badly. We could never tell if it worked or not because she couldn't leave it on for very long. If you have hardcore acne, try it. For small pimples, this just seems like overkill.
B002KHNMVK|1|It's basically shaving cream. You put it on your toothbrush and it's a gel, then you start brushing and it turns into a thick foam and TASTES and FEELS exactly like shaving cream. I almost threw up while brushing my teeth with it, it felt wrong, it IS wrong. I checked the ingredients.......it contains soap. No wonder it foams. I cannot believe they put this toothpaste on the market. My mouth does not feel clean, it feels violated.
B007762NQE|5|Love the fragrance. All natural. And does its job for sure.  I was spending way too much money on the weleda rose deodorant--almost triple the amazon price of the EO Organic selection here. Paying more money doesn't guarantee quality--at least for this product.  I highly recommend a lot of the EO products, and I'm happy to recommend this one.
B003WSFWLY|5|I have extremely dry skin and live in the desert in New Mexico.  My lips chap and bleed in 24 hours here without some kind of lip balm all the time.<br /><br />I've tried many products. A year or so ago my skin care specialist introduced me to the Jane Iredale products.  They're wonderful!  I have to drink water throughout the day, so can't really keep on any kind of lip balm and these are pricey enough that I don't even try to wear them throughout the day.  But I discovered something that works this winter:  when I go to bed at night, I put on the Jane Iredale PureGloss.  It smells and feels terrific.  (I sleep with a towel over my pillow case anyway as I use henna on my hair, so no worries about the lip gloss smudging my pillow case).  I can go all day with minimal lip balm use now and my lips are okay all winter long!
B000HOZDZQ|5|Smells good (like coconut) and easy to use on my quarter-sized tattoo on my wrist.  Can't really speak to effectiveness since I protect my tattoo from the sun as much as I can, but still like to put sunscreen on it.
B00K6RW2D0|5|I just dyed my hair with this last night and I LOVE IT!! I have really long, dark hair that I had previously bleached and dyed the ends a diff color purple...that first dye job had faded so I got this to redo it!! it came out exactly like I had hoped! a dark purple on the bottom 4 inches of my hair! I am going to go ahead and order more! shipped fast and great price!
B007VSVNQO|2|This vacuum is not worth the money!  I've had mine less than a year, and it has been giving me problems since 3 months in.  The canister is extremely stiff to turn open (to empty the dirt) and has cracked across the top.  (Be careful when opening it, too, because it'll all fall out the bottom when you're not expecting it.)  The accordion-style hose for the attachments is also stiff to extend, and the nozzle has now unglued from the hose.  It is also extremely hard to clean and there's a build-up in the tubing that I can't reach to clean out. The suction is fine, but that's the only good thing about this vacuum.
B001BBMG40|5|As a sufferer of mild to moderate adult acne, I've used many different BP products, including several well-known brand name formulations. I've had some degree of success with each.<br /><br />I first used this one (in combination with the Jan Marini Bioclear cream) about 7 years ago on the advice of my doctor. It really cleared my skin up for my wedding. Although I was very pleased with the results, I wasn't convinced it was significantly different than other BP products and it was significantly more expensive. However, after much experimentation I've returned to Jan Marini as I've found that the BP/Bioclear combination keeps my skin nearly 100% clear with consistent use -- something I can't say of any other product or product combination I've tried.<br /><br />Also, from a budget perspective I've found that the bottle goes such a long way (easily lasts me several months) that the price per use is negligible.
B0045W22SW|4|Love this brush for foundation. I like how it is dense and it is soft. I use this for my liquid foundation all the time.
B0017IAF2M|5|works well, smells good,
B000XE0DKU|5|I get it for my wife all the time.  She says it's great lotion and agrees with me on the fragrance.
B004WPGXSW|3|I am always in search for the perfect eyebrow kit! While I like that this kit comes with 3 colors, I wish it had a gel color. Also, I would have liked a better tool kit, so I had to buy a better brush.
B00IDWP4IA|5|I notice a big difference after two weeks!  Dark spots are fading and I had skin cancer surgery and the scar was still red. But now it's almost all gone !  Love this !
B00GST23X4|1|can't use it.  when i read hemp and omega blend, i was envisioning something more 'natural'.  instead i got something that could be industrial &#34;smell&#34; like head and shoulders, a strong detergent shampoo.  was looking for natural.  got industrial.
B00A3LVMMQ|5|First time Brush Shaver, ordered this stand for my brush and razor. It seems well made and looks and feels like its going to last. The base is well weighted and the rubber bottom keeps it from sliding around. Minor complaint is from my wife, she doesn't like the chrome bottom that she has to keep cleaning the water spots from sink splash that mar the looks, but I WILL BE TRAINED to wipe it off after every use. Oh well what we males have to endure to keep peace...HA HA. I am satisfied with the purchase and would not hesitate to recommend it. BTW I still use my old Trac II razor and it fits on the stand.
B005PUZZR8|5|:-)
B00BCYHUUG|1|Item worked great a few times and then quit working all together.  If I'd bought it at a physical store, I could take it back, but Amazon won't take it back. What a waste of money!
B00A8DHI2C|4|Does he job well
B008V9XMY8|5|So happy to finally find this color.<br />It looked great. Thanks amazon.
B000BP0P4U|5|I love this perfume! It's rich. It's sweet smelling but not sickeningly sweet and it has a layer of depth that adds interest and uniqueness. As strange as it may seem, it does remind me of Connemara as we've been there before several times. I hope they come out with more layering products like body wash and lotion to make the scent last longer throughout the day.
B0009EXOKU|5|I can't find these wonderful soap pads anywhere.  They are the very best but it appears I can no longer buy them.  Can't believe 3M has discontinued this product.  Does anyone have any info on this issue?
B00EH10XNW|1|It's very irritating. So disappointed.
B00885UQ8A|5|The first time I bought this lotion was from a beauty supply store in Dallas Tx 4 yrs ago and I have never been disappointed with my purchase. I would by several bottles at a time because the store would run out so fast.. glad I found them on Amazon and at such a great price!
B001G7PLM8|4|The crest product is good. It's not the best toothpaste, but it tastes like cinnamon mostly and it arrives on time.
B002NI0T9O|5|i love this case it keeps the oils protected and organized! Im going to order another the smaller one for personal travel and another to store more oils! enjoy!
B00M8H3RTE|5|Beautiful
B008GSY7UM|3|I used this lighted mirror for one month and today it burnt out.  It sizzled and then lights were out.  Amazon couldn't replace it since it happened after 30 days but Jerdon had excellent customer service and is sending me a replacement.  I'll upgrade or downgrade my rating once I see how long the next mirror lasts.
B00FZESMKG|5|good product
B000C214CO|4|My original anger led me to file negative feedback based on automatic refund policy.  After which, I contacted seller again with a negative perception in my mind.  Only to hear back, quickly I might add, that seller would stand behind product.    MY APOLOGIES and best wishes.
B000YB1U0E|5|Love it it's perfect
B00NT626QI|5|I bought this for my kids rooms and has a nice soothing sound without the fan. Great to use in the wintertime.
B009P2C4IA|4|Good for dry and slightly damaged hair. It's one of the only shampoo products with keratin that works for my hair - makes it super soft and I have many comments about the quality of my hair. Smells good, light scent. Excellent. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Negative/Things to improve: I was very disappointed with 1) The conditioner pump is defective it does not pump so I have to unscrew the lid every time and pour out some to use in the shower.  Makes it difficult to dispense in my travel bottles.  I wish I could have returned it or exchanged it but I needed to use it/wash my hair and couldn't wait.  (It came slightly later than usual as well but that happens)<br /><br />The product itself was the same I purchased in the specialty salon I bought it in, which is reassuring.<br /><br />2) Price slightly more expensive so reducing the price slightly would be appreciated. Keep selling more to Canada please for those who work in North America and need it on travels!!
B00XTTFI6K|5|Simply put an amazing product . I work in the pizza industry and get burns from a super hot oven sliding pizzas off the paddles into the oven all the time .<br />For one super soothing when applied to my burns and the healing process from this product is remarkable compared to anything else that I've tried . For sure recommend this .
B002RXEMHU|4|Im a little disapointed with the packaging. The oils came all jumbled up in a box and smell as if something leaked. I will have to find a container that fits them nicely. The basic care kit, on the other hand, came in a flat box that holds the oils nicely. I give a four due to poor packaging.
B003JA3KDW|1|As late as a few months ago, the Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair conditioner worked beautifully.  Then I bought 2 more bottles last week and found that it left my hair caked with gunk.  What happened?  I checked to see if the ingredients had changed.  Apparently they completely changed the formula and ingredients without saying anything about it on the front of the bottle.  Only the small-print list of ingredients will clue you in about why it doesn't work anymore.
B001RVTWL4|5|She has used the same sent for years.
B003I6O5RC|3|yeah it does give me good volume, BUT it clumps like crazy!! Two coats in and my eyelashes are divided into 5 distinct clumps.. ugh. thats why i like Mega Plush better
B00DZ4GVL0|5|I loved this hair!  I got it in blue and had so many compliments.
B000MS079O|1|I had tried the lotion in a salon and loved it.  So I bought some online. I'm not sure why a lotion would have an expiration date, but this one had passed by a year. It was sent to me anyway.  Mailing it back was too much of a pain, so I didn't.  My bad, their bad review.
B000C1Z1B0|5|i bought this product for ny wife for christmas,she loves it.and she smells wonderful when she weares it.thanks alot. i will soon buy more.
B00CBI31SM|5|I have been using this product for a number of months. I read a lot about this product, read other reviews and decided to give it a try. I noticed a difference at first, shortly after using it, but it was not until a few months later when I stopped using it for about a month because of surgery I had done. During that time my hair became thinner and I started using this product again. That is when I started noticing a significant improvement in the thickness of my hair. On account of this experience, I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it myself.
B000Z5YG8M|5|I was sick of spending money trying different eyeliners that would last an hr or two max. I randomly tried this eyeliner out in black and now I'm addicted. I only have to put it on once in the morning and it stays all day long :) Def worth the money!!!
B00CNTJHQO|4|I decided to try this shampoo on the recommendation of a friend.  I really wanted a more natural and sulfate-free shampoo and am very pleased to have found this line.  After just a few days of use, my scalp has never felt so clean and itch free.  I'm not a big fan of the sage scent, but it's not unpleasant.  The only thing I would say that keeps me from giving this a five star is that it leaves my hair feeling a bit course after taking a shower (I use Moroccan Oil to make it silky).  I would definitely recommend this to my friends.  I'm looking forward to trying the different products in this brand.
B00HLQT0NY|5|Move over Urban Decay, Smashbox has arrived!!!  I LOVE these eyeliners, i was a diehard Urban Decay fan but since using the Smashbox Always Sharp not so much anymore. The selling points for me:<br /> - These liners are always sharp - twist and wala – Sharp!<br /> - These don’t run as easily as Urban Decay. See a sad movie on date night, tear up a little and BAM Urban Decay Raccoon!!<br /> - Price is comparable to Urban Decay but quality surpasses without a doubt.
B007P0MWAO|5|I have curls like crazy, this stuff defines them and holds. no frizz. love this stuff.
B00NIPQ0GC|1|I'm disappointed, it doesn't really work well. It seemed like a great idea but not enough to “Wow&#34; you or blow you away! Robbing or stroking your razor in the opposite direction as the instruction states on the rubber mat material, robs off the lubricant strip that comes with your razor. You’ll notice chucks are missing from the lubricant strip that helps the razor glide on your skin.  So when you use your razor next time, the strip is now dried and harden, it’s rough and prickly; it stabs and irritates your skin when you use it.
B00401LIF6|5|easy to replace on handle.  great for washing your back<br />wish it came in purple, my fav color over all
B0012EF9NQ|5|very good
B00CRKTQWY|5|great product it can be used for many things.
B00GA7YT4A|5|My mom used it for about 2 weeks, healed her bedsore, good product!
B00H9A40SM|4|A quick side note on the instructions: The instruction booklet is confusing with lots of small icons. Given that this razor has lots of parts/add-ons that come with it, a slightly clearer instruction booklet would be nice.<br /><br />Now on to the actual shaving:<br />Closeness of shave: I usually shave with a manual/wet razor (a Gillette ProGlide). In terms of closeness, this Old Spice razor gives a much closer shave than using the manual razor in-the-direction-of-the-grain. In fact, it gives almost as close a shave as using a manual razor against-the-grain. Since I often avoid using a manual razor against-the-grain as it tends to give me razor burns, this Old Spice lets me get that closeness without the burns. In fact, this certainly gives me a closer shave than any rotary electric razor I've tried.<br /><br />Like every other electric razor I've tried, it does however take much longer to shave with this thing than with my manual ProGlide as you often have to make multiple passes with this. Since I shave everyday and don't want to spend more than a few minutes shaving, I find my self using the ProGlide frequently, and this on the weekends when I have time.<br /><br />As for all the fancy add-ons this comes with, I've only used one (as I don't have a beard), and I've found it harder to get a consistent length than a specialized trimmer. That being said, at least it does have lots more trimming options than most devices, so if you're looking for an all in one electric device, this is probably a good bet.<br /><br />At the end of the day, for an electric razor, this scores pretty high marks - it gives close shaves and comes with a ton of trimming add-ons (though I haven't tried many since I don't keep a beard). In my opinion though, if you shave frequently (like every day or two), a manual razor with shaving cream is still better for speed and efficiency.
B0037LOOLA|5|Great product.  It's the only one my husband will use.  I've searched for it locally and was unable to find it...I should have started looking at Amazon first.  This one is for me.
B0000DK5LW|4|This product seems to really pull the hairs out but it is a little painful. I actually just bought it for facial hair and I can only do a little at a time...
B007WWQAJY|5|It worked real well but if you have shoulder length hair you need two boxes one box is goof for chin length hair.
B003M8C3QG|5|Our favorite football team is the New England Patriots and this NFL New England Patriots toothbrush holder is perfect to hold a toothbrush and keep it safe from germs in our bathroom. Suctions right onto our bathroom mirror.
B00DV3YJFK|3|Very large, bigger than i thought but my daughter loved it. It is nice for overnight trips and holds a lot of things.
B00763LZF8|1|Worst floss ever. It breaks so easily. You have to use at least four of them for each floss.
B00SUWEZCO|5|Awesome product
B002ON11RW|5|I just started using coastal scents. I'm impressed. This is a great pallet with good colors.
B00564L4P0|5|I love this body butter and I am always complimented on my scent after I use it.  I used to buy it at Target, but the store in my town stopped selling this variety so I had to resort to buying it online.  I love this body butter and would recommend it to those who like luxurious lotions.
B00669Y8PM|5|I highly reccomend that you purchase this product. It did everything that was promised!!! It is an awesome product!!!  I love it!!
B008RLX7AO|1|Of all the orders in this world it took a entire year to get to me I complained and was issued an apology
B000JL5MK8|1|I read the reviews before I purchased so I knew there was the possibility it would be different. ... And it definatly is not the same. I have another bottle that I ordered a few years ago and the scent is NOT the same. It is very unfortunate that it is not the same. So be warned if your looking for that sweet smell of realities from your memories you will be soured by the reality of this scent.
B008B9K8JA|5|This synergy oil is very unique in its ability. I like how each oil evens the others out in this blend. Thinking of getting the 30ml next time with this one. The shipping was excellent as well as the packaging. I give Edens Garden 5 stars im loving their oils!
B003OTEDE8|5|Okay, this has to be \\"THE PERFECT\\" lip gloss. I bought my first one about 3 years ago and fell in love. I was looking everywhere for this gloss and couldn't find it, until I looked on Amazon, and bought 2. I've NEVER found a lip gloss like this one. It's got just the right amount of color and shimmer and is NOT STICKY! Which is my favorite thing about it. It glides on so smooth and silky. I hate those thick lip glosses that makes your lips stick together. But the Rimmel Sweet Jelly is just that - sweet. It tastes and smells great! Best gloss ever!!
B000WU38QQ|1|The product is not working when I get it and I need to return it. I don't think they did any QC on this product.
B0009OAIAY|1|Bottle was leaking in package, not a products I would order again,  several washings before I could get odor off my hands.  Not my kind of product.
B003BQ6QXK|5|I purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  The last few mirrors he had in the shower all fell and shattered.  Even the &#34;shatter-proof&#34; one.  This is a nice sized mirror and it went up with no problem.  He likes it, so I like it.  So far, so good.
B005OZGDO8|5|Excellent quality! very well made ZERO shedding and blends eye shadow like a dream I LOVE THIS BRUSH! i am slowly building my Sigma brush collection :) also received it 3 days ahead of schedule which is always awesome! securely packaged to protect the product, all around great service :)
B00006IV30|4|This travel roller set was recommended by my sister-in-law. I travelled out of the country last month and brought it with me.  Light weight, jumbo rollers perfect for my hair. Easy to use.  Does the job.
B00LVPDBA4|4|as described and on time  thank you
B003TU4CB6|4|Nice cream but very strong, thought nice, fragrance. I first tried this in New Zealand. I would give it 5 stars except for the too intense fragrance.
B0007ZHLQY|4|I have been trying for many years to pin-point the perfect skincare product. While the process of multiple products to apply every morning & evening, I think this is a wonderful product. I didnt have this magical experience with it. There are a combination of things that cause skin issues, but this a good product to use on a regular basis.
B004E9HNWG|5|I have used this product for years.  Its handy to keep on the side of the vanity and works quickly without irritating my eyes.
B0075J3UKG|5|Nivea Men Relax is a great body wash overall, primarily because of the relaxing (hence the name) scent, but also because it does not dry out my skin. The aroma is noticeable but on the lighter side -- it is a pleasant alternative to some of the bolder fragrances from brands such as Axe, which (like their body sprays), when used in excess, can actually become repulsive. It is rather curious that stores in my area no longer appear to be stocking this product, and it may be only a matter of time before other places follow.
B002WDXGCC|4|I would have liked a little more power. Otherwise everything is as described.  I may just buy another one soon.
B004EHTYJS|1|I order it in pale purple, yet it came in white. Not to happy
B00D8XLRZS|1|It was not what I thought. The front was totally full and no matter what you did you couldn't get it to stay out of your face.  And the front had little hairs making it look fake as it was like you burnt your hair. I returned mine for a refund and had zero issues doing so.
B00QWENAQO|1|Very stringy and irritates my eyes. Took over a month to receive.
B00QJEM7ZM|1|Noticed no difference.
B00GW1HKHW|3|While I realize this .5 mm doesn't help too much with acne scarring, any positive results seems to go away after a few days. I used this coupled with a serum and the results (swelling) seem instantaneous.<br /><br />Maybe I need to keep a steady routine for permanent results?
B00KOJ8V94|4|Works great on my long frizzy, curly hair but I wish it had more tension to have a stronger hold on my hair.
B002TECJN6|1|The can would not spray.
B00G4EN6OS|5|Great product
B004V0SZNO|5|ok
B006MALMH2|1|Too watery. This was made for artists who want to rip their customers off. This stuff is useless and a waste of money.
B0062IWQVU|5|I recently received the  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler as part of a promotion from Gillette, and it has significantly improved my shaving experience. Previously I had been using a power razor, so there probably is little comparison there, but the Fusion shave is about just as fast and the results are phenomenally better. I won't be going back to the power razor.<br /><br />This razor allows you to shave with or without the power on, I prefer to keep the power off just because I think it feels smoother, although i tried it both ways and the results were comparable.<br /><br />I use the trimmer on my sideburns. I can keep the ends of the sideburns clean when i use it without any attachments, and i keep sideburn hair length good when using the #3 attachment. This lets me get an extra week or two in before i need a haircut!<br /><br />I used to exclusively use a mach 3 when i did manual shaves before, probably for the last 15 years. I prefer the Fusion as the razor itself has a better grip and I feel the blades cut better, with the mach 3 i would shave down on the face and up on the neck, with the fusion it is one stroke all the way down, and its clean all the way.<br /><br />Definitely worth trying out, especially if you want to shave and trim.
B0030ZRSHK|4|This is my favorite hard wax. It's the one I am used to using. I also just started the blue hard wax which is also great but I can't stand the smell. I easy to use and comes off easily. If you use the prewax oil.
B005Z2X5JQ|4|Great scent, great deal for Wen if you're not into reordering plan on QVC (I'm not!).  I do notice more hair loss with this scent, even though I love it - it smells like melted mint chocolate chip ice cream - maybe coincidental?  Not sure...
B00394DVIC|4|good formula, good to see no toxic additives used.Better formula and not as gritty as Dr Collins Restore. Hope that burts bees continue making this paste.
B002LMN7B4|2|Doesn't really smell like pine, it smells more like a campfire. The scent is strong and unappealing. Also the ingredients shown online aren't the same as the ingredients listed on the box. I don't like this soap, i thought it would smell more like fresh pine, but it just smells like burnt wood.
