B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is just another show of Joss Whedon's genius. Witty characters and interesting plots, it's a shame it wasn't allowed to grow.
B000LE16VW|3.0|I know it's a few months away (till this disc is released), but I have a lot of questions and skeptical thoughts surrounding this release.  Didn't they already release this DVD a few years ago?  What more could they add that the previous release didn't already have?  Do they really think people are going to repurchase this film on DVD just for a couple of featurettes?  For me, there better be a commentary by the actors (not the director & screenwriter...they already had their commentary).  I'd like to hear Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, & Whoopi Goldberg sitting down watching this film and talking about the experience.  I'd also like to see some deleted scenes and outtakes.  I can't imagine the film was made without a couple of scenes excised (for pacing or otherwise).  I'd also like to see some archival footage of awards shows (Golden Globes & Oscars...particularly Whoopi's acceptance speech and Bruce Joel Rubin's speech for Best Original Screenplay).  Last but not least I'd also like to see every bad review written (and spoken) about this film compared with every good review (written & spoken) and see who was totally right and totally wrong (Eh hem...Siskel & Ebert...well, Ebert... Siskel's dead...can't fault him much...not posthumously anyway). Those would be reason to buy this film again on DVD.  Not a couple of retrospective featurettes (most likely carried over from the previous release) and a commentary track from the director & screenwriter (also carried over from the previous release).  That is not worth anyone's money or time.  Paramount...are you listening?  If you're not doing something along the lines of what I just described then scrap this project!  It's the right thing to do!

B000002UA0|5.0|Syd Barrett was the leader for this first Pink Floyd release.  And what a release it was.  The music is dated and all over the place but it gets 5 stars for being the beginning of one of the greatest bands in history.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I've seen this movie a million times. When I saw the movie this time, what struck me was how radical the movie is. Rather than a \\"feelgood movie\\", the movie is a passionate advocate of the kind of radical communitarian populism that fueled many progressives during the Depression era. Perhaps this radicalism, which was passe by 1946, was the reason the movie was unpopular when it was released. <br /> <br />Plot elements make this abundantly clear. Mr. Potter, a figure straight from Enron or the Jack Welch \\"lean and mean\\" school of capitalism, is the embodiment of monetary values. George Bailey, on the other hand, is the embodiment of communitarian values where personal profit takes a back seat to the welfare of every member of the community. Dystopic Pottersville is presented as the inevitable result of Potter's denial of communitarian values, a place where alienation and anomie reign supreme. Bedford Falls is a communitarian utopia where all walks of life unite for the good of all and for the least among them. Capitalism is transformed from Potteresque exploitation to innovative entrepreneurialism where a good idea (the plastics factory) both enriches its owners and contributes to the good of the community. <br /> <br />I think this political message was strong and intentional and contributed to the film's unpopularity when it came out. Not until it was recast as a \\"feelgood movie\\" did it become a beloved classic, with its message buried in a ton of schmaltzy misinterpretation. Don't let the film's sentimentality (which I love) or the unfortunate racial and sexual stereotypes of its era  blind you to the import of its true message -- a message that is even more germane now than it was in 1946.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I never even knew 'On The Beach' existed until I saw the re-issued cd on the shelves about a year ago.  What a surprise.  This is Neil at his best.  He hits on some of his greatest lyrics and music over the course of this album.<br /><br />Other reviews have done a great song by song run down so there's no reason for me to take up your time covering the same ground.<br /><br />If you like Neil at all then this should be in your collection.  I'd even recommend this one to a non-Neil fan!
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Simply put, they don't make quality Heavy Metal like this anymore (harder to find these days)!  Searing hot, snarling, fist and teeth clenching, bombastic, highly structured and serious killer Metal riffing and leads with great songwriting and vocals.  Udo Dirkschneider (vocals) and Wolf Hoffman (lead guitars) may very well be one of the all-time great hard rock/metal duo's in the business.  Just a superb, genre-leading metal masterpiece!!!
B000002534|5.0|But it works again.  As has been pointed out, Carlos really plays some awesome guitar throughout.  He's also deep into the world of fusion so if you prefer the rock guitar of his first 3 releases you might not like this at all.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash's 1979 album \\"London Calling\\" is bar none one of the finest albums ever made. Filled to the brim with a heap of hard hitting classics that only they can provide, \\"London Calling\\" is one of the greatest achievements in rock and roll.<br /><br />From the insistent echoing riff of the title track that opens the album right to the last few notes of \\"Train In Vain\\", \\"London Calling\\" is The Clash at their best. Songs like the aforementioned title track, \\"Rudy Can't Fail\\", \\"Lost In The Supermarket\\", \\"Jimmy Jazz\\" and \\"Train In Vain\\" are known to both casul and hardcore Clash fans and are on pretty much every \\"greatest hits\\" compilation the band ever had, but there's a number of classics here that only the Clash Elite are familliar with, such as \\"Brand New Cadillac\\", \\"Wrong 'Em Boyo\\", \\"Death Or Glory\\" (sometimes referred to as the ultimte Clash tune) and \\"Lover's Rock\\" that are just as good.<br /><br />Overall, \\"London Calling\\" is a brilliant record that belongs in everyonbe's collection. I highly recommend it (but make sure it's the 2003 special edition which comes with bonus material).
B000002UA5|5.0|The first cd is all live and totally worth the price of admission.  The second disc is not all that bad.  Really interesting work by the band.  Think Bowie during the Berlin years and you're on the way to sort of understanding disc 2.  The Narrow Way Pt. 3 is an interesting song when you stop and look at this as a logical path to Meddle and ultimately, Dark Side of the Moon.<br /><br />But the early live versions of classic Floyd are the real treasure.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Few albums have achieved as much ecognition as The Who's 1971 masterpiece \\"Who's Next\\" has. When lists of the greatest rock albums are compiled, it's always ranked quite highly, usually in the Top 10. I myself think it's a prime contender for the top spot.<br /><br />This deluxe edition is proof of how great this album still is to this day. From the swirling synth that kicks off the timeless opener \\"Baba O'Riley\\" to the heartwrenching portrayal of reckless abandonment present in \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" to the thundering last chord of the ultimate rock anthem \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" to everything in between, \\"Who's Next\\" is a true rock epic and a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Songs like \\"My Wife\\" (John takes the lead vocals on this one and he's great), \\"The Song Is Over\\" and \\"Getting In Tune\\" may not be as recognizable asthe three classics I just mentioned, but are among the finest things The Who ever recorded. The bonsu tracks on Disc One are great bonuses, especially the alternate version of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".<br /><br />The live performance at The Young Vic onn the second disc is simply amazing. They're incredibly energetic, and the sound quality is wonderful. The liner ntoes are awesome, and this masterpiece belongs in any music fan's collection.
B000F8O35U|4.0|How can anyone not love this movie?  It always puts a smile on my face...stop laughing already, Michael!
B00002R0MC|5.0|Out of all the Christmas gifts I have received today, one stands clear as my favorite: \\"Songs Of Freedom\\", a four cd boxed set compiling 88 classic Marley tunes, a vast number of which are rarities. Alternate takes, never or rarely heard performances (starting with his first recordings with Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston dating back to 1964) and much more. The sound quality is quite good, as are the sequencing and the liner notes.<br /><br />Bob Marley was an incredibly kind, loving, talented, nurturing and intelligent individual, and \\"Songs Of Freedom\\" is a testament to just how great this man truly was and how his message still rings true today: a message of peace, unity, love, tolerance, freedom and faith. This is a must have for all music fans, as no record collection is complete without anything by Bob Marley.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|This album lacks all of the heart-wrenching emotion of the first one.  The whole thing seems forced and unnatural; I am truly disappointed; my apologies, Amy.
B00005NB0H|5.0|I was always of the opinion that The Who's 1970 live album \\"Live At The Leeds\\", often named one ofif not the bestlive albums ever made, was overrated. I felt that they weren't very energetic, didn't play their best and overall weren't really on fire. I mean, I really always liked it, but didn't feel it was worthy of a lot of its praise. I myself always preffered \\"Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970\\" (belatedly released in 1996, but worth the wait).<br /><br />However, after hearing this deluxe edition of the album, I can safely say my opinion has changed for the better. The newly improved sound quality greatly helps the album quality wise. The energy level seems much more apparent, especially on songs like \\"Substitute\\" and \\"Shakin' All Over\\". I now see why the album is so highly regarded. I'm still debating whether I still prefer \\"Live At The Isle Of Wight\\" or this.<br /><br />I hve not listned to the \\"Tommy\\" performance on the second disc, but I'm sure it's brilliant. I can say that the liner notes are excellent, and that the first disc alone makes this cd a must have.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Amy Lee and Company have proved they are not an one album wonder. I was hoping for more rocking, guitar power coupled with Amy Lee's angelic voice and I got it in ample supply. The whole album is great. Insightful lyrics and brilliant arrangements abound. Personally, I gravitated more towards the fast pace songs such as \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", \\"All That I'm Living For\\", and \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\". But the ballad \\"Like You\\" is my second favorite ballad after \\"My Immortal\\" from the first album. This was well worth the wait. Evanescence fans should be pleased. I know I am.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|One of the most important, groundbreaking amd influential albums in the history of rock and roll, The Who's 1969 magnum opus \\"Tommy\\", a rock opera about a deaf, dumb and blind kid who sure plays a mean pinball, is now better than ever thanks to the brilliance of SACD and DSD remastering techniques.<br /><br />Every song on the cd sounds like it was recorded just yesterday. It is 100 % crystal clear, perfectly remixed and remastered. It gives you a clearer view of the story as well as a more pleasurable than ever listening experience. Pete Townshend and the people involved in this truly put their hearts into making \\"Tommy\\" better than ever.<br /><br />The bonus disc is also worth it. A lot of awesome raritis. The liner notes are an interesting read, and the album itself is of course a masterpiece nobody should be without.

This disk was bought for me as a Christmas presant( I should say 'these disks' since it is a dual set)...I listened to the whole thing carefully, expecting something different. There are a few small bits which you can get if you listen REALLY carefully, but it is the same on the whole. Someone re-mixed the songs for LENGTH. This IS NOT a \\"new\\" version of the Beatles. It's mixed to fit the length and excitement of the Circe D'Soleil routines. <br /> Please don't get caught up in the hype..it is the same except for a few forgetable moments..however, it is a wonderful mix of Beatles tunes.

B000J103PC|5.0|I loved this movie. I've watched it probably three times since purchasing it and will most likely watch it after finishing this review. Even my boyfriend greatly enjoyed seeing it with me.  <br /> <br />The only thing about it that drives me crazy are Andy's friends/boyfriend. I understand the movie is trying to get a \\"lesson\\" across, but I dont think its done well. Sometimes you have to do what you have to do, and you're true friends will understand that. My boyfriend is way overworked and called in often...in fact he worked through my birthday this year. But he's doing it to establish himself and get ahead in the workplace, and I understand that. Andy's friends couldn't say the same. Everytime they are on screen I feel like throwing something.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|I liked Lester's version enough to pay more than once to see it, but I prefer this version. It's much more dramatic; somehow this one makes the supervillains malevolent and scary where they were depicted as eccentrics in the theater version. Possible spoiler For example the scene in the Oval Office where they are bored; here the additional shots/lines create an atmosphere of just how dangerous godlike criminals with nothing to do and no checks on them could be. There are small reaction shots in this film that up the ante considerably (possible spoiler);a major character drops their head in defeat after seeing superman apparently lose the fight. Not much, but it makes a heck of a difference. The best stuff is Reeve/Brando. This film explains how he got his powers back; the father/son relationship is the core of this version. Reeve has layers to his Superman here; he's almost petulant and argumentative at times. I knew he could act, this one really proves it. This is darker than the bubble-gum original.I really felt that Earth could be doomed to be under Zod's boot forever (Possible spoiler)(Supes acknowledges this in a scene); never took him that seriously in the theater version. The first Superman, as has been said, shifted in tone; this is more serious like one. I thought it was a much stronger movie dramatically and certainly something I could watch in repeat viewings (not just the battles). In fact, for me I'd put this close to the original movie in quality. If you like I over II, you'll likely enjoy this one. At any rate, film students should see this as an example of how minor changes can create a completely different film.
B0001L3LUE|1.0|Morris left out the whole part of history on Israel's deliberate bombing of the USS Liberty in 1967; McNamara was behind that cover up too. Of course, no one was supposed to survive that tragedy but they have and they live to tell you that that was no mistake. And so did one honest investigator, among many, \\"[retired Navy Captain Boston] broke decades of silence and declared that the Navy admiral who investigated the incident had been ordered by President Lyndon Johnson and Defense Secretary Robert McNamara to conclude it was a case of mistaken identity, despite evidence to the contrary\\" as was reported in the San Diego Union Tribune in 2004. But to humor those of you out there who insist on parroting the rhetoric \\"that was a mistake,\\" despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, still, why leave it out entirely? That's because Morris (as do others like him) has an agenda. If you watch his other films (in particular, Mr. Death), you will begin to connect the dots as to that agenda.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I was enthralled to find out not long ago about the \\"Classic Albums\\" series.  Each is a fascinating behind-the-scenes homage to a classic rock album.  But \\"The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon\\" is arguably the best of all.  Insightful & impeccably done.  From a discerning viewer/listener, highly recommended.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|I'm a Meatloaf fan (got the albums, read his autobiography, etc.), but this album was a disappointment to me.  I found that only tracks 4, 8, and possibly 11 really deliver.  Track 2 is supposed to be of some acclaim, but it just didnt' do it for me, and don't even get me started about track 12 which starts off magnificently and then just goes horribly wrong.  This can't be a trilogy because a Bat Out Of Hell IV is now needed for Steinman and Meat to redeem themselves.  Save your money on the album and just buy selected tracks from iTunes.
0066214122|2.0|The first chapter or two are pretty engaging, and the theme is intriguing. But by the time the book gets to it's conclusion, it's pretty easy to see threads of Aliens, The Thing, and even B-movie Screamers running through the conclusion of this book. Although it'd make for an enjoyable horror or sci-fi B-movie, the last third of the book is pretty formulaic, and doesn't measure up to the hype of the premise, or the author behind it.
B00005JOLI|1.0|I went to see this movie with my sons, ages 12 and 17.  My 12-year old and I read the book last summer.  We both liked the book and were looking forward to seeing the movie.  But the movie cut way too much out and sped events up to the point that I felt like we were watching the story with a controller in fast forward.  Jeremy Irons gave the only decent performance.  I did not like the actor they picked for Eragon at all.  He was just a pretty face with zero talent.  My 17-year old summed it up best...when we left the theater he said, \\"That was the cheesy version of Lord of the Rings\\". <br /> <br />So skip the movie and buy the book.  The book is no Lord of the Rings, either, but it is a fun read.
B0007G89G4|5.0|Well acted, well adapted from the Stephen King novella, well shot, well written, well produced, and well directed + done. A true classic hands down. Recomended.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|As Steven Spielberg states in the opening discussion, only a few things are known for sure.  The Israel Olympians in Munich were killed by terrorists.  People associated with Black September were later killed.<br /><br />How this was done, who did it, and where everything happened was something Steven Spielberg tried to establish for the viewer.  Remember JFK?<br /><br />This is another of those movies that grays the area between fact and fiction, reality and speculation.  I doubt that the team leader of the Israel assassins was so obsessed with the victims at Munich.  In reality, he would probably have been more focused on those he killed, and the families he destroyed.  This is the nature of war, and post-traumatic shock.<br /><br />This was a movie on a gruesome and troubling topic: terrorism and retaliation.  It is sad through and through.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I thought the TV show Firefly was good but not great. Serenity however rates a \\"great\\" on my personal scale. Although it builds on the same characters that were in the show, you should still be able to catch on if you've never seen it. (Although if you have, it probably makes more sense as you're able to reconnect with the characters much quicker). <br /> <br />The story is inventive, interesting, and captivating. It also answers a few unanswered mysteries from the TV show, so if you were a fan of firefly, you'll want to watch the movie for that aspect at the very least.
B000021Y7X|5.0|The first time I saw this video, I had only vaguely heard of the Talking Heads. I had heard the song Psycho Killer and I knew that David Byrne was supposed to be a weirdo. As the movie opens, David Byrne comes on to a bare stage alone with a guitar and boom-box. David starts playing Psycho Killer and you start to get into it. As the movie progresses, both the music and the stage evolve. <br /> <br />If you're a concert-goer, you know that some bands put on better shows than others. Perhaps it's their energy, good sound mixing, or just a good vibe, but certain bands know how to put on a good show. David Byrne and The Talking Heads do everything right and the result is not only an amazing concert, but also a visually appealing show. The movie is consistently entertaining with no lulls in the fun. The film grabbed me and never let go till it was over.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|(Please be advised that this Review contains spoilers)  After watching the Richard Donner cut of Superman II, I was surprised at how different the film was to the original theatrical version. Considering that both versions came from the same screen play. Before judging this movie, the reader must realise that 25% of this move was not filmed originally and there was debate during the editing of this DVD whether or not computer enhancements should be used to fill in the missing scenes. What the editors decided upon was to fill the missing scenes using footage from screen tests, I guess to try and stick as closely to the original footage as possible. However despite these efforts, I felt the end result was a little flat.  For this reason I couldn't judge the Donner cut as a completed movie, as I am sure if Donner had completed the movie and editing as originally intended, then you would end up with different film. Personally I enjoyed the movie, there seemed to be a darker tone to the Donner cut which I liked more so than the theatrical release. The theatrical version was more comical, which at times I found annoying. To understand the premise of this movie, we need to look back at Superman 1. The film was supposed to end with the three supervillans being released by a nuclear explosion, which was caused by one of the missiles that Superman redirected in space. The ending was intended as a cliff hanger. However, the producers panicked at the last minute and demanded the film be changed to ensure there was a definite ending. A precautionary measure in case the movie flopped at the box office. Therefore, the ending to Superman 1 was re-edited to show Superman flying around the world in an attempt to reverse time. Funny enough, this ending was originally intended as the final sequence in superman 2.  For those familiar with the theatrical release of superman 2, the original ending planned for superman 1 was re imagined in the opening scene. Only this time the scene was changed to show an exploding elevator in space; a result of a failed terrorist plot in Paris. Thankfully, the Donner cut was re-edited to include a lot of these sequences as they were originally intended. Is this version the better version? I will let you be the judge of that. As a MAJOR Superman fan, I thought the movie was a great addition to the Superman series. The movie gives you an opportunity to see what was originally planned. Although at times the editing was rough, overall it was fun to watch. Does the movie have repeat viewing value \\"absolutely\\"?

B00005JPDL|5.0|\\"The Holiday\\" seems to be getting average reviews (at least when I checked on the Movie Review Query Engine).  That fact tells me that sometimes critics aren't able to perceive a good movie, perhaps because they've gotten so jaded from seeing so many of them.<br /><br />I for one really enjoyed the film.  Ever since seeing Kate Winslet in \\"Enigma\\" and \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" I've pretty much adored her.  Her portrayal of lovelorn Iris in \\"the Holiday\\" was spot on.  I particularly liked the scene where she expressed such unexpected joy at discovering she was going to spend her vacation in a luxurious Los Angeles mansion.<br /><br />I also felt the other three leads, Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, and Jack Black did very well in their respective roles.  I initially thought that the romance between Diaz and Law was a bit contrived, but in the end the film sold it.  And while I could predict most of the twists and turns of the film, it managed to surprise me with a couple about that romance.<br /><br />As for Jack Black, casting him as a match for Kate Winslet worked for me because while he is a talented comic and a developing actor, he's a pretty average guy (gives hope to us guys in the real world), and I liked the idea that he wound up with someone as so appealing and enticing as Kate Winslet.<br /><br />As for Eli Wallach, while he didn't get as much screen time as the four leads, I think he pulled off playing a charming and cranky \\"father figure\\" for Winslet's Iris.  And while some might dismiss his advice to her that she needs to be a \\"leading lady in her own life\\" as trite, it's still good advice.<br /><br />My only criticism of the film was at the very beginning where Cameron Diaz punches her soon-to-be ex-boyfriend twice in the face.  The audience laughed, but I always find myself thinking that no one would be laughing if the boyfriend character slugged Diaz.  But it's a minor fault to a great movie.<br /><br />A final criticism made by some of the critics that needs to be rebutted is the one that the story in England was \\"stronger\\" than the one in Los Angeles.  My response is that the relationship dynamics were totally different, hence the plotlines were different.  Winslet and Black's characters were essentially getting over bad relationships that had left them pretty hurt.  Conversely, Diaz's character was someone who had fallen out of love with her aformentioned boyfriend and was more open to a conventional romance.<br /><br />So I'd say, ignore what any negative reviews may say, and go and see the movie.  As for myself, I know I will add it to my collection, and since I am pretty tired of \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" this will be a film I watch around Christmas again and again.me of the critics that needs to be rebutted is the one that the story in England was \\"stronger\\" than the one in Los Angeles.

B00005JPE7|4.0|This was the perfect end for the Rocky series.  Watching a somewhat depressing Rocky 5, I was always hoping that Stallone would do another film to close out the series.  This film seems to throw out the brain damaged angle of part 5.  Rocky is still a bit punchy, but loveable.  He owns a small resturaunt in Philly.  Paula is back at the meat packing place, Adrian has died of cancer and Rocky has trouble letting go.  His son has trouble living in the shadow of a legend.  When current champ Mason \\"the line\\" Dixon loses a computerized fight between former champ Rocky and himself, his handlers come up with an exhibition bout which Rocky takes to help move on in life and close a chapter.  The world and Dixon think the match is a joke, but this is Rocky we are talking about.  Very entertaining movie with more ties to the first film than any that followed.  A must for Rocky fans.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Before viewing \\"Rocky Balboa,\\" I was hearing mixed comments including \\"this is the best Rocky ever\\" to jibes about \\"how realistic could this movie be?\\"<br /><br />I must say that Stallone did a fine job of keeping it \\"fairly real\\" and perhaps, most importantly, wrapping up the \\"Rocky\\" series.<br /><br />Rocky V was slightly disappointing simply because there was no real conclusion - unless you knew for certain another Rocky installment was on its way. You found yourself asking \\"what happens next?\\"<br /><br /> \\"Rocky Balboa\\" gives us a sense of closure and perhaps that in itself makes it real. We learn that Rocky has been running his late wife's restaurant in recent years and that he is actually seeking some kind of closure (personally and professionally.) As he states to Paulie, he still has \\"some stuff in the basement.\\"<br /><br />His final boxing match leaves no false illusions - he is not a fast young man anymore. But Rocky still has heart, strength, and is still able to go the distance.<br /><br />Another interesting point: Many of the original Rocky sidekick characters are back and while that might seem contrived, Stallone actually makes it work to the story's advantage. By bringing \\"Little Marie\\" back as Stallone did, you get a sense that many of Rocky's cronies stayed in the hood and it was only a matter of time before they all reconnected again.<br /><br />I don't know if I'll say this was, by far, the best Rocky. It was, by far, the best way to complete the Rocky series.

B000G75AE8|5.0|Slayer's new CD is definitely their best since Dave Lombardo's departure. His presence is truly a welcome addition, that obviously injected the band with much needed energy and inspiration. While their previous 3 releases have been unquestionably good, they pale in comparison to \\"Christ Illusion.\\"  From the first track, the guys show they're in excellent form. The song structures keep you guessing - as soon as you get comfy with a couple of verses, they slow down the tempo a bit and inject some amazingly powerful melodic riffs that nicely break up the super fast thrashy rythms. This only adds to the powerful, calculated assault on your senses. Lyrically, they're treading familiar ground: the usual anti-religious and war-related themes prevail. But, when it comes to Slayer, what else would you rather hear screamed atop such musical fury? It makes sense, works like a charm, and Slayer are smart enough to stick to their guns here. I very much appreciate that, rather than a suspicious \\"maturity\\",  as in the case of Metallica. Slayer are by no means rehashing old material. They were the originators of a style, and they are sticking to its basic formula, while adding noticeable elements that set this release apart from all others. In this case, like I said, the incorporation of more melodic riffs and tempo changes is what makes it all the more powerful. Anyone that has been even slightly dissappointed with any of Slayer's last few releases has to give this CD a spin. I was very pleasantly surprised, and so will you.<br /><br />In short, this album is incredibly strong, and shows that Slayer still have it. They always have been, and will always be, the unholy kings of Speed Metal.
B000I5X81K|5.0|No matter what language he's singing in, Josh Groban's remarkable voice shines on this CD.  There is nothing not to like on \\"Awake.\\"  The romantic \\"So She Dances\\" is particularly lovely.  Groban really spreads his wings on the Herbie Hancock collaboration, \\"Machine.\\"  He gets funky without compromising the integrity of his voice.  \\"Machine\\" is also one of the songs Groban co-wrote on this CD. <br />If you liked \\"Josh Groban\\" and \\"Closer,\\" you'll want to have \\"Awake\\" as well.
068987474X|5.0|I first bought this book two years ago after getting out of a bad relationship I was still sad about. I was still hoping for him to call and tell me he changed his mind, but then I got \\"He's Just Not That Into You.\\" At first some of Greg's remarks were kind of harsh and I didn't even believe it all after reading the book the first time. But then I got myself into ANOTHER crappy relationship, and I read the book again. It was starting to click. These men were just NOT that into me. It was that simple. The red flags were there at the start. Otherwise they would do what Greg said they'd do...call me, date me, not make up crappy excuses. Honestly...this is the best relationship book I've ever read. All of the solutions seem easy until you try to apply it to your life and relationship. But trust me, keep reading this book over and over and it WILL begin to click in your head! I read this book everytime a man makes me think twice about where we're \\"going\\" and I get my answer. He's just not that into me! And ladies, that's okay because we are all capable of finding AND keeping a man that IS really into us.
B000J10EQU|5.0|This is a FUN movie with awesome picture and sound.  With a HDTV and surround sound, we may never go to the movies again.  It is a little graphic toward the end when Superman is getting beat up by Luther and his thugs...but I think ok for my 10 year-old...
B00005ASIL|4.0|An excellently well-considered anthology.  This listener went entirely Tull-less for a bit more than a decade, and I am only now revisiting music which once I knew very well.  In light of my own somewhat nuanced approach to Tull, I almost feel as though Ian Anderson compiled this personally for me (for the record, no, he never thought to consult me). <br /> <br />In brief, some of my favorite things about this disc: <br /> <br />1.  First, I admit that they lost me around the time of Stormwatch;  so the fact that far the greater part of this disc is from Heavy Horses and earlier, was a crucial consideration in springing for the disc.  I have my doubts about \\"Broadsword\\" and \\"Root to Branches\\" (though they are certainly, regretfully to use a lukewarm adjective, listenable);  but \\"Steel Monkey\\" was a pleasant musical surprise.  Even accounting for the for-me two dubious tracks, this is better than an hour of fine Tullery. <br /> <br />2.  I was a big fan of Living in the Past in its double-LP form;  was a little annoyed at the omission of \\"Bourée\\" from the CD reissue (notwithstanding very practical space limitations).  Anyway, overall very pleased with the five songs on this disc which represent Living in the Past - they are certainly the very best of that fine album. <br /> <br />3.  Similarly, very pleased with the `harvest' from the albums Aqualung and Songs from the Wood. <br /> <br />4.  I vaguely remember the entire Thick As a Brick album, but am probably content with the three-minute opening. <br /> <br />5.  The edited-down versions of \\"Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll:  Too Young to Die\\" and \\"Heavy Horses\\" are fine by me. <br /> <br />6.  With the edited-down version of \\"Minstrel in the Gallery,\\" I take greater exception, but since in my view, you want to supplement this Very Best Of disc with the Minstrel in the Gallery album in its entirety anyway, I blithely withdraw the objection. <br /> <br />7.  Similarly, I am pleased that there is no excerpt (or \\"edit\\") fromA Passion Play included, since this is really an album which you either want nothing to do with, or want to hear gloriously complete. <br /> <br />So, even counting \\"Broadsword,\\" \\"Root to Branches\\" and the bleeding chunk of \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" as duds (which I don't quite, really), this disc is still 64 minutes of crème-de-la-crème Tull.  Supplement this disc with the remastered CDs of A Passion Play, Minstrel in the Gallery and Benefit, and you've got practically pure value for your music dollar in my view.

0694003611|5.0|\\"Goodnight Moon\\" succeeds beyond such sobriquets as \\"classic\\" or \\"perfect,\\" for this work is that rarest achievement in art and letters: a melding of the visual with the sonic, and always presented in an atmosphere of intimacy and security. This provides a psychological construct for healthy learning that is imperative for a child's growing mind and emotional maturation. Only the Christmas Story of the Gospel of Luke, Chapter 2, is superior in Western literature in nurturing a child's introduction to mapping the world with words, built from visual clues. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is an indispensable foundational work for a child's confident construct of the spoken, written and read English language. The dimension of emotional comfort invoked with this work cannot be overstated.<br /><br />What makes this work so remarkable? In contrast to the mad world of Dr. Suess, where made-up words serve with legitimacy of ancient ones, the vocabulary of \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is normal. In addition, the rhyming scheme, the scansion, the subject, and the illustrations are all both in perfect balance and contrast that engage the child on both the whole (the sentence, or the whole illustration) and the specific (the individual word, or a visual detail in the pictures). This is a small comprehensible world, invoked with poetics and illustrated with grace.<br /><br />It is in the processes of reading aloud, pointing to pictures and words, with the repetition of familiar themes (\\"goodnight\\") and subjects (objects in a nursery) that the concept of printed words signifying objects (both illustrated ones, and real ones) and actions becomes incarnate in a child's mind. Ricoeur's \\"the symbol gives rise to the thought\\" has its birthplace here. This is the ideal vehicle to begin your child's journey of mastering comprehension and action of and in the world with symbols.<br /><br />We own the board book edition, and I highly recommend it for its sturdy use for each new member of a growing family.<br /><br />This is the first book our six year old daughter was able to read to her two year old brother, a moment all families should experience. I urge you to read \\"Goodnight Moon\\" regularly to your child as a gift for his future./> <br />This is the first book our six year old daughter was able to read to her two year old brother, a moment all families should experience.

B00005M91K|5.0|This is a true epic masterpiece, I have never seen ANYTHING like this before, the visual story and poetry are totally mesmerising, and the visualisations fill you with a multitude of emotions. There is not a single \\"dull moment\\". Just leaves you thinking.... <br /> <br />Please, if you don't \\"feel\\" it, just move on, don't write a negative review! This is the work of true genius, with heart and soul!  <br /> <br />This, to me, is the way a film camera should be used.... not all the BS \\"box office hits\\", with their routine and repetitive lame plots!
B000G759LW|4.0|I received Back to Basics for my birthday and I was more than excited. I am a HUGE Christina Aguilera fan. I definitely enjoyed the album, though it can't live up to it predecessor Stripped. Disc One is definitely the best of the two discs because it made Christina's songs sound vintage, but not outdated. All the songs are R&B and really hit the mark. The hit \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" is on there, as well as \\"Slow Down Baby\\", possibly one of the catchiest songs on the album. \\"Back in the Day\\" is also another fun number that has Christina reminiscing about music from years past.The only song on Disc One that's really out of place is the Dedication to the Fans. It's set to a good beat, but it's corny and doesn't really flow with the album. Also, Oh Mother gets tiresome because the lyrics are basically the same as \\"I'm OK\\" on her Stripped album. Disc Two is a mushpot of different styles that doesn't work as well as the Disc One. (It's definitely the shortest one, with only nine songs on it.) Candyman, Trouble, and Nasty Naughty Boy feel like old school songs while Hurt, Welcome, and Mercy on Me are songs that belong in this era. The abrupt change in styles makes Disc Two feel very disconnected. However, all of the songs except for The Right Man are great no matter what style they are. The Right Man is definitely the weakest track on the Disc Two. Overall, it's a fun album that showcases Christina's amazing vocal abilities.
B00005JPDS|5.0|As a big Will Smith fan, I was hoping for a great performance by the actor in \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\".  In \\"Men in Black\\", \\"Enemy of the State\\", and \\"I, Robot\\" Smith delivered amazing performances.  In \\"Ali\\", \\"Bad Boys II\\", and \\"Wild Wild West\\", Smith not only delivered lackluster performances, but he chose scripts that really failed to deliver anything worth the price of admission.  But this film, this absolute brilliant masterpiece of movie making creativity, deserves a whole lot of recognition!<br /><br />  \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is one of the most \\"real-to-life\\" movies to come around in a while.  The script is energetic, interesting, and smart; the acting is second to none; and the performance Will Smith turns in is without a doubt his best work to date.<br /><br />  This is the kind of movie that can inspire people to see past their struggles and look toward the light at the end of the tunnel.  People who are going through financial, spiritual, and mental struggles need a film like \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" to remind them that lots of people have struggled, are struggling, and will struggle to be the best they can be in life.<br /><br />  Will Smith (playing the role of Chris Gardner) and his on screen wife, Linda (played by Thandie Newton), are exceptionally convincing as two parents trying to make things work when everything in their lives seems to be falling apart.  Smith is stunningly realistic as a man just about to go over the deep end as life throws him as many punches as his Ali character actually took in the boxing ring.  Some of the scenes where Smith and Newton are verbally jousting looked as if a physical confrontation was about to come to fruition, but it doesn't.<br /><br />  Smith had to rely on every single emotion, physical characteristics of humans, and making another person's story appear as his own to pull this film off.  This is his crowning achievement as far as this critic is concerned.  Much like Val Kilmer could make movies from now until the day he is unable to act and never be able to top his performance as Doc Holiday in the movie \\"Tombstone\\", Will Smith may never be able to rise above his accomplishments in this performance.<br /><br />  Jaden Smith plays the part of Christopher (Chris Gardner's son) and is just as convincing as his real life father throughout the entire film.  The two work magic on the big screen.  And as much as I don't get into the whole put-a-cute-kid-in-a-movie-and-you-can't-lose philosophy, Jaden Smith is a kid you just can't help but enjoy seeing say predictable things in the movie.  The kid doesn't overact at all.  That's a big plus for a film like this, where it is based on a true story.<br /><br />  Brian Howe (playing the part of Jay Twistle) is great as the man who gives Gardner his first big shot at a more positive future.  His fascination with the Rubik's Cube while riding in a taxi, Gardner begging him for a chance at becoming a stockbroker, is a scene I won't soon forget.  Two men in a taxi, trying to solve Rubik's Cube, with one of the men trying to find a way to solve the puzzle of his own life, and one man not even realizing the desperation that was riding beside him in the taxi; now that's irony.  Isn't that exactly what causes a lot of the pain we see in the world today - the lack of one group of humans to see the needs and thoughts of another group of humans?<br /><br />  Will Smith is a great actor, and he seems like a genuinely good person with a great future.  He is not your typical Hollywood Big Head, with the all the superstar baggage we see with most of the Hollywood elite.  The main character in this movie seems like the best example of what Smith's real life integrity is like; and it's a good statement!  I wish Smith and his family all the best!  Thanks for working so hard on this film.<br /><br />  If you are reading this review and trying to decide if \\"The Pursuit of Happiness\\" is a movie worth seeing, just ask yourself if you are interested in the story of human struggle.  If the answer is yes, then I suggest you see this film.<br /><br />  See ya next review!an struggle.  If the answer is yes, then I suggest you see this film.          See ya next review!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I was in Germany when I heard the song \\"Call me when you're sober\\" I won't lie to you, it took me time to adecuate my ear, then I saw the album in late september and bought it October the 2 in frankfurt. Besides the package of it, I could not believe the depht of the songs, Amy Lee really knows how to write and sing. The best songs are: <br /> <br />Call me when you're sober - 5 stars - her sisters sing in the background! <br />Weight of the world - 5 stars - play it when angry <br />Lithium - 5 stars - it's my itunes most played song! great video also! <br />All that I'm living for - 4 stars - I like the acustic version better <br />Good enough - 5 stars - The most relaxing song ever (play it while in a slow bath) <br /> <br />The other songs are good, but you'll be captured by the ones I just mentioned. <br /> <br />Buy it! <br /> <br />Silvio Tercero
B000053VAZ|5.0|From the riveting first scenes of an energetic locomotive, this is an upbeat movie that sensitively tackles the tough subject of mental illness. The viewer roars with laughter and roots for the two main characters splendidly played by the adept Johnny Depp and his movie paramour Mary Stuart Masterson (\\"Joon\\").<br /><br />Masterson, a brilliant artist - we see her lavishly lay the paint upon the canvas - has a severe problem: she hears voices in her head. She says, with keen insight, to her loving caretaker brother (\\"Benny\\"), played by Aiden Quinn, \\"You need me to be mentally ill.\\"<br /><br />Indeed he does, using it as an excuse to put his own life on hold. In a plot twist, Johnny Depp comes to live with brother and sister. Depp is delightfully different in his own way. Although he can't write, he is a master comic, as hilarious as Chaplin or Buster Keaton. I found myself roaring at his ridiculous antics, including making grilled cheese sandwiches with a hot iron. Hmmmm, never thought of that.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Johnny Depp and Joon, each with their delicious quirksome natures, fall in love: spoken-for in Spokane.<br /><br />Just because Masterson is ill, however, doesn't mean Johnny will forsake her. Memorable scenes include Masterson and Depp taking off on a Greyhound bus to start a new life. Stress, however, causes Masterson's voices to assault her - she holds her head in her hands in terror - and ends up in a police ambulance which takes her to a stark mental hospital.<br /><br />Unthwarted, Depp figures out how to secretly visit her in one of the most hilarious moments in film history. And, yes, the caretaker brother decides that love indeed does conquer all, and has his moment of truth by a railroad train, the motif that runs throughout the film, which is also rich with great songs.<br /><br />A 98-minute must-see from 1993.

B000K7VHPU|5.0|I thought this movie was great.  I go to a movie to be entertained, to be lost in the moment, not to look for holes or be overly analytical about every single second of its running. Special effects or lack thereof aren't the only criterion that one should look at in determining a movie's value. The only question I leave the theater with is this: Did the movie entertain? Did it truly hold my interest?<br /><br />This movie did its job and I will be buying it when it comes out.
B000002NZO|5.0|This is a fantastic album from 1970 that shows Genesis moving beyond the charming pop songs of their debut and bringing a bit more of a prog feel to their pieces.  Of course, Trespass is still a far cry from sophisticated, \\"full blown\\" prog albums like Selling England by the Pound (1973) and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974), but it is still excellent nonetheless.  I guess it is worth pointing out that a folk revival was in full swing in England around this time, and the guys in Genesis were apparently not immune - as such, a \\"pastoral serenity\\" colors many of the pieces.  Come to think of it, I really appreciate the gloominess of Trespass and the rich textures generated with several acoustic 12-string guitars being played at once.<br /><br />The lineup at this early developmental stage included Peter Gabriel (lead vocals, flute, accordion, percussion); Tony Banks (Hammond organ, piano, mellotron, 12 string acoustic guitar, vocals); Mike Rutherford (bass guitar, 12 string acoustic guitar, cello, vocals); Anthony Phillips (12 string acoustic and electric guitars, dulcimer, vocals); and John Mayhew, drums, percussion, vocals).  Although not the classic lineup, the Genesis sound was definitely beginning to emerge and Anthony's delicate guitar playing is excellent throughout.  Unfortunately, Anthony was taken ill (with bronchial pneumonia I believe) and when coupled with a growing anxiety, was forced to leave the band (he was replaced by Steve Hackett in 1971).  In addition to the overall sound, rough sketches of both the story-telling and aggressive playing found on the follow-up album Nursery Cryme (1971) appear on Trespass.<br /><br />The six pieces on Trespass are fairly short by prog standards and range in length from 4'14\\" to 8'56\\".  In large part, the songs are very quiet and loaded with 12-string acoustic guitars and piano, with the single exception of the excellent (and aggressive) closing track The Knife, which features some thunderous playing on the electric guitar.  Like a lot of folks, this is my personal favorite (along with White Mountain) and certainly would not have been out of place on Nursery Cryme.  It is an extremely aggressive piece and the screams at the end are positively hair-raising - they freak me out every time I listen to the track in fact.  For those of you that liked this combination, Nursery Cryme is somewhat similar (although the bizarre nature of the lyrics was bumped up a thousand-fold on Nursery Cryme).<br /><br />I used to own this on vinyl and the CD version has not cleaned up the murkiness of the vinyl recording much at all - this really is not a big deal though, given that it only serves to enhance the generally dark mood of the album.  For those of you that are curious, my understanding is that this version by MCA sounds better than the 1994 remastered version by Phantom Sound and Vision, although the reviews are somewhat mixed.<br /><br />All in all this album is very highly recommended in whatever format you can find it in.ric guitar.

B00005RDRO|4.0|For a time during the 1970s writer Neil Simon was so hot that his name alone was enough to ensure box office success--and one of the results of that fame was MURDER BY DEATH, a parody of murder mysteries of earlier decades.<br /><br />The concept is quite clever, bringing together celebrated detectives of fiction and film: Dick and Dora Charleston (based on Nick and Nora Charles of the celebrated THIN MAN films); Milo Perrier and Jessica Marbles (Hercules Poriot and Jane Marple of Agatha Christie's celebrated novels); Sidney Wang and son Willie (Charlie Chan and son of the fondly remembered film series); and Sam Diamond (Sam Spade of THE MALTESE FALCON.)  Each has been invited for an overnight party at the home of the eccentric Lionel Twain--but upon arrival their hosts seals the mansion and informs them that a vicious murder will occur at midnight.  Can the world's greatest detectives solve their way out of this one?<br /><br />The casting is inspired, particularly so re Lionel Twain, who is played by Truman Capote, an individual every bit as eccentric as the character he plays.  David Niven and Maggie Smith do the honors as Dick and Dora; James Coco and the ever-memorable Elsa Lanchester appear as Perrier and Miss Marbles; Peter Sellers dons Asian attire for Inspector Wang; and Peter Faulk runs wild as tough-talking Sam Diamond.  Alec Guiness, Nancy Walker, Eileen Brennar, and Estelle Winwood also offer memorable support.  The dialogue is quite clever, referencing the various source material of the characters, and is quite often laugh-out-loud funny in its absurdity.<br /><br />What is not particularly interesting is the plot.  After a certain point the film becomes distinctly one-note, and to describe the conclusion as unfortunate would be an understatement; indeed, it would be difficult to say that the film has any conclusion at all.  Even so, the performers make it a fun affair, and it will particularly appeal to murder mystery fans who recall the original characters fondly.  The DVD offers a choice of pan-and-scan or widescreen, trivial notes, and more interestingly a brief interview with Simon himself.

1582701709|4.0|I didn't get the dvd, preferring books, so unlike the other reviewers I am only commenting on the book. It was positive and uplifting. The first half of the book is powerful and energetic but I thought the second half faultered a little. It was somewhat repetitous and overdone after a while, I thought. Maybe the dvd was different and thats why these reviewers like it more than the book. However, I didn't think it merited buying both. The ideas here are not new, but they are presented well and it is definitely worth buying and reading.
0543897605|4.0|Amazing Competence of the Monster: Liberals Encounter Revolutionaries (or Liberals and Counter-Revolutionaries).<br /><br />Friedrich Nietzsche recalls Napoleon Bonaparte's exclamation, \\"Voila un home!\\" after the Emperor's first meeting with Johan Wolfgang von Goethe (in Beyond Good and Evil).  In his early forties during the French Revolution, Goethe had been groomed to the literary fashion of the rational, repressed, and scientific Enlightenment. Yet it may be easier to classify Goethe with a later generation, the sensitive, dark, and emotional Romantic Movement. Writing in the 1880's, Nietzsche situated Goethe as a proxy for a rising \\"spirit of Germany.\\" The ultimate imperialist, Napoleon, had come face to face with this spirit and was impressed to find a man where he \\"expected only a German.\\"<br /><br />But during the earliest decades of the century, the romantics still considered Bonaparte to be a defender of the revolution. A corollary moment was frozen in time by Mary Shelley. When the liberals of the enlightenment looked into the face of the radical revolutionary, presumably a monster of their own creation, their response was horror. More important to the point, when a romantic novelist observed this interaction between liberal and radical, what did she perceive? Mary Shelley watched this encounter seeing a frightened and untrustworthy element, the enlightened liberal, who underestimated the value and humanity of his own creation. Shelley accuses these liberals of abandoning the revolution at its most vulnerable stage. If the enlightened liberals did not deserve retribution, they would receive it nonetheless.<br /><br />Social revolution, one foreseeable outcome of Enlightenment ideas projected onto the surface of aristocratic hegemony, might be blamed by the threatened for chaos, suffering, and mob rule. Yet there is much evidence suggesting Mary Shelley romanticized the revolutionary hero, and damned the enlightened liberals as a class of timid and wavering reactionaries.  First, there are contextual clues. Mary Goodwin Shelley, the daughter of the radical anarchist writer William Goodwin, was herself no moderate. Biographical details of her travels, associations and the causes to which she clung indicate very radical leanings. Perhaps more compelling than this kind of external evidence, the narrative structure of Frankenstein suggests that Shelley offers Victor Frankenstein as an unreliable eye witness, himself implicated in the tragic consequences he attributes to the monster.<br /><br />Initially, the story of the \\"monster\\" is told by Dr. Victor Frankenstein. And Victor's narrative is, in turn, relayed by an Englishman, Robert Walton. During the enlightenment, an eyewitness account by a Doctor of Natural Philosophy endorsed by an educated Englishman was formidable surety. Yet, a comparison of Victor's description of the unnamed \\"monster\\" with the creature's own account provides more textual clues to Shelley's attack on European liberalism. Readers could rightly expect to encounter an awkward, dull-witted, and withdrawn monster. We are, after all, tricked into this expectation. Shelley provides the first view of the living creature as it was seen through its creator's eyes. Frankenstein recalls that as he awoke from a nightmare:<br /><br />  \\"I beheld the wretch--the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did nothear; one hand was stretched out seemingly to detain me, but I escaped, and rushed down the stairs\\" (58)<br /><br />A reader might reasonably expect to encounter a character from the early films which were influenced by the book, a monster of the \\"OH GOD IT LIVES\\" variety. Yet in Frankenstein, when the unnamed \\"monster\\" finally steps up to the podium of first person narration in chapter XI, an abrupt reconsideration is demanded.<br /><br />  \\"It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operation of my various senses.\\"<br /><br />Within two sentences, the \\"Monster\\" has become a someone; \\"Voila un home!\\" This sentient being expresses his individual and singular experience, the agony and confusion of achieving consciousness in a world of heat, cold, hunger, thirst, and loneliness. Missing only the sense of taste (a possible pun on the tasteful attitudes of the liberal classes toward the revolting workers) the \\"creature\\" emerges into the world already fully grown and alone. The monster's account provides ample evidence of an eloquent and sensitive human being. And Frankenstein's broken promise to provide the \\"creature\\" with companionship incited the murderous rampages. Dare we use the descriptors \\"Heroic\\" and \\"Romantic?\\"<br /><br />  Despite what a reader may learn from Victor Frankenstein's narrative, the \\"monster\\" has become competent, articulate, and sensitive.  And by comparing this superhuman competence to the timid and unreliable Victor Frankenstein, we can gain an important insight into the attitudes Mary Shelley may have held toward both the reactionary liberal and the emerging revolutionary.ed.           \\"It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.

B000I0QK74|4.0|I like this CD but I would like it better if James would have included more of the less popular songs such as \\"River\\" and \\"Some Children See Him\\".  There's enough versions of \\"Jingle Bells\\" and \\"Baby it's Cold Outside\\" already!  I love James' voice and I think the combination of his voice and gentle, reflective holiday songs is perfect for the holidays.
B000L9IUPM|5.0|This collection is a must have for any Eagles fan. The music is just as timeless today as it was back in the seventies. When you look in the audience and see three generations of fans all enjoying this music, you know you're onto something good. Will today's crop of \\"cool\\" performers, the rappers, the hip hoppers, the industrial rockers, still be filling stadiums with fans 30 years from now? A resounding NO! Will anyone even remember them? Probably not. But the Eagles still got it, and are limited only by their age, what with all them approaching the big 6-0. You won't be disappointed with this DVD.
B000JJS8TM|2.0|Okay- The scene(albeit fictitous)is a graveyard. Dr. Martinstein and son Giles dig up the graves of John and George, open their caskets, and ask permission to completely  'mess' with their completed works. 'They didnt say 'no'!' is Martin's decision, closing the  lids! Thus this product. Okay, clever, well done, great sound (yawn), but WHY?????????????? <br />This is akin to cutting up family photographs just to insert one's own face. I think it's abysmal, if only for intent. Why Ringo and Paul would ever sanction this is a mystery to me. I got it for Christmas, but it'll most likely end up on ebay, as i aint gonna open it!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Remember, the beatles hardly performed as a band.  Their music is mostly a bunch of edited tracks.  A good way to see this is as a different edit.  All of the beatles best songs appear on this.  It's a greatest hits done right.
B000H2NA30|4.0|Edith Hahn Beer was a law student in Austria when the Nazis moved in.  In this books she relates the abuses she endured in a work camp.  This novel focuses on how she spent the whole time in sort of a denial.  While her family spent money to help her sisters and family leave Edith and her mother stayed, due to lack of money and the fact that edith didn't want to leave her boyfriend Pepi.<br /><br />When Edith realized that Pepi wasn't going to marry her or help her and her mother was missing, Edith decides to go underground.  She gets a set of papers from a friend and flees to Munich.  There she meets a man named Werner who is a nazi party member.  He is very insistent that Edith marry him, even after Edith confesses she is jewish.<br /><br />Edith spends the rest of the war as a robotic nazi wife.  You feel sorry for her and wonder how she could have survived the daily fear and anxiety she faced at being found out.  She doesn't really talk much about Werner.  She mentions his crazy outburst and supposes that his twistedness is what made him marry her.  Edith managed to survive the war and got back her identity when the war ended although it lost her her husband Werner.<br /><br />I applaud Edith's courage and resourcefulness.  It is interesting to read about a jewish person who not only lived among the nazi's during the war but actually married one!  However the majority of the book does focus on her life before she married Werner.  It more of how one Jewish woman survived the war and had married a nazi to do it.
B00006LLLN|5.0|If you've never had the pleasure to hear Alison Krauss sing, this is the cd set to buy. There is a reason so many other artists from all branches of music want to sing a duet with her. She has a beautiful flawless voice. And if your already an AKUS fan this is a must have for your collection.     AKUS is just as good live if not better than studio. I love bluegrass and you can't get better musicians combined as a group. Jerry Douglass is amazing on the dobro, Ron Block plays awesome guitar and banjo, Dan Tyminski does a lot of vocals, guitar and mandolin. Barry Bales is always steady on the bass.     Favorite songs include: Oh Atlanta!, Broadway, Ghost in This House and Take Me for Longing.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|Reading the hyped descriptive language about the film, I thought that this would be yet another one of those highly predictable scripts that would have me mouthing the lines in advance of their delivery.  I was wrong.  While I cannot profess to be a fan of either Pitt or Jolie, I truly enjoyed this film.  Yes, you have to turn off your brain a bit and ignore reality just a tad, but this flick is entertaining.  The back and forth dialogue between the two principals keeps one interested, and the zeal with which the two pursued their vocational duties adds to the balance.  Not for everyone due to the \\"shoot 'em up\\" scenes and romantic petting in one particular spot, but enjoyable for the rest of the family.
B000002Q88|3.0|The five star rating system used on Amazon is not adequate sometimes to express the value and quality of a given album and this is definitely one of those recordings.\\"In the Spirit of Things\\" is more than just ok it is actually pretty good. It is somewhat underrated in that it is not your typical \\"bargain bin\\" item although it seems to be treated as such. I prefer a 1 to 10 rating system with decimal points which gives a person more subtlety and flexibility. I would give this cd a 6.8  based on the following loose criteria:   <br />                                                                                        production 5 out of 10, Song Writing overall 6.5, overall performance 9.         <br /> <br />The production is no better than average due largely to an excessive amount of reverb which tends to blurr the sound of especially the lead guitar. The quality of the songs varies. On the low end I rate \\"I Counted on Love\\"(track no.8) a 5.5 due to a chorus that is mildly monotonous in melody and a little grating due to that and somewhat harsh sounding vocals <br />(probably due in part to the relatively bad production.] <br /> <br />On the high end is the opening track \\"Ghosts.\\" With its mellow and thoughtful opening it becomes more powerful about a third of the way through with the entry of drums and guitars including an almost blistering <br />lead run by Steve Morse. I rate this track an 8.5. It is a sort of sophistcated power ballad. <br /> <br />There are two other songs of pretty high quality. \\"Rain maker\\" (track 10) <br />which I rate an 8 may be the most \\"KANSAS\\" in spirit, although it sounds quite different from classic 70's Kansas. It begins with Steve Walsh speaking dramatically telling the story behind the song continuing with a section which is truly unique in Kansas output in that it includes a gospel choir that also returns with each chorus. In the middle there is a musical depiction of a rain storm and flash flood including powerful arpeggiatedkeyboards and some truly blistering guitar work by Steve Morse.  \\"Bells of Saint James\\" which I also rate an 8 is apparently about a soldier in Vietnam who receives a \\"dear John letter\\" from his wife and wondering why he asks \\"Are the bells Saint James still ringing\\" apparently the church at which they were married. It features cool sound effects and pleading, passionate, and powerful vocals by Steve Walsh in a powerful arrangement. <br /> <br />\\"House on Fire\\"(track 5) is a fun rocking number featuring some fun screamy vocal efects by Walsh.\\"The Preacher\\" (track 9) also rocks and features some really classic rock organ from Walsh. <br /> <br />\\"One Big Sky\\"(track 2) is rythmically driving and puts Walsh's unique vocal qualities to good use in an interesting arrangement. It speaks of the seeming absurdity of trying to find peace and love in a hateful world. <br /> <br />The rest of the tracks are semi-forgetable Survivor/Journey like power ballads. <br /> <br />This album was not only the victim of less than great production but of interference of record company execs who brought in outsiders to write \\"hits\\" for the group amongst other things. This interference was the beginning of what eventually lead to Steve Morse's departure from Kansas and almost from music altogether. If the group had been left more to their own devices it may have become the treasure that some think it is forgotten or not. As it is \\"In the Spirit of Things\\" is an enjoyable product that Kansas should not be ashamed of, it is not a black mark on their output. It takes a mixture of Survivor, Journey, and traditional Kansas-like elements along with newer unique ones to create a better than average album. If it were a little better I would round it up to 4 stars.   <br /> <br />-Steven O. Hemenway
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Well I'm 24 now and I've watched this every single Christmas since I was about 5 years old. <br />I've read all the reviews (all 109 so far) and am really encouraged and pleased that they accurately capture this magical film. <br />This is really good if you have kids and still good if you dont. I can't think of a single person who has seen this film and not liked it. <br />The absence of dialgoue and todays modern world does not detract from this masterpiece at all, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
0743455967|5.0|Two parts memoir, one part writing lesson.  That is what Stephen King gives us here.  The first part of the book is King giving us episodes from his life as a boy and a young man and then as a young writer to illustrate how he became the writer he did.  There is also a bit of a lesson about who King was before he sold Carrie and before the paperback rights to Carrie were sold.  I found it very interesting.  The second section is King actually talking about writing.  There is some very good information here, in particular King has a thing about action verbs and advises against passive voice.  That makes sense because every English teacher/professor I have met had a thing about passive voice, though they never explained it as well as King does here.  King also has a problem with adverbs.  This second section is worth reading.  The final section may be of most interest to long time fans of King because he covers the period after he was struck by a truck and nearly killed.  Overall: Excellent book for fans of Stephen King and for folks who want to read the thoughts of a best selling author on writing.<br /><br />I have not read much King - just the four stories in Different Seasons (the stories that became Shawshank, Stand By Me, and Apt Pupil, plus one other which was probably creepier than the first three) and the first three Dark Tower novels.  I view King the same way as Charles Dickens.  I'm sure there are entire English Departments suddenly rising up in protest, but Dickens and King were both incredibly popular writers of the time.  I do not know if Dickens was viewed as \\"Literary\\" at the time or if that distinction was even made, but he was a writer for the masses.  One college professor loved to recount the story of people waiting at the docks for the next edition of the newspaper to come out so they could get the next installment on a serialized Dickens novel.  Tell me that's not the Stephen King of 200 years ago.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry
0307237699|5.0|After 6 years of cringing every time Bush attempts to complete an entire sentence, it gives me goose bumps to read someone as eloquent and as articulate as Barack Obama.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Whilst not the most entertaining movie I've seen on DVD this year, I do believe this could be the most important. At first glance, the prospect of listening to the former Vice President wax lyrical about climate change while watching him show an array of PowerPoint slides, video clips and photographs didn't have much appeal but a few minutes in and I was rooted to my seat. (And I haven't got a scientific bone in my body). Director David Guggenheim captures Mr Gore's presentation style very effectively and in my view, no one but the most hardcore of denialists could fail to be persuaded by his arguments.<br /><br />But it's not just about Gore's arguments. Sure, his profile makes it more likely that we might listen to what he has to say than we might, say esteemed but unknown Mr Scientist A or esteemed or unknown Ms Scientist B but the facts as he presents them are incontrovertible. They are everywhere around us if we only care to look and in terms of what I hadn't seen or heard about, the movie was an eye-opener. I'd heard things were getting pretty bad but was genuinely shocked to sheep grazing on ski slopes that should be covered with snow, images of boats moored on riverbeds and lakebeds, and one particular image of a horse walking across the bed of the Amazon River. The Amazon River? In the middle of the Amazon rainforest?!<br /><br />The fact is that there's a whole lot more CO2 in the atmosphere than there ever was (at one point, Gore has to get on a hydraulic forklift truck to show us the peak of a CO2 emissions prediction) and this is undeniably having an effect on the world's climate. Some of the denouncements in some of the reviews I've read have been pretty vehement but none are surprising. Leaving aside the politics of the issue, even on a personal level, if the activities that make our cosy lives even more comfortable (and/or pay our hefty salaries) are the very ones that are pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, it's much, much easier to dismiss the evidence than it is to contemplate changing our behaviour. Hence the title of the movie. Behaviour change IS ALWAYS inconvenient. But we turn our heads away or stick them in the sand at huge risk. There could well be dire consequences. If not for us then for the generations coming up behind us. I don't have children and will probably be long gone before things get completely out of hand but I've got nephews and nieces and I care about them and their futures.<br /><br />But that's just me and I'm not trying to preach. That said, I do believe that even the smallest of changes can make a difference if enough of us choose to make them. I urge people to see this movie, to invite friends and family round to see it - and then tell all their other friends and family about it.<br /><br />DVD extras include: Commentary with the Director, Commentary with the Producers, a 30-minute update documentary with Al Gore, made after the theatrical release of the movie with even more worrying data, a documentary on the making of \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" and the music video to the song with which the movie ends, \\"I Need To Wake Up\\" by Melissa Etheridge.idence than it is to contemplate changing our behaviour.

B000G75AE8|2.0|As a long time Slayer fan from the 80's, I will agree that this album is their best since \\"Seasons..\\".  But it does not compare to Seasons, it's just merely \\"the best since\\".  Musically it's decent.  There are thrash songs on it however this is not a \\"thrash album\\". <br />  The lyrics on these songs are just downright awful.  There was obviosuly no time taken or thinking through with the creative process of these lyrics AND the way they are delivered.  Tom is just yelling words bluntly!! You mean to tell me this is all they came up with in 5 years? IN 5 YEARS since their last release?  If anything the lyrics on this album sound like they were just trying to make studio deadlines...  <br />   The only reason I'm giving this album 2 stars is to show that it is set apart from God Hates Us All and Diabolous.
B00006G8G1|3.0|I really enjoyed the set list on this DVD concert.  I had no problem with some of concert being devoted to 'Brave New World' as it is one of my favorite Maiden albums.  But, along with everyone else, it would have been nice if the cameras could have lingered for longer than 3 seconds at a time on one musician or vocalist, as the case may be.  The camera work gave me a headache!!!  Also, Janick Gers is such a tiresome twit!!!  I was happy with the lack of audience members mugging for the camera, however. (Thank you, IM!!)  The Day in the Life of the band on the second disc wasn't anything to write home about, I could have skipped it entirely. (I had to wonder why they even bothered with the Easter Egg portions.)<br /><br />I would rent this again, but I wouldn't buy it.  I will buy the CD or download the album instead.
B000BTGY1O|4.0|This movie would have been fantastic if not for Peppard's boring or Rooney's racist acting.  Peppard was really miscast. It's like watching paint dry. He's so boring as much as Hepburn is charming.  I don't see how anyone would not agree that Rooney's portrayal is anything but racist.
B000002J6F|5.0|This may be one of the top five greatest albums of all time.  Granted, it did take me about 3 listens to arrive at this decision, just because I was used to the CSN(Y)sound. Great country flare with all the staple elements of legit rock. This album saw Stills at the peak of his voice, songwriting, and musical chops all at the same time.  I will say this is more of a masculine album,though, so you may not find many female CSN fans liking it so much. Stills wah pedal solo in \\"The Treasure\\" was alone worth the price of admission.
0446528056|5.0|It just broke my heart the way fate had it's hand in this one. How can 2 people totally fall in love like that and NOT be together??? It is just SO wrong! I think i felt said for John and Savannah, for Tim and his autistic brother, Alan, and for John's father for his world that he was trapped in. I was brought to tears more than a couple of times at how heartfelt the story was. Another great one for Mr.  Sparks!
B000654YRY|5.0|Easily one of the greatest Dire Straits concerts ever. A very young Mark Knopfler, and the rest of the band. One very endearing aspect of this band is the innate chemistry between the different members - they smile at each other, and the overall environment on stage seems very relaxed, pleasant and enjoyable. They really enjoy playing together. The energy of the band is evident, but most important of all - the music! You could listen to this concert with your eyes closed, and enjoy every moment of it - probably more. These guys can play. Knopfler's Sprechgesang - not quite singing, not quite speaking, is a unique way of imbibing emotion into the most ordinary of words. His guitar of course is really adding another 'voice' to his music. These guitars are all abut \\"tone\\". This concert is no different in that regard. One of the best renditions of 'Solid Rock\\", and \\"Local Hero\\". That last one will have you with either a very sad, and heavy heart, and/or tears welling up in your eyes - so moving is the rendition! <br /> <br />One of the drawbacks of the production, is that it is very simple: you get to either play a specific song, or the entire concert. We have been spoiled by other productions, which have background material, featurettes, and so on. None of that here. I also wish the concert was available in a Stereo rendition. You get a Dolby Digital version of the concert. Concerts are seen with the band performing in front of you, not all around you. The producers screwed up in that regard. Exceptional sound quality, though, and you can really hear the guitars wail. If you enjoy Knopfler, you'll love this concert.
0446691437|5.0|Every now and then you read a book that has enormous value by way of it's analogies and abstractions.  This book's analogies give you a tool to measure your commitment to a vision/project/task.  The overview on the contrast between a fundamentalist versus a true artist is extremely enlightening.  Well worth the read.   <br /> <br />As a side note, this work is not really on the level of Sun Tzu's Art of War, but just being compared to that work is honorable enough.
B00068ULLY|2.0|When I saw the first \\"volume\\" of \\"Kill Bill\\", I asked myself: \\"Self, why do they keep bleeping out this chick's name?  Is surprise important, here?  Does it turn out that she's really Eleanor Roosevelt, or Pam Grier, or something?\\"  Now, after seeing the second part, I have my answer; it was strategically vital for Tarantino to conceal the fact that his heroine is, in reality, the famous Beatrix Kiddo!  Whew.  Glad I wasn't spoiled on that one. <br /> <br />But now I have another question:  how is it possible for a man with this much talent to make such an agonizingly stupid movie?
B00005JPDS|4.0|Father and Son performances that will take your breath away. Not the greatest movie, a little slow at times, but Will and young Jaden Smith make for one of the best duels of the year. Thandie Newton very believably plays the haggard and stressed wife and mother. Great acting ensemble all around.    The kid definitely has a future ahead of him should he pursue it. Will Smith is very convincing in his characterized climb from the bottom to the top. Probably his best work to date.     It's never too late to achieve our dreams!
B000J10EQU|2.0|The plot was thin... The acting was so-so (though Kevin Spacey did the best he could with a weak script)... Special effects did not add much to the story. All in all, this movie was not so super, after all.<br /><br />Why can't Hollywood get really good script writers? They should learn a thing or two from the animated \\"Batman: The Animated Series,\\" \\"Superman,\\" \\"Justice League\\" and even \\"Teen Titans\\" writers, who have done superb jobs breathing new life into these ageless heroes.
B000089RVX|5.0|I am not a fan of evanescense. I never knew who they were until I saw a video. This is the only song that I have heard from them \\" My Immortal\\". This song is great. My friends were looking at me asking me what the heck I was listening to. I rate her (them) a 5 because of that great song. I would not buy the CD because she (they) look demonic(evil).
0517543052|5.0|This book has indeed stood the test of time. Das' \\"Be Here Now\\" philosophy was a spiritual gem which was planted for me in the 70's and is still growing today. The modern spritualist / philosopher Eckhart Tolle is a re-write of this timeless masterpiece of spiritual guidance - though Tolle is also an important must-read in itself. If you are interested in spritual enlightenment and you crave sanity in this insane world, then you curtainly need to BE HERE NOW.
B00079018K|2.0|Kasabian had a big hit with \\"Club Foot\\", a bass-driven single that was good. Their second single, \\"L.S.F.\\" was also very good. Three other songs on the album are worth anything. \\"Processed Beats\\", \\"Test Transmission\\", and \\"Reason is Treason\\" are the other good songs. The rest of the songs are interludes (\\"Orange\\" and \\"Pinch Roller\\"), or drag along slowly. \\"I.D.\\" just has a drum machine, strings, and a synthesiser doing two things. Most of the other songs are acoustic, slow jams. When I say \\"slow jams\\", I mean the band just kinda following each other with no direction. <br /> <br />If the CD was released as an EP, I'd love it. That's also assuming it wasn't copy-protected. I feel that I should like Kasabian, because their good songs are good. I guess that when they realized that they had a good song, their egos would inflate, and they'd have a song with singer Tom Meighan rapping (\\"Cutt Off\\"). <br /> <br />I'd give the CD three stars if it wasn't copy-protected, so that's what's bringing the rating down. <br />1. Club Foot: 8.5/10 The song starts with ambient noise, then the bass kicks in, and kicks hard. <br />2. Processed Beats: 8.5/10 An acoustic/synth-pop song that doesn't suck. <br />3. Reason is Treason: 9/10 Simple but fun. <br />4. I.D.: 3.5/10 A long filler track. It would've been fine had it been just under two minutes. <br />5. Orange: 2/10 Not even a good interlude. <br />6. L.S.F.(Lost Souls Forever): 9/10 Very good bass and guitar work here. <br />7. Running Battle: 4.5/10 Doesn't work up to anything, not that it could've been good. <br />8. Test Transmission: 9/10 A fun song like Reason is Treason. <br />9. Pinch Roller: 2/10 Really. What's the point of these crappy interludes? <br />10. Cutt Off 6/10 Would be good, but Tom rapping bugs the hell out of me. <br />11. Butcher Blues: 7/10 Not that bad. Not great, but not bad. <br />12. Ovary Stripe: 5/10 Another (bad)filler song. <br />13. U Boat: 1/10 The worst song on the album. Good thing it's last, because you can just stop the CD. <br /> <br />75/130=50% <br />
B000J3FC0Q|5.0|I got this album for Christmas. One of the BEST albums, regardless of genre, hands down, ever. Better than Frank (and Frank was a hell of an album to begin with anyway).
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The entire production of this concert and the elegant DVD glows with love. This is the warmest, most heartfelt tribute to a great musician and humanitarian that one could wish. The discs are presented in the absolutely correct order. I played through Disc 1 the first night-- the concert as the audience saw it. I laughed and cried (and rocked) as George's friends, led by the absolutely sincere Eric Clapton, paid him tribute in their unique way. The second night I savored the behind-the-scenes interviews, and finally played the theatrical version of the concert on the second disc, which presents the songs in a different order interspersed with commentary. A wonderful supplement to the emotional concert, with some delightful anecdotes.<br /><br />Apart from the movingness of the tribute, the music is fantastic. Watching the disc 1 concert as it was performed, I clapped with joy as more and more people--artists, friends, musicians--kept crowding onto the stage. At one point there were guitars lined up three rows deep--a truly awesome sight. All these wonderful players, grooving on George's music. The only thing that could overshadow it was the sight of _four_ drummers, all pounding away in complimentary unison--and this rhythmic horsepower doesn't even include the percussionists and keyboardists! (Or the classical section chiming in occasionally from the rear.) It was magnificent and slightly overpowering to see and hear, and truly uplifting.<br /><br />Clearly the band was well rehearsed. Everyone was in sync; their absolute focus, heart, and intent was to present this music in the most polished, beautiful way they could. In this they succeeded, brilliantly. If you didn't love George before, you will by the end of this concert. The love his friends have for him is positively contagious. If you did love George, you will treasure this tribute to him for the rest of your life. It is a masterful celebration of a gifted man's life work. We should all have the fruit of such good friendships to show as the sum of our own lives. Well done, George's family and friends. Your love honors him, and you... and us. Thank you.such good friendships to show as the sum of our own lives. Well done, George's family and friends. Your love honors him, and you... and us. Thank you.  <br />
B000J6I0PM|3.0|The Foo Fighters acoustic tour was one of the best concerts I had the pleasure of attending in the past several years. Hearing old favorites as well as the new acoustic material presented with an extended band, in a venue far more intimate than the large arenas the Foos typically play at, was certainly a treat for this fan. I was thrilled to hear the tour would be captured on DVD and CD. <br /> <br />However, I wondered if they would be able to capture the unique energy and atmosphere of the concert on DVD, and I have to say that in my opinion this film is only partially successful at that. There are too many quick cuts and \\"arty\\" shots to try to put visual excitement into what is a fairly static stage set-up (with virtually everyone sitting the entire time, save the keyboardist and percussionist). Instead of adding energy, this only makes viewing the film somewhat dizzying and in the end, even more static, creating distance between the viewer and the band that definitely wasn't there when seeing the show in person. There are too many ultra close-ups of hands on guitar necks and fingers on keyboards, when quite honestly a solid, single shot of Dave sitting and singing on some tracks would have been far more interesting and exciting to watch. <br /> <br />The sound is clear and the color great. I just feel this will probably be a DVD I put on to listen to the music and occasionally glance up to watch, instead of one where I will be riveted to the screen throughout. It is also a shame that the U.S. release does not contain the additional Hyde Park concert that the U.K. edition does.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|i have read all the reviews and i agree and disagree and it will go on and on.i loved superman 2 the lester version when it came out in theaters.recently i bought the superman 2 donner version not even knowing what to expect.since i have a passion love for the superman 2 lester film i welcomed any other versions as well.keeping in mind both lester and donner were at the heart of the film and even though both directors saw different directions it was an added bonus to see  a movie i love move in a different direction than the original one.of course all are correct in saying repeated time travel and superman asking his mom  then in another film ask his dad,all in all we all have a gripe about the misfires or the should have made a right instead of a left scene,but if another director from out of the blue redid this movie i would have tossed this in the garbage so with this in mind what i feel is great about all this is you can make a choice of which version you want and lester's or donner's because truly at the end i can add another film of christopher reeves to my collection to me that makes it worth while to own........
B000G759LW|5.0|I recently bought this item and I must say this is by far one of the best albums Xtina has ever made. My favorite songs are Ain't No Other Man, Hurt, Candyman, Nasty Naughty Boy, and a couple others. If your a new fan, or a long time hard core Xtina fan then this is the album for you. Both discs are completly different from each other and thats what makes this album unique and in so many ways different from her other albums. One word..BUY IT! You will NOT regret it!
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie made me feel, even though it is rated R for violence (but the movie is not gory, otherwise I wouldn't watch it). This movie follows William Wallace, a warrior who fought for the freedom of Scotland from the rule of king &#34;Edward the Longshanks&#34; who was the king of England, at the time.<br /><br />The character of William Wallace is fascinating. At first he didn't want any trouble, he just wanted to live in peace with the woman he loves and have a family. I loved how everything he does, is fueled first and foremost by his passion for his lost and one true love, Murren.<br /><br />This story has everything from love, to loss, to hurt, betrayal, war, and triumph, all the way up to the death of William Wallace - that scene always moves me to tears... and how he sees his late wife among the crowd, as if waiting for him to join her. The love between them is so beautiful.<br /><br />The character of Robert the Bruce is very interesting as well. From his betrayal of William Wallace, and how that act tore him apart, to how he became the one who took up the fight for freedom after William's death at the end.<br /><br />The character of the princess is very interesting too. She shared a common bond with William, they were both hurting and lonely. However, I think it would have been better if the relationship between them had stayed platonic.<br /><br />This also has good supporting characters, and a beautiful soundtrack... in conclusion, this movie is moving, intense and passionate.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I like this movie. What I absolutely hated was the fact that I had to sit<br /><br />through endless (okay, more like 5) minutes of advertisements THAT YOU<br /><br />CANNOT SKIP. It is ridiculous that I have to pay for ads now.
B000JU7NCE|5.0|The Cure have always been a schizophrenic band(as evidenced in the title of their release of the \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" album). They can turn out lovely, touching pop melodies, and then turn around and write something about death and disease. This collection features the latter. I've been to Cure shows on a fairly regular basis since about the release of \\"Faith\\", and occasionaly they would do a show guaranteed to drive the audience out before the end(evidence of these performances can be found on the flip side of the \\"Concert\\" cassette tape called \\"Killing the Cat(Curiosity)\\"). Anyone expecting to hear \\"Love Song\\" \\"Pictures of You\\" or \\"Mint Car\\", welcome to the cheery \\"Shake Dog Shake\\" \\"The Baby Screams\\" and \\"The Drowning Man\\". I love this thing to bits. The production, the visuals, and performance is top notch(although Mr. Smith's facial expressions run the gamut from deranged to really deranged), but I doubt that my 14 year old cousin would say that she enjoyed this. The only beef I have is the absence of any keyboard player, so that the audience was moved to sing that part on \\"Play for Today\\". Cheesy.
0786173955|5.0|I bought the audio CD version of this book. <br /> <br />Recording and Narration:  Very well done.  Narator is very clear in his pronunciation of difficult islamic names. <br /> <br />This is an eye opening and very scary book.  Well documented with a vast amount of passages taken directly from the Koran.  The author weaves together original teachings, current statements from Islamic leaders and the misdeeds of many.  This is a wake up call to those in our Country and others in the western world that we better take this threat seriously, or risk losing our civilization.
B000E5KJE8|4.0|* My Theater consists of a 159\\" (78x139) Dalite Cinema Contour fixed screen and a BENQ High Definition DLP projector displaying HD in 1080i.

0060263857|5.0|Before running out with your child to see the recently released movie - take the time to share this wonderfully timeless, touching and human story with your child(ren) in book form. There is always something lost in translation from one media to another - I urge you to at least remind yourself what has been traded off to make a movie of it!
B0000640VO|5.0|No matter what movie she's in, it's bound to be great.  This movie could make an earthworm feel emotional.  I loved it so much that I could watch it any time.  The first time I saw it I was speechless.  What a beautiful movie.  Not just a mushy-gushy movie, it has its funny moments too.  I truly love this film.  It's very dear to my heart.  It's amazing just what she did in the movie.  I loved this movie so much!  If you don't get it at least rent it.  You'd have to be a jerk not to be moved after this movie.  Awesome film! I promise you won't regret it! <br /> <br />Jumaane
0307236722|4.0|I have had this book for a year now and have made a few dozen recipes out of it.  Overall they have been good ones and the book is full of good information on the hows and whys of baking.  That said, I have had trouble with a couple of the recipes being not completely correct.  In one case, the proportions for making a strusel topping were off, resulting in a too dry topping.  The other calls for an ungreased baking pan, causing the bars I was making to stick terribly.  Not huge issues, granted, but annoying none the less.
B000GFLEAY|5.0|Seabiscuit on HD-DVD is a stunning visual treat. <br /> <br />Numerous visual scenes are unforgettable: <br /> <br />* Jeff Bridges at the end of the road race is standing high in the mountains and states that 'the future is the destiniation' - the scenery in the background is breathtaking. <br /> <br />* Toby Maguire and Seabiscuit take a ride in the autumn countryside - the visual of the bridge and the countryside is amazing and worth the price alone. <br /> <br />* Numerous race scenes in the movie are captivating with the vivid colors. <br /> <br />The audio track was exceptional and the hoofs of the horses rocked our home Theater. <br /> <br />Highly recommend this excellent movie in HD; a cinematic pleasure!

B00005JPDR|4.0|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is a visual cinematic feast and a celebration of the goodness of humanity, of being human and of being different. In contrast, it is also a story of obssession and of murder.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) was destined to explore and experience the allure and mystery of smell. Growing up in Paris, he is obssessed with scent- no matter what it might be. With a remarkable ability to smell even the slightest and most subtle of scent, he became obssessed in capturing the fragrance of young virgins. Without regard for life, he continues to kill until he got caught and was sentenced to die.<br /><br />Directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run), Perfume is a study of contrast. Grenouille's power of scent and how he uses it does not differentiate the good and the bad smells of Paris. As he pursues his obssession, we are transported from the stench and cruelties of Paris into the lush and freshness of a fragrant french countryside.<br /><br />What is so amazing about this film, aside from the intelligent directing and cinematography, is the acting. Ben Whishaw, who only stands at 5'9\\" is literally an acting giant. His portrayal of Grenouille is both chilling and fascinating. The subtle changes of emotions on his face is remarkable and deserve much praise. While the character in the Patrick S&uuml;skind novel is described as seemingly disfigured and unattractive, Whishaw is the exact opposite. He exudes a certain charisma and innocence mixed with a hint of sexual danger and notoriety. Such mix can only be described as enigmatic. He carried the film and lifted it to a higher level.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman both provided superb support to Whishaw.<br /><br />While there are some departures from the novel, which happens to be one of the most fascinating read, it remains powerful and remarkable.
B000J103PC|5.0|As a fashionista myself, I absolutely adore this movie. I got it on DVD for Christmas and I am very happy with it. It's witty, funny and the characters are so enjoyable. This is a movie that even a straight man could enjoy. It's not your typical chick flick. A lot of people could relate to this! Struggling and breaking your back to move up in the world, even when no one thinks you can do it and the odds are against you and it feels almost impossible. You can't help but be happy for Andrea as she succeeds and proves her naysayers wrong by becoming a confident and stylish woman. Many people would say that she lets her job consume her and alienates her friends and family, but honestly, I feel that her friend Lily and her boyfriend, Nate were being unsupportive and not understanding. Such as shown in the scene where they play keep-away with her phone when Miranda calls her, C'mon! If my boss is calling and someone takes away my phone, I'd go off! It's very difficult for her and there's a lot of pressure on her to succeed and it seemed as if her friends and boyfriend were a little threatened by her success and the fact that she looked fabulous. She looked great and she was doing great at her job, and her friends couldn't even be happy for her. She should've gotten some new ones. Her friend Doug, on the other hand, seemed to love her new job! Nate was being whiney, selfish and threatened. Merryl was absolutely amazing and oscar-worthy as Miranda! From the minute she walks out of the elevator, she exudes cruelty! Stanley Tucci, as Nigel, is a riot! Clever, funny and witty! Simon Baker is sexy and irrestible as Andies admirer. The Devil Wears Prada is definitely a must-see, especially for those who love fashion. This movie drips with cotoure! <br />

B0002F6BRE|4.0|`Elf' released in '03 is a delightfully funny Christmas treat for the whole family to enjoy. Will Ferrell is perfectly cast as Buddy, the human child raised by elves at the North Pole. The supporting cast is also excellent, especially Zooey Deschanel as Buddy's love interest Jovie.<br /><br />As you`ve come to expect from a Will Ferrell movie there's a lot of madcap physical comedy and over-the-top acting. Be that as it may, it really works in this film. More importantly, it delivers a great Christmas message. Recommended viewing.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Syriana is loosely based on Bob Baer's book 'See No Evil'.  The creative license taken with Baer's book serves us well, and we end up with a complex, entertaining, and somewhat educational look at America's involvement in the middle east.  I've heard complaints about the plot being too complex and hard to follow.  This isn't a 'boy gets girl' or 'good guys vs. bad guys' movie.  It shows some of the complexities involved with foreign relations, particularly as it relates to oil, middle-eastern monarchs and terrorism.
B000JLTRJ0|1.0|I refuse to see this film.  I am offended that so many people feel that it is in any way respectful to anyone impacted by the events of 9/11.  It is a typical Hollywood scheme to get rich off of something that should never be considered for profit, particularly since so little time has passed.  One might point out that profits were donated to charities, but what is left out is that it was 10% of profits from the first five days the film was open in theaters.  This means that 90% of profits (as in everything on top of the ridiculous salaries for most involved) go straight to the pockets of Paramount Studios.  At least Cage donated a decent chunk to the Red Cross.  I for one refuse to contribute to such a blatant exploitation of thousands that died.

Or do as I did and get the soundtrack 1st to get you all hyped about the movie.

0307346609|4.0|Basically, this is an 'expanded' Zombie Survival Guide.  Attach a little story to all of the things laid out in that book, and you've got World War Z. That doesn't make this book any less readable, though. <br /> <br />The references to um, 'certain American political figures' are cute, some of the tales are engaging, and Max Brooks still doesn't have a grasp on physics (hint: if Zombies are the same physically as people, they can't walk around on the ocean floor without being crushed...just like people).  <br /> <br />All and all, if you're a zombie fan, its a good read.  Apparently they're going to make a movie on it.  Maybe it won't suck.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|When a movie starts with \\"We may experience some slight turbulence and then explode\\", well, you have to see it through, right?    I never watched \\"Firefly\\", but bought this on a whim because of a tiny \\"Wired\\" magazine review.  Thank God for tiny \\"Wired\\" magazine reviews, as this is one of the *GREAT* sci-fi movies I own.    It's high-tech and human, with (ambiguous) saints and devils, and some of the great sci-fi lines.  Just listen to Jayne describe his assorted bases for starting a fight.  Hysterical!    Lots of fun.  Buy, watch, enjoy.  Then spread the word.
1594200823|2.0|One really wonderful thing about being an omnivore is the large choice of foodstuffs available for consumption. Nature has presented us with a precious gift, not a dilemma. Think of our poor uneducated forebears who without any anxiety about what they should eat, ate what was locally available. The good old days of moldy stored food and spoiled meat. The good old days of no greens in Winter and vitamin deficiencies that killed children and old people. Agribuisness is awful, save for the fact that it provides us with inexpensive nutritious food. The author is the worst sort of investigator, filled with beliefs that he uses poor research to validate. <br />\\"What should we eat?\\" Whatever we're hungry for. Pass the ketchup, please.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Quite possibly the most creative movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br />When you think about sci-fi, you normally think about trips to the stars, or killer robots.  You never think sci-fi might be \\"Total UnRecall\\" - the application of just-out-there therapies to stabilizing modern life via amnesia. <br /> <br />This is a brilliant piece of work.  It fuses just over the horizon technology with the way humanity might decide to use it, with an oh-so-human story.  It's perfect. <br /> <br />This movie is a gem.  See it.  Please.
B00005JOCU|5.0|Like many others, I vividly recall how Jennifer Holliday sent shivers down my neck when she ripped through her defiant anthem, \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\", in the original Broadway production nearly a quarter century ago. It is the kind of transcendent moment in the theater that had exponentially raised my anticipation of the much-delayed 2006 screen adaptation. The great news is that director/screenwriter Bill Condon has pulled together a top-notch entertainment piece full of ceaseless energy and eye-filling dazzle. Even if the narrative deficiencies of Tom Eyen's original musical have not been resolved here, Condon compensates by bringing more historical context to the story and making even more pointed references to the characters' real-life counterparts. More importantly, he recognizes that the episodic human drama really takes a back seat to the early Motown-to-disco musical pastiche brought forth by Henry Krieger's sturdy, crescendo-heavy score and Eyen's constantly engaging lyrics.<br /><br />The time-spanning plot focuses on a girl group in Detroit, three childhood friends - vocal powerhouse Effie backed up by good-girl Deena and chatty Lorrell - who are together known as the Dreamettes. Showing promise but failing to win a local amateur contest, they are corralled by smooth-talking Cadillac huckster Curtis Taylor to sing back-up for local R&B star James Thunder Early. They become a hit on the chitlin' circuit, but Taylor wants broader fame. Along with Effie's ambitious, soft-spoken songwriting brother C.C., Taylor launches a new label, Rainbow Records, right out of his car dealership. They record a song that starts to move on the charts but not before it is lifted by a white group in an antiseptic cover version. Taylor turns to payola to ensure Early and the Dreamettes achieve pop success on their own. He also tries to tone down Early for white audiences and makeover the girls into the Dreams. The latter strategy means pushing Effie into the background and Deena upfront, a move that causes friction and resentment in spite of the group's burgeoning success. Eventually, Effie's diva behavior gets her kicked out of the Dreams, and Early's star fades into addiction and irrelevance. Meanwhile, Taylor has built a media empire with plans to make Deena a movie star. His Svengali-level of control reaches a breaking point when he takes back a song C.C. wrote for Effie's resuscitating solo career in order to make it a disco hit for the Dreams.<br /><br />It's most fortunate that casting is exemplary here because that could have easily been the film's downfall. Even though it is an ensemble piece, the lion's share of the press has been going to Jennifer Hudson's blazing debut performance as Effie. Standing in the shadow of the startlingly overwhelming Jennifer Holliday is no picnic, but with her zaftig figure and huge voice, Hudson effortlessly captures the character's sassy self-confidence and eventual emotional deconstruction. Musically, she clearly has the vocal chops and technique to nail all of Effie's numbers, especially \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\", the film's crowning moment. As Early, Eddie Murphy finally has a role that takes advantage of his gift for mimicry (this time an amalgam of Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson and James Brown - who sadly just died this morning), adds darker colors and textures to his established screen persona and dares him to try singing again. The result is nothing short of a revelation.<br /><br />As Deena, the obvious Diana Ross doppelganger, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles manages to hold her own, even though her character has not been sharpened into a stronger personality. A stunning woman by anyone's measure, she manages to capture her progenitor's breathy, slinky singing style, while lending a naturalistic quality to her portrayal. She has one shining musical moment, a new song called \\"Listen\\", though ironically, her powerful vocal delivery seems at odds with Deena's supposedly limitedtalents. With the unenviable task of playing Curtis, the Berry Gordy-like figure of Machiavellian villainy, Jaime Foxx begins solid even as the character becomes more cardboard as the story progresses. With a beautifully soulful voice of her own, Anika Noni Rose shines as Lorrell moving fluidly from ditzy back-up singer to resigned mistress. Keith Robinson also displays a fine voice and brings gravitas to his subtle performance as C.C, while Danny Glover provides his welcome seasoned presence as Early's manager, Marty.<br /><br />There are several moments that are plain wonderful. One in particular is when Early starts to rehearse the Dreamettes on \\"Fake Your Way to the Top\\", and as he gyrates, it turns into the actual stage show. Another is the near-operatic histrionics on \\"It's All Over\\" when most of the principals take flashy, fiery turns to illuminate the story's turning point. I like some of the movie's more overt send-ups like Early wearing Marvin Gaye's knit cap as he sings his civil rights-themed ballad, \\"Patience\\", or when Deena comes floating down the theater aisles blowing air kisses just like Diana Ross at the Motown reunion concert. All the production values are first-class from Tobias A. Schliessler's dazzling, color-saturated cinematography to Sharen Davis' va-va-voom costumes to Virginia Katz's kinetic film editing to John Myhre's evocative production design which includes recreations of the 1967 Detroit riots. Despite a smattering of weakly contrived dramatic moments in the second half, this is knockout entertainment for anyone who enjoys the musical genre.talents.

I think it is one of the most important pieces of psychoanalytic work ever. It is ground-breaking. Completely lucid and understandable. Gives immediate sense of trust in Newton and his work and findings.<br /><br />I was led to this book after a series of other \\"happenings\\" and now I am going on to having an LBL myself once I find the right therapist. I am certain this is the next step for me in my journey. I am 58 and have been wondering what to do next for some time now. I believe I am back onto something real and meaningful.
B000002HPT|4.0|The rumor is Dream Theater sold out on this one.  I wish other bands could sell out like these guys, but that's still an unfair indictment of the album.  Granted, Falling Into Infinity doesn't take you all over the musical map... you know, the one they recreate every time they pick up their instruments.  But it demonstrates they can rein in their incredible talent to put out an album that taps into a larger audience and which is quite listenable if you're not in the mood for an hour of world class shredding.  For all the criticism, this was nothing more than a blip and a pretty impressive one at that.  Lines in the Sand doesn't rock?  They're still around and still awesome as ever.  Enjoy a good album by an amazing band.
B00005JPGM|3.0|I think its clear that Blood Diamond is supposed to be a weighty, heart-felt, conscience film.  It is a very entertaining film, for the fairly straightforward story-line, but it turns into a slightly screeching, preachy, and slow moving vehicle for the obvious.  I thought the acting was excellent--I thought they did what the script asked of them.  I just think it was a bit overhyped (not the movie's fault).  I do think it was \\"Hollywood-ized\\", to soften it.  The violence in the movie was thankfully minimal, with respect to the actuality; however it seemed gratuitous, and frankly had no context.  The movie's themes were lazily delivered by the script, as opposed to circumstance.   Perhaps, what I blame most of all, was the audience, who I suspect, like most other audiences, frankly didn't appreciate the subltety of the unspoken and seemed shocked to have been confronted with this for the first time.  It frightens me that this movie will probably serve as a historical and factual anchor for a subject that goes much deeper.  <br /> <br />Overall, with more than enthusiastic praise going to DiCaprio and Hansou, I've seen \\"B movies\\" that delivered much better. <br /> <br />
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Now, I'm not saying that I didn't like the theatrical version of Superman II because I did, but I always disliked the slapstick quality of the film.  Richard Donner's version removes almost all of that and I think it makes for a better film that is truer to the vision of the first film.  This Superman II is, in all respects, a continuation of the first film, as Donner envisioned it.  It begins almost exactly where the first film ended and ***SPOILERS*** cuts out the hokey Paris opening sequence.  The Amazon reviewer laments that cut, but I always thought it was a stupid plot.  In addition, in Donner's version the Niagra Falls portion of the film is much shorter, and again I think that makes for a better film.  Above all, what really makes this film 99% better is Marlon Brando as Jor-El.  The scenes between him and Christopher Reeves are dramatic and really form the underpinning of the film:  the relationship between fathers and sons; Jor-El and Kal-El; Johnathan Kent and Clark Kent.  The scenes in the Fortress of Solitude both before and after Superman gives up his super powers to be with Lois Lane are so dramatic and emotional.  Of course, the film is not without its flaws.  It's not perfectly pieced together, but that's to be expected, the scene at Niagra Falls in which Lois discovers Superman's secret is odd looking, and the ending leaves a lot to be desired.  Even Donner admits the ending was bad and it would have been changed if his original vision had been completed.  In the end, this is a film for the fans.  We finally get to see what Donner's version of the film would have looked like; and I don't have a problem saying it would have been the superior version.
B000J103PC|3.0|Based on Lauren Weisenberg's book from 2003, The Devil Wears Prada is a fairly good film that follows a naive young woman on her journey from a small town to New York City where she gets hired to work for a popular fashion magazine. This movie is one of a handful of films directed by David Frankel- a man best known for his directorial involvement in various television series and in a few films.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada has many of the cliches one would expect in a film that follows an unoriginal plot but it also offers some interesting twists and some excellent performances. The story of a naive small town girl who moves to New York in search of a big career is an old theme for a movie but Devil Wears Prada succeeds more often than it doesn't and it turns out to be an acceptable film.<br /><br />A large part of this movie is spent dealing with Meryl Streep's Miranda character; detailing her ruthless, uncaring persona as she verbally degrades her workers and has everyone around her walking on eggshells. I found myself enthralled with Streep more than anyone else in the film because once again, she excels in every possible way. Like always, Streep is excellent in this role and she is the main reason I recommend watching this movie. Her Miranda character is cold, insensitive, and arrogant, but not as completely obnoxious as she could be. Miranda never raises her voice and often expresses herself very effectively without saying a word. Streep deserves all the credit for making this character so enjoyable to watch and she, alone, makes the movie worth viewing.<br /><br />All of the other performers are very good in this film, including Anne Hathaway in the lead role, Stanley Tucci, Emily Blunt, and others. It was interesting to watch Hathaway's character as she stumbles into this job with a fashion magazine, hoping to use it as a stepping stone to a career in journalism. She changes many things about herself simply to please those around her in the business and ultimately sacrifices much of her personal life. This is the type of situation I cannot personally relate to, but I can think of several individuals who have walked down this same treacherous road, expecting great things in the professional sense but giving up their own personal identity in the process.<br /><br />Where Devil Wears Prada falls short is with the screenplay and the lack of deeper examination of the fashion and publishing industries. A great motion picture could be made about a subject like this but David Frankel decides to keep Devil Wears Prada on the simple side. The movie does a good job with its cross examination of that sensitive area where personal lives and business lives cross each other but it doesn't go far enough to be considered a classic film.<br /><br />Overall, Devil Wears Prada is a good movie with some funny moments but mostly a serious message about work and play. The movie reminds me in some ways of the hit series Sex in the City (David Frankel directed some of the Sex in the City shows) and it succeeds mostly because of the performances- especially that of Hollywood veteran Meryl Streep. Take Meryl Streep out of this picture and you would have another second- rate run of the mill movie destined for ever growing Hollywood bin of mediocrity. But with Streep performing so well and the rest of the cast contributing very good performances as well, Devil Wears Prada turns out to be a good enough film to recommend.ltimately sacrifices much of her personal life.

B00005JPE7|5.0|What do we mean by [i]transcendant [/i] art of the story-telling variety, ie books or movies? I think it is fair to say that this sort of real art moves us deeply, transcending the actual subject matter and  strongly touches us personally at a universal human level. Was  The Old Man and The Sea only about fishing? Was Moby Dick about simply whaling? Was The Magnificent Seven about 7 gunslingers on a job? Was Showgirls  only about nude dancing? Ok. Bad example. But you get the point.    As a prime example of such art, I commend to you the new movie Rocky Balboa. Like everyone else, I was sort of disdainful of Stallone cranking out another Rocky movie. I was wrong. And if you don't do yourself the great favor of seeing it now on the Big Screen, you will be, too. It is more than great entertainment; it is art. Transcendant art. The best in the series. The best. And it is not really about boxing.    Rocky Balboa has carved himself a nice life since his career in the ring ended. He has a nice successful restaurant. Upscale clientelle. he's an icon. People greet him on the street,wanting to have their pictures taken with him.He wears an expensive sport coat to work. He speaks well, looks good, has friends of all sorts and money in the bank. And yet..and yet..    Adrienne is gone, of cancer three years ago. He goes to her grave and walks where they walked, remembering. His son is estranged from him, overshadowed by his famous father and blaming his dad for it. And Rocky tells stories to his restaurant patrons of the old days while signing autographs and posing for photos. Is this The Italian Stallion? There is still fire within. And one way to let it out. Fighters fight. He applies for a boxing license.Passes all tests with flying colors. And gets turned down. The insight that Stallone brings to this script which he wrote, his heartfelt speech to the Licensing board and later his son and\\" Paulie\\"  are the real knockouts in the film. He gets his license, planning on some minor fights. But it isn't going to be that way.    When a computer simulated fight predicts that Rocky in his 1970s prime would defeat current undefeated heavyweight champion Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon (Antonio Tarver,genune light-heavyweight champion and top pound-for-pound fighter at the time), an exhibiition fight is arranged. Dixon at first  expects to \\"carry\\" Rocky, much as Jumbo Collins carried Joe Frazier when Smokin' Joe came out of reitrement and had nothing left. But as boxing pundits continue to say that Dixon isn't what Rocky was, as he is dissed, as Rocky gets the pre-fight applause and press, you can see Antonio Taver getting more and more irritated. And when Balboa tells Tarver \\"I didn't come here to lose\\", you know it ain't gonna be no friendly exhibition.      Technically, the film is amazing. The fight scenes, video and real, feel authentic. Real referee,real announcer, real commentators, Mike Tyson ringside  screaming that the champion is ducking him. The editing is great. It IS an HBO PPV fight. There are several muted almost hidden, images that will reverberate with fans of the earlier films. And Tarver at the peak of his form has that great long jab and crushing left cross (he is a southpaw) that won him the real title.     This film is not about boxing. It is about getting older, about loss, about digging down, about being true to yourself, about love and kids and redemption. [...].    It is more than a movie. Written, directed and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is transcendant art. And The Best Picture of the Year. Maybe any year.    Don't miss it.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Chicago is a well- made musical production that tells the story of several vaudeville ladies in 1920's Chicago who compete for fame and fortune and are willing to sacrifice their reputations, sleep with different men, kill a few people, etc., to advance their careers. This movie was award with the Best Picture Oscar for 2002 and after watching it a couple of times, it is easy to see why it was considered for this prestigious award. The story presented in this musical is pretty good and it is packed with an all- star cast that includes performers like Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Richard Gere, and Queen Latifa. With a combination of talent like that, a film has a good chance for success. And Chicago certainly does succeed on most levels with many excellent song and dance scenes and strong directing from Rob Marshall.<br /><br />What makes a musical memorable is, of course, the music itself; in particular, the catchiness of the tunes, the presentation of the songs, and the integration of the songs within the context of the film. Among the many songs in this musical (about 18 of them), some of them are certainly better than others with the standouts being \\"I Move On\\", \\"All I Care About\\", and \\"All that Jazz\\". Many of the others are only average and I have already forgotten most of them- even after watching the movie two times. The way the songs are inserted into the movie, however, is very good and Rob Marshall deserves credit for timing the presentation of these tunes but even more impressive than the timing is the performances themselves. The dance scenes are hot, with Catherine Zeta- Jones and Renee Zellweger leading the way. Dozens of hot female bodies twist and turn to the music, making you quickly forget about quality of the songs themselves.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it isn't the greatest I have ever seen in a movie (musical or otherwise) but it is still pretty good. What I like best about it is the character development and the progression of the lead character, Roxie Hart, from down- and- out vaudeville wannabe to media darling and ultimately back to where she started. It is interesting to watch as Renee Zellweger's character goes from a sexually dissatisfied woman married to a very homely looking man to a murderess. She is concerned at first that she will spend her life behind bars for killing the man she was having an affair with. Then, realizing her media star power as a woman who shot and killed a man, she forgets about the murder and lavishes in the attention, only to see the spotlight ultimately shift to another person who has an even greater story to tell.<br /><br />All of the performances in this movie are noteworthy and it is important to point out that Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Renee Zellweger, and the others perform the song and dance routines themselves. There is no lip- syncing or dubbed music here. The star performers prove they have earned their celebrity status by performing their own parts. Each of them is very good in their roles, especially Zellweger as the main character and John Reilly as her plain- looking, plain- spoken husband.<br /><br />Overall, Chicago is a good musical with some hot dance scenes, good songs, and star performances all around. The movie ultimately looks slightly better then it sounds because not all of the songs are very memorable. But it is still a very good Hollywood musical and the first of its genre to win the Best Picture award in a more than thirty years.of the lead character, Roxie Hart, from down- and- out vaudeville wannabe to media darling and ultimately back to where she started.

0393314804|5.0|If you like the movie and you've also got the soundtrack cds then go the whole hog and give it a read. It consists of a series of vignettes that were woven together superbly for the film. Readers might be put off initially by Welsh writing in a scottish dialect, but once you suss it out, it works most effectively in setting the scene and the characters - and there's a almost complete dictionary in the back. Some of the scenes are a tad grimmer than the film portrayed - hence the beauty of books allowing character development etc. But that said the film captured the essence of the book very, very well. The cover shows the cast of the film, and I think they did a grand job matching up the characters to the actors especially Begby.  <br /> <br />Welsh indicates how easy it is for the disenfranchised of the western world, and probably all cultures, to find themselves trying drugs \\"just the once, I can handle it\\" and then caught in the embrace of addition, needing the next fix and how to fund it etc.  <br /> <br />A very powerful protrayal of the sad and seedy world of drug addiction. (The \\"Mile End\\" track by Pulp captures it perfectly).  <br /> <br />Recommended!
B000J103YI|5.0|I am taken a back by the vocal talents of Jennifer Hudson. She does well with the songs previously done by Broadway's Jennifer Holiday, the original Effie. Beyonce really sounds like the ultimate old school diva of divas, Diana Ross. Veteran screen perfomer, Eddie Murphy does the best singing he has ever done. His take on James Brown style vocals is just pure soul. The is a timeless CD to be played over and over.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I have been a environmental scientist and have studied climate change for most of my professional career and I have to give Al Gore credit for condensing into a feature film quite a lot of valuable environmental information that otherwise has not made it to a mass audience.  Yes, it does have some of Al Gore's life story in it as well some of the \\"lecture circuit\\" shots.  For the short-sighted, this may seem to be irrelevant information (the facts mam, just the facts), but it does re-enforce Al Gore's background and how he came to be an activist in Global Warming. If the film only contained the dry facts, much of the mainstream audience might not have wanted to see it.  This so-called \\"irrelevant\\" information is a small part of the total film and gives the film a bit of context and perspective that I enjoyed.   <br /> <br />As for the dummy that wanted to see the references ... are you expecting technical references like in a professional journal?  You don't have to believe me ... just talk to your local climatologist at a local university.  The vast majority of the information Al Gore is giving here has been the mainstay of climate study for well over a decade and some of it has been common knowledge for a lot longer than that.  Needless to say there are many potential references.  I didn't see anything that was \\"made up\\" by Al Gore.  Although he's \\"just the messenger\\", I can't think of anyone I would rather have delivering the message.    <br /> <br />Buy it, watch it, pass it on to friends.

B000FQ4M58|5.0|Bat out of hell III doesn't hit you instantly but give it a few listens and the album starts to find its own feet. My personal favourites are Blind as a bat, If God could talk, Cry over me and what about love. Pretty much there are no real low points. Sure there are a couple of cringeworthy songs but thats just the meat. If you like meat loaf you will love this album.
0670034711|5.0|Gilbert's book is a very easy read, earthy and witty-she writes like she speaks.  Her inclusive ideas about the spiritual quest are inspiring and enlightening.  Can't wait to read more of her work.
0375505091|3.0|This book has to be reviewed on two levels. First as a retrospective of Annie Leibovitz's photography from 1990 - 2005. On that level, the presentation is sumptuous and greatly enhances even the most mediocre photos. Few of these photos are as breathtaking as much of the work Leibowitz produced in earlier years. Most of the photos would, in fact, be indistinguishable from the work of thousands of others photographers were it not for their famous subjects, such as Al Pacino and Willie Nelson.<br /><br />  One troubling aspect of this collection for me was Leibowitz's seeming imitation of the styles of other photographers from the past such as Dianne Arbus and even Leni Riefenstahl, the infamous creator of the Nazi propaganda film \\"Triumph of the Will\\". Her portrait of the muscular torso of Sylvester Stallone is terribly reminiscent of Riefenstahl's style. Likewise her portraits of two Las Vegas dancers, resplendent in their bejeweled costumes, is compared with portraits of them as ordinary middle-aged women without makeup. Effective, but in many ways a reflection of Arbus's famous style. Portraits of Colin Powell and Norman Schwartzkopf look like those from virtually any high-end portrait studio.<br /><br />  The vitality and originality I used to associate with Annie Leibovitz is largely absent in this collection. On the whole, it is a disappointing portfolio.<br /><br />  Leibovitz perhaps intended this collection to be a different kind of statement, truly a statement about her \\"life\\". And it is, uncomfortably so perhaps.<br /><br />  There are many, many photographs of Susan Sontag, Leibvoitz's partner. Sontag is remembered (and reviled) by many for her strident anti-Americanism. It is difficult to reconcile these \\"loving\\" picures of Sontag taken by her lover with the Sontag who exorciated Americans very shortly after 9/11 and told them they deserved the disaster they got. Hard to put away feelings of animosity while seeing so many photos of her in Leibvoitz's book.<br /><br />  Leibovitz also includes many photos of her family. These are nothing more than snapshots for the most part, no matter how deftly they have been manipulated in the printing process. (I am really curious as to whether Leibovitz does her own printing. Much of the impact of many of her photos in this collection owes to their printing and the large presentation size, not their content or composition.)<br /><br />  In some ways, Leibovitz would have been better served by putting all of her family pictures into a separate section. As such it would have chronicled the physical decline of her parents while their children and grandchildren grew and would have been a powerful testament to familial love.<br /><br />  Leibovitz makes it clear that this is a deeply personal statement. She says \\"I cried for a month. I didn't realize until later how far the work on the book had taken me through the grieving proces. It's the closest thing to who I am that I've ever done.\\" That sentiment may indeed account for the ordinariness of the photos in this book. Leibovitz is showing us her life - as the title implies - and not simply showcasing her best work. On the other hand, that presumes the admirer of Leibovitz's photography is interested in her personal life with Sontag and family and not just her photography. I'm sure some will enjoy this collection: I did not find it especially noteworthy.<br /><br />Jerryoitz's book. <br /> <br />  Leibovitz also includes many photos of her family.

B00005JPCA|5.0|There have been a lot of great James Bond movies over the years, but this one raises the bar to a new level.  This is not the rather campy tongue-in-cheek 007 that has too often stolen the show in the Bond franchise; this is a truly ruthless Bond that is true to creator Ian Fleming's vision of the character and the world he lives in.  Daniel Craig steps right into some of the biggest shoes in the fictional world and makes the role his own from the first dead-on shot to the last.  Craig's lean, hungry look captures the essence of Fleming's master spy perfectly.   The dark, noir-ish prologue sets a dangerous tone that holds firm throug the remainder of the film, which delivers all the intrigue, action, romance and globe-trotting excitement that Bond films are famous for but with a decidedly sharper and deadlier edge.  There is no Q-branch here, with its plethora of fantastic gadgets, and while there is humor it's understated and flows naturally from the all-too-human characters and the plot itself.  The action scenes are physical and punishing, the love scenes intense but never gratuitous, the sets true-to-life and the direction from Martin Campbell precise and dextrous.  Mads Mikkelson is a perfect Le Chiffre, possibly even more menacing than the source novel's version, and Jeffrey Wright's new interpretation of Felix Leiter rings true. But it is Eva Green's stunning portrayal of the enigmatic Vesper Lynd that is perhaps the most haunting of the whole film.  Green's Vesper is beautiful, witty, and intelligent, but unreadable and somehow tainted with a hidden wound that makes her ultimately untouchable as well.  There hasn't been a Bond girl like this since Diana Rigg's immortal turn as Tracy from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE way back when.  And Craig's last line is the perfect end-note for a breathtaking thrill-ride and brilliant re-imagining of one of cinema's most enduring yet frequently mishandled characters.  No doubt many long-time fans of the movie series, ignorant of the original source novels, were a little disappointed with this return to Bond's deadlier roots, but the result is one of the three best Bond films ever.  Only DR. NO and the aforementioned ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, both likewise notable for their more realistic versions of 007 and his creator's vision, are comparable in any way to the new CASINO ROYALE.  Somewhere, I think Ian Fleming is smiling.
B000000H6D|5.0|I saw this band open for Pantera in the mid 90's....  I am mostly a \\"news talk\\" listener now, but it is always fun to visit my roots!  If you like the hard rock of the 90's then this is for you.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|The main reason why I went to purchase this album in the first place was the fact that I was reading on a website of my favorite group Keane where the songwriter/piano player Tim Rice-Oxley was invited by Gwen to write and produce a song for her new album The Sweet Escape called \\"An Early Winter.\\"  What I have heard on just this song alone has exceeded my expectations.  And, by the way, the rest of her album kicks major [...] and I think is even far better than her last solo album.  Despite the fact that there are a few songs on here that I would prefer to press the \\"skip\\" button on, most are at least half-way likable.  Before listening to the horribly inaccurate reviews here on Amazon regarding this latest splendid sophomore solo effort, go ahead and give the album a few spins yourself before judging it.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
B000FBGBPC|1.0|What's with all the 4 and 5 star ratings? I bought this album after reading all the great reviews and although its bearable, it's not mindblowing.<br /><br />This is standard rock fare of the Nickleback variety: No originality, average riffs, okay vocals but terrible asinine lyrics that are so obvious and cheesy it's laughable, (for example track 2 'this life is filled with hurt when happiness doesn't work?') This is bad 9th grade poetry, All the songs follow the same themes of loss, pain and despair and none of it rings true or connects on any emotional level.<br /><br />This is not a bad album but there's so much better music out there. If you are thinking of buying this album, I recommend you try before you buy or at least seek out albums by bands such as Dead Letter Circus, Butterfly Effect, Chevelle, Cog, Grinspoon, Karnivool, Shihad, 36 Crazyfists, A Perfect Circle etc. There is so much more original music out there.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|This film was excellent and I thought that it was even a little bit better than one of my favorite dance movies, \\"Flashdance\\", in some ways.  One way that \\"Step Up\\" was better was the fact that Jenna Dewan was little more admirable as a character than Jennifer Beals was due to the fact that there were a number of instaces in \\"Flashdance\\" where I felt that Alex (Jennifer Beals) just got way to foul-mouthed and upset for no apparent reason and also I felt that that \\"Step Up\\" was deeper in its thematic elements, whereas \\"Flashdance\\" seemed a little too shallow in some parts.  Also, I really felt that Jenna Dewan really showed some major star power in this film and really made me say to myself,\\"Wow this girl is got a great future in acting in front of her is she keeps it up.\\"  At any rate, I really enjoyed this film and I thought it was FAR better than \\"Save The Last Dance\\", which didn't really seem to do much for me and was actually rather violent, dark, and depressing.  Go ahead and give \\"Step Up\\" a shot.  I can guarantee you will at least find it very likable.

A Film about a Dysfunctional Family that even though it deals with Such Heavy Topics as Depression, Drug Use, Marriage Problems and Death Surprisly isnt Depressing But a Laugh Out Riot! A Film that Most People Can probably relate to and can probably recognise a family member or two in this film. The ending when the LIttle girl does her Talent in the Beauty Pageant is Hilarious! I highly recommend this film and I hope is gets the oscar nominations that it deserves!
B0000024TQ|5.0|As has been stated repeatedly here, BOOKENDS (released in 1968) is the greatest of all Simon & Garfunkel albums, and one of the best records made in the 1960s.<br /><br />Tonight, Christmas night, I've been thinking about Christmas of 1968-- I was 14 then. That was an awful year to live through for anyone, especially a kid. The Vietnam War, the assassinations of public figures, and seeing part of my city burn the previous summer during riots-- it was a lot to handle.<br /><br />The song \\"Save The Life Of My Child\\" from BOOKENDS was in my head all throughout 1968. I identified with that frightened boy standing on the ledge, while a crowd below urged him to jump. His final thought as \\"he flew away\\" was \\"...I got no hiding place.\\" That was exactly how I felt in those days.<br /><br />What a powerful and unforgettable way to begin an album. The moods of BOOKENDS reflect so well the troubled times of the late '60s, with its anti-war sentiments (Punky's Dilemma), and its tales of love and love lost (America, Overs). The original first side of the record ends with the sad longing and fears of Old Friends, who sit on a park bench and reminisce together. But this bittersweet song has a deeper message. These old men were survivors-- if they were supposed to be elderly in 1968, then they made it through the Depression, and two world wars, and if they were the youth of 1968 projected into the future, well they too made it through trials by fire.<br /><br />And so have I made it through! I'm in my 50s now and headed for that park bench one day. The fears and sadness of 1968 are long past, but a final memory remains:<br /><br />As I lay in bed early that Christmas Eve, the colored glow of tree lights seeped into my room. Off in the distance were disembodied television voices of Apollo astronauts circling the moon-- they read passages from the book of Genesis, and wished well the \\"people of the good Earth.\\" It was a peaceful and hopeful ending to a terrible year.<br /><br />Very few albums truly encapsulate a moment in time. Even fewer connect deeply with listeners in ways they may not realize until decades into the future. Simon & Garfunkel's BOOKENDS is one of those rare examples. It is paradoxically timeless and a reflection of its time.ew albums truly encapsulate a moment in time.

B000K7VHPU|4.0|I saw this movie with very little preconception of what it was about. I had not seen any trailers all I knew is that the amazing Jessica Biel and two of my favorite actors Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti were in it. Of course I knew from the title that it was going to have something to do with a magician or illusionist for lack or better wording. I was very pleased with the whole story. I enjoyed the revealing of the grand illusion, and the romance between Norton and Biel. I enjoyed the tirades of Sewell and the musings of Giamatti. My expectations were not set unreasonably high so I was very thrilled with the movie. In addition to the story I thought that the visuals were spectacular and worth a look. I will certainly be adding this film to my collection.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Gosh, I love this CD.  I love soulful singers and he's got \\"IT\\".  The whole production is phenomenal.  Extremely talented individual (singer, songwriter, instrumentalist). I love the fact that he included the words to all the songs in his CD jacket.  Wow, don't know where to start, \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\", \\"Gravity\\", \\"I Don't Trust Myself (with Loving You)\\", Vultures.  \\"Bold as Love\\", \\"In Repair\\". Heck I love the whole thing.  It's worth it people.  Just buy it. You won't regret it.
B00005JPE7|5.0|After the dissapointing Rocky V, Stallone has somehow managed the impossible- a Rocky sequel which nearly measures up to the standard of the original and Rocky II.  Tossing out the machismo training and fight sequeunces of III,IV, and V, Stallone returns (again) to the gritty roots of Philadelphia.  Here he courts (in the non-standard way) a young woman resembling Adrian, takes her son under his wing, and even (hold on to something) manages to grow as a character. <br />The training and fight scenes are minimal, but when they take place, they reach catharthic heights of glee not seen since Rocky III.  Rocky Balboa is a unique film in this day and age-a meaningful film.
B000I2IT44|5.0|An absolutely fantastic DVD of what is without question one of the best, original, and skilled rock bands on the planet. Nothing beats seeing them in person, but this DVD set comes about as close as anything possibly could, especially on a big screen with true 5.1 sound. Get it, you will not be sorry.
B000E1MTWM|5.0|While it's not really a film, it's one of the most beautiful \\"film\\" portrayls of WW2 i've ever seen.  This belongs right up there with the best in the war film genre.  This series came out right before the sonic boom of HDTV so to see this series in all its glory come to the High Resolution arena will be fantastic.  I just recently saw Saving Private Ryan on HDTV and it looked unbelievable.  With Speilberg producing the series, each episode used the same film stock and stylistic look as SPR, thus Band of Brothers must, and will look incredible.  If you have the few bucks to spend, and are a fan of the series, regardless of if you have it already or not, it's DEFINETLY worthwhile to buy, and REALLY nice to upgrade.

B000FTWB7G|1.0|Only one star because 0 is not an option.  Hmmm, Lets see here!  An Over-emotional, whining, drama queen front person backed by a tragically unimaginative NU-Metal band.  Why is everything she sings sound like whining.  I actually owned Fallen and there were a few choice tracks on it, but it was the long winded, drawn out, sanity peircing vocals that forced me to throw it away, couldn't even give it away.  The same goes for The open Door.  The direction may be a little bit different but its just as bad, only now she sings multiple tracks over herself which kinda gives the impression that if she was any more full of herself, there would be 100 of her.  Not to mention the fact that just one vocal track was annoying enough.  So, as the cover suggests, Magical Mysterious Commercial Goth Queen enters a huge magical smokey doorway to Narnia, Someone should close and lock the door behind her!  Enough already!
B00023B1LC|5.0|I really loved this movie. The plot, the acting, the flow of the events... It was just excellent! I can see this movie every once a week. Has a lot of action, good fighting sequences, and you can feel Bourne's adrenaline flow.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|I really don't understand all the bad reviews from critics and reviewers alike for I personally loved this movie. Now, it's not the grandest spectacle to grace the big screen nor is it Russell Crowe's finest hour, but `A Good Year' is some quality entertainment and serves it purpose in the relaxed and happy season that is fall. Having just seen the poorly made and highly overrated `Catch a Fire' I was ready to relax and watch something entertaining and enjoyable, and being the Russell Crowe fan that I undoubtedly am I decided that `A Good Year' would be just that movie.  <br /> <br />Max Skinner (Crowe) is a stuck up British stock broker who at one time was a kind hearted soul, and his fondest memories are littered with his Uncle Henry (Finney) and his Chateau in France. Upon his Uncles death Max is left the sole owner of Henry's estate, and in like fashion he flies out there in order to sell if for profit and make it back ASAP. What he doesn't bank on is Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish) showing up claiming to be the long lost daughter of Henry and claiming rights to his estate. Throughout the course of the film Max has to go through the stages of redemption, which include discovering the jerk he has become and rediscovering his inner child.  <br /> <br />The two key components to his wonderful film is the scenery and the acting. The script and storyline as some have already pointed out is very unoriginal, we've seen this done plenty of times, but the beauty that is France, as well as the beauty that is Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard (who plays Fanny, the seductive woman who steals Max's heart) more than make up for the familiarity. Crowe is, as many know, my all time favorite actor ever, and I feel that he can carry any film he touches. Whether you are a fan of his phone throwing escapades or not, you have to admit that the man is gifted, very gifted. Here he proves that by being just as compelling and engrossing laughing and smiling as he is riding into battle. Albert Finney and Marion Cotillard are also wonderful here, but to me it was little Freddie Highmore (such a talented young man) who outshined most in the cast (can anyone outshine Crowe...I don't believe so).  <br /> <br />As I said in the beginning, I don't understand all the bad press. So what if it's no `A Beautiful Mind' or `Gladiator', so what if Russell was not Lucky Jack or James Braddock, `A Good Year' is still a good time and Max Skinner is just as fun as Crowe ever was. I recommend it, I enjoyed it, no better yet, I loved every minute of it.

B00005JPCA|5.0|From the moment the film opens, with it's gritty black and white (so gritty in fact that it had me wishing they'd made the whole film black and white) to the moment the Bond theme closes out the film, `Casino Royale' is probably the most intoxicating and rewarding film to come out this year.  With all the pre-release criticism and speculation put to rest, Daniel Craig proves that blondes do have more fun, much more fun, for his James Bond is the most real, the most intense and the most enjoyable of the lot of them. <br /> <br />With a plot that makes sense and is easy to follow, `Casino Royale' delivers on every level that a film can, providing entertainment for everyone.  My wife, who is not a fan of Bond movies or even action movies utterly loved this film, so much so that she insisted we see it again the following night.  With action sequences that look so painstakingly real, to emotions that look so painstakingly real, Daniel Craig and the rest of the cast hit every note just right.   <br /> <br />Starting us off with Bond earning his `00' status, the film gives us a great development of the man.  `Casino Royale' is what Bale and Nolan did for Batman with last years `Batman Begins' for Craig and Campbell breathed life into a dying genre.  Sure, everyone who loves Bond will love Bond, but even his fans will admit that the latest in the long line of Bond films was growing tired, but now, with `Casino Royale' under his belt, Bond has a new reason to breathe. <br /> <br />I want to also make mention of Eva Green, an actress I feel is only a few short roles away from an Oscar, for her turn as Bond girl Vesper Lynd was brilliant.  For the first time in the history of Bond films has a Bond girl been more than a piece of tail.  Vesper is smart, seductive and essential to the development, of not just the story but of James Bond himself, for her character and performance add so much weight to his growth as a man. <br /> <br />`Casino Royale' will go down as the greatest Bond film in history (that is until Craig and Campbell top it) and will be a reminder to all that just because bond looks different doesn't mean it's a bad thing, for Daniel Craig has done things with this franchise that us Bond fans have only dreamed of.  He made Bond cool again, and made him someone even my wife can watch again and again!

B000059TEQ|4.0|If I had seen this film upon its release (I wasn't born yet) then I may have been tempted to give it five stars, but beings that the plot has been used and abused since then it's really nothing new.  Like my title states, this is the film that most tragic love stories look to when devising a plot, and it shows in films as recent as `A Walk to Remember', which upon finishing watching this film last night I turned to my wife and said \\"doesn't this remind you on `A Walk to Remember' and she of course said \\"yes, it does\\".  Despite the fact that the script at times grows corny and even a bit irritating, the real story is found within the performances of the two leads, Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal, both of whom rightfully deserved their Oscar nominations.  Their story of true love is inspiring, and while the ending has been repeated over and over this is still a film that every lover of movies should see at least once, I mean, it is considered a classic for a reason!
0743298020|2.0|I had great expectations for this book (no pun intended) and I put it at the top of my holiday wish list based upon recommendations from Amazon readers as well as Barnes and Noble.  Having just finished I felt compelled to write a review so that other readers like myself do not get caught up in the literary recommendations.  I love to read both classics as well as contemporary fiction.  The Thirteeth Tale was supposed to be a nice blend of both as it was compared to many classics, most notably Jane Eyre.  It was a significant disappointment.  The plot was interesting, if not a bit trite, and the characters were nicely developed but on the whole the story was a bit flat.  In spite of the fact that the author dwells excessively on the art of storytelling (it was a recurring theme in the novel) I did not find this book particularly satisfying.  It was devoid of real novelty and the ending was wrapped up too neatly for my taste.  A decent enough first effort by this author.  However, I will likely not be caught up in over hyped literary reviews as quickly in the future
B000LC55F2|5.0|`The Prestige' marks one of the finest films I've seen this year, complete in every sense of the word. It's dark and mysterious and funny and strange and eerie and disturbing and thought provoking and engaging and unique in everyway possible. From star performances by Christian Bale, High Jackman and Michael Caine as well as titillating eye candy in Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo, `The Prestige' enlists an all star cast to help tell the twisted story of two rival magicians bound together by a tragic event that haunts their every action.  <br /> <br />When Alfred Bordon (Christian Bale) accidentally causes the death of Robert Angier's (Hugh Jackman) wife Julia (Piper Perabo) not only is their friendship instantly over but they are now rivals, in every aspect of their lives. The film begins with the death of Robert Angier at the supposed hands of Alfred Bordon. As we await the result of the trial we are given, in flashbacks, the events that preceded the murder. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career highpoints here, adding layers upon layers to their characters and giving us, the viewer, every reason in the world to sit back and enjoy.  <br /> <br />I don't want to give any of this movie away so I don't want to write too much. This film is utterly brilliant and one that is sure to please. I myself was utterly impressed with every second of this film and am positive that you will be as well. There has been much mention of the twists and turns this film takes and the surprise ending, just note that you may think you know, even I thought I knew, but I really had no idea. Excellent, excellent film!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best Tv series ever. Exquisite character development. A feeling of home and camaraderie. Humor and no faked conflict. Why can't Fox take a look at Star Trek. That became an industry in it's own right.  Heck man, invest a little to make a lot. Bring it back.
B00005JPDS|4.0|It's within every subtlety, the redness of his eyes, the quivering of his chin and the weariness with which he watches his son that Will Smith delivers one of the year's finest performances.  I've always been a fan of Will Smith, and this film really shows he's more than just a funny guy, he really can express real emotion, and it's the subtlety with which he expresses it that really shows his acting chops.  In a role that could have easily been `over-acted', Will Smith gives us raw human feeling and emotion that we can all relate to and understand.    As Chris Gardener, a man who made a few bad decisions and is now paying the price, Will Smith shows us many layers of this man.  He's angry with his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) for her lack of faith in him...he's disappointed in himself for not having been more than he is...and most of all he's scared of disappointing his son Christopher (Jaden Smith).  After venturing into the business of selling a bone density x-ray machine, a machine that is all but impossible to sell, Chris ends up broke and unable to keep his family together.  His wife Linda leaves him and soon he's thrown out of his apartment and left on the street.    In an attempt to make a better life for his son Chris enrolls in an internship with a local Stock Brokerage Firm and really pushes himself to be the best he can in order to get the job and provide for his family.  Yes, there are times when this film feels very slow, long and even generic.  They repeat a lot of scenes in order to really show the horrible state he and his son were in, the obstacles he had to overcome all in hopes to make his triumph in the end all the more heartwarming, but it's really Will Smith's performance that makes the film what it is...that and his chemistry with real life son Jaden who definitely takes after his father and serves up one of the most endearing and real characters brought to the cinema this year.    Yes, `The Pursuit of Happyness' may be the `Cinderella Man' of2006 (personally `Cinderella Man' was the better film), but with powerful performances but the two Smiths it's brought to a different level and made worthy of the viewers time, attention and money...and Will Smith I'm sure with rightfully receive his second Oscar nomination!
B00011F5DK|5.0|We tried to get this game a couple of years ago for Christmas, but couldn't find it anywhere for a price we wanted to pay (read: ebay was outrageous!).  Finally, we got it this year, and the entire family (all adults except one child) has been having a great time figuring out the strategies.  It's a game that's easy enough to understand that you can jump right in and play, but the level of competition can make it a really long or really short game.  It's a blast!  Every home with games should have this one!
B000JLTRJ0|3.0|This film is not entirely horrible, and it's one that we should all see at least once I'm sure, but the controversy regarding this film I think transcends a little deeper than whether or not our country was ready to face the events of 9/11 so boldly. I feel that we were ready, but I'm afraid to say that this film just doesn't quite bring us there. It delivers on a few levels but fails to really serve to the viewer the true feelings and emotions of that fateful day, mostly because the attacks are never seen and the devastating true story revolving to policemen John (Cage) and William (Pena) is so watered down that it loses every ounce of feeling while either of them is on screen. That's not to sound harsh, and as I'm writing this I'm wondering how many pissed off Americans are going to rush to hit the `not helpful' button, but I have to be honest. I felt absolutely nothing for either actor because to me they brought absolutely nothing to their character. Michael Pena did do one up on Cage by revealing some depth in emotion on a few pre and post accident scenes, one when he first hears of the attack and is wanting to call his wife and the second when he is in the hospital fighting with his wife over the baby name (his wife Alison, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, is pregnant in the movie). Cage though was completely dead to me, evoking absolutely no emotion whatsoever, and Maria Bello floored me in her lack of depth for after her brilliant performance in last years `History of Violence' I expected the most from her.  <br /> <br />I did find a small glimmer of light though, and that was in the eyes of the extremely talented Gyllenhaal who just illuminates the screen every scene she as in and I'm hoping will finally pull out an Oscar nomination because of this. If anyone in this film deserves it it's her. Her tortured performance as a pregnant woman coming to terms with the fact she may indeed be a widow soon with the very fact that she must tell her four year old daughterhanging over her head was the most moving and emotionally gripping aspects of this movie, and quite frankly the only reason I shed a few tears (the whole scene where she's fighting with her husband (playfully) about the baby name is so touching). The rest of the supporting characters are so underdeveloped and or just plain ignored that they become a waste of space, and in the case of Stephen Dorf and Michael Shannon, a complete waste of talent for even they brought absolutely nothing to the picture, Shannon going as far as to deliver one of the worst performances I've seen all year. I guess I just expected a lot from this movie, I expected to feel so much different when walking out of it, but instead of feeling a sense of heroism for the two leads or a sense of remorse and or depression for that horrific day I was left wanting and even, dare I say, a bit annoyed that what should have and could have been a great and truly inspired film became nothing more than a movie. It was okay, but nothing special, and judging by the source material it should have been something VERY special.  <br /> <br />I do feel a bit of sympathy for director Oliver Stone because it's obvious the man is a man of vision, he's just losing his footing somewhere in delivery. This isn't his first falter for 2004's `Alexander' was an equal disappointment. We all know that Stone can manage a good if not great film, for just look at `Natural Born Killers' or `Nixon'. In the past Oliver was able to hone his skills and deliver to us a brilliant cinematic experience, but of late he's been so focused on the boring details that he loses the whole purpose of what he's trying to convey, he loses what really makes these stories worth telling, and in effect he loses us, the viewer, and that's a very bad thing. I was skeptical about seeing this film because the critics were even saying that it was very watered down and unsatisfying, but I stuck to my guns like I always do and was prepared to once again disagree with the paid professionals, but in this case I have to suck it up, reign in my pride and eat crow because the critics were right. It's not horrible, but it's not great, and that's a shame, because it should have been just that...great.  <br /> <br />At least we had Gyllenhaal...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|So many shows these days  follow certain financial formulas and shows tend to be nothing more than  the evenings entertainment, when these shows are canceled  we as viewers simply move on. <br />firefly was destined to blaze a different path. Even with the chaotic showing times and out of order episodes  most that watched more than 1-2 episodes  fell in love with the rich world  and stunningly deep charactors. This is not where firefly's saga ended... this is where it began... <br />firefly had spawned a solid fanbase that even after the series has been off the air for years now  continues to gain momentum  the popularity was so great that universal (thank you) decited to create SERENITY... <br />Serenity is excelent in itself and another \\"must see\\" dvd   <br />If you just give firefly a chance and watch a couple of episodes  I know you will become endeared with these charactors as many others allready have.  its hard to explain this, but the viewer feels like they could find themselves in this world and not be looked down on like so many other utopian scifi. <br />this world is gritty and hard similar to the western frontier and the charactors are definatly not saints  but they are good people trying to live their lives  you might hear the term  \\"cowboys in space\\"  and while this is kinda true its also kinda wrong the world is much more deep and ultimatly believeable than this simple statement. <br />mal the captain coined a phrase that applies to the firefly series... <br />\\"we have done the impossible and that makes us mighty\\". <br />(as a sub note  the producer joss wheton as well as all the actors and actresses also feel strongly that firefly must not faid away and is worthy of much much more..) <br />my only regret  is it took me so long to realize how good this was.

This is undoubtedly one of the best Beatles books that exist, even though it may contain some inaccuracies. Those who don't like it criticize because Mr. Emerick gave some very raw accounts of their idols' bad behavior. But whose book is it? It's Mr.Emerick's! He only wrote what he saw with his own eyes and what he thought and thinks. He knows better than any of us. He didn't write the book to please everyone (maybe that's why he waited so long).

B000AP04EW|4.0|I didn't expect to like this movie. By the time I finally got around to catching it on cable TV I was Brangelina'ed out. Feh. But \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is so much fun to watch, never mind that it is completely and totally unbelievable, that you can't help hanging in for the ride and enjoying almost every minute of it.<br /><br />So: He's John. She's Jane. They're both gorgeous. (Being Pitt and Jolie, what else would you expect?) They meet in Bogota, Colombia in the middle of some government mess, and it's love at first sight. Flash forward to five or six years later (they're not sure which), when they are contentedly if boringly settled in suburbia, each going about their daily business. She thinks he's the head of an engineering firm. He thinks she's the head of a computer company. What neither of them knows is that each is a top agent for rival companies of international assassins, and each company has contracted them to take out the same target, a young hunk named Benjamin Danz a/k/a \\"The Tank\\", nicely played by Adam Brody. Through a series of mis-steps, each gets in the other's way and the target escapes. Their respective companies are not pleased. Now they're each assigned to do away with the hindrance, and they find themselves with 48 hours to kill each other.<br /><br />From there, the craziness multiplies exponentially. \\"Do you know you're ticking?\\" asks an incredulous bystander, warning John just in time that an explosive device is about to detonate in his jacket pocket. \\"That's TWO TIMES you've tried to kill me!\\" shouts John into his cell phone while racing Jane home in a purloined limousine. \\"Oh come on, it was just a little bomb,\\" she sniffs as she zooms down the highway towards home, where an enraged John is headed and all hell is about to break loose. And amid gun battles, exploding houses, car chases and general mayhem, they discover that their respective firms are not pleased to learn that they are married (sleeping with the enemy is a no-no), and set up the Tank mission all along as a trap for them to take each other out.<br /><br />The plot is so off the wall that it would defy the belief of a five-year-old, but this movie doesn't ask to be taken seriously, as if anybody would. It's a fun movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else. We see the Smiths going about their daily (or nightly) assignments as he is sent to assassinate a guy named Lucky at his poker game; when he returns home, Jane asks John how the game went; John replies, \\"I got Lucky.\\" Har-de-har-har. While John has been off bumping off Lucky, Jane herself has gone to the hotel suite of a notorious gun-runner with a taste for S & M. \\"Have you been selling big guns to bad people?\\" she coos as she strokes his hair and takes hold of his neck. Twist. Snap. Thud. Out the door just in time to make it to the Colemans' cocktail party. Typical life in suburbia.<br /><br />But what really makes this movie is the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie. From their first scene together, these two set off sparks. Their magnetic attraction to each other, even while they're doing their level best to kill each other (or at least to keep from getting killed by the other) hold them and the movie together. Pitt has some nice comic turns (\\"Honey, you're overreacting!\\" he shouts at her while she tries to run him down with her car. \\"We don't want to go to bed angry!\\") and a couple of tired comic turns as a klutz who keeps making noises dropping things when silence is essential), but it's Jolie who holds our attention more. She sizzles and smolders and her eyes speak volumes; this lady hardly needs words to communicate with eyes like hers. But the movie is almost stolen by Vince Vaughn as John's colleague Eddie, a loser who still lives with his mother because she's the only woman in the world he can trust, even while he yells at her for keeping tabs on him. An assassin and a momma's boy? Hilarious -- and as unlikely as the rest of the film. The movie hits total disbelief through the final gun battle with their firms' combined hit team, in which John and Jane take out every agent with a minimum of fuss and bother, while the hit team acts like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. Well, hey, it's only a movie.<br /><br />When all is said and done, \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" treats us to two hot actors in very nice performances, lots of comedy, loads of action, and not a whole lot else. It doesn't demand anything out of you except to suspend belief and enjoy the ride.

0375507256|4.0|I started this book months ago and would not have returned to it but a friend pointed out that there are different narratives so I thought I'd slog through the journals of a tedious notary in the 18th-century on a Pacific island to get to the next bit... <br /> <br />well, this is the book's charm and also its downfall.  The several sections (each interrupted at a high point and then continued later on, which both adds excitement and is also maddly irritating) are mystically connected-- that is, following Ewing's journal, we meet Mr. Frobisher, a rake-composer in 1931 who has wangled himself into the position of secretary to a world famous British composer-- and Frobisher is reading Ewing's journals.  He's writing letters to his friend Sixsmith, and Sixsmith is a character in the next section, which is a mystery corporate thriller about a woman named Luisa Rey. <br /> <br />All of the sections capture the genre they ape perfectly.  You have to admire a writer this versatile.  And Mitchell is wrestling with big themes about humanity and its tendency to war or to civilization (he wraps this up with a big bow on the last page, actually). <br /> <br />But, I found the central and most crucial section, a post-apocalyptic world narrated by a simple goatherd in dialect (crossin', for example; in the future apparently nobody pronounces \\"g\\" anymore) incredibly exasperating and hard to slog through. <br /> <br />OK, so there will be, and always has been, tension in the human race between the will to destroy and the will to create.  Yeah, and?  There's a recurring comet-shaped birthmark that several characters have, suggesting that this is all the story of one person incarnated many times... an interesting idea, never really ddeveloped. <br /> <br />As a dystopian warning, the book falls a little flat, although the scifi section about a clone (\\"fabricant\\") is particularly exciting.  I visited Korea recently and can see why Mitchell would choose Seoul as the capital of a worldbased on international corporate conglomerates.  Much of the book takes place in the Pacific; why, I'm not sure.  I feel that I missed a lot of what Mitchell was getting at... but feel little impulse to reread. <br /> <br />It's an enjoyable yarn, certainly, and once immersed I didn't want to put it down.  Still, I doubt I'd be rushing to read another book of his... I prefer to go deeper into one narrative than for narratives to play on each other this way.

If only I could have read it thirty years ago when I was struggling to reconcile reason and religion, it would have given me the knowledge, strength and insight to counter the bleatings of the theists around me and make my stand for atheism easier. Let those who cling to the uncivilising behaviour of religion demand all the respect they like for their irrational views, they will no longer get any from me. If only every child was required to read this along side of reading the bible and the koran, then perhaps we can be rid of this god nonsense in a generation or so.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|As an Meteoroglist with many years of experience the idea of global warming is a recurring part of the cycle of earth. This has occurred many times in the past. Alarmist include Al Gore doesn't take in account the history of climate change over decades instead of just a few years from the 1970's. This year was suppose to the be worst hurricane season ever, what happened. The Gulf and Atlantic oceans were warmer than usual but the Pacific Ocean was colder. That equals balance. Sure man has changed the climate a bit but not as bad as Al Gore wants you to believe. The polar ice caps have melted but warmer temperatures cause more rain over these regions which replace the ice cap. This is anothe cycle of earth. This video is nothing more than polical crap, just like Al Gore invented the internet.
B000GY729M|2.0|Let me preface this review by stating that I am not a fan of the Killers mostly for reasons of their style and approach. I find the band- much like groups such as Interpol, the Bravery, and Franz Ferdinand- self-absorbed and abrasively irritating in their rehashing of the past (i.e: the 80s synthpop and post-punk/british jingle bands) and selling it to 16-20 year old alternative girls. In all honesty, my opinion is that the Killers are nothing but Ultravox without the talent with a bit of pathetic Robert Smith/Midge Ure aping in one Brandon Flowers thrown in for good measure- from what I have gathered, Mr. Flowers has taken his megalomania to new heights, aping the Boss, Springsteen himself. Being a fan of 80s new wave/post punk, I find the Killers and bands like them not so much a fun \\"homage\\" as I do an insult to intelligence and taste.    That being said, I must admit that there are worthwhile moments on their sophomore effort Sams Town. I can slightly agree with the U2 references everyone picks up on, but I believe there are a few other influences coming through on the record. While the heavy John Foxx-era Ultravox influences of Hot Fuss remain, they often take a backseat to vaccuous attempts at Springsteen and 'Joshua Tree' era U2. Besides, listening to Sams Town, it seems the Killers have graduated to Midge Ure-era Ultravox, with Flowers' vocals being so obviously lifted from Midge that its audacity is insulting. The lyrics are so empty and self-important in their attempt to present slices of \\"Americana\\" and everyday life that I often found myself splitting my time between chuckling and cringing- good examples are the first single, 'When You Were Young,' which truth be told, I found enjoyable, but more or less a sad attempt at aping 'Mr Brightside.'     The influence of Flood and Alan Moulder are apparent on the eponymous title track, and on the more epic tracks, as the strings are highly reminiscent of the Smashing Pumpkins' 'Tonight, Tonight,' (produced andmixed by the pair)- the wall of sound in the introduction of Sams Town is impressive and \\"epic\\" in every sense, yet the music- like the majority of the record- is pedestrian and runs out of steam before ever leaving the starting gate. More often somber and meandering than passionate, the Killers musical section seems more bored than anything else. Like the Pumpkins' Mellon Collie, Sams Town wants to be huge and ridiculously over-the-top but still relevant. Where the Pumpkins succeeded on every level, the Killers stumble over themselves and fail.     With the follow-up single, 'Bones,' the band gives an \\"interesting\\" attempt at melding glammy Roxy Music with 'Head on the Door'-era Cure (i.e: the 'Close to Me' horns).     'For Reasons Unknown,' if given more work, had promise. However, like every song, it has embarrassing lyrics ('I look a little bit older/' I feel a little bit colder') that are downright dumb and seem reaching to \\"say\\" something, but ends up saying nothing at all.    The vocals are something I see alot of people complaining about on the Amazon boards. Now I'm no Mensa member, but I know that warbling eccentric cry anywhere, and yes, that mouth usually has bright red ill-applied lipstick on it. Throughout the album, Flowers gives the listener his best Robert Smith impression through his deliberately cracked/wannabe cutesy \\"sensitive guy\\" vocals.     Musically, the band seems to be on cruise control here- too many times, the arrangements of the songs are awkward and sound like they were haphazardly thrown together during soundchecks(a good example is 'For Reasons Unknown'). The guitarist sounds just as all these other 80s retro bands' guitarists- and like them, he misses the point of that era of music and the playing; attempting to make his guitar sound quirky and off-kilter, it just sounds flat and is as compelling stylistically as erectile disfunction.     'My List' is downright boring and neutered. Many will defend it by arguing it is \\"atmospheric;'but come on! This is flat and uninspired trash- good atmospheric music in this vein is Ultravox's 'Your Name (Has Slipped My Mind Again).' Eventually, it erupts into a faux-Motown type number that frankly eludes the bands' musical depth (or lack thereof).    I give this album two stars mostly for the Killers' pompous and misdirected attempt at musical growth and \\"maturity.\\" *AHEM* A testament to too-much-too-soon, what results is, whether one likes it or not, an unintentionally entertaining trainwreck of a band that has let its self-importance grow like a cancerous tumour, overshadowing the naive charm it held for their fans in the first place. Please buy an Ultravox album and spay and/or neuter your pompous wannabe 80s retro pretty boy bands.
0307276902|5.0|I just finished reading this amazing book, I have also read some of the comments and publicity is getting from people who don't believe it actually happened. I don't care about other peoples reviews regarding if it happened or not, if it was or wasn't Hazelden, I thought it is well written in a new and refreshing way, it is inspirational, and it shows that it can be done no matter what, if you want to stay sober you just do it, against all odds. The only thing I did not agree with the author is that part when he goes into a bar and asks for a whiskey and then throws it away, he shouldn't have exposed himself in that way. But other than that it is amazing!<br /><br />I really wish I could meet him in person and have him give a speech about recovery in a local clinic that I help out at.<br /><br />It is a courageous story and through out the book I kept saying...Go! Go! You can do it!<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone trying to stay sober and find an example of a good struggle and fight with ones feelings and emotions.<br /><br />When someone writes from within, true feelings come out, I believe the author wrote well from within himself and is proof that feelings are the ones that should be exposed during a rehabilitation process, because feelings are the ones that have to be worked on for someone to be sober. If only the exterior is exposed, relapse tends to come along.<br /><br />James Frey: My admiration for you!! You are living proof that it can be done!
0307237699|5.0|Senator Barak Obama's poignant look at America is refreshing.  His collection of thoughts on politics, life and values is substantial as well as simulating.  I believe `Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream' is a complete review of his campaign platform for running for President 2008 - the table of contents is a dead give-away: Ch. 1: Republicans & Democrats, Ch. 2: Values, Ch. 3: Constitution, Ch. 4: Politics, Ch. 5: Opportunity, Ch. 6: Faith and so on.<br /><br />Sen. Obama, a former president of the Harvard Law Review, does an outstanding job at articulating and bolstering his opinion on race relations, immigration, education and international policy, just to name a few.  He provides an academic-like review of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and how they apply to the political issues of today.<br /><br />Everyone would appreciate his candidness in his evaluation of the current state of politics: \\"The fact is, close to five years after 9/11 and fifteen years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the United States still lacks a coherent national security policy.  Instead of guiding principles, we have what appear to be a series of ad hoc decisions, with dubious results.\\" (p.302)<br /><br />Why be opposed to Reclaiming the American Dream?  Certainly it would be better than the nightmare we are living now.
B0007VZ9DU|5.0|This movie is one of the great masterpieces of the 1990's. The script is full of great lines, even the narration running through the first hour is a wonder of writing. The way in which 1970's Vegas is captured is unsurpassed - the look of the famous 'Strip' from those days has to be seen to be believed. And the acting is way above anything else in this genre. The fact that the movie was filmed inside an actual Vegas casino dating from the '70s just before it was demolished (the Riviera) helps take the film above the 'movie-look' and into the realm of a documentary. The believablilty is incredible. These characters are real and the world they inhabit is a real one. <br /> <br />This is surely one of the milestones in movie history ... a movie that treats its 'adults only' audience like adults. Sure there's gore everywhere and over-the-top swearing every 5 seconds, but this is not a pretty world we're peering into. If only more movies were made with the same realism. As my dear old Dad said after I played the DVD to him, 'I feel like I've run a marathon after watching that!'
0895260131|1.0|I picked this book up in a local Borders and after opening it up to a random page and scanning it my skin literally started to crawl.  That said I sat down and began to skim through various other parts of the book thinking to myself that it was like a car crash on the other side of the freeway.  It's disgusting, but you can't help yourself so you look anyway.  This book makes gross generalizations and is terribly biased.  The hardest part for me personally to bear was that parts of it weren't total lies.  There was enough facts to make the semi-untruths seem like complete and total facts.  It just doesn't tell the entire truth nor does it put anything in context.  Does it even mention that in the Qur'an it is explicitly stated that it is the duty of Muslims to protect People of the Book (Jews & Christians)? No.  Instead it focuses on what will sell books:  the opinion that Islam is dangerous, bloodthirsty and violent.  To me these claims can be made for almost any religion (including, unfortunately, my own)except Jainism if you take the right facts out of context and push them together all in one shiny pretty cover.  For the most part the book is filled with misleading half truths, lies and throughout the entirety complete bigotry at worst or at best a lack of objectivity.<br /><br />Other reviewers are stating that this book is great and glorifying it as what the west should know about the \\"real\\" Islam.  To trust them I would have to forget my entire higher education (I have a B.A. in religious studies, and focused on Islam as well the far East).  Do yourself a favor and do NOT use this book as a credible source in an open-minded search for information on Islam.  If your goal is to find out about Islam then check out Seyyed Hossein Nasr's book or Reza Aslan's newer book on the subject.  If what you are trying to find out is why and how individuals use religion (including all of the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam) to validate and fuel their own hate against the other and then go on to commit terrorist acts I would recommend the stellar book \\"Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence\\" by Mr. Mark Juergensmeyer which examines the subject quite well.<br /><br />I realize that at this point and time it is not fashionable to defend Islam and that it is quite fashionable to vilify it.  I urge everyone not to make judgments about the whole of Islam because of the beliefs and actions of a fanatical few.  Learn the facts first.  Back those facts up with credible sources from scholars on the subject (which is something this book fails to do).  Then and only then make your judgments.  You may find that you will be surprised by the outcome of your research.ate against the other and then go on to commit terrorist acts I would recommend the stellar book \\"Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence\\" by Mr. Mark Juergensmeyer which examines the subject quite well.

B00003CWTI|3.0|<br />The movie opened with 3 curious incidents of coincidence in the past. The first hour then unfolded the backgrounds of 2 dying men, his daughter, a policeman, his son, a nurse, their wives and 2 prodigy at TV quiz show.  <br /> <br />The second hour saw the important decisions these people made. At one point, the camera shifted to and fro among 6 (or more) stories against a pulsating music background. The pace and grip closed in, leading the audience to yearn for more. The heavyweight character actors executed their parts beautifully and the shots were well-sequenced, successfully building up an atmosphere of urgency, I found Julianne Moore at the pharmacy store a mesmerizing performance. She was so beautiful yet cold, quiet yet restless, until her sudden outburst of spitting venom bespoke her guilt-ridden state.  <br /> <br />The last hour wrapped up only after a bizarre natural disaster, forcing the characters to a closure and a reflection of their chaotic lives. Without the improbable disaster, it would not be convincing that these people, all suffer from a relationship crisis, would alter their paths, heading for a better future. <br /> <br />There is just a fine line between stories of clichés-pretensions and sincerity. Even more difficult to cook all these stories in the same pot and still make sense. Nowadays books and movies (Clash, Babel, Friends with money) choose to dart from one short story to another on relationships which are supposed to be subtly related. Not all come off with a success though. At least this movie can be given the benefit of the doubt of being original and it displayed sincerity as well as good directing. Yes, the movie can be slow at some point but it had its gripping moments. It had thus gained enough momentum to drive the story to a more than satisfying ending.
B000092ZYX|4.0|This album has a good balance to it. It contains elements from most of their previous albums, and somehow blends together quite well. My favorite tracks are \\"2+2=5\\", \\"Go to Sleep\\", \\"There,there\\", and \\"A Punch-Up at a Wedding.\\" \\"A Punch-Up at a Wedding\\" is definitely one of the best songs they've even written, and \\"Go to Sleep\\" is awesome as well. I'd give this album 4 stars just for those 2 alone.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of all the electronic stuff, so Kid A and Amensiac aren't my favorite albums, and some of these songs contain too much electronic fakery. \\"Sit Down. Stand Up.\\" would be a killer song except of the very end, where the techno kicks in and the annoying repetition of \\"Raindrops\\" keep going and going and going...<br /><br />Tracks that aren't too great are \\"I Will\\", \\"The Gloaming\\" and \\"Myxomatosis\\", the latter of these sound something like Beck would write in 1996.<br /><br />All in all, this is good album, but I wouldn't recommend this one for someone who wants to get into Radiohead for the first time. Buy OK Computer and the Bends. You won't be disappointed.
B000HCPU0Q|5.0|I'll come right out and say it -- I'm obsessed with the Clash.  They're my favorite band of all time and I own almost every song they ever recorded (and quite a few bootlegs, too).  Now, I do have the Clash on Broadway box set, but other than that, don't have any of the other crappy record company compilations (e.g., Story of the Clash).  Those are not comprehensive, usually out of order, and always lacking.  However, I do have Super Black Market Clash, but that's far from a record company compilation, as it was an expansion on the Black Market Clash B-sides collection that came out in 1980 while they were still together. <br />That being said, I immediately jumped on the opportunity to place this little goody at the top of my Christmas list.  Sure enough, it's exceeded my expectations.  The packaging is beautiful; each single comes in a sleeve with the original artwork, with a slip cover inside just like a real record.  As icing on the cake, each CD is all black (even on the bottom) and the top has lines that look like the ridges of a record, and the original label is in the center.  Even The Cost of Living EP, which originally had an opening flap (and inner artwork) is exactly like the EP itself.  Wow. <br />Minor complaints (from the obsessed fan): I'm not sure why all the sleeves open on the top, rather than on the right like most record covers (not that this is important at all, but if they're going to all the trouble to make it look so real, it strikes me as odd). The 44-page booklet is really pretty, but lacks any real substance.  It is interesting, however, to see what some artists have to say about Clash singles (each single has its own page with a quote from someone in the music industry). <br />All in all, I think this is a great idea.  Sure, record companies are evil and they are in this only for the money, but if you are a huge Clash fan, this should be worth it.  But I wouldn't recommend it to Clash newcomers or even normal fans -- it's not worth the money if you wouldn't like something like this.  But then again, I don't think this is catered toward anyone but the huge fans...I think it'd be a waste for anyone else.
B000000W8C|5.0|If you know of the Verve as the \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" song and the Urban Hymns album, then you're definitely missing out on what the Verve is all about. A Northern Soul is in many ways, even better than Urban Hymns. Soul hads a slightly harder sound, with songs like \\"A New Decade\\",\\"This is Music\\", the title track \\"A Northern Soul\\", and \\"No Knock on My Door\\". But the album also contains ballads like the excellent \\"On Your Own\\" and \\"So It Goes\\". It also contains a song that sounds a lot a track from Urban Hymns, which is \\"History\\". It also contains a few songs that sound a lot like A Storm in Heaven, their debut album, these being \\"Stormy Clouds\\", \\"Life's An Ocean\\", and \\"Drive You Home\\" All in all, the album has the right balance of sound, and at times, it's simply amazing. The album does have a weak song or two, one of which is \\"Drive You Home\\" But one of the best things I like about this album is being able to understand most of the lyrics. In their previous albums, the lyrics are echoed out and tough to hear, but A Northern Soul is much better, with Richard Ashcroft's lyrics coming to the front of the music.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Turn off your computer and go to your nearest movie theatre and go see Rocky Balboa RIGHT NOW!! This is a beautiful, inspiring, and touching film I have ever seen in a long time. I love Rocky and I love the Rocky movies. This is great work Mr. Stallone has put in the movie. Rocky's friends are mostly gone. The only ones left are his son, and Paulie. But, this man's heart and soul keeps going forward no matter what the obstacles are. I tell you what, I never been this emotional at a movie theatre since Passion of the Christ.
B000089RVX|5.0|One seldom hears such brute force served up at the same time with such tenderness. To know what you want to sound like on your first CD with such power and grace is truly amazing. I love all the songs but My Immortal touches the deepest of them all and Going Under is great too. I'll say about Evanescence what someone else said about Lucinda Williams - just when you think you've been through every human emotion possible Amy Lee comes along and plows up a whole new field.You can feel her breath on the back of your neck. If you're reading the book Twilight this would be a great soundtrack to it.
B00005JPE7|4.0|6th instalment and deffently one of the better ones,Takes it back too basics and the underdog match up that is so common in the series.With a possitive message(theme) of beating the odds and rising too the challenge. <br /> The wife is gone(\\"womans canser),his son is grown and working for a company,Rocky ownes a restraunt that's named after his wife.Every chance he gets ,he lives in the past:giving way too a lot of flash backs.Living in the past gives way too a need too feed the beast and get back in the ring.So he reapplies,is rejected and then accepted back into the world of boxing.Which in the meantime is dominated by a non-popular champion,Masion\\"the line\\"Dixison.Who has deffend his crown ,and perfect record yet again.The sporting world powers that be decide too do a computer generated match of Rocky in his prime vs Masion.Rocky's image wins and makes the Dixison camp popularity even worse then it is.When they find out Rocky is back in the game they imedetly challenge him too a exhibition match.Thus sets the layout ,training ,music for the rest of the film.Which was a little bit of a surpise too me.With its ending and the feel it is a deffent through back too the movie that started the series 30years ago.And anyone whos a fan of Rocky or sports movies shouldn't be disapointed.The movie closes with regular people running the steps Rocky ran way back when(and in this movie one last time)-nice touch. The real world of boxing is refered too quite a bit ,even Iron Mike makes a cameo-rooting for the champ ofcourse.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine is the story of a dysfunctional family who embark on a road trip to get their homely daughter to The Little Miss Sunshine contest across the country.  The story takes many twists and turns and has a great ending.  This movie isn't hilarious but it is definetly entertaining and worth a watch.  You will enjoy a few laughs and follow a great story line.  This is an original movie and I highly suggest you put it on your to-watch list.
B000FC2FVA|5.0|Well folks, this is a long overdue review of a record that needs its rightful recognition.  Simply put, this should be the album of the year for 2006 (not \\"Return To Cookie Mountain\\" by TV On The Radio).  This disc is packed full of the kind of rhythms and melodies that will keep you going back to it year after year.  \\"It's Never Been Like That\\" is one of those rare albums that are great from beginning to end.  I am a (still young) high school teacher and have played some of the songs for a few students and they've all reacted positively to what they heard.  Questions like why don't they play Phoenix on the radio? and do they have other records? were being asked.  As a teacher, I have summer months off from work and I travel to Italy for most of the summer.  \\"It's Never Been Like That\\" quickly became the soundtrack of the summer for my wife and I.  I highly recommend this album and feel confident that you won't be disappointed.  As always, allow every album the opportunity to grow on you and I promise you that this album will be one that you keep going back to year after year.<br />Getting back to my comment about \\"Return To Cookie Mountain\\"...  I am personally startled that this disc by TV On The Radio is as highly praised by critics and fans as it is.  I commented that you should allow an album to grow on you in order to fully understand it and appreciate it, but after more than 10 times listening to \\"Return To Cookie Mountain\\", I an still wondering how it is possible that quality albums like \\"It's Never Been Like That\\" could get overshadowed by that album.<br /><br />ENJOY PHOENIX!!!
6305558167|1.0|This review is a warning. Do NOT subject yourself to this movie. In Excalibur, the often mind-numbingly awful filmmaking of John Boorman (Zardoz, folks) reaches a nauseating peak. At a running time of approximately 14,000 hours, it is a bloated misfire of epic proportions, being simultaneously horrible, boring, laughable, and way too long. It's as though the production started out with grand, epic intentions, and then Boorman decided \\"hey let's find the worst actors ever, give them the worst lines ever, write the most retarded script ever seen, and then spend 75% of the budget on LSD.\\" Honestly, Monty Python did a far better job of portraying the King Arthur legend. It is really too much of a strain to go into any great detail about exactly WHY this movie blows so much, but please take my word for it. The acting is weirdly ineffective and dense (as is often the case with Boorman). This is partly the fault of the dialogue, which always seems to be hinting at some higher meaning, but in reality it's just pretentious fluff. The main characters are weak, unlikable, and usually look pretty stupid in their goofy outfits (Mordred has to be seen to be believed). Take King Arthur himself for example. Nigel Terry is so painfully un-tough in the role that he makes Winnie the Pooh look like a Hell's Angel. Another one is Merlin, who could have been such a cool character but ends up being this creepy weirdo that nobody would want hanging around in reality. You end up hating them all so much you really don't care if they get killed. In fact you may even take some giddy pleasure in watching them get picked off one by one. The strongest performance is delivered by the inanimate piece of metal that serves as Excalibur itself. One need only bear witness to what may be the most apalling scene in movie history to sum up this movie. Of course I'm talking about the full armor rape scene, complete with roaring flames and full choral accompanyment. Hideously awkward to watch no matter whoyou're with, it's best to just laugh nervously and fast forward through it. To make matters worse, the filming is consistently dark and creepy, and only serves to make the proceedings even more bizarre. It's like one of those demented nightmares where nothing makes sense and everything looks weird too. It makes being a knight of the round table seem about as attractive as gargling sand.    The first time I saw Excalibur I was almost fooled into thinking it was a good movie. The danger is that it tricks you into thinking it's a great movie if you're not careful. It sneaks up on you, because the beginning is not all that terrible. Then it just goes on and on and on and on, getting stupider and stupider like General Hospital or something, and you start to realize \\"wow I really don't care how this ends, but hopefully they'll all die.\\" It wouldn't be nearly as bad if it didn't take itself so incredibly seriously. There isn't a single glimpse of humor anywhere. Anyway, I've said enough. It's not that the special effects are dated or that I just \\"don't get it.\\" The problem with Excalibur is that it's just a really bad movie in every way. I'm quite certain that many people are going to consider this review a mean-spirited affront to a \\"great\\" film. If I cared, you could take comfort in my sympathetic laughter. Just don't say I didn't warn you about Excalibur.
B000A88F22|1.0|The new breeds of celebrity are completely lost to the concept of \\"Less is More.\\"<br /><br />Do any of you know who Cary Grant was?  Handsome, debonair, classy, sophisticated, talented.  And the reason Cary Grant is still thought of as all those things was...he wouldn't show his face in public unless he was Cary Grant.<br /><br />Look at Elvis Presley.  Elvis was so reclusive that when he did appear as a grotesquely overweight and incoherent version of himself, nobody really saw it.  They still saw the \\"image\\" of Elvis until well after he died--and some people still don't see anything less!<br /><br />So now you have Britney & Kevin.  Britney is a big pop princess, a jailbait songstress, a sex symbol to young and old.  She marries a lump, a wannabe rapper who abandons his kids and for whatever baffling and mysterious reasons believes he has something to offer the world.  Fine.  The world has survived (so far) Yoko Ono...but, Britney, YOU DON'T VIDEOTAPE the most embarrassing parts of your life and expect the fans to adoringly lap it up.<br /><br />Less is more.
B000068FUS|3.0|I love DBT!!  That being said, this disc marks a turn in direction for the band, and the turn ain't too smooth.  There are some gems here- check out \\"Dead Drunk and Naked\\"-- classic Patterson Hood.  But overall, I feel the song writing is sub par, and frankly, disc 2 is just poor. <br />Personally, I would pick up the other 5 cd's prior to this one.  If you really love the band after that, you might wanna try to find this one on the cheap somewhere.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|The Donner Cut of Superman II is decidedly different in tone from Lester's original version, and sometimes that's good and sometimes it's not. <br /> <br />Here's what's good: <br /> <br />1.  Hearing John Williams' music rather than Ken Thorne's adapted music is a welcome change.  Thorne's orchestration never quite captured the majesty of one of John Williams' best scores, and even though the music doesn't quite play up to the drama of what you're seeing on the screen during some moments, it's still better than what we've been listening to for 25 years. <br /> <br />2.  The Marlon Brando scenes really add much to this film, and represent the most significant difference between the two versions.  Jor-El really does shame his son (much more than in the original version with Supes talking to his mother), but the final appearance of Brando is incredibly powerful and moving.  This is the reason to see this version. <br /> <br />3.  Seeing alternate camera angles showing familiar takes of scenes brought this movie much more to life -- a wise choice.  It's the same scenes, the same performances, but for those familiar with Superman II, it's just nice seeing something a little different. <br /> <br />Here's what's not so good: <br /> <br />1.  The Donner cut might be a little too tightly edited -- there are character moments from the Lester version (particularly the Clifton James performance) that are just so ingrained from years of watching this film that the absences are jarring.  Sometimes, the film seemed to be trying too hard to stay tight. <br /> <br />2.  Supes \\"interfering with human history\\" by reversing time at the end, while it would obviously have been different had Donner had a chance to finish the film initially, seemed unnecessary -- and for what it's worth (SPOILER ALERT) -- the threat of Zod and company is left in place with the ending on this film.  Also, the diner finale doesn't really make sense left in the film. <br /> <br />3.  It really looks like Luthor is being killed when the Fortress of Solitude meets its ultimate fate!  Also, why would Superman bother to destroy the Fortress when he was just going to go back in time and revert back to events before Zod and company were released? <br /> <br />4.  In Lester's version, the scene where Superman's identity is revealed had a lot more depth (and a fine performance by Margot Kidder) -- I'll never be tossing my copy of the Lester version for this scene alone.  It was goofy, but it had something special about it. <br /> <br />This is not the complete picture of what Donner would have delivered had he been able to finish the film -- we're never going to get that.  This approximation, however, is MOST welcome, and Warner Brothers and all involved should be applauded for finally giving it to us.  Brando's scenes in particular make it worthwhile.  Had Williams been able to score Superman II, I think it would have added immensely to the experience. <br /> <br />If you're a Superman fan, seeing the Donner Cut is a must do.  We don't know what kind of ending they'd have come up with, and I have to suspect that the anti-Lester sentiment by those involved with this cut might have made the editing more harsh than it might have been if Donner had been able to finish his film.  But it's a thrill to have finally seen this film we've been wondering about for so many years.  Hats off to those involved, and flip the bird once more to the Salkinds.  That's really what it comes down to in the long run -- all of this should never have happened -- if Supes really could go back in time, he should have told the Salkinds to stick with Donner.  We did.  And after all these years, we've been rewarded.
0345457692|5.0|I am amazed by Richard K. Morgan. This book is pure genius. It works on several layers; as a mystery, as a complex high-tech scifi adventure, as a morality tale and, here's the toughest achievement, as serious thought-provoking literature. This critically acclaimed book more than lives up to the overheated hyperbole. For one thing, the language is very creative. I don't know where Morgan gets his technical vocabulary, he's a liberal arts guy, not a software engineer, but he pulls off the hard science with confidence and flair. He invents a religious philosophy, Quellism, and extends the jargon and nomenclature with great effect. Lockheed-Mitoma, Khumalo nervous system, Envoy training, stunbolt, chain gun, bodies as sleeves, betathanatine, needlecast, reaper cocktail, shard pistol, this book is crammed to the max with cool concepts. The story is complex, I've read it twice and I know I'll discover new a new twist or two when I read it again.<br /><br /> I'm not a big science fiction fan, but I do enjoy good writing in any genre. With this one (first!) novel, Morgan's Altered Carbon has earned its place on the short list of scifi masterworks like Dahlgren, Stand on Zanzibar, Stranger in a Strange Land, and Neuromancer. Well done, sir, well done.<br /><br />Ken Coffman is the author of Hartz String Theory, Steel Waters and other novels.
0440236738|5.0|I've read hundreds of suspense novels, and I think one of the very best writers out there today is Harlan Coben.  Mr. Coben is best known for writing thriller novels filled with a lot of plot twists.  I have read all of Coben's standalone books, and I think that GONE FOR GOOD is probably the best of the bunch.  This book is a real pleasure to read.<br /><br />I won't rehash the storyline of GONE FOR GOOD, which consists of a man slowly discovering the many hidden secrets of his missing brother.  Needless to say, this book has a brilliantly layered plot, and Coben does a great job of revealing one surprise after another as the book progresses.  This book is incredibly fast-paced, and I couldn't read it fast enough.  In many ways, this is the literary equivalent of a Hitchcock movie.<br /><br />GONE FOR GOOD has an abnormally large number of plot twists, and I suspect that some readers will resent being manipulated.  But I enjoy a good surprise, and Coben is one of the few thriller writers out there who does not sacrifice character for plot -- despite the fast pace of the story, I felt that all the major characters were flesh-and-blood people.<br /><br />If you've never tried Coben before, GONE FOR GOOD is a good place to start.  My recommendation is to start with this novel, then try the novel TELL NO ONE, which is almost as good.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|There have only been a few times that music has made this kind of impact on me: <br /> <br />1. Metallica - Kill Em All in '83 <br />2. Slayer - Reign In Blood in '86 <br />3. Jimi Hendrix - Are You Experienced in '89 <br />4. Black Sabbath - Greatest Hits in '90 <br />5. Led Zeppelin - IV in '91 <br />6. Frank Zappa - Hot Rats/Apostrophe in '92 <br />7. Tool - Aenima in '96 <br />8. Medeski, Martin, and Wood - Combustication in '98 <br />9. Tool - Lateralus in '01 <br /> <br />... and now Mastadon - Blood Mountain <br /> <br /> <br />This band has one of the most seamless transitioning of time changes I have heard in a long time.  I can only compare this to great jazz with a side of hardcore... hence my only description for it is jazzcore.  If you are a fan of metal but are tired of the same old distorted power chords being played in the same pattern like a metronome (90% of the garbage out there) then give this disk a listen.  It will take some brain power to hear the real beauty of this album... metal posers who just want to bang their head should go listen to their Disturbed commercial metal because this albums time signatures are outstanding and make all others pale in comparison.
B000816TCY|4.0|I wish I didn't have to remove the battery to charge it, but otherwise it works fine.  I bought this to have a backup when my primary ran out of juice.
B00006RINF|4.0|I bought this album because I heard that it's good and similar to Evanescence. I was not disappointed. Every song had melodic metal in it, which are the type of songs I really like. Cristina Scabbia also has a melodic voice, and Andrea also sings good. The only problem with this album is the lyrics are too repetitive and they should spend more time adding more lyrics instead of constantly repeating the chorus. My favorite song on this album is The Ghost Woman and the Hunter. It's a sad and melodic song. Recommended.
0307277887|4.0|I waited until after the first season of Dexter was over before I read the book. I didn't want to be spoiled for the tv show. <br />I liked the book.  I will be getting the second and third books really soon.
B000063JDE|3.0|I watched this movie tonight and was a little disappointed by the story. I read all of the reviews, looked at the plot line and thought it would be a good movie to watch. I was a little bored through the movie because it traveled kinda slow and was a little disjointed. At times, it was very boring to me. Maybe in it's time when it was made, it probably was a milestone in movie making. It is now outdated with it's story line and \\"director's tricks\\" which made the movie very confusing. It you want to see a movie along this line that also has a \\"mystery\\" to it, see \\"StrangeLand\\".
B00006AUIG|3.0|As a devotee of abandoned asylum websites, I found this film disappointing. The plot is interesting, in a 'what just happened...hang on...rewind that bit...Huh??... way. Make sure smarter people than you are watching the film so they can explain it to you at the end. Loose ends are hangin'. Much more creepy music, use of the site and bizarre camera angles were needed to make this film the best it could be considering that Danvers (was) the most atmospheric old loony bin in New England. I got a bigger chill looking at photographers stills of this grand old building on Opacity.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|I can't say enough about Kapla blocks.  My kids have played with all the usual building toys such as tinker toys, legos, etc.  I started out with the 200 piece set.  Every block is perfectly balanced so kids can make great structures from a very young age.  My kids have had there blocks for probably about 10 years now and we keep adding to the set.  They love building with them and have made some really amazing things.  These blocks are something that could definitely be passed from one generation to the next.  They may look like they are plain and wouldn't be much fun but just wait until your kids start playing with them and see what they can make.  Then they will be hooked!!
B00005JOCU|2.0|Since I never saw the Broadway show that this film is based on, I have no idea if the things I disliked so much about it are from its restructuring as a movie, or from the original stage version.  But here are the reasons I thought it was a mess:<br /><br />1. It was extremely jarring, more than a half-hour into the film, to see characters suddenly burst to song within their real-life situations, as opposed to just in performance. The concept should have started out either as a standard musical, where people sing in character as well as performers, OR they should have done the modern take, where the musical numbers are confined to stage and studio.<br /><br />2. This blah-blah-blah about it is The Supremes, but it's not The Supremes, is nonsense.  It obviously IS intended to be about the real group, but some of their facts are wrong, to the point of being downright nasty toward Diana Ross. If you listen to their early recordings, it is only Diana's voice that stands out uniquely, and that talent, ALONG with her looks, personality, and style propelled her to the front. There was no other gift to the extent of \\"Effie's\\" among the other Supremes. To insinuate that \\"Deena Jones\\" rode to stardom solely as a \\"product\\" based on her looks is truly a fantasy.<br /><br />3. Beyonce Knowles is terrible!<br /><br />4. Yes, Jennifer Hudson is good, but her character is dreadfully one-dimensional, annoying, and over-written. Isn't the script called \\"Dreamgirls\\"?  It could have been a take-off on \\"Funny Girl\\": call it \\"Effie Girl\\".  Way too much screen time devoted to her storyline made the focus lop-sided.<br /><br />5. In yet another inconsistancy, more than three-quarters into the film, James Thunder Early (Eddie Murphy) gets a song rejected and instantly becomes a drug addict, dying from an overdose within the next few minutes!  There was absolutely no build-up to this, but that's kind of OK with me, since Murphy's character was also already blown-up beyond the subject of the movie.  Speaking of no bulid-up, who was the woman who instantly popped up to sing at Thunder's wake?<br /><br />6. The songs are awful, nothing but hook-lines. I ask people who love the music from this show to sing even ONE song half-way thru, but all they can remember are the chorus tags: \\"We're your dreamgirls!\\"...\\"One night only!\\"...\\"And I'm telling you I'm not going!\\"...\\"I've got a Cadillac!\\"  No melody lines or meaningful lyrics beyond that.<br /><br />I'm now going to go enjoy my Diana Ross and The Supremes box set.  Ah, sweet reality!!!s the woman who instantly popped up to sing at Thunder's wake?    6. The songs are awful, nothing but hook-lines. I ask people who love the music from this show to sing even ONE song half-way thru, but all they can remember are the chorus tags: \\"We're your dreamgirls!\\"...\\"One night only!\\"...\\"And I'm telling you I'm not going!\\"...\\"I've got a Cadillac!\\"  No melody lines or meaningful lyrics beyond that.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I am 60 years old so I have been watching TV for a long time. No series ever has come close to The West Wing for intelligence, wonderful writing, wit, and respect for the audience.  I got this collection as a Christmas gift and even though I probably know most of the episodes by heart, I will enjoy every one of them over and over.  In the days of George Bush and his minions showing how bad a leader can be, we still have Jed Bartlet to show us there could be another way to do it. Too bad life doesn't imitate art.
B000F39MAG|5.0|It is hard to understand why american opera fans a so far behind the world's theatrical scene - this is an fascinating, very well played and sung production (No need to praise Gruberovas Elisabetta here).   <br /> <br />The old-fashioned plunder we see on most US-opera stages today is- alas !-the taste of the old ladys who support the opera houses. The next generation should develop a better feeling for art on stage.
B0002STNQ2|3.0|This novel is about nano-technology and a group that creates nano-robots that can perform actions as a whole, unfortunately they turn on their owners and thus the thriller part of this book. <br /> <br />As a whole, I love most all of Crichton's work, and while I enjoyed this one I think it was lacking a lot. First, how many novels/movies have a plot where a robot is given artificial intelligence and then turns on the owner??? The only thing that makes this one unique is that it is nano-robots that work as a team and evolve. Second, I love reading Crichton novels because while entertaining, I also feel that I learn something new each time. In Prey, he glossed over the technical stuff way too much by barely going into distributed processing and nanotechnology. Now he may have done lots of research for this novel but it didn't show this time. <br /> <br />It was still an entertaining book that I finished in just two days because of its addictive nature but coming from Crichton I expected better.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Many reviewers here have already mentioned the sound quality and the magical remix tour which I totally agree.  Some of you have mixed opinion on the cut-and-paste results that I also agree.  Some work some don't.  But one thing came to my mind is that this collection gives special attention to John's songs.  The album title came from his song \\"All You Need Is Love\\" or simply \\"Love\\" from his solo period.  His songs open and end the set.  And yes, he got more quota than any other including Paul.  George got his usual 2 songs per album and in this case a double album so it's 4.  Ringo got 1.  This is not to say that's the way it should be or John and Paul MUST get balanced treatment, or it's the show's soundtrack so there's nothing to do with quota.  Only a pity that Paul deserves better and we know he's sensitive about it.  Think about Abbey Road with its excellent side B, there's none of Paul's song listed here but John got 4.  <br /> <br />There's no right and wrong.  It's just an observation.
0156030209|5.0|Life of Pi was simply an amazing novel. It packs so much in that it is astounding. The first section of the book deals with the Pi's struggles growing up and exploring many different religions. The second part of the book (the bulk of it) is the primary part of the storyline where Pi ends up on the boat with the tiger. While the first section was thought provoking, the second was even more so in seeing what Pi would do to sustain his life and trying to place yourself in the same position and deciding what would you do if placed in a similar circumstance. The ending of the book brings a surprising twist that I won't reveal here, lets just say it does not disappoint and only leaves the reader questioning even after the last page is read. <br /> <br />This is truly a remarkable read and in my opinion an instant classic that will be read for years to come.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Since the end of the WW2 the bounds between science and power have been tightened. And although the perspective which the common citizen respect the science has experienced notables changes in the last six decades, the disillusion, hopeless and fear possibly have not been more dramatic than at this historical moment.<br /><br />But the warnings sent by the nature, simply are ignorant of any sort of agreement; the mankind has surpassed the ethical boundaries and the environment simply has reacted according the well known principle of action and reaction established by Newton.<br /><br />It' s time to realize we cannot shirk our moral and ethical responsibilities and beyond all the coziness the technology has provided us, there has been an usurpation of permissible limits that mirror a distorted conception respect the limits of our own growth. Moreover, the core of this global issue doesn't fall back over us as citizens, and admit there has been a considerable of silent scientists who have foreseen what' s going on and nevertheless, have decided to make silence due to unconceivable reasons. The possession of knowledge carries a moral obligation.<br /><br />So what we will watch in this dramatic movie is just the iceberg' s point  of considerable magnitude that is challenging with threatening celerity. The derived consequences o this misconception of the progress will work out (as it actually is happening) as a sinister boomerang that attacks without any sort of consideration or geopolitical zones. A typhoon, a tornado, a sudden increase of the pluviometric level or its correspondent drought due the gradual displacement of the normal distribution of rains, are undeniable facts and the enormous number of causes such as the visible increase in the levels of CO2 , the overpopulation and the countless catalogue of crucial and incidental factors that fall into the actual state of things demands from us, effective solutions.<br /><br />But the billion dollars question stands out is: Will enough politics will exist and necessary universal agreement to face this huge challenge even if it implies the required confiscation of certain human rights and inherent legal restrictions concerned with the individuals liberties, contained into the same entrails of the democracy ?<br /><br />Because when the mankind's surviving is in that irreversible point of no return, perhaps we will have to derogate and overlook certain formal and real liberties in order to achieve that superior aim. But will the human beings be fully prepared to become aware this dilemma ?will exist and necessary universal agreement to face this huge challenge even if it implies the required confiscation of certain human rights and inherent legal restrictions concerned with the individuals liberties, contained into the same entrails of the democracy ?

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore at his best.  I did not vote for him because he was too conservative for me, but he is doing a great service to the world with his quest to inform  the public about the danger facing us with climate change.

B00006RAKP|5.0|More than thirty years ago I was walking down Doheny Boulevard in LA, made a try for Sunset and ended up walking into the Troubador where they were featuring a virtually unknown UK singer pianist named Elton John. He was surprisingly taut and sculptured then and he had the round rimmed rawhide colored glasses on. Man when I heard him sing Your Song, one of his signature tunes since then and on this cd, I couldn't get over the unique and positively brilliant aspect of his compositions. I had no knowledge at the time of his writing partnership with Bernie Taupin and ofcourse no possible ability to forecast Elton's sheer dominance of the music business nor his eventual outrageousness on stage, fights and controversies and uncomprable density of near perfect work. I just know now what I could not have known back on that LA walk I had in a warm pulsating and euphoric drizzle-rain-Sir Elton is and was always either the best or near there when it comes to emotionally stirring music and enviable musicianship. On this cd, Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002 there are two other memorable selections that I have always found to be touching and introspective, Tiny Dancer and Levon. Taupin's lyrics are very UK and Elton's piano and vocals just make these two entries the types<br /><br />of songs that you never get tired of because they bring out the nostalgia and warmth that all comes within you when you listen to special music. I purchased this cd because at its price point it represented a great value, it never hurts to get the best for less when it comes to buying any media. Don't forget I am one of those cd reviewers who seems to remember the entire career spans of all the artists still touring because at my age, I was there when they started. Based on my appreciable longevity in critiquing music, this cd is one that you must get at the risk of compromising in quality any personal music collection where, for some, reason it is missing.<br /><br />Jay Adler<br /><br />CD Reviewer<br /><br />Massapequa, New York>Massapequa, New York

B00000JGHM|1.0|It's really troubling to see all the reviewers talk about how great Pacino and De Niro are together, when actually there is only one scene they share.<br /><br />Moreover, the two probably were never even on the set at the same time, as the coffee scene is shot in singles and over the shoulders. Now wouldn't any director, if he had the chance (even one as stupid as Michael Mann) die to have at least one shot where we could show these two giants together? So each actor was shot separately with probably a stand-in or the script girl reading the lines of the other.

0380789027|5.0|Neil Gaiman is kinda my hero. This collection of his short stories is amazing.  Several times after reading one of the stories in this collection, I shivered with pleasure at how it seemed to be the perfect ending that pulled it all together. <br /> <br />I don't want to ruin any of the stories with too much summary, but they are generally pretty creepy and fantastical. Just don't expect happy endings. The introduction was actually worth reading and interest (and contained a bonus story). I thought that \\"Changes\\" and \\"We Can Get Them For You Wholesale\\" were particularly good.  A couple of the stories fell flat for me, but the good ones were so perfect they made up for it.  I think that Gaiman's prose is much better than his poetry but that didn't make his poetry bad - just not as good.  Anyway, much worth reading in here.

B000I0QK74|4.0|James Taylor's renditions of classic holiday tunes are as good as anyone's, and when I heard this not too long ago, I discovered something truly wonderful. His version (with Natalie Cole) of the ever-popular duet standard \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" is quite possibly the first (and hopefully not last) version of this song where the female does not make mention of smoking a cigarette.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Wonderful album. I had a friend a few years back who was really into Radiohead, and at that time I picked up 'Pablo Honey' and didn't really like it all that much, so I put it away. A few years later someone on the Genesis forums was talking about how this album by Radiohead, 'OK Computer' was like progressive rock. So I decided, what the heck? I'll pick it up at the record store. So I did. And a great album it was. It was more of a 'down' album than I was used to, but it was still wonderful. I listened to this on a rainy day, driving around, and it added a relaxing and at the same time dramatic soundtrack to that day.    'Airbag' starts out really kicking and brings you into the album with a great drumbeat and some great mellotron and guitar bits, really gets your blood pumping, and leads you into track two, 'Paranoid Android' which is a really good track that alternates between really fast and upbeat rock parts, and slower moodier sections. Other standout tracks on this album include 'Subterranean Homesick Alien' which has a nice atmosphere to it, 'Let Down' which is a nice slow tune with some soothing vocals, and 'Electioneering' which is much more upbeat and more like the first and second songs, I would assume that this was a single at the time. The album closes with 'Lucky' and 'The Tourist' both of which are very emotional and use a heavy amount of mellotron. These are probably my favourite tracks on here, and close out this wonderful album. Since this is an excellent addition to any prog music collection, I shall give it five stars. :)
B000FA57RG|5.0|I don't understand why this CD is generating so many bad reviews. I agree that people who aren't big Madonna fans probably won't enjoy the documentary...however, why would a non-Madonna fan buy her film anyway?! That makes no sense to me! Anyway, anyone who loves the Material Girl will surely enjoy watching her latest documentary. However, the CD is the best part of this compilation. I've seen Madonna in concert several times, and the Re-Invention World Tour was by far my favorite experience. Live Madonna recordings are few and far between, and the fourteen songs on this CD are of incredible quality and make me want to get up and dance every time I listen to them! In addition to many of Madonna's greatest hits (\\"Vogue,\\" \\"Like a Prayer,\\" \\"Die Another Day\\"), the CD includes a great version of John Lennon's \\"Imagine,\\" which was one of my favorite aspects of the Re-Invention Tour.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that there aren't enough songs on this CD. I am especially disappointed that the version of \\"Material Girl\\" Madonna performed on tour isn't included on the CD, but oh well.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this album is a must for all Madonna fans! I can't wait for the Confessions Tour album to come out in 2007.
B00004XONN|1.0|After picking up 'OK Computer' and really enjoying it, I came on here to see which album I should buy next, and 'Kid A' was the only album in the 'Key Albums' list. That should not be the case. This album made me want to shoot myself or something, the whole thing is paranoid, depressing, and downright scary. Listening to this will make you feel like a mental patient. I got the special edition 2x10\\" vinyl edition for my turntable... I doubt I'll be playing it very much anymore. I really tried to like this album, I really did, but I just can't listen to this anymore or I'll go insane. It's nothing at all like OK Computer, and it's very electronic and experimental, which I don't mind since I'm a fan of a few experimental techno bands, but this whole album had an aura of fear and paranoia surrounding it that I don't want to touch it again. It starts out with 'Everything In It's Right Place' which sounds so scary and closed in or something, and right then you know this is nothing like the previous album. The title track 'Kid A' contains some seriously distorted vocals, and is not a track I'd like to listen to by myself, it's just scary. 'The National Anthem' is more upbeat, but it's just plain annoying and has some very loud and out of tune horn sections on it that really bother me. The only songs that I sort of like on here are 'How To Disappear Completely' and 'Optimistic', both of which are very depressing songs despite the name of the second one, the former of which has a chilling section at the end with Thom humming along with the music. The latter is just a decent pop song. The last side of the album, which contains 'Idioteque' and 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' just finish off the whole paranoid suicidal feeling of the whole album. Finishing this album was like finishing a suicide note. \\"I will see you in the next world\\" are the last lyrics to the album. I pretended to like this. I really tried to like it. But I just can't stomach it anymore. I don't know what kind of masochist would want to listen to such an album, and I can't believe it's listed as the key album here. That one should be 'OK Computer', not this awful thing. 'OK Computer' was a 'down' album, but this one, I don't even know what the hell to call it. Not recommended at all. :(
B00004CZAP|5.0|This movie is SO smart, well acted, and well-written.  Everyone should be forced to watch this movie to see how popular films can be intelligent, sexy, and fun.  Each time that I watch this movie I find a different detail that I previously missed.  It's worth watching several times and it's worth recommending to friends.
B00005B4GU|2.0|After buying the sucidal 'Kid A', I decided to pick up its brother 'Amnesiac' to see if it was any better. Not much. It's just a disjointed and watered down version of 'Kid A', which actually makes it one star better than that one. But still not recommended. I like the opening track 'Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box', it's not as suicidal as the opener of the last album, and it's kind of mesmerising. 'Pyramid Song' is okay, but I don't see what the hype is about. The third track, 'Pulk Pull/Revolving Doors' appeals to me because of my interest in techno. I think it's a really neat song. The next cut, 'You and whose army?' is not great except for the piano ending to the song, which oddly reminds me of the acoustic piano on 'From Genesis To Revelation'. 'Knives Out' is a nice pop song, sort of depressing but alright I guess, it's probably the best one on here. The remake of 'Morning Bell' is not worth bothering with. I didn't like it in the first place, and here it's even worse. 'Like Spinning Plates' is probably the most dramatic piece on here. This one could make me cry. It does have that creepy suicidal feel to it, though, that I'm not too fond of. The closing track 'Life In A Glasshouse' is really weak and doesn't feel like a good closer. This album is not really great, but at least it's not creepy and foreboding like 'Kid A'. It's a lot more loosely put together and the tracks are a lot weaker, which in the case of the Kid A sessions, is probably a good thing.
0143034901|5.0|For fans of gothic fiction and postmodern literature, The Shadow of the Wind's elegant prose and labyrinthian motifs are delightful.  The novel is a classic page-turner, with plenty of twists and turns to keep even a jaded reader hooked.  As most reviewers have pointed out, the book has its share of improbable coincidences, stereotypical characters, and a predictable (and rather stretched) ending, but these flaws ultimately do not overshadow an enjoyable plot and a main character to whom readers can relate.  Book lovers will have a good time with The Shadow of the Wind, especially if it has been awhile since they have become lost in a novel.
0743289412|5.0|This is an excellent book both for fans of Stephen King and for those new to his fiction. Lisey's Story unfolds more gradually than many of Mr. King's other novels but ultimately the reader is rewarded with a race to the finish and I was eventually struck by the usual illness I suffer while reading Stephen King. (The inability to avoid looking ahead a page or 2 to see what happens). Lisey is the widow of Scott Landon, a famous writer in the genre of Stephen King. There are enough allusions at the beginning of the novel to suggest that Scott's upbringing on its best day was highly dysfunctional and that Scott possessed the ability, as do some of Mr. King's other heroes, to pass through the veil of this reality into another world. This world is inviting on one level, but foreboding and malevolent on another. Lisey needs to face these realities of their relationship to move on personally. As the novel develops, it also becomes clear that the past holds the key for Lisey to escape from personal danger as the enigmatic and dangerous Mr. McCool makes an appearance demanding Scott's unpublished work. As Lisey confronts the past and it gradually unfolds, the reader understands the path Lisey must take to escape danger.

0375831002|5.0|When I got to the end of this book, I went back and started over.  I recommend this because the first 40 pages can be a little criptic.  I read it through a second time and loved it, loved it, loved it!!!!  What an amazing piece of literature.  Death is not the evil guy we all think of, he's pragmatic, compassionate, and doesn't always like the job he has.  Read this and enjoy the passionate prose and style.  This is a keeper on my bookshelf.  I can't wait to go back and visit this family time and time again
B000A6CLL0|5.0|They say that stress is the true test of a person's character.  If that be the case, then the crew of the Enterprise acquired more than enough character during the third season, having had far more than their fair share of adversity. <br /> <br />The entire third season is a single arc, begun at the end of the second season and which closes at the beginning of the fourth.  A previously unknown race, the Xindi, have attacked Earth and killed seven million people.  The attack came from the Expanse, an unstable region of space that lets ships in but not out, and where even the laws of physics are sometimes suspended.  The Enterprise's mission: enter the Expanse, find the Xindi, and prevent them from deploying the weapon (the first was only a prototype) that is being designed to destroy Earth entirely. <br /> <br />But the Enterprise crew itself is not entirely united, nor completely fit.  Lt. Reed's security department has been supplemented by a contingent from the Military Assault Command (the MACOs), whose presence (and whose leader) Reed deeply resents.  Commander Tucker's hometown was destroyed in the attack, and he has recurring nightmares about his sister, who was killed.  Commander T'Pol is slowly losing her ability to contain her emotions, a grave (and offensive) affliction for any Vulcan.  And Captain Archer fights to retain his humanity as he is repeatedly forced to cross ethical boundaries (such as torture and piracy) in order to make the Enterprise's mission succeed. <br /> <br />Tucker's and T'Pol's personal struggles drive them together (they are an unlikely couple but most enjoyable to watch) and in their mutual support, they at least are able to cope.  Archer, on the other hand, cannot cope with the monster inside him that the Xindi attack has unleashed.  He has changed, as he himself admits in the fourth season, \\"and not at all for the better.\\" <br /> <br />Although the Xindi arc, the longest in the history of Star Trek, is itself interesting to watchunfold, the third season is also interesting for the character development.  The main characters not only carry out their mission and are almost killed many times along the way, but they also grow as people, so that by the end they share a collective bond to each other that is as strong as those of Kirk's and Picard's Enterprises, and perhaps stronger. <br /> <br />This season, like all others in Star Trek, is not immune from the occasional \\"not-so-great\\" episodes and I prefer not dwell on them, as what makes an episode good or bad is in the eye of the beholder.  If I do find any great fault in the third season, it is that the producers did not full resolve the Xindi arc at the end of this season, but instead sent the Enterprise on a pointless Nazi-timewarp excursion instead (to be resolved at the beginning of the fourth season).  The viewer will eventually see the battered ship and crew arrive home to a victor's and savior's welcome, but that moment of triumph is unsatisfyingly postponed for another day. <br /> <br />All in all, however, a most enjoyable season. <br />

B000IJ79WU|4.0|SUPERMAN II - The Richard Donner Cut, to this reviewer is better than the more recent SUPERMAN RETURNS. This SUPERMAN II is a great companion piece to Richard Lester's directorial version which is a very good film.  It is different yet similar in many ways. But overall, its a great movie and what they restored and presented is an excellent installment to Superman on film.<br /><br />If one thinks about how this may fit in the overall continuity (as what Bryan Singer wanted in SUPERMAN RETURNS) it fits within the context between SUPERMAN I and SUPERMAN II (Richard Lester).  In the Richard Donner cut (sorry, this is a spoiler), Superman uses his \\"Turn-The-Earth-Back-In-Time\\" (as he used in SUPERMAN I ) to repair the destruction caused by the three Phantom Zone criminals (Zod, Ursa, and Non), and even sends them back into the Phantom Zone. So, naturally, in SUPERMAN II (Lester) it would be inevitable that the Phantom Zone criminals escape again because it was meant to happen in the course of Earth's history.<br /><br />SUPERMAN II: The Richard Donner cut is really linked together with SUPERMAN-THE MOVIE (the first film) even to the point of Lex Luthor being indirectly responsible for the escape of General Zod, Non, & Ursa from the Phantom Zone (sorry another spoiler). The opening sequence is different, and the ending is totally different (again being linked to the first film). Lastly, there is a lot more explained plot-wise due in part of the inclusion of the Marlon Brando footage as JOR-EL which is incredible because they had all the footage with the effects all ready in-the-can and ready to be used for the sequel.<br /><br />The film opens with a short video message from Richard Donner thanking fans for the support of his restored vision, and in the \\"Extras\\" on the disc you can tell he has some bitterness towards Richard Lester because he doesn't acknowledge or mention his name other than saying \\"Some 'other' director took over the sequel.\\" However, other people who worked on this resoration do mention Richard Lester as being the director of  the other SUPERMAN II.<br /><br />The film is dedicated, obviously and appropriately, to the memory of Christopher Reeve, and the extra footage and different takes shows how great he was as Superman/Clark Kent. Also, It shows the dynamic chemistry of Margo Kidder/Lois and Christopher Reeve/Clark/Superman which is very much absent in SUPERMAN RETURNS.le who worked on this resoration do mention Richard Lester as being the director of  the other SUPERMAN II. <br /> <br />The film is dedicated, obviously and appropriately, to the memory of Christopher Reeve, and the extra footage and different takes shows how great he was as Superman/Clark Kent.

0807126063|5.0|I read this book based on the recommendation of both Tucker Max, and one of my friends from college, and I couldn't agree with both of them more.  This book is an intriguing look into the mind of John Kennedy Toole.  The characters, especially Ignatius, are all intriguing in their own ways.  This is always one of the first books that I recommend to someone, and I am looking foward to reading it again.
1400082773|5.0|\\"Dreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance\\" is the story of Barack Obama's unusual family background. The son of a white American woman an a black man from Kenya, Obama spent most of his young life in Hawaii, where he was raised by his mother and grandparents. Obama lacked a relationship with his father, who returned to Africa long ago. Throughout his life, Obama struggled to discover his own personal identity. This book is the story of Obama's life from his youth until he begins studying at Harvard Law School. In between that time, he works as a community organizer in Chicago and eventually journeys to Kenya in an attempt to come to terms with his family's past and gain an understanding of his heritage.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much. Obama wrote \\"Dreams From My Father\\" more than ten years ago, so the book gives a clear depiction of his personality and character, both of which developed long before he became such a notable public figure. Although a bit wordy in places, Obama writes very openly and honestly about his personal struggles and experiences. This is an amazing story about history, family, and identity. I think that anyone curious about the young senator from Illinois should pick up a copy of this book and learn more about the man who may very well become our next president. (Barack, if you're reading this, hurry up and announce your candidacy, already!)
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend is amazing.  This album is a must for anybody that listens to music regardless of the genre.  The piano and his voice create a pleasurable listening experience that is often lacking in much of the music that is released today.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|I'm not going to go into detail about the story, because the editorial already does that. Just thought I'd mention, FWIW, that I personally couldn't stand the original Stargate movie or SG-1 series - BECAUSE of the military/action emphasis. I'm more of a Next Generation/Babylon 5/Deep Space 9 fan, and when I started catching episodes of the second season of this in Australia I was rather amazed. This is from the same people? I mean, yes, they lay the Star Trek jargon on with a trowel, and it's inferior to the best ST series, but for my tastes it was a huge improvement over the original SG series, which I didn't enjoy at all. <br /> <br />So there you are -  a positive review - but from someone who didn't like the original series. Make of that what you will (probably a lot of 'this wasn't helpful's, because I dissed the first one :) <br /> <br />I would have given it 3.5 if we could do inbetweenies.
038533348X|5.0|This book is a classic.  I read this book during college, and I have proceeded to read it at least 4 more times.  The entire story highlights the depth of Vonnegut's genius.  It also shows how carried away that man can get with things.  The Ice 9, in my opinion, is a metaphor for the nuclear arms race and MAD.  The characters are sharp, each with their own duty and importance to the story.  I believe that Cat's Cradle is a good as other Vonnegut classics such as Slaughterhouse 5.  I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to read something a little different than what they are used to.  Vonnegut is a genius, and you need to discover why that is so.
1896597890|4.0|I gave this to a teen-aged daughter for Christmas--an odd gift I suppose, and ended up reading it myself straight through, in front of the tree. Perhaps it's not a kid thing. In North Korea's social model we see the ultimate manifestation of the human urge to power and total control. It's dreadfully fascinating.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned Delisle's \\"spare style and gentle humor\\". It's interesting to note the difference in approach between Orwell's works, 1984 which Delisle brings into the country, and Animal Farm. Both of which compared to Pyongyang are as subtle as a brick. Pyongyang being a different form of course, a kind of documentary rather than novel or allegory, Delisle lets the relentless and omnipresent mechanisms of thought and behavior control he encounters mostly speak for themselves.<br /><br />Passing through this empty, lonely, oppressive environment for a couple of months, he captures the mood effectively through the use of minimalist grey style and mild observations. He conveys not only the presence of the totalitarian state, but also the absence, or at least the inaccessibility, of the human spirit, that has been so systematically isolated and controlled. He wonders \\"to what extent can a mind be manipulated? We'll probably get some idea when the country eventually opens up or collapses.\\" Indeed, won't it be fascinating to bear witness to minds made free. I hope the regime doesn't destroy the society to save itself, for as Delisle quotes the Dear Leader, \\"Only 30% of the population would need to survive to reconstruct a victorious society.\\"<br /><br />Some people don't take graphic novels seriously. They should have a look at this one.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|It is almost impossible for me write the words explaining how much I love this film while giving it justice it does not need.  Seven Samurai which was directed by master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and stars the late Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, is a grand samurai epic near unparalleled.  It was not until I bought the 3 disc criterion edition and watched it did I realize this film is a beautiful master work!  To start off I loved the story Kurosawa had written for the film with his talent for language and literature seen in every scene, shot, and performance.  The narrative follows Seven Samurai hired by a group of poor farmers to protect their village and food from a collective of invading bandits. It is an awesome tale that elevates itself into something more with each character's individual story.  I found it interesting how Kurosawa incorporated the historical account of the conflicting lifestyles between the villagers and the samurai while incorporating subtle comedy and a romance into it.  The visual decor and cinematography expressed on the now restored black and white film are astounding from the shot of the samurai bowing to the grave of a fallen comrade to the epic battle scenes between the samurai and the bandits.  Most importantly the performances done by the actors and actresses were achieved with genuine direction.  The samurai are performed with a balance of gentle humor and swift ambition that adds grace to their characters as they interact with the scenery.  Toshiro Mifune's character, Kikyushio is developed and likable to the point you begin to feel great sympathy for him, observing his transformation from a drunken loner who carries a huge sword and respected by nobody to a true honorable samurai accepted among the other six. All of the samurai are awesome including the leader played by Shimura as the elder ronin, Kambei who takes the young Katsushiro under his wing.  Kyuzo is probably the most impressive of the seven who has deadly skill witha blade, quick and silent while maintaining control and courage.  The love story between Katsushiro and the village girl, Shino is touching, affecting, and handled with care by Kurosawa without being over the top.  To conclude I love Seven Samurai and feel it is one of the great masterpieces deserving of the title \\"Classic.\\" It is one of my favorite films, but also an important film for students such as myself to study in order to understand the work of an influential director such as Kurosawa. A heartrending and visually powerful epic delivered by one of the world's great directors.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|Firstly it is a great shame that this film never came to be in all it's glory. The scenes that Brando shot alone hold enough weight to buy this DVD. The extensive care to reconstruct these scenes from the original negatives tryly shows, and there is NO fancy cgi graphics, in fact the care to preserve 70's film styles and effects truly shows. According to the documentary included several hundred new cgi generated effects were created for this film, and I couldn't find any on screen, they are seamless. <br /> <br />The biggest flaw would have to do with the surviving footage, more-so the lack of surviving footage. This movie was never shot, it is a re-construction using out-takes from both Superman 1-2 as well as pre-shot footage for Superman 2, which was under re-development. So yes there is a lot of footage that was previously used in both movies, including the identical ending that was cut into Superman 1. They were good enough to search out never before seem camera angles of these scenes and give us a fresh view, of a much seen scene. <br /> <br />But that said even this film, with all it's flaws and lack of coverage and continuity, the use of test and even audition footage, all integrated into what is, ald could have been a far superior sequel to Superman. <br /> <br />It truly is one of the greatest losses in recent film history, and the studio should bow their heads in shame for cutting out an absolutely amazing scene with Marlon Brando, just to save a quick buck. <br /> <br />The entire sequence plays out the father and son relationship formed in the first film beautifully, and honestly answered a lot of questions. Like how did Superman get his powers back after throwing them away for Lois.
B000058983|5.0|This critically acclaimed but somehow commercially underground landmark deserves a place in your collection.  Although Lee managed to sabotage his band and his mainstream success on numerous occasions, they did manage to make a few amazing records, and this is widely-regarded as their best.<br /><br />Forever Changes is generally lauded for two primary factors--the so-called \\"baroque-folk\\" sound that made Love unique, and the songwriting that set Lee and MacLean apart from the other blissed-out hippies of the day.  To start with, that \\"baroque-folk\\" sound is typified by lots of acoustic guitars (often 12-string), and the liberal use of an orchestra including strings and horns.  These orchestral elements blend perfectly with the music--it's pretty rare that folk and rock are combined so convincingly and unpretentiously with orchestras, but it really gels here.  On songs like \\"Old Man,\\" \\"Maybe The Times...\\" and the opening track \\"Alone Again Or,\\" the strings and trumpet lines add some hair-raising, soaring moments to the songs and provide a stylistic diversity (\\"Maybe the Times...\\" has an almost Latin feel) to the music that transcends typical folk of the day.  Although Love's use of the orchestra has become legendary, I don't think the rest of the band's instrumental and production work gets as much attention as it probably should.  The fingerstyle guitar is excellent throughout, and the electric lead on songs like \\"A House Is Not A Motel\\" and \\"Live and Let Live\\" is blistering and screeches above the rest of the mix. I really dig the production on the rhythm section--on most songs the drums are mixed on one side and bass on the other.  You can really distinctly hear each instrument and really hear the great bass playing and drums.<br /><br />As far as the songwriting goes, Arthur Lee certainly hit a high water mark on this album, with the help of Bryan MacLean on three songs.  Lee's lyrics are what really makes this album a classic in my book.  The sheer alienation, isolation and cutting satire that this album encompasses make it such a unique entry into the era.  Lee obviously had some unique insights into the world and life and he most clearly and movingly expressed them on this album.  There are so many breathtaking, revelatory lines in these songs I can't name them all, but some great examples are \\"the news today will be the movies tomorrow,\\" \\"Write the rules in the sky/ but ask your leaders why,\\" and \\"in the morning we arise and start the day the same old way/ as yesterday, the day before/ and all in all it's just a day like all the rest.\\"  I can only speak for myself, but the ideological and emotional impact of Lee's songs is something priceless and I value this album as one of the most cherished in my collection, right up there with Roy Harper's, The Band's, Dylan's and Pink Floyd's best.<br /><br />Musically, the songwriting is also engaging and excellent.  Complex chord sequences and some interesting time shifts mix things up and make the music even harder to classify in a neat, tidy genre box (I can't believe I saw music as potent Love in an \\"oldies\\" section in a record store).<br /><br />This reissue is packaged with great liner notes that are both informative on Love's checkered backstory and full of pictures.  The bonus tracks are actually better than most bonus tracks (usually useless).  Songs like the Tom Jones-like \\"Wonder People,\\" the epic single \\"Your Mind and We Belong Together\\" and the B-Side \\"Laughing Stock\\" really add to the collection, although I wouldn't change the track sequencing of the original album for anything.<br /><br />Although it took a few listens for this album to really blossom for me, since I really started paying attention it has grabbed hold and never let go.  If you're a fan of folk and classic rock or just appreciate great lyrics and ideas, pick this up right away.

B000J4QWMC|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and was somewhat let down.  I am one who doesn't think M. Mann can make a bad film.  I also think that Miami Vice is the greatest show in TV history.  The unrated DVD, if watched closely, is very different from the theatrical version.  Mostly in the area of music.  Especially in the end of the film when \\"In The Air Tonight\\" is played over the \\"confrontation\\" scene.  During that song we get a glimpse of Crockett and Tubbs in the car driving and preparing, much like in the stellar pilot of days gone by.  The song from the trailer (L. Park and Jay Z I think) is also in the beginning.  The additional clips in the movie all add to the relationship of Sonny and Rico.  Mann makes a compelling argument for the composition of the theatrical release during the awesome commentary on the unrated version.  True fans do what I've done...tuck this unrated version in your drawer next to your 10lb VHS tape of the original pilot and when you are through watching seasons 1-5 on DVD for the 100th time put on your shades let your chest hair out and lay waste to the rhythym of the night.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This CD made me cry, gave me goosebumps and made me fall in LOVE all over again.  Born in 1961, the Beatles have been with me all my life.  However, the tracks are so familiar, it's easy to listen to even their best tracks with half an ear, at best. I put this CD in, and sat without moving, eyes shut, for 90 minutes.  The new mixes caused me to listen, really listen, to the Fab Four:  the lead guitar, the bass, the drums, the vocals.  I remembered how utterly amazing these four boys were.  I love this CD.  Highly recommended for \\"old\\" Beatles fans.
038572179X|5.0|Near the end of your life, looking back, what would you want to do differently? What transgressions against your family and neighbors would you want to \\"atone\\" for? Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" provides a retrospective view of an entire life spent trying to atone for a single youthful misdeed, though this retrospection can only be fully understood by the end of the book. \\"Atonement\\" is about the basic psychological (spiritual?) need to \\"balance the scales of justice,\\" to somehow pay for our misdeeds with a sufficient number of significantly venerable ones (hence the privileged young protagonist becoming a war nurse, etc.). Whether this kind of \\"atonement\\" can actually be accomplished is questionable. In my view, it cannot be, and for me this firmly establishes McEwan's book as a tragedy. At the end of my life, if I'm afforded the luxury of lucid retrospection, I hope I will understand that I can atone for nothing, but must repent of everything.    \\"The ending is by far the most important part of a story; if you tie everything together at the end, all other sins will be forgiven,\\" I recall a teacher in one of my college literature classes saying. For me, \\"Atonement\\" began slowly, and even during the middle section, when my interest was piqued, I wondered where the story was heading. But the ending shed light on all that had come before, in a most unexpected and brilliant manner. The \\"revelation\\" at the book's end delivers a reinterpretation of the story's events that requires a radical shift in perspective concerning the meaning (and even reliability) of the former narrative. I did not view this ending as some sort of \\"gimmick,\\" as some other reviewers seem to (it is definitely NOT like one of those endings where the protagonist wakes up only to find out it was \\"all a dream\\"--i.e. the author couldn't really figure out how to end the story). On the contrary, the ending of \\"Atonement\\" provides the key to understanding the entire narrative structure and theme of the book, and, in my estimation, makes McEwan's novel a work of modern fiction to rank with the classics.
B000IJ79WU|1.0|I'd love to be expressing joy of seeing a stellar re-incarnation of one of my favorite movies. Though, I find myself hoping to help you avoid the anguish and expense in buying this item. Trust that the studios made the right descision back in the day and continue to enjoy watcing the true theatrical version. Because to take such drastic action to fire the director and re-shoot the majority of the film, they must have had good reason. Think about it, a studio spending all that money to make almost a whole new film? There had to be a really good reason. <br /> <br />Like anyone who is as I, a huge comic book fan, I excitedly purchased the Blu-Ray version of this. Now, after watching it, I can say it wasn't worth it. I'm not speculating sight unseen as many of these reviews are. This re-edit really wasn't as good as the original. In fact, I had to watch some of the original to cleanse my memory of this alternate version. <br /> <br />I've always thought highly of Richard Donner. For the original Superman and the lethal weapon movies. Even to consider it may be his influence in the X-Men film that made it so well. Though now, I'm considering the influence was not as positive. And maybe it was his ideas that held back \\"Superman:Returns\\". Which was good but, not great. Because if you do see this, it makes sense why the films aren't living up to there potential. I hope for the next Superman movie, the studios make the same choice they did back in the day.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I loved the movie when I first saw it, the score, the plot, the spectacle.  However, a short time after listening to the movie, I picked up the original London cast album.  Now that is beautiful.  In listening to the London, Broadway, and Broadway touring shows, I hear just how lacking the main characters in the movie were.  The singing just was not up to the standards of the stage show.  Not even close.  Gerard Butler, an extremely attractive man, did not fit as the phantom.  The character should look old and disfigured, not young with a slight burn-looking scar on his face.    I consider Emmy Rossum a very talented actress, but not a singer.  Her voice lacked the maturity and the operatic tone that Christine should have.  Yes, she was young, but there are plenty of young girls who can sing opera a great deal better.  I should know; that's around the area in which I am studying, and I am as young as she was.    I would recommend this movie to people who aren't picky about singing.  As for people who know great voices and great opera and/or musical theatre, you may be a bit irritated.  It is a very pretty movie, though.  Great costumes and scenery.
B00004SVIK|5.0|I never liked the studio version of 'The Wall'.  All in all, I believe Roger Waters lost his mind and slipped into complete megalomania while they recorded their epic double album of despair.  Of course, the wall has a group of outstanding songs that should have made up a single album.  As a double album/cd somewhere along the way the music starts taking the listener down a one-way path to places that aren't very interesting at all.<br /><br />That said I still have to give this live edition 5 stars.  Why?  It's a bloody good show.  If you can get beyond the whining of Waters and concentrate on what he and the band accomplished theatrically then I believe you will find this a considerably enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Plus, it's really cool to go back in time and hear Comfortably Numb played live for one of the first times ever.  That's amazing in itself.
B00005JPAM|3.0|Sometimes it's a hit or miss with directors, and with Stephen Frears at the helm the odds of a film being a success versus failure are about fifty/fifty. He has given us some excellent cinema such as High Fidelity, Dangerous Liaisons, and The Grifters. But sometimes his movie eye misses the mark or lacks an intriguing or well-rounded story. Mrs. Henderson Presents, Mary Reilly, and Hero are just a sprinkling of Frear films that had a good shot at being great, but ultimately failed in coherency, pacing, or some other aspect.<br /><br />THE QUEEN is certainly a film with some great acting. Helen Mirren is spot-on as Queen Elizabeth II, as was Michael Sheen in his portrayal of Tony Blair. But from here the cast sags quite a bit. James Cromwell picked up the part of Prince Philip, but seemed very out of place since he has been typecast in such things as The West Wing TV series and The Sum of All Fears flick. And Sylvia Syms (as The Queen Mother) and Alex Jennings (as Prince Charles) were difficult to see in their respective roles since they are still in the public eye. Although Queen Elizabeth is still in the spotlight, Helen Mirren's strong portrayal made that role much easier to swallow.<br /><br />Fresh subjects are tough to hit upon anyway, and you have to give credit where it is due; Stephen Frears certainly deserves some acclaim for simply attempting to make a film about the Royal Family and their reaction (or non-reaction) to Princess Diana's accidental death. But herein lies another problem: plot. There isn't one. The Queen is a reactionary tale, focusing mainly on Queen Elizabeth and the newly installed Prime Minister Tony Blair, and how each of them views the country's response to Di's death. Of course, the Queen deals with it by not dealing with it. While Mr. Blair continually tries to save the monarchy from self-destructing due to their own ignorance of the peoples' grief. But there isn't a definitive beginning, middle and ending to the story. It's character study of the monarchy will probably be boring to many, especially in the beginning. Most viewers may feel like dozing off after the first twenty minutes of disinteresting royal uppityness.<br /><br />Although the beginning and middle of the film lag, the ending picks up just enough to make it watchable. The excellent shots of Balmoral Castle and its Scottish surroundings were fairly awesome, as were some analogies regarding the royal deer that roam the outback wildlands.<br /><br />If you enjoy a good modern day character study, and are interested in the current monarchy, you'll probably eat this film up. But if you're eager for something plot-driven and deeply intriguing, you best look elsewhere.racter study of the monarchy will probably be boring to many, especially in the beginning.

B00005JOCU|5.0|I saw the Broadway show and was ready to compare it with the movie.  All I can say is be ready to forget Broadway and enjoy a great movie. The one unbelievable appearance is that of Jennifer Hudson.  How can a first movie and acting performance be considered, in my opinion, for a best supporting actor award?  The other surprise was Eddie Murphy.  The theater audience burst out in laughter when he appeared on screen.  In expectation of a joking and laughing Murphy this allusion was soon put on the back burner.  Eddie Murphy showed a new side.  His singing, dancing and earthy demeanor will shock you.  This is Eddie Murphy, with an amazing posture as a struggling singer. Moving on, the weaving in and out of music and plot is done with perfection.<br /><br />Now back to Jennifer Hudson.  When she is on camera you receive the vibes of the person who is the true \\"Diva\\" of this movie.  What a performance and voice.  When she sang \\"And I am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" the movie audience applauded.  If she is not nominated for an Oscar, Hollywood has missed an opportunity to give a just reward.  For you movie and music lovers, be ready for a thrilling and spectacular movie.
B000JLTRJ0|2.0|When most movie-goers think of Oliver Stone, they usually think of cutting edge (Born on the Fourth of July), or visceral film-making (Natural Born Killers), or even historically disturbing cinema (The Doors). But few -- if any -- would consider Stone schmaltzy or an opportunist. Watching WORLD TRADE CENTER, though, one can't help but feel a touch of the latter and a significant amount of the former.<br /><br />UNITED 93 was similar in that it took the recent horrific events of 9/11 and reintroduced Americans' fears to that awful day. It utilized (for better or worse) those feelings we all have and made money off of it. This isn't as terrible as it sounds, though. Cinema has been doing this for as long as celluloid has been running through projectors, but never has the filming been so close to the actual date of the events (or at least rarely).<br /><br />One can't help but think that Stone must've been desperate for film material or somehow felt closely connected to the events that day. Either way, the script (although based on actual events) was lackluster at best. There are just a few exceptions that we'll cover in a moment.<br /><br />This is the (true) story of the port authority police officers that responded to the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11, and is specific to the two men from the port authority who were trapped and later rescued from under the rubble. Nicholas Cage (National Treasure) stars as John McLoughlin, a gruff Sergeant who was around during the first bombings on the trade centers several years earlier. His entrapped fellow officer is rookie Will Jimeno played by Michael Pena (Crash), a family man with a new baby on the way. Both men have to deal with their isolation and near certain demise as they lay pinned and stranded only a few feet from one another. The story jumps between the rubble strewn men, their wives and families, and a retired marine who feels the call of duty after the attacks and risks his life to find survivors in the buildings' wreckage (the schmaltzy portions are firmly entrenched here as we're spoonfed everyone's tearful response to that terrible day).<br /><br />It is this \\"marine\\" that most might have the biggest trouble with script-wise. He seemed almost inserted into the story to give some grist to an otherwise empty milieu. His need for \\"revenge\\" felt hollow amidst so much emotion. And although this may be \\"the way it was,\\" it didn't translate well to film.<br /><br />Interestingly, Nicholas Cage gives an admirable performance even though he's not jumping into and out of danger, or battling evil-doers with deadly weapons. He's confined as is co-star Pena and their concern for one another is touching, as is their concern for what will happen to their families as they lay thinking/dreaming about them (these were some of the best parts of the screenplay but only a small portion of the whole).<br /><br />The most powerful part of the film was its sound editing. When the buildings collapsed and then later continued to creak and groan, they took on an ominous characteristic that brooded poorly for our two main characters and gave movie-watchers a great sense of dread.<br /><br />But when the sound becomes the most impressive part of a film, there's more problems than applause.e buildings' wreckage (the schmaltzy portions are firmly entrenched here as we're spoonfed everyone's tearful response to that terrible day). <br /> <br />It is this \\"marine\\" that most might have the biggest trouble with script-wise.

B0002STNQ2|1.0|Being in hi-tech, I couldn't get past a few chapters. I like Crichton's research and his imagination, but found this book sorely lacking. Maybe it picks up midway, but I don't waste my time on a book that doesn't grab me right away, there are too many other options.
B000002GBB|4.0|This is an awesome album that really shows off tommy shaws knack for writing and performing. This albums also has alot of JY's strong hard rock vocals and pleasantly shows off DeYoung powerful keyboard abilities. I highly reccomend this album for styx fans like myself.
B00026WUBE|1.0|Bob Dylan's awesome. The Band, both as Dylan's backup group from the Blonde on Blonde sessions and as a group apart from Dylan, are pretty good too. So why is it that, when they come together, they make such near-unlistenable music?<br /><br />In my mind, Dylan was drifting from '67 to '74 - after the excellent double-album Blonde on Blonde and the motorbike accident that followed, his music slipped in quality. His best offer was the mediocre Nashville Skyline, his worst the awful Self-Portrait. In other words, bad times for the guy, especially considering what he had made from '63 to '66. Anyway...<br /><br />Now, Dylan's the best lyricist ever, but you wouldn't know it from this album: too often he suffers from the Attack of the Love Song Cliches (Never Say Goodbye; You Angel You, where he literally sings \\"If this is love/then gimmme more\\"; Tough Mama; On a Night Such as This; Wedding Song), all about as convincing as a Hallmark card. And the Band's backup is nauseatingly lush. There are a couple gems: the tender Hazel overcomes heavily cliched lyrics because of the emotion put behind it; the stately Forever Young is a classic, though the faster second part's a joke. Thankfully, this dry period would end right after this disaster, as Bob put out arguably his best album, Blood on the Tracks, a year afterward. But this is still a sign of the seven-year slump.
B000EYK4KI|4.0|If you haven't watched the theatrical version of this movie plenty of times, you may not notice the minute changes from that version to this director's cut version.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue has changed and some scenes are extended. The Bogota Dirty Dance scene has been extended, as was the War of the Roses fight and love scenes.  The Dance of Death towards the end is also slightly different.  Also different was the hidden lives of both Smiths weren't revealed until much later in the movie.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the original cut, but this cut cleared up some minor foibles I had w/ the first. Adam Brody's scene was cut out of the beginning, which I thought worked better for the movie because in the original his introduction went nowhere, other than his reappearance toward the end. There appeared to be a lot more character development in this version as well. Of course more Bogota scenes are dreamily sexy as was the love scene after their big marital spat.<br /><br />If you're a huge Mr. & Mrs. Smith fan, I would recommend buying both the theatrical release and the Director's Cut.  If you don't want to buy both, I think the Director's cut is actually better than the original.<br /><br />The only part I wish was that Brad & Angie to do some of the commentary. The commentary on this disk wasn't as interesting as the Original Version dvd, because Doug Liman is constantly talking about the cost of the production which is kind of boring, I would have liked hearing more about the plot, tidbits about the sets, bloopers, more on why some scene got added or removed---anything but the cost and days of production.<br /><br />As far as the Bonus disc, there are plenty of deleted scenes to enjoy.  I would highly recommend getting this edition.
B000000OAA|5.0|1974 was a a mixed year for Queen with twin tirumphs in the studio albums 'Queen II' and 'Sheer Heart Attack' and health problems for Brian May which kept them off the road. The extra studio time was put to excellent use as 'SHR' became Queen second straight masterwork and another essential album in their catalogue. All band members continued to excel in their chosen specialties, notably John Deacon who contributes his first song \\"Misfire\\", a fairly cool acoustic ditty. However it is Mercury and May per usual who dominate the proceedings. More than on 'Queen II' the band goes all out to diversify their sound and variety of song types. You get the heavy riff rockers \\"Brighton Rock\\" (a May masterpiece of multitracking riffology!), band compostion \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" (a metal fan's favorite and live staple for years), \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" (part of an extended suite that leads to first side closer) and \\"Now I'm Here\\" (Brian's glam rocker and set opener at the time). Most famous song is of course Freddie's ode to classy but bad...um...girls, \\"Killer Queen\\", the band's first international hit. Piano ballads include \\"Lily of the Valley\\" which like the previous albums \\"Nevermore\\" is a heartbreaker, \\"Dear Friends\\" and \\"In the Lap of the Gods, Parts I and II\\" in which the second part closes the album in an anthemic manner. Novelties such as \\"Bring Back Leroy Brown\\" (Brian on ukelele) and \\"She Makes Me\\" add to the complex flavor of the record. Roger's \\"Tenement Funster\\" is a very cool rocker with Roger himself singing and playing guitar, definitley his best song at this date. The album would cement Queen as one of Britain's biggest acts and would break new ground in the States and Japan. Glam rock may have been fading but Queen was asserting that they were special and could not be pigeon holed into any catagory.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The white Stripes are an  amazing group. The fact that two people are able to produce  so much energy in their music is really quite impressive. Their style of music is different from just about anything else. This album is just simply good music, what else can I say?
0151006903|5.0|I must admit that at first I was put off by the description of Budolino himself: a man who always tells lies and who learns foreign languages easily. I thought the descriptions were not enough to make a character unique or at least, intersting. To be honest, I bought the book because it has UMBERTO ECO written in every side of it. I thought it might look good next to my old  \\"The Name of the Rose\\" hard cover.<br /><br />Finally I ran out of books to read during my lunch break and I thought I would take some of my old books to work. I'm glad I picked Eco.This book surprised me completely. Baudolino manaages to escape the violnece of the Sack of Byzantium during the FOurth Cruzade and heads East looking for Prester John.<br /><br /> Through Baudolino and his friends,we visit the lands of the Blemmyae, the Skiapods and finally the Hypathias, whith whom Baudolino finds love again. There's a physical descritpion for every creature, there are some words spoken in their own \\"language\\", and we even know what they think about each other.<br /><br />Every church they visited was shimering with jewels, every palace full of gold and gems, every town glittery with vibrant colors It makes you wish you were alive to see it when it was new (or when it existed).<br /><br />The part I still remember is when Barbarosa, thinking he's drinking from the Holy Grail, celebrates Mass with Baudolino,and his friends who swear allegiance to Barbarosa and to the Grail. In that moment of magic I became attached to this book.<br /><br />Towards the end of the story, the true death of Barbarossa is revealed in a most unexpected turn of events, just like \\"The Name of the Rose.\\"
0393061434|1.0|This book is written for people who know BASIC and computer programming, it is a poorly written book barely touching on the stories of the founding of Apple.  It concentrates primarily on exactly how the Apple I was built, step by step.  I was extremely disappointed.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Excellent Dvd for those who enjoy the more melodic side of Pink Floyd.  Gilmour at his best, changing guitars throughout, voice as strong as ever.  Supporting cast beyond excellent.  Song selection ver Gilmour-esc!  A few of the usual suspects, a few Division Bell, and a few miscellaneous choices that were a nice surprise.  Can't go wrong, top of the line production quality (sound most importantly).  Now need to find a cd of this.
B000002UBU|5.0|For years, the character actor Bud Cort hated the movie \\"Harold and Maude.\\" His bravo performance in that film overshadows every other thing he's ever done. So it is with Don McLean and \\"American Pie.\\" I can understand McLean's ambivalence; even so, \\"American Pie\\" is still the greatest song of all time.<br /><br />That nine-minute wonder captures the essence of the 1960s -- Buddy Holly, of course, but also gymnasium proms, the \\"God is dead\\" controversy, Lenny Bruce, the Vietnam War and the protests, the threat of nuclear annihilation, the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley, Charles Manson, the Beatles and \\"Sergeant Pepper,\\" Janis Joplin, even the Rolling Stones' tragic performance at Altamont Speedway. Despite McLean's protestations, the references are much too spot-on to be accidental.<br /><br />\\"American Pie\\" is simply a work of genius.

B0000A1HQP|5.0|I came in on the middle of this film on HBO one afternoon while flipping through channels. I paused for a moment, got hooked, and spent the next hour laughing like a crazed fool. This is perhaps the funniest movie I have seen in the past decade. When you think it can't get any worse for the main character, or any funnier, it does! Having missed the first 30 minutes on HBO, I rushed out to buy the DVD, and have enjoyed watching this film again and again. It's PG-13, namely because of a few bad words and some content dealing with adultery.

B000ION79Y|1.0|This is a total disaster, no good fight scenes, no coherent plot and no funny lines from Stephen (when you can hear or understand him).  Don't buy.  Don't rent.  Don't even see for free on TV.  Worse than John Wayne's \\"The Conqueror\\".  BTW, I am a SS fan from way back.

All of the main characters are loveable, earnest, and in some cases bumbling-- even the Witch-finder Sargeant. There are a couple of despicable (but bumbling) demons, and the Horsepersons of the Apocalypse are flat-out evil.

B0000DDAU9|5.0|Mastodon is definitely one of the most original and interesting bands to have come out during this decade. This CD is definitely no exception.<br /><br />On \\"Remission\\", Mastodon blends together many elements of music and basically define their own genre. You can call it sludge, progressive, doom, death metal, whatever. It's brilliant and stands out in each of these genres. Brann Dailor's drumming is fantastic. Guitar work is excellent. You have to hear this yourself. Believe the hype this band is getting, because they deserve it.<br /><br />Also, check out these bands if you enjoy Mastodon:<br /><br />Today Is The Day (featuring ex-members), Burnt By The Sun, Gojira, Intronaut
B00005JNEW|4.0|Where I come from high school sports in general was something merely for the jocks to participate in and rarely garnered any widespread interest within the school.  Football games--except for the annual \\"bowl\\" game against our cross-town rival (eventually discontinued because of the traditional post-game brawl)--rarely found more than one hundred parents and students attending.  So some of the meaning behind this film is I guess lost, leaving me more of a dispassionate observer than anything else.  Still, I really found this movie to be quite fascinating, and a powerful and well-told story.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I have listened to Zep since 1969, and thought that nothing new would ever be worth my time and money. My brother got this set as a gift and told me it's pretty good. I said \\"yeah, right...\\" and forgot about it. Then, a couple years later I borrowed it and haven't given it back since. It's got some of the hardest, tightest, best versions of their stuff ever recorded. The energy is as raw and dangerous as any future punk band. The engineering is pretty damn good, especially considering that Jimmy Page is three quarters deaf and produced the older remastered box sets and re-releases with way too much treble. This disc is nicely equalized. It has multiple versions of some songs but each is distinct and worthy of its inclusion. I'm sure there's other unknown Zep tunes in the vaults that are worth a listen. I would have liked to have lesser known or odd songs included - I've downloaded bootlegs of very poor quality versions of \\"Hey Joe\\" and others which could have used some expert remastering. The package is sharp and the notes are well done, thanks to Cameron Crowe, who toured with the band for a couple weeks as a very young reporter for Rolling Stone Magazine. Zep Live are the best garage band you'll ever hear.
B00004VVND|5.0|The premise behind Westworld is simple and even more relevant than it was back in 1973: what would happen if humans engineered human-like robots and something went wrong?  Back then, it was simply a matter of speculation; now, just over a short thirty years later, humans have \\"advanced\\" scientifically more than anticipated, and the likelihood of such a scenario occuring is much greater.  Something which I find quite unsettling.  I was very interested to see how this movie would resolve itself, and to be quite honest, I think the outcome was a little too optimistic.  Regardless, I really loved this movie.
B000002GB4|5.0|Great set o songs from the 70's albumns before styx turned dyx.  \\"Rock'n Roll Shooz\\", \\"Put me on\\", and \\"Jenifer\\" are undebatably(did i spell incorrectly, oh gee why no e-mail me and tell me in loud boistrous font-like ye have nutn' better to think of herbert) the best of the bunch...<br /><br />Other trax like Crystal Ball had a nice mellow tune of atmopshere.

B00000JGHL|3.0|A decent and somewhat entertaining movie about political corruption in New York, this movie arguably would have been a total flop were it not for Pacino and Cusack.  I feel that the amount of killing is a little excessive and lends to the general pradicability of the plot.  It was worth watching once, but I doubt I'll ever feel compelled to do so again.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|Okay...Long title, but what we have here is an LP (I still call them that) ranking with anything released of the period, or for that matter at all! I have always felt that this album should have ranked and been treated as Rumors or Hotel California was, because it is every bit as good! Now for those that already well know the content, what you need to be aware of is the sound!, and boy does it cook in this department! I always felt when this was first released on vinyl that it sounded muddy and lifeless, and even thought the 1990 release on cd helped, you still weren't hearing what the boys were hearing in the studio. I am very pleases to tell you that this problem is fixed here. Buy this expecting to be transported back to 1977, when you first purchased it, and plan on hearing it as though you were hearing it for the first time!!

And, since Emma Thompson spent five years working on this script, she deserved the chance to play Elinor, which she does splendidly (and, as Whoopi Goldberg said \\"that's why they call it acting.\\") <br /> <br />I'm not an Austen fan, and never read any of her books until after I saw Emma Thompson's and Ang Lee's beautiful telling of this story.  I read the book and found it flat compared to the brilliant script and direction in the film.  Reading the novel after seeing the film, I felt like I was trying to read a dream: you see something, but you can't really focus on it. <br /> <br />However, Emma Thompson keeps the most important characters and story lines, and Ang Lee's direction keeps the film moving.  Caution: it does seem to start slowly as the film sets up the plot of the young women being disinherited and their greedy sister-in-law preventing their elder brother from endowing them with the funds needed for their station. <br /> <br />Watch for Hugh Laurie's incredibly pained (and outstanding)performance as a serious, quiet man married to a silly woman who never stops talking.  He uses a newspaper as a shield against his wife and mother-in-law's slings and arrows.  Now being a \\"House\\" television series fan, when I re-watch this film, I wish he could let loose on his wife like he does as House! <br /> <br />Even if you don't like Austen novels, you will like this film if you are a fan of films of the 1930s and 1940s.  Why?  Because it is driven by the script and not special effects.  It's about people, and the painful daily choices we must make knowing that love does not always conquer all.   <br /> <br />The soundtrack is outstanding too.  I bought that on CD several years ago and it's one of my favorites.
B000H305U0|1.0|Yes I am coming to you from beyond the grave,  here is some back story ...I just got fired from my job as a hand model after a sun-tanning accident,  my whole family perished in a freaky chucky cheese mascot incident, and I had just gained 5 pounds.  So I decided to end it all.  Since I am anti-gun freak, that method was out.. I can't swallow pills..too big, they get stuck in my throat.. so that method was out.  A noose wouldn't work,  I never learned how to tie my shoes, always wore loafers since I was an infant as well as well tailored fitted suits..so that method was out. <br />So on a whim I decided to go out and purchase the new Justin Timberlake CD.  It solved all my problems. <br />Listening to his music is a slow death, kinda like in Return of the Jedi at the Great Pit of Carkoon along the Dune sea where one can get digested for a thousand years or maybe like one of our many black deaths or great plagues.  Anyway, painful as it was it got the job done. Let me explain further <br />First thing I did was take the disc out of the casing which caused me malaise and fatigue,  after falling on the floor and crawling to my CD player, I lifted up the disc and  with much effort, and place it in it's proper spot.  At this point my head began to pound, my lower back began throbbing, and a scratch formed at the back of my throat.  I thought about running away but I've come this far, and so with much strife I pressed play. <br />Here's what happened.. <br />Song 1 \\"Future Sex/Love Sound\\" - immediate nausea, projectile vomiting and a marathon of the \\"runs\\" occurred. <br />Song 2 \\"SexyBack \\" - severe arthritis in every joint appeared and I fell into the corner in a fetal position calling out the names of all my mothers. <br />Song 3 \\"Sexy Ladies\\" -Along comes Conjunctivitis  ,  my eyes become fire, partial blindness developed .. which actually relieved the pain of actually looking at the cover of the CD. <br />Song 4 \\" My Love\\"  - After listening to this number I became hemorrhagic and my body became one giant rash, but I wasn't dead yet.. I was beginning to feel that this might not work...oh boy was I wrong!! <br />Song 5 \\"Love Stoned\\" - made my genitals swelled in a not so good way and the roof of my mouth became blood red <br />Song 6 \\"What Goes Around\\"  - the pain in my skin became so intense that i tried ripping it off with spatula <br />Song 7 \\"Chop Me Up\\"  - Oh yes it did \\"chopped me up\\" with Gastrointestinal bleeding   from the mouth and rectum, this CD gets betters as it goes, oh boy I wish I had that gun now. <br />Song 8 \\"Damn Girl\\"  - OH NO!!! I was starting to get worried when my eyes and nose started bleeding profusely but then my ears started too, with it  a glimmer of hope that all that blood could muffle this awful song. <br />Song 9 \\"Summer Love\\" - Now I'm in full seizure at which point i bit my tongue off. <br />Song 10 \\"Until The End Of Time\\" .  At last , delirium set in ... not even that could help me from this bile song <br />Song 11 \\"Losing My Way\\"  Now I'm in a comatose state and you know all the things you hear about comatose patients hearing everything that is said around them.  Well it's all true,  I heard every single note of this song ... not even a coma is relief. <br />Song 12 \\"All Over Again (Another Song)\\"  Just the title of the song made me freak out ... is this an endless cycle ... will I  have to live this excruciating existence forever in a sort of Bill Murray \\"Groundhog Day\\" pattern of life.  And just when I thought that ... death occurred as all my internal organs liquified. <br />Now here I am in limbo to warn you against purchasing this CD,  I don't care if I go to heaven, purgatory , or the inner depth of hell.  I would rather burn eternally and get eaten alive on a daily basis than to have to live through listening to another Justin Timberlake recording.
B000ION23K|4.0|Took me a while before viewing this one....and that was to my disavantage<br /><br />because this one.....is a very good movie.<br /><br />Yep...good for kids and adults, the animation, the characters and everthing<br /><br />else works together and what comes out is a great fun movie.<br /><br />Just wait till you see the frog part.....excellent...<br /><br />I enjoyed it soo much, that i watched it again on the next day...<br /><br />Give it a try
B0006J28KU|5.0|My review will be heavily biased since this is my favorite film.  This film has all the elements IMHO of the quintessential crime drama: atmosphere, film-moir undercurrents, note-worthy dialogue and the ruthless cut-to-the-meat discipline.  This is an intense movie; light scenes are few and far between and even then, you can feel that the overall mood of the film scorns any suggestion of humor.  DeNiro as the master thief and Pacino as the obsessive cop are in perfect tandem with Kilmer,Sizemore and Judd as perfect supporting cast.  Sometimes the lines blur between lead and supporting characters as all players in the movie do an excellent job.<br /><br />This is one for any and everyones collection; after all, you might never see Pacino and DeNiro together onscreen again until their apperance in perhaps Celebrity Deathmatch.<br /><br />Enjoy !!!
B00003CXPD|4.0|Billy Elliot is an 11 year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class (meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike).<br /><br />This is the classic \\"family doesn't initially understand,\\" \\"teacher believes in him,\\" \\"screws up audition but spirit carries him through\\" type movie.  It's put together quite nicely, and you never really know how it is going to turn out.<br /><br />The transition from ballet dancing to tap/jazz seemed to happen in one day, which seemed jarring.<br /><br />The beginning of Swan Lake, with Billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance, 10 years or so later, was a real \\"feel good\\" part of the movie.
0312935579|5.0|I read this book over 13 years ago, and I tell you, it still remains one of my faves. Even though I was barely 13 when I read it, the book gave me hope and made me believe that anyone could become something, no matter their background and especially like Emma's.
B000IJ79WU|1.0|The original Superman II release was by far my favorite of all the superman movies.  And I firmly believe if II is your favorite then you will be greatly disappointed with the Richard Donner cut of the film.  The story continuity from the first film while better on paper, I found myself missing the early dramatics of the eifel tower scene in the lester cut.  Cut to the Daily Planet right away in the RD cut, Lois Lane is convinced Clark is Superman and jumps out the window to prove it within the first few minutes of the film.  This really needs the build up and suspense that is found in the Lester cut.  Now while Marlon Brando is great, the Holograms in which is show up in, remind me of 1970's \\"cheese\\" special effects.  They are just not believable.  The less technological images of his mother within the Crystal are far more effective.  The isloation Chamber is lame.  It looks like just a group of crystals in a circle.  The brilliant story line of Lois leaving behind the green crystal, so that he may reverse the transformation....all done with our imagination in the Lester Cut, is left to some riduculous merging of the Brando Hologram, and Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent....I was just blank at this, not knowing exactly how he got his power back was better.  leaving in the screen test with Clark and Lois as the way she confirms he is Superman, just shows a weaker side to the actors.  It is like veiwing an audition tape in the middle of the movie.  The very same lines in other parts of the film when directed by Lester are more belivable, and dramatic.  And I think the biggest problem with this cut, is the editing.  The great scenes like the fight over Metropolis are cut short, so we may see Lex Luther steal Perry White's Coffee???  I'm wondering what else is on the cutting room floor if stuff like this was left in. <br />In conclusion the Studio made the correct decision 30 years ago.  II would have been easily coupled with III and IV and the Origanl Superman would be my favorite.  Instead I hope to sell the Richard Donner cut, to cut my loses, and go out and buy the Lester version of the film today.
B000002VRZ|5.0|No New American from India should ever be allowed to review Southern Rock or any Rock CD...I saw the Outlaws and ZZ Top in Roanoke,VA in 1977 and they brought the house down with every song and actually commanded the same applause as that lil' ole band from Texas did later that night !! and outside of a few songs in five albums wrote all of their own material...The Outlaws were truly electric in more ways than one and the new digitally remastered songs sound better than ever !! only real radio stations play the deep cuts and \\" Ghost Riders in the Sky \\" fits the bill for high fidelity sound !! Yep , it's a Southern Rock thing , Dr. Bombay ,you wouldn't understand !!!
B000GFLEBI|4.0|Based upon the wonderful, well-written novel \\"Red Dragon\\" by Thomas Harris, this is a superior and chilling thriller. Grim and gripping, it features Edward Norton in the role of troubled, retired FBI agent, Will Graham, who is called back to service in order to track down a bizarre serial killer, known as the \\"Tooth Fairy\\". It appears that Graham has the uncanny ability to get into a killer's mindset and figure out what his next move might be. It is as if he and the killer become one. In his preparation for this, Graham even consults the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter (yes, THE Hannibal Lecter), deliciously played by Anthony Hopkins. Unfortunately for Graham, Hannibal has not forgotten that Graham was responsible for his changed circumstances.<br /><br />It is Hannibal Lecter, after all, who was the catalyst for Will Graham's retirement. The viewer is treated to scenes of Lecter's life, before he was revealed to be Hannibal the Cannibal, one of the sickest serial killers ever to strike. The viewer sees the renowned psychiatrist in his milieu as an erudite, cultured, and wealthy patron of the arts. A noted gourmand, Dr. Lecter liked nothing better than to give intimate dinner parties for the favored few. Of course, some of the ingredients used for his dinners were best left unsaid. It was nice to see the always excellent John Rubenstein in the small role of a dinner guest, heaping accolades upon Hannibal for his dinner parties.<br /><br />The movie is compelling and, at all times, gripping. Anthony Hopkins reprises his career defining role and steals the show (Really, Hannibal Lecter has become all but a cottage industry for him!). With a twinkle in his eye, he is, in his low key way, deliciously malevolent. Edward Norton, one of the best young actors around, gives a decent and sensitive portrayal of Will Graham, the angst ridden former FBI agent and profiler, but lacks the grittiness and hard-edged veneer that the role really demands. He also simply looks too young and soft for the role. Ralph Fiennes gives a fine performance as the tormented Francis Dolarhyde, but his portrayal is hampered by the fact that too little is revealed in the film about what makes him tick.<br /><br />Emily Watson affectingly plays a blind woman who becomes romantically involved with Francis Dolarhyde. It is her involvement with him that helps bring the film to its stunning conclusion. Moreover, Ms. Watson is a wonderfully talented British actress who manages to get her American accent down pat. Good performances by Harvey Keitel, as Graham's former boss, and Mary Louise Parker, as Graham's wife, round out this fine, ensemble cast.<br /><br />This film is a taut, unnerving psychological thriller that is subject to comparison to its 1986 predecessor \\"Manhunter\\". Having seen both, I call it a draw. This current version had a bigger budget, so obviously it has better production values. Also, the opening scenes in the current version are more interesting than those in the 1986 one. Music, however, was used to much better effect in the earlier version. Moreover, the final scenes in the earlier version were much better than in this later version, as they were much more suspenseful. Both films, however, are worth watching. Do yourself a favor and view both. Then, judge for yourself.soft for the role.

B000784WMW|5.0|ROCHESTER (as portrayed by Timothy Dalton):  \\"Do you think me handsome, Miss Eyre?\\"  JANE:  \\"No, sir.\\"  ROCHESTER:  \\"Get out much, Miss Eyre?\\"    That said and aside, it's wonderful.    Dalton's depiction of Rochester's anguish and yearning amid his arrogance, makes his portrayal the best I've seen, and the many hours of the screenplay allow us to revel in a full depiction and transcription of our most beloved of Bronte's set-pieces: from their meeting, to the first interview, to the interviews that followed, to the chat at dawn after Mason was sent packing, to the proposal and the crisis of desire and conscience that befell the aborted wedding.    Zelah Clark has the look and the attitude of Jane.  So much so, that the chemistry between the actors seemed to recast the class differences between the characters: I believed in the matinee idol Dalton's passion for the obscure actress, Clarke.       She even made Jane's redemptive year in Moor House, not quite the penance it usually is for the rest of us. Making her reunion with Rochester all the more poignant.
B0009WK5CW|5.0|This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book \\"The Bourne Identity\\". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural \\"Bourne\\" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.<br /><br />Matt Damon, looking very buff, portrays Bourne as an intelligent, resourceful character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them. Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.<br /><br />This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale. Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre. This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.py thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall.

B00000IFWE|5.0|My wife gave me this cd for my 21st birthday way back in 1999, and the raw emotional power of this album totally blew me away. It still does, eight years later. Petty was going through a bitter divorce at the time this album was coming together (late 90s) and it shows on many of these tunes, which convey timeless messages about love, betrayal, pain and healing. Perhaps my favorite is the really wonderful, comforting song \\"Room at The Top\\", which we danced to at our wedding. This is a very powerful album that when it's all said and done should be recognized as one of Tom Petty's finest efforts. If you are a Petty fan and don't own this one, than you better go and get it now! It is required listening.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This is my nephew's favorite movie.  I recently visted them and the movie got lost.  He was devistated.  I got this to replace it but the original was found.  Now they have a backup.  I have to say I cannot get over how wonderful the movie is.  It is a great story and all of the computer animation is incredible.  There are times you swear it is real.
B00008G9JN|5.0|What an amazing album! This is more than just incredible music, it reveals another world full of ancient spirits, magical forests, and Celtic folklore and rituals. The complex relationship between Mother Nature and mankind is also explored in \\"Jack in the Green\\": \\"Does the green still run deep in your heart, or will these changing times, motorways, powerlines, keep us apart?\\" I guess the jury is still out on that one! The musicianship on this disc is simply superb. Tull was at the absolute height of their powers on this release, which very well might be their best and most satisfying album. No Tull collection is complete without this cd!

1577314808|5.0|The Power Of Now is an exceptional book brimming with the peace and wisdom that unfolds from the realization of one of the simplest yet most profound truths: Now is all there IS.  <br /> <br />There is a wonderful Zen Koan:  <br />Q: What in this moment is missing? <br />A: Nothing. <br /> <br />This is a fundamental and extraordinarily powerful truth that is directly and immediately verifiable to anyone. Simply, the universe IS. There can never be anything missing because the universe is ALL there is any moment. You live your life at the intersection of here and now. The past is gone forever, so let it go, and the future has yet to be, so let it come in it's own time. Thus, to accept what IS in any given moment is the most rational and intelligent of responses leading to a much happier, richer, and more satisfying existence.  <br /> <br />Yet, our ego mind is conditioned to avoid the present moment by constantly projecting itself into memories of the past or imagining a future that may never arrive. When that happens we lose touch with Reality, with what is so, and hypnotize ourself into living in attachment to an illusion that can only lead to suffering, as our illusions of how things should be, could be, or would be, will inevitably collide with the reality of how things actually are.  <br /> <br />Learning to accept what IS and just BE won't turn you into a blissed-out do-nothing. On the contrary, what you experience is that you can be happy now, without conditions, AND take action in the direction of your goals, rather than waiting for conditions to be different first before allowing yourself to be happy and enjoy your life. <br /> <br />This is so simple that many people find it extremely difficult to grasp, let alone accept. In fact, paradoxically, it takes considerable effort and much practice to decondition ourselves and just Be.  <br /> <br />As a professional life & career coach, I work daily with my clients to assist them in this awareness and understanding. This book has been extremely helpful in that process, for that is what Eckhart Tolle attempts to address: that who you are, not your ego or personality, but your true Being and genuine contentment is only experienced in the Now. <br /> <br />
B000JBXXZ4|1.0|First of all, I have never heard so much whining about love in one album.  I love Incubus and I have been waiting for this release with great anticipation.  The only problem is that \\"Lights Grenades\\" is the only track that I can enjoy listening to over and over.  They lost their style in this one and I am very disappointed.  I just hope that when I see them in concert that they rock this stuff out, and aren't the pussies they portray in their new album.
B00005JNS0|5.0|ME AND MY CHILDREN LOVE THIS MOVIE! DISNEY DID A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH THIS ONE! JUST TO SEE A WORLD WITH CARS AND NO HUMANS WAS PRETTY GREAT! IF YOU ARE A CHILD AT HEART AND HAVE LITTLE ONES,YOU SHOULD OWN THIS MOVIE!
B0009UC7H0|1.0|You might enjoy this if you believe a script is not necessary to make a movie, and you suspend any and all belief in reality. To enjoy this film you must believe that military truck beds are held together with two giant screws that can be twisted off with a coin, and that three people can withstand a barrage of metal piercing bullets without ever getting hit. It looks as though the characters are staring out from swiss cheese, and through sheer skill or dumb luck, not a scratch on 'em. At every turn this clunker jumps the shark. This is NOT Indiana Jones fun, this is ripped off stupidity. The biggest problem is the script. Five writers are listed and if any one of them has worked on anything more difficult than their high school yearbook, I would be amazed. Through this gifted prose the principle three avoid being shot, the plague, sand storms and everything short of Armageddon, and come out victorious standing together with Cruz as the Princess Leah- Laura Croft super broad. I longed for the Imperial Storm Troopers to just shoot them all. The only saving Grace is William H. Macy, who maintains some sort of decorum in this madness. Poor Matthew uses some other voice, a combination Darth Vader-Alec Baldwin with a little \\"shiver me timbers\\" thrown in. Sorry, I can only suspend disbelief  so long. If you believed Mr. Cruz himself really could jump from a helicopter onto the back of a moving train INSIDE a tunnel, then this movie is for you. For the rest of us, it is a boring collage of sped up film and action secquences that make absolutely no sense. Enjoy.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I just want to clear up the bonus disc issue for anyone looking to buy this set. If this information has already been posted (and for those already aware), please pardon the repetition.    It appears that the 3rd Bonus Disc (Limited Edition - 1977 Capital Centre - Largo, MD) is a promo item exclusive to certain retailers, namely Wal-Mart. I recently saw this set advertised on television, and Wal-Mart was the only retailer specified at the end of the ad as carrying the item, obviously as a plug for Wal-Mart. Additionally, while shopping this month, I noticed that Wal-Mart carries only the set with the Bonus Disc, while other stores carry only the 2-Disc set. Both items also have different UPC codes.    So, anyone looking for the Bonus Disc set needs to be careful about buying online, as there seems to have been some early confusion about where to get the bonus disc. Be sure to ask your used seller which version they are offering.    As for the Kissology set itself, I did receive the 3-Disc version as a gift, but have not yet watched it in its entirety. While being familiar with most of the content, my general impression of the set is that it is a quality product that is well worth the retail price for even the most marginal of Kiss fans. I say this due to the fact that this material is FINALLY available in a non-perishable format. Anyone who is familiar with the 1985 Live Aid DVD set, and what a laborious task it was for the producers of that set to assemble the few bits of quality footage that actually survived, should appreciate why this Kissology set is so valuable. It is a sad fact that master tapes degrade over time, and with the footage in this set being 30+ years old, it is a blessing that we have this much complete footage to enjoy in a format that will not degrade (at least not in our lifetime). I, for one, am happy for that, and it is for this reason alone that I feel it deserves 5 stars.
B000067FP7|5.0|Gizmo is a Mogwai, and he used to live in a Chinese antique store, but Rand Peltzer picked him up to take home to his son Billy for Christmas. Mogwai are a big responsibility, and the shopkeeper warned Rand about it, but as long as he keeps to the \\"rules\\" he thinks they'll be okay. No water, no exposure to sunlight and no feeding after midnight. Still, with all the curiousity, Christmas stresses and Mogwai mischief, all three rules are broken, and Gizmo multiplies, and these copies transform into the Gremlins, a rather nastier bunch of creatures... <br /> <br />Will Billy be able to put things right, or will his hometown be thrown into chaos? <br /> <br />I was a big fan of Gremlins when I was little, the changes they go through and the conditions and such. It's a funny sort of film, great effects too. The book of the film is worth checking out as well, as it's got a few more details about Gizmo's past and the origin of the Mogwai. Worth a look for sci-fi fans.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This is a great comedy - intelligent, understated, and revealing.  The film is about a family's trek to deliver their daughter to a young girl beauty pageant.  It's about dealing with the inappropriate actions of the people close to us.  And it's about finding ways to live with people who do things we don't like.<br /><br />When the family gets to their first child beauty pageant, they realize it may not be the most healthy thing for young Olive, who is pursuing pageantry for reasons of self-affirmation and approval.<br /><br />Dwayne: \\"I don't want these people judging Olive.\\"<br />Sheryl: \\"Listen.  It is too late.\\"<br />Dwayne: \\"No, it is NOT too late.  You're the mom and you're supposed to protect her.\\"<br /><br />Pageant - n. - 1. an elaborate public spectacle illustrative of the history of a place, institution, or the like, often given in dramatic form or as a procession of colorful floats. 2. a costumed procession, masque, allegorical tableau, or the like forming part of public or social festivities.<br /><br />\\"You can't fly jets if you are color blind.\\"<br /><br />Dwayne:  \\"F#*k beauty contests . . life is one beauty contest after another . . . If I want to fly, I'll find a way to fly.  I mean you do what you love.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm glad you're talking again Wayne.\\"<br /><br />The casting is perfect.  The comic acting is sublime.<br /><br />The family's old van's clutch is out, so the whole family is needed to push it up to 15 miles per hour before the engine can engage in 3rd gear.  To do this, they must run along side and jump into the arms of a family member inside.  This regular & repeated dangerous activity and its symbolism are great.<br /><br />The movie explores the idea that at some point, someone you love will want something that 'everyone' else thinks is inappropriate.  The movie highlights that at those points, each of us decides whether to join the crowd in shunning them or whether to go up on the stage and dance beside them.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Seven Samurai is not only the best movie I have ever seen, it is also much better than the Hollywood remake.  The way in which it explores the philosophy of bushido is interesting and instructive.  The story is that a village of peasant Japanese farmers must appeal to the masterless and dangerous ronin to save them from the bandits who are soon to raid their village.  The excellent performance of Mifune is a tribute to the unfairness of feudal Japan, and the great character of Kyuozo makes this film almost perfect.  To cap it all, the villagers themselves are true characters, Manzo desperately trying to hide his daughter from the samurai, Rikichi's acute sense of pain whenever anyone talks to him about wives, and Yohei's strange twisted lower lip complete the greatnes of this movie.  A must-see.
B000683VI4|5.0|I hated this movie!!!  The only thing I actually enjoyed was the nap I was able to get through most of it.  So why the 5 stars?  Because this movie was not made for me and the people who this movie was made for (my wife, my mother-in-law, my mother, anybody who loves a good love story) loved this movie.  This movie seems to be the ultimate chick flick so if you are into chick flicks then you HAVE to rush out and pick this up. <br /> <br />If you hate chick flicks with a passion, avoid this movie at all costs.  Unless you need a good nap.
B00004XONN|5.0|Where to begin? I was glad to read the Amazon reviews beforehand to make sure I knew exactly what I was getting into once I heard this experimental album from Radiohead . . .  weird, adventurous, electronic music that touches your soul but takes time to appreciate. Got it. Everything In Its Right Place is a distortion of sounds (Thom's stuttering what I make out as `Kid A') that had me first scratching my head in confusion and finally enjoying it as a fantastic opener to the album. The National Anthem is a nice jazzy song with unbalanced trumpets that became my instant favorite. It makes you wanna dance. Optimistic is a beautiful, soaring, unconventionally uplifting piece of work and my favorite song on the album. \\"You can try the best you can, the best you can is good enough\\" has become my personal motto. Idioteque is an eerie track containing a sort of dance beat about what seems to me the end of the world or some nuclear war which is unavoidable. Typical Radiohead - their lyrics really shine. This album is a masterpiece but I can understand why people won't like it. It's a hard album to love. Simply put, I love it because it's bold. Other key tracks: Morning Bell & How To Disappear Completely.
B000059XUI|5.0|Other than that waste of a film, Superman V, this is the only Superman where the Man of Steel has to go against someone with superhuman powers.  And it wasn't just one, but four villains from the planet Krypton that has the same powers as Superman. <br /> <br />But it wasn't just doing battle with the other Supermen (well, one was a superwoman) that made this great, but it also showed the human side of Superman as he makes the choice to become mortal for Lois Lane's sake.  Then there was the continual relationship development between Lois and Superman/Clark Kent. <br /> <br />Of all the Superman movies, this is by far my favorite... even beating out the new Special Effects driven \\"Superman Returns\\".  If you love Superman, you need to check this one out!

B000G8NXYG|5.0|Seven Samurai, simply put, is one of the greatest films ever made. I love movies. I love all genres, but I was NEVER a fan of foreign films. I was the typical American movie-goer. \\"You mean I gotta read subtitles? To hell with this.\\" was my attitude. That all changed with two American films, that ironically has a large portion of them subtitled.  <br />The flashback scenes to the young Vito Corleone in Godfather II were in Italian with subtitles. Two thirds of Dances with Wolves was subtitled. Those two films showed me that if the story is strong and the characters are engaging, I didn't mind subtitles.  <br />With that in mind I approached Kurosawa. The film makers I admired most, Lucas, Spielberg, Scorsese, all cited Kurosawa as a major influence and I was very curious. My prejudice against foreign film had always prevented me from exploring. Once I had that out of the way, I was able to explore. <br />Turner Classics ran Seven Samurai one night. I recorded it and watched it, the next morning. I was in awe. In my life there have been three films that completely floored me, three films that left me awestruck, Star Wars at age 8, Schindler's List, and I added Seven Samurai to that short list. <br />Strength of story, strength of character, strength of the filmmaker and his technique, there is not a single weak point in this film. When you factor in this was Kurosawa's first Samurai film, it make the accomplishment all the more stunning. <br />
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I was interested in the project due to Sir George & Giles Martin working with the master tapes from Abbey Road Studios - with digital technology - to re-create the music for this soundtrack. What was done in the production and remixing makes it a CD that should be frequently referred to by producers and engineers.<br /><br />But there is something missing when the CD starts with the mixing of several songs into one number and - for example - taking the beginning acoustic guitar of Blackbird as a lead-in to Yesterday; you have to see the show at The Mirage in Las Vegas.<br /><br />The project was the idea of the late George Harrison and Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, who was a former street performer. And at The Mirage is a custom-built theater with surround sound, video projections and 360-degree seating to deliver a stunning stage and musical performance.<br /><br />The CD kicks into gear near the end, with Harrison's feedback guitar driving Revolution, which flawlessly transitions into Back In The USSR and seques to the best track, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, with Harrison's biting acoustic guitar and a new orchestral arrangement by Sir George Martin bringing a new, more powerful meaning to the lyrics.<br /><br />As a CD, there are more misses than hits when mixing songs into new packages. But within the context of the show, Love must be a great tribute to a band whose legacy is felt as strongly today in the music industry as it was so many years ago.
B000E5KJF2|4.0|I thought that this movie was really funny. It wasn't the greatest movie ever made but for a comedy it was smart, unpredictable and different. This is something that is a rarity these days as most comedies are stupid and confuse vulgarity and shock for humor. Robert Downey and Val Kilmer as Gay Perry are both excellent choices for their roles and do a very good job. The dialouge is smart, quick and funny.<br /><br />I recommend this movie highly. Check it out!
B00005JPBD|5.0|It's tough to rate Almod&oacute;var's \\"Volver\\" as anything less than five stars, because it's so well done.  Why isn't anyone in the US making movies like Almod&oacute;var?  He's been on a colossal roll since \\"All About My Mother,\\" which I think is his masterpiece.  Put that work end-on-end with the three films that have followed - \\"Talk to Her,\\" \\"Bad Education,\\" and now \\"Volver\\" - wow, does it get any better that?  The guy's maturation as as a filmmaker as a filmmaker is simply incredible.  Even though there were some early triumphs such as the classic \\"Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,\\" there were some stinkeroos in the early days, too.  The dreadfully bad \\"Kika\\" comes to mind.  Now, it's nothing but top-quality stuff, time in and time out.  The intricate scripts and classic Almod&oacute;var signature stagings are a treat every time.<br /><br />From an acting perspective, though the cast won an ensemble award at Cannes, the story and revelation here is Penelope Cruz.  Maybe it's a language barrier, but despite Hollywood's best efforts to cram her down the throat of the collective American public, not a single role she's ever done in Hollywood has resonated.  And that's despite repeated attempts.  But, here, wow - what a revelation.  She's incredible on every level.  And, here's a vote for Lola Due&ntilde;as as Cruz's on-screen sister.  Her unique and expressive face is called on for some moments of comedy.  She's a gifted physical comedienne.<br /><br />It's also great to see a gracefully aging Carmen Maura back in Almod&oacute;var's world.  Basically, Maura in Spanish royalty when it comes to acting.  She's 61 now and not afraid to show it.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|I thought that this was a pretty good movie and that it was a good adaptation of the book and stayed very true to it. This movie exposes that brain washing and homoerotic culture of the American Military. It also shows the truth behind the everyday life of the basic Marine during desert storm. It might not be what you expect in that the action is few and far between. But it also has a ton of the basic war movie stuff that you have seen in every war movie since The Boys from Company C.<br /><br />Still a good movie and worth watching, check it out!
B0000AOV85|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the foremost in the \\"Classic Albums\\" series. A very well put together piece analyzing the leading-up-to and production of what is arguably the greatest rock album ever made. All four members of the Floyd give interviews, as well as their manager and sound engineers. Pretty much everyone who was directly involved with the production of this album gets airtime. One of the seminal feautures of the \\"Classic Albums\\" series, and very well done on this particular part of the series, is footage of the band members and/or sound engineer at the mixer giving a track deconstruction, isolating certain vocals or instruments, detailing effects laid on top of tracks--it's amazing stuff, so strange to hear things like \\"Us and Them\\" without the echoes overlaid onto David Gilmour's vocals. If you are a fan of \\"Dark Side\\" this is a must-own. A truly wonderful glimpse into the genius that created this remarkable album.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Not since Eric Clapton and BB King collaborated, have I enjoyed a CD as much as the Road to Escondido. Mellow and blues-y; a great Sunday afternoon relaxing kind of music.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is a fantastic, crystal clear transfer of the best movie ever made. I honestly don't understand how anyone can not like this movie. <br />That's been discussed elsewhere, so I started this review to complain... <br /> <br />This wonderful DVD is in some of the cheapest packaging I have ever owned- this is a massive disservice to a movie I will probably pull out every few years to show the friends who have never seen it.
B000LC55F2|4.0|First off, love Nolan's work and I couldn't wait for the next film to come after seeing the heights he has gotten to after reworking and revamping Batman to finally give Gotham and the Dark Knight the movie they deserve. When I found out he was finally moving on with The Prestige, a book that he read (or maybe his brother did), I read that same book. I have to say if you read the book then the movie comes up short, why? Cause at times (from what I remember of the book) you know what the whole trick is and who is who and what will happen. With that said I can remember sitting in the movie house in awe once again of Nolan's directing ability and his brooding sense of style and atmoshphere; though at times I was hoping for a complete vere off the road of book-to-film adaption. The reason being reading the book, or rather knwoing the source material kind of ruined some of the mystery for me (I learned an important lesson that night, next time never to read the book that Nolan is basing his film off of, read it afterwards). Also for such a plot and for such characters I was hoping for an R rated film (that way I think the characters could have been more savage and a bit more adult), I think the PG-13 aspect does help with some of my dissatisfaction (characters seemed streamlined and babyfaced to kind of cash in on those new Batman fans, you know?).   Now what can I say about the film? Well read what others have said... I can't add on to it's about two magicians who follow different beliefs of how to go about doing magic in the late 1800s. And due to some fluke they both become bitter rivals in a blood fued that will not only cost them their lives but also what they hold even closer, their secrets...  Bottom line is, if you are looking for a good old fashioned thriller then get this movie. This film is just another BIG example of why Nolan is the true hier to Hitchcock's throne and not M. Night by any means what so ever. And if you are like me, then you can't wait for thenext installment of Nolan's career (hopefully more and more Batman and then oh yes, The Prisoner)...
B000J4QWMC|2.0|Thius is not that good. I will, tend to agree with the bad reviews overall. It is an adaptation of the seies but which completely changes the style of its concept. While that is OK and probably more adapted to the times, the movie is still unfocused. The storyline is not that great and it combines a slow-moving pace with periods where nothing happens with moments of hard violence. It is also very very darkly shot and while I am sure this was intentional, it was not a good idea. And the acting is not that great.
0385280890|3.0|As to why Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. would think we, the gentle readers, would be interested in the measurements of his penis and the fictional penises of his fictional characters is the greatest mystery of this title, perhaps of the malevolent universe.  And so on.  Billed as a novel, \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is more a collection of socio-economic rantings than an actual work of fiction.  Not that I blame Kurt...  His tidy little, astute essays in \\"In These Times\\" are quickly forgotten by the public.  But, his ideas in his novels will be around for several more years.  Don't get me wrong.  Ideas don't really make a difference.  Really mean people with killing machines make a difference.  But, what would I know, being merely a meat robot devoid of free will put here for the amusement of my creator.  I give the book one star for literary style, five stars for ideas, and an overall average three stars because it is printed in English in nice type.  And so it goes.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I just bought The Open Door the other day. I do listen to some hard rock but it is not the dominant style in my collection. That being said, I must say that I think \\"The Open Door\\" should be album of the year. There is not enough to say about this album. Amy Lee has crafted a true work of art, using the pain and turmoil of a relationship breakup as her muse. The songs exemplify not only hard rock/goth but touch upon everything from singer songwriter pop to opera, with full orchestration. One such unconventional song, \\"Lose Control\\", rocks hard but is dominated by a gentle piano and programming background. The current hit single \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\", is a tour de force of emotion over a break up, and \\"Like You\\" is a heartwrenching account brought upon Amy Lee having lost her sister. The closing track \\"Good Enough\\" is with strings and piano, and lacking heavy guitars, but is powerful nevertheless. If you want a powerful album to listen to, get \\"The Open Door\\" now.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This was probably the best movie I've seen all year. Everyone I've recommended this movie to has walked away loving it. Like the Usual Suspects, it absolutely requires at least a second viewing. You will not figure out the connections on the first pass. Mysterious, dark, and more than a little quirky, the story is riveting and ends on a surprisingly sympathetic note... not at all what you believe you are heading to as the movie unfolds. I won't give anything away here, but it is a great movie.<br /><br />The cast and characterizations are flawless. On a side note, I'm a huge Christian Bale fan and I always think each movie I see him in is his best work yet. This is no exception. He's perfect!
1577312082|1.0|I know I am not a good reviewer, don't read a great deal of books, but this one I will take the time to warn others about, it rambles on and on, as if the author just wants to hear himself talk. It is so full of painfully obvious thoughts, and maybe I ask too much for some entertainment value this one has very little, so I would suggest you pass on picking up this book.
0142402753|5.0|I am an absolute Julia Donaldson fan and own almost all her stories. This one as well as probably her most famous story (The Gruffalo), must rate as some of the best children stories available. Snail & the Whale, Room on the Broom is must-buys as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00005JNS0|1.0|I am shocked.  We just sat down to view this movie (after being told by many friends and relatives it was excellent)and I am still amazed at what I heard and saw.  I even had to get up and check the box for the rating...I could not believe it was \\"G\\".  The language was disgusting.  I would not use the words \\"idiot\\" and \\"moron\\" in front of my children.  I certinly do not want them to see it on T.V.  And that is only a few of the less than wonderful terms that were used. The terrible crash scene, out running a train, trying to get another vehicle to crash...that's as far as I got and I shut it off.  I am dissappointed that in todays world this is okay for our children to see.  Not my kids.......I will throw it away...
B000J10EQU|3.0|I was very disappointed with this film in so many ways.  First of all, I am old enough that I watched the original Superman TV series with George Reeve and used to collect the comic books!  I loved the first two Superman movies with Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder.  He was just terrific as Superman and she did well with what she was given for Lois Lane.<br /><br />Brandon Routh seems to be doing a Christopher Reeve impersonation especially when he is in his Clark Kent persona.  However, as Superman -- not super at all.  And by the way, what were the director/producer thinking having that dangling curl over his forehead as Superman?  Sheesh, it looks stupid!!  I agree also with other reviewers that his costume was too burgundy instead of red (check the comic books, guys) and the small \\"S\\" up too high on his chest looked ridiculous!!  I liked much of the plot and acting but really felt that Brandon Routh should have put his OWN imprint on Superman and having Lois Lane a single mom, engaged and still acting loopy about Superman was just not believable.<br /><br />While Smallville has taken many, many liberties with the Superman as a teen and now college man, at least when you watch Tom Welling as Clark Kent/Superman he is very believable.  Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor with John Glover as his dad, Lionel Luthor, are also incredible actors.<br /><br />Not sure why (maybe he is under contract to Warner Bros.) Tom Welling wasn't given a chance at Superman Returns but maybe next time they should try him!!  He is only 1 year older than Brandon Routh and appears from other movies (Cheaper by the Dozen 1 & 2) in good shape.<br /><br />Kate Bostwick did a nice job with a very unhelpful script.  I think much of her dialogue was not very realistic for an ace reporter!<br /><br />All in all, fun to watch but not a thrill and much lacking.  Rent it don't buy it.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I am sorry but I don't believe that humans are 100% responsible for GW. <br />To me this video came off as political propoganda. I couldn't take the lies and halftruths being pushed as truth. save your money and rent it if you must.
0895260131|1.0|I agree wholeheartedly with Ms. Martie D. Kelley's review.  There is no objective research and the \\"facts\\" Spencer states are verses pulled out of context.  If you want to learn more about Islam and the Crusades, there are many other unbiased options that can provide a better and fuller understanding without resorting to the intellectually lazy and bigoted approach that Spencer used.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|These guys are easily one of the best power metal bands in the world and this DVD shows why. They write epic songs made of monster guitar riffs and awesome drumming. The keyboard parts are so atmospheric and create the perfect mood for each song. Khan's awesome vocals are so passionate and perfect that each song feels like his last. This DVD contains an entire show with crystal clear sound and includes a second disc with bonus footage including a making-of featurette and some nice interviews with the band members. Definitely a must have DVD for Kamelot fans and certainly one of the best DVD's by any band in this genre.
B000021YQV|1.0|Sorry Guys for a old Classic Rocker like me I coundn't take this.!. That Singer is mostly likely the worst I have ever heard. I would rather puncture my eardrums then ever listen to this again!.
B0000046X0|5.0|Chick Corea and RtF at their FINEST!<br /><br />This album is simply superb.  Bill Connors adds so much more to this band than Al DiMeola.  Al should stick to classical spanish guitar.  Meanwhile, the songs transition very well, and each has a very sophisticated flavor and UMPH to it.  One of the chief aspects that defines a classic CD is its ability to grow on you with each listen.  This album is good for hundreds, if not thousands of spins.  Each time you listen variables like mood, atmosphere, company, and others will redefine what makes this album so special.<br /><br />If you like bands like Weather Report, or can appreciate the bass work of Jaco Pastorius, this CD will make a fine addition to your collection.
6304493711|4.0|Richard Curtis is just splendid when it comes to light-hearted comedy (especially romantic comedy). This movie personifies that. It is upbeat and very easy to get into.  <br /> <br />Hugh Grant does his whole mumbling routine (which you either love or you hate - I happen to dig it) and the supporting cast is simply brilliant. Andie McDowell's place in this movie is something of a mystery. I don't know if her casting was genius or just grabbing any American actress who had name recognition. Her character should come off as, well, a bit of a whore but Andie couldn't play such a role if her life depended on it. She's just too nice. I think her playing the role may have saved it, though. Any other actress may have come off much less likable in the end. <br /> <br />One of the only negative things I can say about this movie, and Richard Curtis, is that the gay people aren't written well. The gays are gay in name only, they just come of as flamboyant asexuals. Granted the movie is 12+ years old, but still... <br /> <br />I am not a fan of romantic comedies at all (save for \\"French Kiss,\\" this movie and \\"Love Actually\\") so I was very pleasantly surprised with this flick.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I have seen all the movies that have been put out by Marvel over the last 6 years or so and was never a big fan of the X-Men films though the first 2 were passable.  This movie has way too many characters in it!  Some of the characters are pathetic looking such as the Juggernaut and The Beast (who looks and sounds like they dyed a gorilla costume from the Planet of the Apes movies).  They waited to the last installment to introduce The Beast and the Angel who were original X-Men in the comics (X-Men was never a popular title until they changed the line-up adding Wolverine and Storm along with others). <br /> <br />There is just too much going on for the viewer to grasp the entire plot unless you were intricately familiar with the comic stories.   The scene where Magneto rips and moves a large section of the Golden Gate Bridge was ridiculous.  The movie seemed to also rip off the humans being disolved into a sand-like substance by The Phoenix from the War of the Worlds movie (sans the clothes that remain after they disolve). <br /> <br />The last scene of the movie sets it up for a sequel though I don't know if my head can stand another two hours of overdone special effects with too many characters (as much as the Fantastic Four was panned it was a lot easier to watch with only four heroes and one villian to focus on)!
B000LC55F2|5.0|I went into the movie theater to see 'The Prestige' with high expectations.  It did not let me down. With my father being a magician himself, I just had to see this film. The old saying \\"Watch closely\\" is perfectly fitting for this movie.  I was completely surprised by the ending, and it kept me on my toes the entire time. It was a fast moving story that didn't have any dry, dull moments.  Hugh Jackman was excellent as usual, and Christian Bale was wonderful as well.  This was the first movie I have seen him in.  Don't forget about Michael Caine either.  The wisdom his character brought to the story was essential.  I believe this is a movie you can watch several times and always find something you didn't see before.  I can't wait until it is released on DVD!  You have got to see this movie, what else can I say?!

B000J103OI|5.0|What not to like about this DVD. It has it all great cast and great storyline. Even though Hathaway and Streep was fantastic. Stanley Tucci is the star of this movie. It asks the age Old question What would you do and how far would you go for the job of your dreams? If you are missing great drama this is the movie to get.
0465092756|2.0|Most of this book is written in incomprehensible jargon which is impossible to follow.  It is one of the most poorly written science books I've ever come across.  The only concrete idea I walked away with was that \\"string theory might be wrong because it isn't science\\" which could have been captured in 4 pages.  Instead I wasted my time reading a long and painfully written history of quantum mechanics and the relation between physics and math, which did nothing to enlighten me later.  Then there was long passages containing nothing but whining about string theory and how it was wasting a generation of physics youth. <br /> <br />I am not a scientist but I don't think this book was directed at scientists.  I read lots of science books but this one was not that good.
0618918248|1.0|the author's argument fails in that he assumes \\"god\\" means what humankind has defined god to be in their religious texts.  also, metaphysically-speaking, this universe we earthlings partly inhabit can still exist as an evolutionary-based dimension within god's greater creation-scheme.  it is unfortunate when an argument against the existence of god really goes no further than an author's already belief that god just cannot possibly exist.  if atheists really believed there was no god, they'd live their lives having nothing at all to do with the topic.  afterall, how many books are written to refute existence of the four-headed unicorn?  a rise in the number of atheistic books points to a rise in individual spiritual frustration among us.  god is love and earth is a testing ground.  overcome the negativity here and keep loving.

0385334206|5.0|years ago, on NPR i believe, i heard someone put this book down as an exception to vonnegut's otherwise fine books. I felt stupid hearing that, because i always thought this was my 2nd favorite vonnegut book (after slaugherhouse-five). so I went back and read it again, and I WAS RIGHT; this is my 2nd favorite vonnegut book. and this is a very funny book, if you have a mind tuned to the finer, darker, dryer side of humor, that is. people without a very keen sense of humor will probably not get it, it is above them. or rather their brains will not tune in the frequency on which this kind of humour rides. anyway, this is a great book, which needs no synopsis rehash here from me. if you have a discriminating sense of humor & a weariness with the way people are handling this earth, then this is a must for your soul. <br />
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|Rihanna's sophomore album clearly establishes her as one of the best young artists we have today. Her voice is strong, vibrant and full of electricity. She sings passionately and leaves you wanting more--way more, in fact, of her incredibly flawless style and sophistication.<br /><br />The CD starts off with the electrically charged \\"SOS.\\" Rihanna grabs your attention with the way she attacks this song and infuses it with all the sex appeal and energy of a young lady falling in love. The musical arrangement is strong and very catchy. No wonder it was played all over the radio! The CD then takes a turn into a much more somber mindset with the pensive \\"Kisses Don't Lie.\\" In this song Rihanna sings of a budding love that she knows could hurt her feelings.<br /><br />Other great songs on this CD include the painfully honest \\"Unfaithful\\" about a woman who strays from her man; \\"Dem Haters\\" about people who are your friends only because they want things from you; the incredible sadness of the ballad \\"Final Goodbye\\" in which a woman professes her love for a man even though the love affair is over; and the excitement of a new love in \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love.\\"<br /><br />Rihanna also performs four tracks with guest performers who are really nothing short of the best: Rihanna is joined by Sean Paul on \\"Break It Off\\" and Corey Gunz does a great job with Rihanna on the final track entitled \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want (Part 2).\\" J-Status is also featured on the track \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love.\\" Last but not least, \\"Dem Haters\\" features Dwane Husbands with Rihanna. Awesome!<br /><br />The liner notes feature wonderful color photos of Rihanna and all the credits, too. Moreover, the sound quality is excellent; you'll swear Rihanna is personally standing right next to you singing just for you when you hear these tracks.<br /><br />Rihanna scores a huge hit in my book with this CD. She sings with great sensitivity and the musical arrangements are very well planned and executed. These remarkable musical arrangements have an R&B/Soul/Caribbean/even a slight touch of reggae feel to them. Trust me: Destiny will call Rihanna to record more for our delight and we are lucky to have her amongst us. I highly recommend this for Rihanna's fans; and people who enjoy contemporary R&B/Soul will not be disappointed.lanned and executed.

0307341542|2.0|I had expected good things from this book, not from the reviews but that great opening line and that spectacular image: that stinging red sweater.  What a sizzler of an opening! <br />This is, unfortunately, where the good news ends, and why this book only got two stars--and that's being generous. <br />For a few chapters, this book moves along at a fine pace.  Confident style, good voice--and then we get that first cut, and I got kicked right out.  I'm not going to give anything away here and while, yes, this is fiction, this kind of revelation is, well, insulting.  Women can't have problematic or even sadomasochistic relationships with a mother without being self-destructive?  Puh-leez.  This read, a teeny bit, like _Secretary_ (a superb film) without, unfortunately, James Spader as eye-candy.     <br />The point is this: The revelation of the protagonist's problem, in and of itself, serves no purpose to the plot, not that I could see.  I wasn't horrified; I was pissed off.  It's like the spoof Dean Koontz serves up in the _Odd_ series of the standard dysfunctional detective. <br />As for the identity of the killer: saw it coming as soon as the killer walked onstage.  Not a good thing when I'm waiting for the protagonist to get it together.  In the end, I didn't; I skipped ahead, read the last few chapters and promptly gave this book to the Salvation Army.
B000002UR7|5.0|It may surprise some people to discover that Radiohead wasn't always the experimental and disturbed rock band that they are today.  It may surprise those people even more to discover that Radiohead began as an early-90s alt-rock band like any other.  In 1993, they released their debut album, PABLO HONEY, and it was a debut like any other ... or so you'd be led to believe.  As a die-hard Radiohead fan, I knew that I must someday investigate PABLO HONEY, despite its lack of acknowledgement from many of my fellow fans.  Finally, I did, and was I ever surprised! <br /> <br />Maybe PABLO HONEY's lack of attention grew from comparisons to later Radiohead masterpieces like THE BENDS (which actually has a lot in common with PABLO HONEY) or their supreme achievement, OK COMPUTER.  It's fascinating to listen to PABLO HONEY and then listen to the band's most recent album, HAIL TO THE THIEF.  They sound like a completely different group.  It's no secret that Radiohead evolved and changed immensely over the course of six albums, but does that mean that they weren't a talented band to start out with?  Erase your prejudice and your expectations and listen to PABLO HONEY.  It's a collection of visceral ruminations on everything from mental status (\\"Vegetable\\") to love (\\"Thinking About You\\") to the apocalypse and how handy it would be to have a guitar during that time (\\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\").  Each song features swirling, driven guitar and oddly angelic singing from Thom Yorke.  The lyrics are heartfelt and the arrangements show definite promise.  One way to describe Radiohead on PABLO HONEY would be \\"the U2 of the early-90s alt-rock scene.\\"  The overall sound of the album is very similar to that of THE BENDS, which is why I find it especially odd that this album has been disregarded by almost everyone. <br /> <br />Is PABLO HONEY as good as THE BENDS?  No.  Is it as good as OK COMPUTER?  No.  I suppose one might consider this Radiohead's weakest recording, although AMNESIAC holds that position in my book.  Try to examine this as what it is, though: an unpretentious debut from am immensely-talented band just starting out at the beginning of the 1990s.  It's not as good as the later Radiohead releases, but for what it is it's one of the most important albums of the decade, and certainly one of the best of the early 90s.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|This recent effort by Icelandic atmospheric/post-rock band Sigur Rós is a more polished, more studio-produced sounding, more mainstream and pop-infused album than some previous efforts.  This can make the songs more melodic and catchy, with hints of accordion/concertina, glockenspiel or toy piano, and electronic pad sounds.  This meanders in a slightly different direction than some of the more esoteric, abstract previous works.  These songs tend to fit into a \\"radio format\\" length and style.  Some people will absolutely love this new sound of Sigur Rós; diehard fans of the band's older sounds (more atmospheric, guitar-driven, and experimental) may be fairly put-off and disappointed, however. <br /> <br />If I were to describe the new sound, it sounds to me like some of the riffs and themes from fellow Icelandic band Múm combined with the driving, pulsing rhythms of Texan post-rockers Explosions in the Sky, with the recognizable old-school Sigur Ros vocals woven underneath.  Since I am a huge fan of Sigur Rós, Múm, and Explosions in the Sky, to me the new sound is fine and welcome -- in fact I prefer it over some of the more abstract previous works by Sigur Ros.  However, if you are looking for the long, sweeping progressive guitar-distorted-ambience sounds of Sigur Ros or if you are more into experimental music ala Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\", then I would say this album might not be for you.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|In 2004 Gwen Stefani took a leap and jumped out from being No Doubt's lead member to being a solo leader of her own, with her delicious debut 'Love.Angel.Music.Baby.'  The sound was fresh yet familiar and immediately struck a chord with many fans and critics alike, garnering several Grammy nominations including Album of the Year.  Sadly the standout singles; \\"What You Waiting For?\\", \\"Crash\\", and even \\"Cool\\" were blacked out by the major success of \\"Rich Girl\\", \\"Hollaback Girl\\" (Gwen's first #1 hit ever and the #2 song of the year), and even \\"Luxurious\\".   <br /> <br />Taking note of this, her second solo release 'The Sweet Escape' churned out even more mindless R&B and Rap like sound in hopes of duplicating the success of \\"Hollaback Girl\\".  I must admit, as many others shamefully do, that when I first heard \\"Hollaback Girl\\" I liked it, hell, I even... loved it.  Somehow, spelling out bananas and saying sh** thirty-eight times was entertaining.  I'm not criticizing the song, although many have, or any of the others with the same style from Gwen's debut.  They were alright but that was only three songs just 25% of the album. <br /> <br />'The Sweet Escape' on the other hand contains seven which is over half of the album, she strays away from pop which she does very well, and tries to conform for record sales and chart status.  The lead single, \\"Wind It Up\\" has already become a chart success (due mostly to downloads, the only thing that seems to matter at Billboard, instead of airplay as it used to and should be) peaking at #6.  Personally, I enjoy \\"Wind It Up\\" but like the one jewel in a pile of stones it's practically the only enjoyable 'upbeat' song. \\"Orange County Girl\\" sounds like something from the Orange County jail, an annoying slew of rap... from a white girl.  On \\"Now That You Got It\\", the title is repeated more times than sh** is repeated in \\"Hollaback Girl\\".   <br /> <br />Speaking of sh**, in \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" the chorus goes a little like this, \\"Don't get it twisted, don't get clever, this is the most craziest sh** ever.\\" Need I say more? On \\"Breakin' Up\\" every line is repeated two or three times in a row, which gets annoying about 30 seconds into the song.  While \\"Yummy\\" is mildly entertaining the lyrics are questionable (\\"Diet drama\\" and \\"I know you've been waiting but I've been off making babies, and like a chef making donuts and pastries it's time to make you sweat\\").  The title track is alright, the chorus makes up for the lacking verses. <br /> <br />Now, like I've already stated, here's the pop gems that Gwen shines on.  \\"Early Winter\\" is a beautiful track expressing that her and her lying lover are having an 'early winter'.  Next is \\"4 in the Morning\\" begging her lover to give her everything because she's given all of her.  In the sexy \\"Fluorescent\\" she's amazed by how wonderful her lover is.  \\"U Started It\\" is similar, giving in to what her lover started claiming \\"we argue sometimes but not tonight\\".  The ending track is also one of the best, in \\"Wonderful Life\\" she reminisces of a past lover but reminds herself it's a 'wonderful life'. <br /> <br />In the end, while the innovative L.A.M.B. flew with flying colors and easily passes with an A (4 ½ stars).  'The Sweet Escape' needs to find some originality and leaves me with a rotten taste in my mouth, barely passing with a C (2 ½ stars).
B000EGDC0A|3.0|OK, so Alison goes mainstream.  Yeah, she vamps it up (big time) in the videos (supplied on the DVD disc included in the deluxe edition), and even alludes to doing heroin in 'Ride a White Horse' (how chic).  Her stage show (also shown on the DVD) even features faceless, latex laden dancers luridly prancing about, sort of like a Madonna debauche-fest.  It's all supposed to sell records and get folks off their large butts to see her show.  And, sure enough, she's sold a bunch of units and her stage show is a big hit.  But the question begs to be asked: is this yet another talented artist who went for the big payday and instantly became irrelevant (a la The Dandy Warhols)?  Well, maybe ... not.<br /><br />Goldfrapp remains committed to the music.  And the seemless blending of '80's pop, electronica, and glam sensibilities really works here.  On the first track, 'Ooh La La', I thought Alison was channeling Marc Bolan (of T-Rex fame - before you were born, remember?).  No question, she and Will Gregory made a calculated turn away from the prosaic emotionalism of \\"Felt Mountain\\" (their first LP).  \\"Black Cherry\\" (their second LP) got them on a roll and, frankly, I would have preferred less glam on \\"Supernature\\" and more straight ahead alternative rock (a la 'Crystalline Green' found on \\"Black Cherry\\").  With this new LP, despite its pop leanings. there isn't a whole lot to complain about.  Every, and I mean every, track has a solid hook, soaring vocals and harmonies, interesting sonic treatments, or something else going for it.<br /><br />Alison's voice is amazing.  Coupled with the electronic wizardry of Will Gregory, Goldfrapp has put the music world on notice.  Hopefully, with their next LP, they'll add a percussionist and pour something more meaningful than campy schmaltz into the mix.<br /><br />For now, having just discovered this CD, I'm munching on the candy and enjoying the flavor by the mouthful.  I know, deep down though, that this candy probably just won't endure after 15 or 20 listens (at most).  It'll eventually cause cavities, in my brain.ens (at most).  It'll eventually cause cavities, in my brain.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Ok, I am a fan,  but I am not such a fanatic that I actually enjoy such disasters as Tango and Cash, Rhinestone(wince) or Stop or my mon will shoot(gag). I can tell you this, if you at all root for  the underdog story or are a fan of the original, you will love this film. I go to movies periodically, usually waiting for the dvd or cable. I had to see this film, mostly out of curiousity, also to give the film a chance. <br /> <br />The film was stunning,  moving and Stallone, not the most versatile actor, was absolutely believable and touching as the lovable lug, saddened by the recent death of his wife and still mourning the loss, his decision to fight again, he still has some stuff in the basement to get rid of. The film moves beautifully, the fight scenes are like a HBO special, at times reminiscent of raging bull. little Marie(screw you creepo! first movie) was outstanding as the female (love interest?)in the movie and has some touching moments with the rock. Paul Young as Paulie, was great and also had some touching scenes with Stallone. Apollo Creeds trainer makes an appearance,  short scenes,  but is great in the role.  <br />Rockys nemesis (Antonio Tarver)is also convincing as the underappreciated champion with something to prove. His scenes with his old trainer as his confidant, are very well done and convincing. <br /> <br />The Rocky series, has had its ups and downs,the last movie, was not a befitting end to the series. Stallone does a fitting tribute to one of the best movie stories ever told. <br /> <br />Stallone puts his all into the film, he looks absolutely amazing, he took this film seriously and went all out, I won't say its the best Rocky, but maybe I should!
B000002TQV|5.0|In 1995, a slightly-popular alt-rock band called Radiohead released their second album, THE BENDS, and suddenly their bubble of isolation burst and they found themselves in the spotlight.  In the minds of many fans, it was on THE BENDS that Radiohead was truly born; many people choose to ignore the group's underrated debut PABLO HONEY.  THE BENDS is certainly a wonderful place for one to begin investigating the sensational work of Radiohead. <br /> <br />On THE BENDS, Radiohead decided to take it up a notch from PABLO HONEY - actually, more like thirty notches.  The band carried over their airy sound from PABLO HONEY, but left behind their visceral attitude, replacing it with an atmosphere of dreamy confusion and bewilderment.  Sure, there's pounding drums and driving guitars, but Thom Yorke's voice makes it perfectly clear that the band feels as lost as they do frustrated.  Each of the album's 12 compositions are absolutely stellar, and it's hard to pick favorites.  One of the most popular songs from the album is \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", a sorrowful serenade played repeatedly in the teen comedy classic CLUELESS.  The lyrics are poignantly meaningful and brilliantly concealing, and the music itself is nothing short of excellent.  True, the production does sound a little rough, but that's part of the album's charm - something it has a lot of. <br /> <br />THE BENDS is considered by some Radiohead fans to be the band's finest record, and that's not hard to imagine - it's neither as pessimistic as OK COMPUTER nor as off-puttingly experimental as KID A, though it's clear on \\"Planet Telex\\" especially that the band was already beginning to experiment.  THE BENDS was an overwhelming critical success, hailed by many as the best album of 1995 and even by some as one of the best albums ever recorded (it was ranked 110th on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time).  It's lost none of its impressiveness or popularity since its release, and continues to astoundlegions of curious listeners.  If you're looking to investigate Radiohead, start here.
B000GY729M|2.0|Many of the other reviews already succinctly summed up the strengths and weakness of this album:    + The album strives to differentiate itself from Hot Fuss by focusing on hometown-based lyrics and less Britpop-infused sounds.    - Having said that, most of the album is rather droll and repetitive.  It is not so much BAD as it is simply mediocre: noisy, fuzzy, flat and forgettable.  If the original Killers sounded like a tribute to gritty turn-of-the-80's Iggy Pop and the Cure, the new Killers sound more like a tribute band to the Killers -- almost like they are doing a cheap cover-band imitation of themselves.  Aside from the popular radio single \\"When You Were Young\\", the rest of the album is nearly devoid of the catchy hooks and mind-penetrating off-kilter melodies that abounded in Hot Fuss.    It looks like the sophomore curse has reached yet another band.  I do have faith (and hope) that they might be able to find themselves again and branch into a wonderful new sound with a 3rd album, but for now I would recommend waiting it out and avoiding purchase of this one.
B000JLTRJ0|4.0|Though this film can be overlong, and I thought \\"United 93\\" was a better re-inactment of events, it's definitely time to tell the good that arose from the rubble. Great visuals; the feel of 9/11 comes across extremely well. But long extended pre-rescue and rescue scenes just don't hold the attention of film audiences for long. Not many multiple viewings for this type of movie on DVD.
0440418569|5.0|It's for kids, but will be appreciated by adults that like fantasy/star trek like stories as well.
0618680004|4.0|This is a much needed book that should have been written earlier. Although I welcome it as a step in the right direction I have several reservations about it. While Dawkins hopes that after reading this book a believer will become an atheist I just don't think he is tough enough on religion. For one thing, he is not using all the ammunition at his disposal. Not even the full implications of evolution and modern cosmology are analyzed. For another thing, he digresses into irrelevant subjects. Divinely ordered biblical genocide, Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition are entirely missing, but we do get paeans to the literal and cultural influence of the King James Bible. When I asked him about the omission of the Inquisition and the Crusades at a lecture he gave in New York he brushed it aside as something that \\"everybody knows.\\" Well, everybody does not know as a general murmor from the audience revealed, and these were not uneducated people but members of the New York Academy of Sciences. And missing also are non-Abrahamic religions, for reasons of \\"unfamiliarity.\\" This is a weak excuse for not having done your homework. Not just the track record of Abrahamic religions but the track record of religion in its entirety must be made clear. This is very important because people are not disturbed by what they do not know, and without a knowledge of such \\"strange\\" religions as those of Mesoamerica we simply do not comprehend the true evils that religion is capable of. But first let us look at what the book actually gives us. He very ably covers the ground that needs to be covered within his stated limitation to Abrahamic religions, shows the emptiness of proofs for God's existence and goes even beyond that by discussing some more primitive religions. Historically, Bertand Russell covered most of it in his 1927 essay \\"Why I Am Not a Christian.\\"(1) And more recently, Sam Harris has written a hard-hitting book \\"The End of Faith\\" (2) which Dawkins likes. That book drew thousands of letters from Christians with a hugely negative response which motivated him to respond by publishing another book called \\"A Letter to a Christian Nation.\\"(3) He laments in it that \\"This letter is a product of failure - the failure of the many brilliant attacks upon religion that preceded it - failures great and small that have kept almost every society on this earth muddling over God and despising those that muddle differently.\\" And he is right - true believers generally find a way to weasel-word themselves out of criticism that should settle the matter. It is not surprising then that the present book has also come under fire. Jim Holt headlines his critique of it in The New York Times Book Review as \\"Beyond Belief\\"(4). To him, reading the book is a little like watching a Michael Moore movie. He finds the least satisfying part of the book Dawkins's treatment of the traditional arguments for the existence of God - the ontological, cosmological and design arguments - which Dawkins rightly dismisses as vacuous  because they rely upon the idea of regress and invoke God to terminate it (5). And Darwinian evolution's ability to construct complex organisms is juxtaposed with the same old argument about entropy increase that a multitude of creationists have been using. And then he wants Dawkins to also tell him why there is a universe at all, a question that seems to bother theologians a lot! H. Allen Orr (6) who should know better also attacks him in the pages of The New York Review of Books. He is a geneticist but simply lacks a coherent view of nature. To him Dawkins is \\"...a kind of latter-day T. H. Huxley.\\" And then he attacks science itself: \\"Why... is Dawkins so untroubled by his own (large) assumption that both matter and the laws of nature can be viewed as given?\\" he asks.  That takes us back to the twelfth century Muslim philosopher Abu Hamid al-Ghazzali who objected to laws of nature simply because they would \\"...put God's hands in chains.\\" He was of course right. The result of unhanding God: no more Muslim science that amounted to anything. The rest of Orr is worse and descends to a name-calling orgy. Arguments about God can now be found even in a magazine like National Geographic. In the February 2007 issue John Horgan (7) interviews Francis Collins whose recent book \\"The Language of God\\"(8) embraces God and dismisses the conflict between science and religion by assuming that what is in the scripture should not be taken literally but figuratively. He is really good at sidestepping issues. When asked about religious terrorism he quips: \\"...we shouldn't judge the pure truths of faith by the way they are applied... We shouldn't blame faith for the ways people distort it and misuse it.\\" Five hundred years of inquisition - one third of the time that Chistianity was the dominant faith of Europe - was just a distortion then that does not count against God. On the problem of evil, he excuses God this way: \\"God gave us free will, and we may choose to exercise it in ways that end up by hurting other people.\\" Never mind the all-good, omniscient, omnipotent God of the theologians. At least one of these attributes has to be missing: he is either not omnipotent or he is not all-good. I vote for a malevolent God who is omnipotent and wishes us ill. Steven Weinberg (a physicist) once asked why six million jews, including his relatives, had to die in the Holocaust so that the Nazis could exercise their free will. Collins's take on this: \\"If God had to intervene miraculously every time one of us chose to do some evil, it would be a very strange, chaotic, unpredictable world.\\" Really. If the millions butchered in genocides did not move him to act why expect him to act on prayers of ordinary people? He is clearly a malevolent God who wanted this to happen. Consider his track record: twice he was involved in human sacrifice, once with Abraham where he relented. He instigated Joshua to murder everyone in Jericho and he himself oncedrowned the entire human race except for one family he kept as breeding stock.    But he is not the only malevolent God we know of: in the Old World Baal, his rival, very likely demanded human sacrifices as well since that is what Baal-Hammon worship at Carthage involved. So did another Caananite deity, Moloch. And the New World gods that we know of were almost all malevolent, dreaded deities that demanded human sacrifice on a grand scale. Here is how Marvin Harris (9) describes the temple precinct of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital:    Nowhere else in the world had there developed a state-sponsored religion whose art, architecture, and ritual were so thoroughly dominated by violence, decay, death, and disease. Nowhere else were walls and plazas of great temples and palaces reserved for such a concentrated display of jaws, fangs, talons, bones, and gaping death heads. The eyewitness accounts of Cortez and his fellow conquistador, Bernal Diaz, leave no doubt concerning the ecclesiastical meaning of the dreadful visages portrayed in stone. The Aztec gods ate people. They ate human hearts and they drank human blood. And the declared function of the Aztec priesthood was to provide fresh human hearts and human blood in order to prevent the remorseless deities from becoming angry and crippling, sickening, withering and burning the whole world.    As we shall see, the depths of human depravation under the theocratic empire of the Aztecs give a whole new meaning to the words \\"established religion.\\"     Another weak point of Dawkins is his lack of emphasis on the pernicious influence of belief in a soul that survives death. By excluding major non-Abrahamic religions, any discussion of the Hindu doctrine of \\"suttee\\" which derives directly from that belief is also eliminated. Suttee (or sati) means \\"dutiful wife.\\" The duty consists of a widow throwing herself into the flames of her dead husband's funeral pyre so that her soul can commune with his. Should she hesitate, her husband's relatives will give her a helping hand. It was made illegal by the British in 1831 but survived into the twentieth century in backwoods India. There are ultraorthodox Hindus who would like to reinstate it. This is just one example of the inhuman consequences that belief in the soul has caused. It is a very ancient belief. Thousands of years before the Bible was even written, the royal graves of the Old Kingdom pharaohs in Egypt were surrounded by \\"subsidiary\\" graves (10) of servants, sacrificed so that their souls could continue to serve their master in the next world. Likewise, the royal graves of Sumerian kings at Ur of the Chaldees contained the bodies of up to eighty five servants, also sacrificed so that their souls could provide a ghostly retinue for the departed king. And in Russia too, the Scythians who inhabited the steppes in the first millennium B.C. built royal graves called \\"kurgans\\" where the body of the king was accompanied by his queen and household members, all sacrificed to start his new household in the next world. But the Shan dynasty Chinese outdid them all. With their king they buried his concubines, his household members and his guards, enough to start a new royal court in the next world. Over a two hundred year period near the end of the second millennium B.C. they extracted the souls from thirty five thousand people for this worthy purpose.     I wish it were ancient history but it isn't. Muslim extremists are now utilizing belief in the soul to recruit suicide bombers. If you kill yourself for Allah, they are told, you are a martyr, your soul goes straight to paradise, you are rewarded there with seventy two virgins for your sexual pleasure, and thirty two of your relatives will get to heaven when they die without having to submit to final judgement. (11) Thousands of volunteers have signed up, the 9/11 hijackers among them. Even worse, we now see a spectacle of mothers praising their children's martyrdom, presumably because it gets themselves also into paradise regardless of their sins. And in the West we are not free of this superstition either: the concept of the soul still bedevils us in the guise of the \\"right to life\\" movement. For right-to-lifers, life starts at conception not because the genes from both parents are present but because the miracle of \\"ensoulment\\" has taken place: a soul has entered the fertilized egg. They know how weird this sounds so they don't talk about it much. But to them, that zygote with a soul and the embryo it grows into are complete human beings with \\"rights.\\" Which makes abortion as well as use of the early embryo as a source of stem cells murder and explains their irrational stand against stem cell research. And the soul dispossessed by stem cell research goes straight to hell through no fault of its own because it is filled with Adam's \\"original sin\\" which only baptism can remove. In case you wonder what part of the Bible this comes from, it doesn't. Moses was entirely ignorant of the existence of a soul, Ecclesiastes did not know about it either, and Paul insisted that it is not a soul at all but a dead human body, raised from the grave on Resurrection Day and made \\"incorruptible,\\" that goes to heaven.      Human sacrifice of children was also apparently a practice in biblical times, judging by the story of Abraham who agreed to sacrifice his son to God. Baal, god of the Phoenicians and a bane to the priests of Yahweh, was also god of the Carthaginians who called it Baal-Hammon. He demanded burnt offerings of Carthaginian children who had to be brought to the temple by the mother (12). \\"Mother and child\\" statuettes, found in Carthaginian settlements in Corsica, testify to this custom. The child was roasted in a temple oven or on an outdoor burning ground known as a tophet. In Carthage, a children's cemetery (13) still survives. Thousands of victims as well as a few dogs are buried there, suggesting that under some conditions it was permissible to substitutea dog for a child. In the New World, human sacrifice was nearly universal. Best known is the Aztec custom of sacrificing and then eating war prisoners. The emperor was also the high priest who presided at the more important ceremonies.  On top of a pyramid now called \\"Templo Mayor\\" in Mexico City were two temples, one dedicated to the rain god Tlaloc and another one to their chief god Huichilopochtly. When Cortez, the conquistador, was still emperor Montezuma's guest he was taken up the 114 steps of the great pyramid and was shown three hearts being burned and numerous other hearts of victims they had sacrificed that day. (14) The smell, his companions reported, was worse than that in a Spanish slaughterhouse. The victims of Tlaloc were children and they had to be made to cry because it was out of their tears that he created rain. Huichilopochtly's victims were mostly war prisoners as befits a war god. Victims  were fattened for sacrifice since they were to become food of the gods (15). Four priests held the victim spread-eagled on the altar while a fifth one opened the chest with an obsidian knife and took out the still-beating heart (16). Arms and legs belonged to the soldier who captured him and were used in a sacred meal for which recipes have survived. The trunk was thrown to the jaguars and heads of victims were posted on a head rack called a tzompantli in temple square. This was not a small operation, for their empire stretched from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In addition to supplying prisoners for sacrifice at the capital local towns had their own gods that were just as bloodthirsty (17).  In 1521, when Cortez with his conquistadors and indian allies finally took over Tenochtitlan, they found more than two hundred thousand human heads on display in the temple district. These were not only on tzompantlis but also cemented together into a towerlike structure. Aztec sources related that at the dedication of the great pyramid in 1487 four lines of prisoners stretching for two miles each were sacrificed by a team of executioners who worked day and night for four days (18). An estimated 14,100 prisoners lost their lives in that single event which remains the only competitor to the efficiency of the Nazi killing machine at Auschwitz. According to one version of Aztec theology their god Huichilopochtly was a creator god in charge of the present or fifth world, four previous ones having been created and destroyed by a medley of other gods. His rule for the Aztecs of this world: bring me human blood every day or I will destroy your world too. The Aztecs obliged by sacrificing war prisoners to him. But to get war prisoners you need a war. Another city, Tlaxcala, had a similar God problem and periodically they went to war against each other. These wars were called \\"flower wars\\" and when both sides had taken enough prisoners peace was declared and everyone went back to worshiping their gods again. Possibly one in four Mesoamerican males ended up as food of the gods this way. It is true that New World human sacrifice does enter the book but only peripherally, through a news item about a young girl sacrificed by the Incas. He rightly criticises multiculturalist attempts to justify such atrocities as integral to native culture but then just drops the entire subject and thereby misses the true impact of what human sacrifice really meant in the Americas.     As to religion in general, no matter which one you look at it demands accepting a delusionary lifestyle. Religion is a product of human social evolution, made possible by possession of language, and is still evolving. It resists rational discourse because childhood indoctrination is effectively permanent. In biology, such behavior is called imprinting and there is a fair chance that something like imprinting has imprisoned the minds of the religious from childhood on. The Jesuits were right when they said \\"Give me a child until seven and I will give you the man.\\" In people like Collins that indoctrination was temporarily suppressed by education until it surfaced again when a suitable rationalization appeared. That rationalization to him was belief that God has miraculously put a \\"moral law\\" into our heads, something that C. S. Lewis (19) dreamed up in his book called \\"Mere Christianity.\\" But this is contradicted by the meticulous observations of Marc Hauser (20) in \\"Moral Minds.\\"  He carefully observes the development of moral behavior in children from infancy to adolescence and postulates the existence of a moral instinct similar to the language instict we all have. While imprinting by childhood indoctrination explains the persistence of religion it does not explain its origin. Possession of language is the sine qua non of religion which puts the probable date for its inception at least sixty thousand years into the past. Since practically all religions have some form of afterlife we also need a reason for introducing it from the start. With this in mind, it is likely that the initial stimulus was the very strong and long-lasting human emotion of grief that we share with other mammals. Suppose, for example, that Ugh, a stone age hunter, has been stepped on by a mastodon and is dead but his grieving wife has a dream in which he is still alive. She speaks about it to the local herbalist who says something like this: \\"Oh yes, he is alive in that happy hunting ground - and I know the head man there if you want to contact him.\\" Wishful thinking will make her want to believe this and not much more is needed to start a primitive religion. Word of mouth then garbles the details and all sorts of miraculous things become attributed to the head man, family and tribe of that happy hunting ground. \\"Psychics\\" today play the same game. Although it is possible that originally there was only one religion this is so easy that it could have happened multiple times in different groups. But belief in miracles that goes back to primitive religions is still withus. Collins in the National Geographic interview maintains they are real but then cops out by claiming that they are so rare that he personally does not expect to see one. By this device his view becomes empirically congruent with expectations of those of us for whom the world is controlled only by laws of nature.     And this view, if you like, is what constitutes the scientific world view. The most basic of these laws is quantum mechanics and its relativistic extension to nuclear matter known as the \\"Standard Model.\\" Thanks to its validity throughout the observable universe we know the conditions in distant galaxies since they are coded into the quantum properties of light reaching us. Quantum mechanics also controls the interactions between atoms from which the laws of chemistry derive. Linus Pauling in fact got his first Nobel prize working out the details of this in the thirties. And these laws of chemistry in turn control all chemical reactions in the universe, including all biochemical reactions that take place within living matter. Hence all life activities that are manifest to us are enabled by this underlying quantum layer of reality, leaving no room for anything like souls. Ruled out also are ghosts, spirits, gods, angels and devils, all guilty of violating the rules of quantum mechanics. There has never been an instance where quantum mechanical predictions of any kind have not been followed to the utmost precision by nature. The Bayesian probability of such sustained and correlated precision over the volume of cosmic space and time is so astronomical as to be incalculable. A true believer can still say \\"God made it so and he can change it if he wants to.\\" But more intelligent religionists like Collins know that the game is up and have decided to put God into hiding, somewhere outside of nature and outside of space and time (21). From that safe haven, they think, he can still make incursions into our universe. If so, there is absolutely no evidence that he has ever done so or ever will.

B00000294R|3.0|please, don't hate on me for just giving this 3 stars.. i'm a huge d.i.t.c. fan and i got love for L (rest in peace). but this album isn't really that great. L is a ill lyricist far above your average, but the freestyle flow and lack of concept in many songs makes me kind of bored. also i don't think the beats are what they could be. you can't even compare them to the beats on the true ditc-classics: funky technician, word life, runaway slave, awakening, stunt blunts & hiphop etc. <br />and let's be real about it... this lp isn't even top 10 from 1995. <br />doe ore die, krs-one, dah shinin, livin proof, liquid swords, ob4cl, legal drug money, good fellas, labcabin california, 2000, soul food are all much better albums.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|What a sad, dreary movie this was.  I'm dumbfounded by all the people claiming this is the funniest movie they've ever seen.  Even the actors looked bored making it.  I'm pretty sure Steve Carell was sleep walking through most of this big snooze fest.
6302886228|5.0|I saw this concert on VHS in the 90's.  I was lucky to find it at my video store.  Now, of course, it is practically unavailable on VHS, and not at all on DVD.  Why?  It is one of the  finest tribute concerts ever.  Each performance seems to rival the next for quality, and it goes on for at least a couple of hours.  For me, two of the highlights are Johnny Winter's revelatory version of Highway 61 Revisited and Vedder's Masters of War.  Who's here?  Oh, no one, just The Band, George Harrison, Eddie Vedder, Lou Reed, Neil Young, Roger Mcguinn and anyone the producers asked. Now, a lineup like that can lead either to epiphany or a terrible mistake.  Luckily, the former was the result.  One day it will go to DVD (how much longer they can ignore it may depend on the sagacity of whoever is minding Dylan's business end). and then everyone may get to experience this unforgettable night.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This movie was really scary when I was younger. Not so much now. Some parts of the movie still made me jump a little. Other than that it's still a good movie.
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|This is a very good concert DVD by an excellent band but the problem was that they left off so many classic Eagle songs.  Why didn't they perform \\"Heartache Tonight,\\" \\"The Long Run,\\" \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling,\\" \\"One Of These Nights,\\" \\"Lyin' Eyes,\\" \\"New Kid In Town,\\" etc.?  Also, even though Henley is my favorite member of the band, he sings too many songs here and Frey only got to sing three.  The first 2/3 of this DVD also only feature softer songs and the rock songs don't come until the end.  Plus, I think there is more chemistry and band interaction on the Farewell 1 DVD than there is on Hell Freezes over.  Now, with all that aside, I'll talk about what does work.  \\"Hotel California\\" is great in its alternate acoustic version even though I prefer the electric version but at least this one has Felder on guitar.  \\"Wasted Time\\" is probably better here (but still great on Farewell 1) since you have Henley behind the drums, Felder on guitar, and more shots of Walsh on organ.  \\"In The City\\" is great here but its just as good on Farewell 1.  \\"Get Over It\\" is an excellent song and performed very well featuring great guitar work from Walsh, Felder, and Frey although Henley I feel should have been behind the drums on that one.  \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" is great here but just as good on Farewell One.  \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" is a stand out here particularly for Felder's guitar solos.  \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" makes its debut here even if it's just as good on Farewell One.  \\"Desperado\\" is much better on Hell Freezes Over\\" than on Farewell 1 because you have the Eagles PLAYING the song rather than the backing musicians.  Some Henley solo stuff like \\"New York Minute\\" seem to drag a little, but \\"The Heart Of The Matter\\" does work well.  \\"The Last Resort\\" is a bit long but it is still performed very well.  Another real bonus is the interview and rehearsal footage.  So, this is a very good DVD but it could have been much better if more classic Eagle songs were included but what does work here works very well.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Awake by Josh Groban is great.  My two favorites are You Are Loved (Don't Give Up) & February Song.  I am not particularly fond of the song with Herbie Hancock, \\"Machine.\\"  The rest of the CD, however, is very enjoyable.  This is my first Josh Groban CD, although I did receive Closer for Christmas as well.  In reading some of the reviews, it sounds like the other CDs are excellent as well.  This man's voice is incredible.  I rate this CD a solid 4 stars.  I suspect it could grow to 5 stars with subsequent listenings.  A worthy entry to any music collection.
0385720920|4.0|The votes are pretty much in on Palahniuk, but allow me a few lines, since this is the first book of his I've read. I was turned on to him by the girl who does my hair, who said people fainted and vomited at his readings. With that endorsement in mind, I picked up Choke, CP's first best-seller. The story is one of a sex addict and his troubled relationship with his crazy mother, who is dying in a hospital. That's about it for plot, though we do follow our anti-hero to sex addiction meetings, his colonial Williamsburg-esque job site, and on visits to the strip clubs. This book is not so much about content as it is about style. And stylistically, it is a fast paced narrative filled with unrelenting cynicism. In the care of worse writers than CP, this could get tiresome and grim. But Choke is a laugh-out-loud funny book. The early chapter on the sex addiction meetings is hilarious. What is better than sex?, our narrator asks us. It's perhaps the best chapter in the book. The novel is really a lamentation. Victor could be called Jeremiah for all the teeth gnashing he does. The novel reminded a lot of Kurt Vonnegut. The \\"it's the first word that comes to mind\\" line that is repeated throughout reminded me of the \\"so it goes\\" line from Slaughterhouse Five. My main problems was with the ending, which is convoluted, rushed, and altogether unsatisfying. The later chapter on trysts in airplanes could've been left on the cutting room floor. But on the whole, this is a good book. I'm not sure if I'll read more CP soon. But I'm glad I read Choke.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I can remember attending a beer bust attended by \\"20 somethings\\" in the mid-seventies, in which the host played nothing but Beatles' albums. At the time it seemed odd that a host would chose a \\"retro\\" music format. Fast forward.  To borrow a phrase, listening to The Beatles Love blew my mind.  What a joy to experience again the gensius of musicians who can write, play and sing...really sing. Wow. Phil.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I waited a long time to purchase this DVD.  It wasn't because of the set list because the band chose basically all the classic Eagles songs plus some solo hits from Walsh, Henley, and one from Frey along with three new songs.  It wasn't because I wasn't an Eagles fan because they are one of my favorite bands.  It was because Don Felder was absent.  But then I started to read reviews of the DVD which were mostly very positive and I rationalized that I did own the Who DVD (post Moon) Royal Albert Hall and I still think it's outstanding so I figured why not give the Eagles Farewell 1 tour a shot.  I'm very glad that I did because it has become one of my favorite concert DVDs.  The sound on this DVD is amazing and the camera work is fantastic.  Also, like the other reviewers said, the Eagles perform their songs as they should be heard and they perform almost all their classic songs and then some.  Okay, Felder is absent from the concert, but Henley, Frey, Walsh, and Schmitt help you forget about him plus Stuart Smith plays Felder's parts just as Felder would have played them.  Plus, Felder never sang lead vocals that much with the Eagles and the Eagles are a band that concentrates on vocals as much as instruments.  Speaking of the band, they all sound great.  Henley has gained some weight but his singing is still top notch, his drumming and percussion skills are both excellent, and he even plays some acoustic and electric guitar.  He is an underated musician but his drumming was always a vital part of the Eagles sound just like his singing.  Frey thankfully sings a lot more here than he did on Hell Freezes Over (only 3 songs on that one).  Some reviewers said his voice was going a little but I totally disagree.  His voice (probably best voice in the band) still is outstanding and he does a fantastic job on guitar and keyboards.  Frey is also underated as a musician but his guitar and keyboard playing were also vital to the Eagles sound.  Frey is also the one who talks to the audience the most during the concert.  Walsh is definitely a true rock and roll star.  Both his guitar playing and singing during this concert are extraordinary.  He is definitely one of the best American guitar players ever.  Some Eagles fans did not think Walsh fit in with the band but I have to disagree.  Songs like \\"Hotel California,\\" \\"The Long Run,\\" \\"Life In The Fast Lane,\\" and \\"Heartache Tonight\\" would not have sounded as good without Walsh.  Schmitt is a little bit overshadowed by the other three in terms of singing but he still does a fantastic job on his two signatures songs (\\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" and \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\") and on bass and high harmonies.  Oddly enough, Schmitt is the only one who plays his instrument on every song throughout the DVD (there is at least one song where the other 3 only sing without playing anything).  The extra musicians do not hurt the performance at all and the horn section works here unlike with some other bands such as on The Who's Encore Disc of Tommy and Quadrophenia live.  The spotlight is still on Henley, Frey, Walsh, and Schmitt.  Highlights of this concert include \\"Heartache Tonight,\\" \\"Hotel California,\\" \\"Life In The Fast Lane,\\" \\"Already Gone,\\" \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling,\\" \\"Lyin' Eyes,\\" \\"Dirty Laundry,\\" \\"Take It Easy,\\" \\"In The City,\\" \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"You Belong To The City,\\" \\"Funk 49,\\" \\"The Boys Of Summer,\\" \\"New Kid In Town,\\" \\"One Of These Nights,\\" \\"I Can't Tell You Why,\\" \\"Tequila Sunrise,\\" \\"Wasted Time,\\" \\"The Long Run,\\" \\"Rocky Mountain Way,\\" \\"One Day At A Time,\\" \\"Life's Been Good,\\" and \\"Hole In The World.\\"  The only performance that doesn't do it for me is \\"Desperado.\\"  Don't get me wrong because I really like that song, but none of the Eagles really PLAY on it this time.  Frey doesn't play piano like he should and Henley should be behind the drums.  The performance for Hell Freezes Over is better.  That's the only let down, but Henley still sings the song very well.  For those who appreciate good humor, watchFrey and Walsh during \\"All She Wants To Do Is Dance.\\"  Anyway, if you are an Eagles fan and appreciate good music I would definitely recommend this DVD.  It's one of the best filmed concerts ever produced.
B000JLTRKE|1.0|First they blew it with United 93, now this. I'm not saying that the two cops that this film is about didn't deserved to have their story told. But what about the thousands of other people who died in the Twin Towers? Ironic how the film is called 'World Trade Center' but there is not one freakin scene in the movie that takes place inside the Twin Towers. Viewers should know what THOSE people went through as well and what compelled some of them to jump out of the windows. Instead, the movie bores us with overlong scenes of idle chit-chat of the two trapped cops and annoying \\"tear-jerker\\" scenes of their bawling wives. Give us a break!!!
B00005JKGO|4.0|Long considered a major filmmaker, Federico Fellini established his reputation through an insistence on the interest-value of his own fantastic and idiosyncratic vision of the world... In so doing, however, he repeatedly lays himself open to charges of egomania, self-indulgence and superficiality; certainly much of his work, if visually extraordinary, is hyperbolic, naïve and incoherent...<br /><br />This film about the hedonistic, amoral life of Rome's \\"beautiful people\\" is really a series of startling episodes held together by a character played by Marcello Mastroianni, a gossip columnist who is himself caught up in the aimless, scandalous \\"sweet life.\\"<br /><br />Filled, like all Fellini films, with stunning, bizarre images and faces and marked by the director's wild comic imagination, the film was widely condemned as \\"vulgar, witless, and intellectually bankrupt\\" and lavishly praised as \\"a cultural and social document, as well as an exciting entertainment.\\"<br /><br />\\"La Dolce Vita\\" moves from one shocking sequence to another... It is a sprawling epic satire on what Fellini considered the spiritual malaise of modern society... It followed a journalist employed by a scandal magazine around a Rome obsessed with orgiastic parties, voluptuous film stars and the commercial marketing of religion... While its images are flamboyant--a statue of Christ flying above Rome suspended from a helicopter, Anita Ekberg dancing in the Trevi fountain, a kitten on her head--the film's despairing tone often rings meaningless, even though Mastroanni's compulsive womanizer, never glamorized, fails to achieve redemption...
B00005JPE7|5.0|Never underestimate Stallone.  The mere appearance of this film is proof of a determination and drive that only Balboa himself can match...but they're the same guy, literally.<br /><br />I'm sure film theorists may have something to say about Balboa/Stallone, however the Great Man must be credited with pulling off a successful sequel, by previous sequel standards.  The abysmal V and the ridiculous IV wash away as Stallone returns to...Part I to bring the whole thing together.  Back in his old 'hood, hat on head, hitting sides of beef, running up the museum steps, talking about getting hit and still going, feeding his turtles, being a lovable palooka, it's all here.<br /><br />You know what the story is about, if not, go read one of the other 800 reviews.  Balboa wants to get back in the ring, bottom line.  He's old.  He's an underdog.  He's insane.  But he wants to do it...so he does it.  Ditto Stallone.  It took many years of struggle and a different studio to put together this relatively low budget sequel that will make a nice chunk of change when all is said and done.  Stallone brings back everybody, even Adrian in flashbacks, and even Duke, who appears to have filmed only a trailer, to once again stand in the big guy's corner as he battles a superior opponent.<br /><br />The brain damage of Part V is not mentioned, but no matter.  They just disregard it.  Rocky at 60 getting into the ring with the champ?  Hey, it can happen.  Stallone got into tremendous physical shape for the film, and he's 60, so there.  Anything can happen when Sly puts his mind to it.<br /><br />You either accept that Stallone is out of his mind and move on and enjoy what is a good sequel and better than half of them, or avoid it.
0312330871|5.0|The classic \\"who done it!\\" What most people have come to think of when a murder mystery is mentioned. Most modern day \\"murder mysteries\\" bore me as I usually figure out early on who the culprit is and how the crime was committed. Although I had the \\"who\\" figured out in this mystery, I could not figure out the \\"how.\\" And one thing I absolutely love about a mystery is trying to keep solving it...all the way to the end! <br /> <br />Ten people whose lives are not connected in any way, are invited by a very mysterious host(ess) to a luxurious house on a somewhat remote island for a brief getaway. Very soon after their arrival, each is accused of having brought about the death of another person and for that they are to pay. When, one by one, they are discovered dead, it is time to try to figure out who - and where - the killer is and try to stop him or her from continuing their murderous rampage before all are killed! <br /> <br />This novel is evenly paced and easy to read. Agatha Christie seems to have covered all of her bases on this one to leave the reader attempting to figure out the clues. The book keeps the reader involved, tracing over the clues and the guests in the house, while moving through the story and wondering - who might be the next victim? And exactly who can the killer be? <br /> <br />A well thought out mystery, very well done! <br />
B000GGSMB2|5.0|Seriously, could someone please tell me why all these hip-hop, poser clowns have attached themselves to this film? Sorry, but none of you have the remotest thing in common with Tony Montegna. You probably couldn't even name another Brian DePalma film. I didn't buy the last \\"special\\" edition because of the ridiculous Def Jam \\"rappers waxing 'poetic' about Scarface\\" DVD. What a joke! But then again, hip hop culture is a joke, so what do you expect.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this DVD is great and the movie is great. What else is there to say? This movie is atmospheric and stands the test of time.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|'The English Patient' is a love story set in Europe as World War II ends... It is a wartime romance mystery epic, like 'Hiroshima, Mon Amour,' 'The Sweet Hereafter,' and 'After Life.' Anthony Minghella weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque, and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience...<br /><br />This adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of 'Casablanca' and 'Dr. Zhivago.' The film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed... Told in flashback, it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse...<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, Count Laszlo de Almasy, a Hungarian cartographer of few words, who works for the British government, and is stationed in the North African desert...<br /><br />Count Laszlo is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the Allies, taken into custody by a medical convoy in Italy, and essentially left to die in peace, in an isolated monastery in Tuscany, under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine, and reads to him a book, considered his great treasure, and his one surviving possession...<br /><br />Hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories, wrapped up in his head, released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind...<br /><br />Fiennes gives a haunted, pained performance, playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his heart's capacity for passion... He makes us sympathize with the character in showing self-doubt and weakness... As a badly burned man, he has only cherished memories... His joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes... He remembers falling under the spell of an attractive English married woman... He remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love... His tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture...<br /><br />Kristin Scott Thomas matches Fiennes' work with a radiant sensuality... She is captivating as the married European woman, conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the Count finds irresistible... Their different world, despairing and hopeful, menacing and resilient, is simply beautiful... With intense passion and intelligence, this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife...<br /><br />Juliette Binoche seems to shine as the French-Canadian nurse full of life and energy... This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold, kissing wounded soldiers, but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her...<br /><br />Colin Firth is good as Katherine's husband... He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent... He quickly becomes friend of the Count, yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery, his face reflected a peaceful fury...<br /><br />William Dafoe plays a double-agent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm... He is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda... This cunning Canadian man seems to know of some dark secret in Almasy's past... He believes the 'English patient' is partially responsible for the mutilation of his hands, and is busy seeking revenge on everyone even remotely involved...<br /><br />Naveen Andrews is Hana's ardent lover... He is a handsome Sikh, and an explosives expert with a dangerous job... There's a scene that is stuck in my head because it literally had me on the edge of my seat for what seemed an eternity... In this particular scene, the military sapper has to cut the wires on a bomb that has been hidden on a bridge... It's on a timer and he only has a few minutes left... The scene cuts back and forth between his tense face, the wires and his dirty fingers as they try madly to figure out how to untangle and cut the wires without detonating the bomb...<br /><br />All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in \\"The English Patient.\\" John Seale's cinematography is breathtaking, and Gabriel Yared's majestic music is dreamy, and romantic... This is a rich motion picture with ambition and style, a fever dream, lyrical and complex... We are almost able to feel the heat of the desert, the pain of the burnings, the intimate flush of humanity that becomes the most haunting element of this epic love story...es without detonating the bomb...  <br /> <br />All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in \\"The English Patient.\\" John Seale's cinematography is breathtaking, and Gabriel Yared's majestic music is dreamy, and romantic...

B000ILYYJE|5.0|The Doors just keep on going into the 21st century with this, yet another release of the same freaking albums.<br /><br />I didn't buy 'The Complete' studio album box set ('Complete' is a lie).  I didn't buy the other remasters I've seen.  But this...how many more times can something be remastered?  How good does it need to sound?  By virtue of the fact that I 'only' have the 'old' remasters or whatever they were, the discs from the mid-90s or so, I considered picking this up.<br /><br />Sure enough...I found this half-price at a music store liquidating its stock (a common thing these days).  And it's certainly well worth it for that much.  So I can sort of recommend depending on how many other versions of the albums you already have.  If you've not been through the 38 or so versions of The Doors, Strange Days, and the rest, this might be a real treat to hear the material remastered and interestingly, remixed.<br /><br />Once again, they've bothered to once again trickle out some unreleased material (another take of this song, some studio chatter, another jam, etc, etc, etc).  Do they have tapes of Morrison passing gas that perhaps they can release, too?  These guys intend on living forever, so that by 90 they finally release some 'unreleased' song nobody has heard in 70 years.  And more photos.<br /><br />The box certainly looks nice, shaped like a door and all, complete with a peep hole on the box itself.  When you look inside, the see the zeros on Manzarek and Co's bank accounts.<br /><br />Of course, it's very overpriced.  I guess they want to target this to, you know, the millions of people out there with no Doors albums and a hundred bucks to blow on a whim.  The Doors are evil...they bother to put out 'Boot Yer Butt' a few years ago, compiling bootlegged material (including some very rare stuff as well as other bits in awful quality) and limit the run to a few thousand copies, but they push this thing out...the same albums.  And still no sign of the two post-Morrison albums on CD.  They are unbelievably and completely shameless.  Okay guys, you got me.  Here, take more of my money.  And now I'm updating to write that they have indeed taken my money.vably and completely shameless.  Okay guys, you got me.  Here, take more of my money.

0393061434|3.0|Wosniak talked some about the Apple company, barely anything about partner Steve Jobs, but nearly every detail detail of his childhood, which was a disappointment for me. <br /> <br />Much of his time was spent relating incidents that were of minor interest (he ran a Dial-A-Joke) and just skipped over the endings of stories that I wanted to know the outcome of, such as what happened to his close friends involved in a serious accident WITH HIM. (He did mention their fate later, but I found this storytelling practice infuriating. He used it several times.) <br /> <br />Then there were Wosniak's \\"fun\\" pranks he played on ususpecting victims. I thought they were decidely unfunny, thoughtless, even mean-spirited and dangerous. <br /> <br />He was repetitive. Repetitive, as in \\"As I already told you...\\"  <br /> <br />SO WHERE DO THE THREE STARS COME FROM? Though I really hated the self-absorbed book, I was very happy I stuck through it for the last ten minutes of the last CD (8th).  <br /> <br />Wosniak didn't continue on about himself-- he talked about helping children, gave compassionate advice to awkward kids on might want to become engineers and he gave a gracious tribute to Steve Jobs. Last ten minutes? Definately five stars.
B00005JPE7|3.0|With the first Rocky film, we are introduced to a decidedly American character.  A true blue collar hero who inspires the quiet majority is certainly a great accomplishment.  Sylvester Stallone merely looks outside at the real world and reflects in his film the squalor and the near-squalor surrounding and pressuring his main character.  We watch as he struggles to be the right man for a woman.  He struggles with his dreams and feelings of inadequacy, and through it all, we connect with him emotionally and we subsequently celebrate his victories.    The second film is essentially a director's extension to the first film, and it continues and concludes much more storyline than Stallone probably intended.  Stallone is so complete with the first Rocky movies that the third, fourth, and fifth movies have nowhere believable to begin, and it's painful to watch Stallone brutalize a character that he worked so hard to build.    Rocky Balboa is interesting to me because it shows how poor and unnecessary the third, fourth, and fifth Rocky films really are.  There's no need for Rocky to overcome the overly racial-ized Clubber Lang in Rocky III, or the Cold War Russian in Rocky IV.  By far the worst of the series, Rocky V nearly obliterates everything human about Rocky Balboa, turning him into a selfish jerk; he's always self-centered, but only in Rocky V does he make that unsympathetic turn into selfishness.    But with this final chapter, Stallone has attempted to own the mistakes of his Rocky series as well as finally write a conclusion worthy of the character he created 30 years ago.  Yes, the older Rocky lectures to us in clichés and he tells us \\"something [we] already know,\\" but he does it in a manner that is believable and insightful within the context of the character.  Stallone has rendered a good sense of desperation and pain for his older Rocky.  It's likely Stallone himself is going through these very same feelings as he ages and looks back at some mistakes and missteps in his career as well as the moments of greatness.    My uncle is 50 years old and in fantastic shape.  After seeing the film with his kids, he thought the film didn't have enough action and that it was more about thinking and feeling than the Rocky he knows.  His description of the film is accurate, but I'm not sure what else one can expect from Stallone.  Stallone is 60 years old and in great, great shape for his age.  He gives as good a physical display as possible in this final film, and he does not appear broken or apologetic because of his age.  There are few movies out there that actually respect the aging and the elderly.  Stallone has found a way.    It's also great to see Rocky continue to learn and not settle on old prejudices.  This struggle may be even more difficult than the physical challenges of the film.  Stallone displays a matured tenderness in a Platonic relationship with a younger woman that I wasn't expecting, and I appreciated the gesture.  Stallone seems to have touched on nearly everything in the Rocky world, tying up loose ends, finishing things.  Rocky Balboa could easily have been the conclusion to a trilogy instead of a disclaimer about what Stallone meant to say.    In the end, the film works for me.  Despite being sentimental, I actually believed Stallone's older Rocky, mostly because it's clear that Stallone believes what he's saying and doing in this film.  Better late than never.
B000ASSDVA|4.0|The ballad of the Cid, the story of Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar, who on his white stallion Babieca drove away the Moors from Spain and took to wife the proud Chimene who had sworn to kill him but lived to love him and became the mother of his daughters, has, like so many ballad of chivalry and heroism, come down to us from medieval times...<br /><br />It was left to Anthony Mann, director of the best Westerns of the 'fifties, to make the purest example of the the epic: the famous \\"El Cid.\\"<br /><br />With that stern, intense face and athletic figure, Charlton Heston was ideally cast... His performance was inspirational, pure and profoundly beautiful... He was indeed 'the only man in Spain who could humble a king and would give a leper a drink.'<br /><br />The grandeur of the film lead to a deeply moving climax: Inside the walled city of Valencia, the dying Cid, aware that his men might fall into confusion with the next attack of the Moors without him in command, and knowing that he cannot last the night, obtained the promise from Chimene and his closest friends that they will bind him upright on his horse and, with his king beside him, he will ride out at the head of his soldiers the following morning...<br /><br />As dawn breaks and the Spanish troops are maintaining steady their position, waiting inside the gates in silence as their leaders rides through upright and firm of face, the gates of the city swing open and the rays of the sun transmit their sparkling light over the Spanish hero... Their lances and helmets emit a source of energy as the white-bearded warrior, on his white stallion, rides out the gates of history and into legends... Miklos Rozsa's organ raised more the exaltation for these great images were themselves mythical...<br /><br />In Rodrigo's character we discover great qualities of an unusual man: He is merciful and courageous, a man of honor, a great champion... He also is a faithful ally, a man of justice, a man of principle, a loving father and a passionate husband...<br /><br />The performance of the entire cast was exceptional: Sophia Loren played the lovely Chimene, the latent force of Rodrigo; John Fraser played the weak, ineffective King Alfonso; Raf Vallone played Count Ordo&ntilde;ez, the Cid's traitorous rival for Chimene's hand; Herbert Lom was the fanatical Moorish warlord and Frank Thring was Al Kadri, the evil ruler of Valencia...<br /><br />Mann's epic features an eyeful of flashy costumes, impressive settings and big battle scenes, and like its legendary hero, creates great spectacle and great epic...her and a passionate husband... <br /> <br />The performance of the entire cast was exceptional: Sophia Loren played the lovely Chimene, the latent force of Rodrigo; John Fraser played the weak, ineffective King Alfonso; Raf Vallone played Count Ordoñez, the Cid's traitorous rival for Chimene's hand; Herbert Lom was the fanatical Moorish warlord and Frank Thring was Al Kadri, the evil ruler of Valencia... <br /> <br />Mann's epic features an eyeful of flashy costumes, impressive settings and big battle scenes, and like its legendary hero, creates great spectacle and great epic...  <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore was able to tie his life which to me presented \\" our lives\\" \\" our own memories\\" in a world that seems to be fading away by humankind's unawareness of the destruction of our earth.  <br /> <br />This documentary opened my eyes to what we could lose, what my children in the future will not be able to see or touch in their adult life. They will see the places I've been to in pictures or movies.  <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviewer why isn't this DVD a bit more affordable as I would love to send this to all my family and friends so we could all help in saving our earth.  <br /> <br />Thank you for making this documentary I hope that the powers that be open their eyes to this as well.  <br /> <br />
B000000XBC|4.0|If you are just looking for a CD with some great CCR songs get Vol. 1. This CD has a title that is not completely correct. It is more a collection of covers or songs that have influenced the sound of CCR. \\"Mary Lou\\", \\"Suzie Q\\" etc. Some songs rock, some are a little on the tacky sound or are just good songs.  <br />Certainly not a great CD, but if you are a fan and want to know more about the development of the band. Country, old blues, rock 'n roll etc.
B00005JPDS|5.0|The Pursuit of Happyness is the sad but uplifting true story of millionairre stockbroker Chris Gardner. Will Smith (Hitch) plays Gardner with such a sincerity that I will be rooting for him to win this year's Oscar for Best Actor when, not if, he is nominated.  <br /> <br />The movie pursues Gardner as he struggles with cash, which ends him up on the street with his son, played by Smith's real life son Jaden, who in my opinion deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance as well. After being evicted from his home for failing to pay the rent, Gardner goes from the subway restroom to homeless shelters, as his dream of becoming a stockbroker takes it's first but difficult steps as a non-paid intern at a major stock brokerage firm.  <br /> <br />Pursuit teaches us that we must follow our dreams no matter what might happen. It is truly an inspirational movie that should garner many Oscar nominations including one for Best Picture, and one for Best Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton who plays Gardner's impatient wife, as well as an award nomination and win for both Smith and son! <br /> <br />One of the best films of 2006. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A <br /> <br />
B000E1155E|5.0|My friend recently gave me this CD, and I have to say I am very impressed with this band's debut album.  I'm a teenager who mostly listens to bands who are dead or broken up, such as the Clash and Boston, because I am tired of a lot of new bands churning out crappy, identical-sounding songs that are played on the radio for a month and then forgotten.  Thank God for this album though, because it breaks from the mold or conventional modern songs.  It's not whiny, and sounds much different from most new music.  Best of all, it's the first music I've heard in a long time that's presented with actual emotion, not just wannabes whining about how this girl left him or life sucks. <br /> <br />The band sings with a very mature look at the world and on love, but still manages to throw in a little delinquency so as not to alienate younger listeners.  It's fresh, it's new, and it doesn't get old.  This is modern songwriting at it's best, people.   <br /> <br />When Fall Out Boy hits the dust, and The Killers are dead, people will still listen to the Arctic Monkeys, because this stuff is built to last.  Great job, guys.
0060012358|3.0|I read this when it came out, thinking that perhaps it might be OK to share with my children.  Note, please, that it was not marketed or labeled as young adult fiction when I bought it.  I found it to be one of the darkest and least funny of the discworld novels, and not at all appropriate for my kids at that time.  I didn't think about it again until, to my horror, my sister-in-law gave a copy to my ten-year-old son.  My thirteen-year-old might be OK with the cruelty, starvation, cannibalism, animal pit-fighting, and so forth, but not the 10-year-old.  This book is deep Pratchet, and as such, not for children.  I was appalled to see that it is now being sold as a children's book.  I would never offer this book to someone in middle school or younger unless I knew him and his reading level very well.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I would not buy the album. However, you could burn it on the computer for free and skip Wind It Up since that's the worst song on the internet!!!
0307237699|4.0|Overview : Jameson Thottam <br />Obama is certainly a great communicator and is a very likable man. The book was written at a relatively low level to appeal to the mainstream which is too bad since I would have liked to hear him talk about some of the more complex issues and/or in more detail. Instead the book is a bit too idealistic so it is difficult to take many of the things he discusses seriously.  <br /> <br />Fixing the Problem: Jameson Thottam <br />It is easy to say we need a better educational system or family values matter, but how do you fix these things in a day where there is so much corruption? The real problem in America is the control by large companies and the tolerance for corruption. And politicians are key players.  <br /> <br />The Political Agenda: Jameson Thottam <br />Of course this book is his informal way of asking the people if he should run for president. That of course is a different issue.  Portions of the volume read like outtakes from a stump speech, and the bulk of it is devoted to laying out Mr. Obama's policy positions on a host of issues, from education to health care to the war in Iraq. <br /> <br />The Views: Jameson Thottam <br />He presents them in a way that requires one to reexamine their ideas and beliefs. For every argument he makes, he shows a real-world example and provides a practically flawless arguement. He writes in such a way that one understands the issues he's discussing, even if one hadn't previously deeply thought about them.  <br /> <br /> <br />El Fin: Jameson Thottam <br />Definitely worth a read in anticipation of the upcoming elections <br /> <br />: Jameson Thottam
B000ICL3KG|5.0|See it. Then decide. We were skeptical but Gore makes a very compelling case.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|The lecture portions of Gore's presentation are compelling and well worth viewing, if only for the knowledge presented therein.  The remainder, which combines biographical moments from Gore's life played a little too much like one of the candidate bio films played at political conventions.  Thanks to modern technology those parts are easy to fast forward through and thus do not detract at all from the lecture portions -- which are compelling.  The best part is the timeline -- which is the one part I showed to my 11 year old that convinced him utterly. <br /> <br />Gore also does a wonderful job of demonstrating how absurd \\"conventional wisdom\\" can be -- without ever taking the scientific establishment head on -- he takes a great example from his youth (and mine) when our grade school teachers (and approved textbooks) completely ruled out the notion that the continents actually fit together at one time, despite the coincidental similarities in coastlines. <br /> <br />Gore's recommendations as to what to do about the problems he identified are thoughtprovoking in unusual ways.  How to deal with this \\"uncomfortable truth\\" without surrendering to despair or helplessness?  This may be as inevitable as plate tectonics!! <br /> <br /> Here's a man who was both Senator and Vice President, ran for President, and was utterly unable to do anything about it -- now he is doing the only thing he can think of, which is to go out and present these facts one lecture at a time.  What can the rest of us do about it?  And will it matter?  Maybe -- but for my money we will see the polar bear go the way of the passenger pigeon long before we come up with any solution. <br /> <br />
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|This thing is awesome! Just look at it, I don't care how it shoots, its just so cool looking. Out of the box it probably shoots about 35 feet as it claims. The darts do fire a little randomly, I think heavier darts would improve this. After about a half hour of playing I took it apart and added a significantly stronger spring, while now I have to use two hands to cock it I can say it goes a good 100 feet. I would not want to get hit with thing now! <br /> <br />WAY FUN! get one
B00003CXAA|5.0|I have yet to find anyone who doens't like this movie.  It's a true classic.  The story is fantastic, great actors/characters and plenty of action and drama.  The sotry is told beautifully and the cinematography is quite nice.  On any given day I find something in life that is worth quoting from the Godfather.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|5 stars...Eddie Van Halen is brilliant...from crazy original rhythms, to monumental solos; he IS a guitar.Hes the best, hands down.The orignal Van halen is raw power and energy. David Lee Roth is the most unique energetic frontman, Michael Anthony can serve you up a low thundering bass line and blow out your ear drums with a crushing high note. Alex Van Halen attacks the double kit like no other double bass drum player. The album defined what VH was ready to do; take over the rock world.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this for my father, a WWII infantry vet who saw action (and won a bronze star with a purple heart) in the battle of the bulge -- (he was, in fact, among the first people to see the Russian Cossakss invade Poland from the East on his 13th birthday in 1939  <br /> <br />He watches little TV, and has little interest in DVD's.  Doesn't see a lot of WWII stuff -- he was mesmerized and watched it all the way through several times.  Actively avoids it at time. This presentation rang very true to him and perhaps even spoke to him.  (My son and I have watched it many times, in both the HBO and A&E incarnations). <br /> <br />Based upon Ambrose's wonderful oral history of an elite light infantry company in WWII (and its leadership) the production values are simply outstanding, and it communicates a sensibility about the war that rings true to all ages -- from 10 to 85.   I personally found the series to be uneven, and lacking in continuity, principally because the medium required a focus upon different characters in different episodes and, since it was based upon real events, there are necessary gaps in continuity.  Simply read Ambrose's book, and those problems are readily solved. <br /> <br />It is difficult to identify a comparable movie or miniseries -- perhaps Stone's Platoon (which combined the real horror with the real bonds that formed amongst the men who fought) comes closest.  After that, the \\"Combat\\" TV series (written by men who had served in WWII is the closest analogy one can think of.   <br /> <br />For those without cable, and any interest in WWII or combat, this is a must own.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This is a one of a kind.  Sexy, spicy, unpretentious, and visually stunning. <br />It has a wonderful complicated plot and has all the bells and whistles.  A must see for the open minded and democrats.
B000GUJYLU|4.0|I like the story of the original Cinderella, so this movie was also enjoyable for me.  Drew Barrymore does a nice job as the lead character and adds some zip to the movie.  Supporting characters are also good.
032147404X|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my 15-year old sister to go with her first pro-sumer digital camera.  Figured she'd learn a few things.  Being a semi-professional photographer myself, I did not plan on reading this nor did I expect to learn anything.  Instead, I flipped through it and decided to take it to work with me.  It was her gift, but I read it from cover to cover in a matter of hours.  It's a great book with tons of tips and tricks.  Sure, some of them make you say \\"duh\\" but then others make you say \\"duh, why didn't I think of that?\\" <br /> <br />It's short and simple but I highly recommend it for anybody interested in digital photography.
B000A7DVY0|5.0|\\"We're not talking about the guys who built the railroads here\\"<br /><br />too many quotables to list!
B000002UR7|1.0|I see nothing good about this album. Also, (this will incur many thumbs-down) I absolutely hate Creep; I hated the song from the first time I heard it (who the hell wants to feel sorry for himself).  There are no good lyrics and there is absolutely nothing catchy about them to make up for it.  This album is no fun and offers no enjoyment, it is extremely bland; I dislike it.
B00005JOLI|2.0|I have been counting down the days to this movie. I haven't been this excited to see a movie in a long time. How sad I was when the movie was over. Not because it ended but because how much they marred it from the book. I really loved the book and I understand that the movie will cut bits from the book to squeeze it all in but what was the reasoning for making it totally different??? It left out so many important issues, people and places. I do not see how they can make a second movie when they totally screwed up the first. I gave it two stars because my kids (who didn't read the book) did enjoy the movie.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is probably the best concert DVD I have ever seen, it is all perfect: the track selection, the sound, the lights, the atmosphere... the concert you just play from the beginning to the end again and again, no chance to skip any track. <br /> <br />I am a big fan of PF's The Wall, Dark Side of the moon, Division Bell & Momentary Lapse of Reason albums, this concert has a piece of each one of them and confirms that probably there is no other artist in the planet that works every single detail of the production as Pink Floyd, everything looks professionally prepared, from the album art, to the videos displayed on the concert screens mixed with the light effects, an epic concert... my only regret is not have attended any concert during that tour... \\"wish you were here\\"... <br /> <br />Just go and buy it, this is a no miss for any music fan.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Ole Bobby keeps cranking them out. This album is one of the best in several years.
0307237699|4.0|With most books I read, I conclude either this person is an idiot or he's a lot smarter than I am.  Barack Obama falls into the latter.  Call him a political cheerleader, or whatever you think he might be.  He inspires the mind and the soul, reminds we are not the Democratic United States of America or Republician United States of America.  He'll be labeled as a \\"flash in the pan\\" or as someone who is simply \\"pumping sunshine\\" (I don't think I skipped a cliche') But truthfully, as for myself after 6+ years of what we've been getting, it would be a welcomed break.  In short, buy the book and jump on the bandwagon.
B00005JPE7|5.0|I have a lot of respect for Sylvester Stalone.  He's a talented artist and a wonderful writer and director.  I loved this last Rocky movie...and I didn't really think I was going to.  I heard Stalone say in an interview this film was a love note to Rocky fans and it really was.  It's a great film to see with your kids.  We saw it two days before Christmas and we felt like it was a wonderful gift for our family.  <br />Thanks Stalone!
0375505091|1.0|As a professional photographer I've been a fan of Annie for a long time and she's on the top of my list of those who've influnced my work.  However, in this effort it strikes me as a vanity piece.  Her family photos are interesting to her family and maybe someone else but I'm not sure who that might be.  Her landscapes are marginal at best.  She even states that she was provided a helicopter to shoot some landscapes and they came out blurry but the magazine used them anyway.  I'd recommend she stick to what she does so well: hoopla.  Stick to the celebrity stuff Annie.  Access is 90% of your success.  Anybody want to buy a copy?  Viewed only once and in perfect  condition.
B00011D1OA|5.0|From the cast to the music, from the sets to the costumes, from the atmosphere to the script, My Fair Lady remains one of the most beautiful and succesful musicals ever that has been brought to the big screen. It is an enjoyment for both eye and ear and stil keeps audiences humming the songs long after they have seen the film.    Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, who play the main characters in the film, both act deliciously and are both a joy to look at. Hepburn is truely lovely as the commen flowergirl Eliza Doolittle, who is found by professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harisson) on the streets of London. Higgins takes on a bet with an old friend, colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White), that he can transform Eliza from a streetlike flowergirl to a wonderful speaking Dutchess. But this proves to be harder than it looks.  Hepburn's performance is one of a kind. She gives the character of Doolittle a heart and a soul like no other actress could have done.   And even though Rex Harrison's character Henry Higgins isn't always likable in what he says, he is terribly funny and the way he uses his voice is absolutely fantastic.    The film may feel a bit dated to the younger generations, it remains a true masterpiece that still makes the hearts of many beat faster. The songs are marvellously written and remain in your head for a long time. The costumes are beautiful and the sets are also. You can really see that months and months have been put into the production of the film. Every little detail is taken care of.   This version that is seen on the dvd shows a restored edition of the film. The film was beginning to become lost, the filmroles were getting older and started to fall apart. But thanks to fantastic professionels, the film has been beautifully restored and gives the film back the colorful and fresh look it should have. The audio has also been restored which brings the songs and music in their fullest and most beautiful form. A fascinating documentary shows what happenedand how the film was restored. It also shows a great welth of footage behind the scenes of the film, how it was made and produced back in 1963. This together with the film makes this dvd a true treasure to have and to hold in your dvd collection.     So with legendary performances by legendary actors, with beautiful art-direction that pleases your eyes, and music that your ears will fall in love with, My Fair Lady is one of a kind and has been that way many years. And it is safe to say that it remains that way for many years to come.   Worth every star given on top of this review.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Hollywood was once a hotbed of big, flashy, quality musical extravaganzas. Then it became a hotbed of action, horror, and comedy. Now, it is a land of cheap laughs, people up to their ears in sex, and the occasional musical adaptation of a hit Broadway show to pull in some extra cash from the theatre goers who would love to see their favorite shows on the big screen.<br /><br />We (the theatre goers) wouldn't mid this, if it weren't for the awful results which so often come from these adaptations. In 1996, \\"Evita\\" made it to the big screen, only to be a big letdown for fans of the show (do the movie producers even consider them?) In 2002, \\"Chicago\\" became a hit movie, even taking home the Oscar for Best Picture. After that, Hollywood began thinking that musicals were the thing to do, so they began spewing out movie adaptations of Broadway shows in the hopes that they would follow the same fate as \\"Chicago,\\" which I loved, by the way.<br /><br />When it was announced that Warner Brothers was to release a movie version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"The Phantom of the Opera,\\" I almost wet myself in excitement. I had only been a \\"phan\\" for about two months, and now I would finally get to see it! I began checking the official website every day, waiting for more news to be released. My world revolved around this movie's release for months. Finally, the movie was released. I could finally see what I had heard Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman singing on my worn out CD of the Original London Cast.<br /><br />Initially, I loved the movie. I thought the voices were a little off, but I loved the movie. I even saw it twice in theatres. Then the national touring production came to Atlanta, starring Beth Southard and Gary Mauer as Christine and the Phantom, respectively. A friend and myself went to see it on the closing night at the Fox Theatre. We had both seen the movie and were absolutely in love with the show. After seeing the live stage production, I can now say, without any shred of doubt that this movie was not made for the phans, but for a new generation of possible phans.<br /><br />The first thing they did wrong was cast the three leads the way they did. I won't compare Gerard Butler to Michael Crawford, because it would be like comparing a Happy Meal to a gourmet dinner, but I will compare him to any actor who has played the Phantom on stage (except Paul Stanley). He is awful. Bad. Horrid. There is nothing good about his performance. I hate him in this role. For one thing, he is clearly too young to be playing the Phantom! TOO YOUNG! The Phantom (I'll call him Erik to save typing time) should not be young, tanned, built, and good-looking. Erik should be older, pale, thin, and creepy. Did the casting directors even look at the Leroux novel for reference? As for his \\"disfiguration,\\" it is a joke. I've had pimples scarier than that crap. Erik does not have bad sunburn and a small bump on the side of his face; he has a practically melted face, no nose, and a hole in his head. THAT is creepy! I can honestly say that I have never had a pimple as scary as that. As for his voice, it is not a bad voice. It IS a HORRIBLE voice for this part. Erik should have a smooth, sensual voice, NOT a hard, growly, rocker voice. In short: Gerard Butler should not have been cast as the Phantom; there are plenty of other actors who could have done a much better job than him.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum, though very pretty and very good for the character of Christine, simply does not have the voice to support the role. Her voice could never have filled the opera house, and the managers would have been laughed at for trying to put her in Carlotta's role. Though her voice is pretty, it's too pretty for a character that is supposed to be an operatic soprano. I will say that her rendition of \\"Point of No Return\\" is very good, and I get chills every time I hear her growl \\"consume us.\\" She has some redeeming qualities to her that make her Christine bearable, but nothing spectacular.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother writing about Patrick Wilson as Raoul, because he is such a wasted character in this movie. Note to screenwriters: a swordfight does not add anything to a character except some bruises. Instead, I will take a brief moment to mention that I applaud the supporting cast for being well cast, though I deduct points for not casting a Carlotta who could actually sing the part herself. If Margaret Preece could sing the role, why couldn't she simply play the role? She did it on stage; she might as well do it in screen.<br /><br />Now that I have ripped the movie to shreds, I'll review the wonderful DVD. The first disc contains the movie, and it has excellent sound and video quality. The French language track is also very good (and the singers are often better than their English speaking counterparts). The fun really starts on disc two. Here, viewers can view two documentaries (one about the show, the other about the film), a deleted scene, and a hidden video of the movie crew attempting to sing the title song from the show (yes, from the show, not the movie. This rendition does not chop out the fourth verse). The behind-the-scenes of the movie is just like any other:  nothing special here (unless you like to hear Webber's excuses for the horrid leading actors who were cast in the movie). The deleted scene, featuring the song \\"No One Would Listen\\" is also nothing special. Were the scene in the film, it would have brought it to a screeching halt and completely ruined the excitement of that particular sequence (it would have been between the plan to capture the Phantom and \\"Point of No Return). The real treat is the documentary \\"Behind the Mask,\\" a look at how the stage musical came to be. It features interviews with many of the creatives behind the show, as well as beautiful footage from a (at that time) recent London performance of the show, making viewers wish even harder for a DVD of the actual show to be released. The crew sing-along is fun, but painful. Expect to cringe more than once while viewing.<br /><br />To wrap up what I've said, the movie is visually stunning, but the performances are nothing specal, and sometimes quite bad. The supporting cast is great, but I wish Carlotta had been played and sung by the same actress. The DVD set is wonderful, and the second disc offers some real treats for the fans and phans. The DVD gets 5/5 stars from me, but I have to knock off two points for screwing up the casting., but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br />I'm not going to bother writing about Patrick Wilson as Raoul, because he is such a wasted character in this movie.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|Sure some of the songs are missing and the DVD isn't in widescreen, but at least we even get the show on DVD! Think of the shows that will never make it to DVD like Malcolm in the Middle for example. Be thankful for what you get. <br /> <br />One of the funniest shows on TV! Can't wait for season 3! (HA! Season 2 isn't even done yet!!)
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I must have seen this movie at least 15 times so I asked my daughter to buy for me this past Christmas (2006)I still laugh at Billy Nighy and his singing (which isn't too bad) but he is so funny. Hugh Grant and his dancing is hysterical. I laughed and cried in this movie. I wish they had Actually left the deleted scenes in and made it over a 3 hour movie. There was not one boring moment in the entire movie. Each one of their lives was touching but to list them all would be too long. Watch it, enjoy it with a loved one. Laugh and cry like I did. You definitely will not regret it.  <br />
B000AYEL6U|5.0|My favorite all time movie is the original A&E Pride and Prejudice and although I've enjoyed other movies over the years, North and South is the only other movie I just had to immediately watch again.  In fact, I'm buying the DVD and decided to write a review while I'm at it.  Just loved it.  A little more on the drama side than the lighter Pride and Prejudice, but the two main characters are no less interesting.  Richard Armitrage is just perfect for the part of John Thornton and so easy on the eyes (yes, ladies, he's hot).  And Daniela Denby-Ashe plays a perfect Margaret Hale.  This is one movie not to be missed if you like period films.  Enjoy.
034544678X|5.0|As a dog trainer who specializes in behavior issues, as well as being an avid reader (and fellow author), I cannot express how much I adore this book. I have attended Patricia's seminars and her warmth, intelligence, and ability to convey invaluable information related to canine behavior comes across in this book just as it does in person. I have a vast collection of dog training books. Some are referred to for specific information on behavioral issues. Some gather dust. This one will be read more than once, just for the sheer enjoyment. Patricia McConnell is an excellent writer, and anyone who wants to understand more about the relationship between dogs and people and how to improve them should absolutely buy this book. It is one of my most highly recommended books to my dog training clientele. - Nicole Wilde, author [[ASIN:0966772695 Help for Your Fearful Dog: A Step-by-Step Guide to Helping Your Dog Conquer His Fears]] and [[ASIN:0966772687 So You Want to be a Dog Trainer (2nd edition)]]
B000J103YI|5.0|the movie and the music was very good. all the actors did very well but jennifer hudson was very good. for a 1st time actress she worked the part like she was a pro. and her singing was on the money esp. when she sang \\"i am telling you\\".dont sleep on this girl, she is definitely going places.
B000F6IOC0|1.0|One of the strengths of the first Underworld was the supporting cast and the plot. Viktor, Lucian, Kraven, and all the other vampires and lycans added much to the original and then you had the ruling class vampires against the lower class lycans. A class war that lasted for centuries.    Then along comes the sequel and we have basically the supervampire, Markus, and the superwerewolf, William, against the lovely Selene, and the dorky Michael, the one weak link in the original, with a predictable ending.    The flashback at the beginning was the best part of the movie for me but it quickly went downhill after that. They should have brought back Viktor, Lucian, Amelia, yeah I know they were all dead at the end of the Underworld but this is the movies and they can be brought back, and have them deal with Selene and Michael. At least some kind of continuation from the original and take it from there. Instead we have a bloodfest that goes nowhere.    To quote Viktor from the original, \\"Abomination.\\" Yep, that's Underworld: Evolution.
B0009MAP90|4.0|This was Bob Dylan's first album, as you can probably tell by how young Dylan looks on the cover.  Dylan only wrote two of the 13 songs on the album, with the rest being adaptations of folk and blues songs.  Even at this young age, Dylan was a strong performer.  He gives particularly powerful performances of \\"Baby, Let Me Folow You Down\\" and \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", but all of the performances are good.  Of course, Dylan didn't really came into his own until the album after this one; when he blossomed into a great, totally orginal songwriter.  But this is still a fine album that shows he was a talented performer even before he became \\"The Voice of a Generation\\".
B000HEYVOU|5.0|One reviewer said that this may introduce fears of monsters and other scary stuff to a child who hasn't already thought of it.  That's the best... because then you don't have to deal with a long term problem, not the easiest stage to face it.  Developmentally, they will sooner or later have fears of the unknown.<br /><br />The children I have read this book to have loved it... every one.  The repetitive nature of saying, \\"Go away!\\" makes it endearing to small people, who are learning to predict from page to page.  The construction of monster building and dismantling helps the children to face scary things, by letting them face the individual aspects one by one.<br /><br />In terms of plot, plot isn't necessarily important or relevant to very small children.  Plot comprehension comes later.  This is an excellent book for children who aren't ready for a simple plot and very entertaining for those older children who are.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|The thing that most amazes me about this dark, Goth, extraordinarily bizzare band's albums is how much (almost joyful) energy penetrates their sound and how sane they all sound in the program notes. Yet there is here also sorrow and a mind dancing with the possibility of losing itself.<br /><br />The tightness of the guitar-bass-drum combo grows on me as I listen and becomes almost the calling card of the band, though most of us are drawn to Evanescence in the first instance by Amy Lee's voice.<br /><br />'Lithium' eloquently summons up the conflicting desires of strugglers with depression (a clause I use not out of political correctness but rather descriptive accuracy), who often 'want to stay in love with their sorrow' even as they cry out, repeatedly, 'But God I want to let go.'<br /><br />The more celebrated (by air-time at least) 'Call Me When You're Sober' helps us savor for a moment the aftertaste of a less benign chemical.<br /><br />If honesty about foreign substances is a theme of the album, let's add 'Lacrymosa', with its ecclesiastical name and choral backdrop. There it is too-quick love that has poisoned the body and the body politic shared by two lovers who can't make it stick. Lee is willing to go this far:<br /><br />'I don't want to hold you back now love<br />I can't change who I am<br />not this time, I won't lie to keep you near me<br />and in this short life,<br />there's no time to waste on giving up<br />my love wasn't enough<br /><br />And you can blame it on me<br />just set you guilt free, honey<br />I don't want to hold you back now love'<br /><br />It is Lee's reference to 'honey' and 'love' that makes this tune anguished rather than trite, and therefore worthy.<br /><br />Evanescence save the most beautiful song of the album for the final track ('Good Enough'). A poignant sadness--all too real--lingers about this tune. The measure of the art is that it leaves the listener himself feeling sad. For the singer. For those who listen, and those who do not, and only feel 'good enough'.<br /><br />In spite of album-insert words that suggest a connection with transcendence, Amy Lee and her fellow travelers in Evanescence are a little too much in love with death and in need of some light and life. I fear that even Lee's seductive voice is not versatile enough to sustain this tone over the long haul, artistically and perhaps personally.<br /><br />What this reviewer longs for is for Lee and Company to realize that there is someone who remembers her name ('Lose Control'), capable of replacing her fascinated fear of the dark, and able to move the voice she's been given on to sing both solidly and authentically for as far as the eye can see.connection with transcendence, Amy Lee and her fellow travelers in Evanescence are a little too much in love with death and in need of some light and life.

0743289412|5.0|Like other readers I found the early pages of this book somewhat annoying.  I found myself wondering how I could return this book to Barnes and Noble to replace it with another read for our trip up north.  But just enough of the love and bewildering ambivalence of a long term relationship grabbed me and I found I loved the character of Lisey.  I continued on, probably annoying hubbie by reading through a three hour car ride.  But I could not put it down. <br /> <br />Horrific and supernatural elements aside, the most compelling aspect of this book is the complex love-hurt nature of a 25 year relationship.  Being married 30+ years myself, the continuous themes (special language, shared memories and torments, dark phases, hope, humor)pulled at me.  I wanted to follow Lisey into her stream of thought/feelings and try to make sense of them in her grief.  For this, I was able to set aside the \\"smuck\\" references.  I imagine outsiders (of my own marriage) would find our unique language annoying, but for us, it is our telegraphic communication of thousands of days and in a way the heart of our marriage.
B000IU3Y3W|3.0|I love the music on this, but as others have mentioned, to call this a DVD set implies \\"video\\" and there is none. The DVD images are still photos from the concert which could easily have been included in booklet form with the audio CD. I am surprised that Neil Young allowed this to be produced and released this way. <br /> <br />The music is 4.5 stars, the DVD is zero stars. <br /> <br />Save the money and buy the CD by itself. Young has said he will be releasing many things from his archives in the near future. I sincerely hope this isn't indicative of what those releases will be. If he has real film footage that is worthwhile, great, let's see it. Otherwise, stick to audio.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|What can I say that others haven't said before this review? Well...if you're really into contemporary jazz (I hate the \\"smooth jazz\\" label!) click \\"add to cart\\" cause this is the album you've (and me) been waiting for a long a time. Living legends George Benson and Al Jarreau surrounded by an army of outstanding artists (including Sir Paul McCartney) put together, probably, the best album of the year for the genre. Without a trace of a doubt this album will take home most of the Grammys if not all of them. Keep talking about it's simply useless. Go, get it, listen to it and enjoy it for the rest of your life because pairing these two masters in a single album may not happen again.
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|What is this Sh**? Incubus seems to be getting worse with each album. Atleast A Crow Left Of The Murder had 1 or 2 hits on the album (although it sounded too much like a RUSH album). Light Grenades offers no hits at all! Incubus kind of reminds me of another band I used to like, STAIND (AKA SELLOUT), because the first few albums were excellent and then I just have no idea what happened.  With Incubus, I have no idea what they are trying to do with this album.  Parts of songs are good but I'm having trouble getting through the whole album.  How can people say they've gotten better? Listen to \\"Make Yourself\\" or \\"Morning View\\" and then \\"Light Grenandes\\" and tell me which of the 3 sound like CRAP!  I've been to a few Incubus concerts in the past but now I can truly say I have no desire in hearing new music from this band ever again.  R.I.P. Incubus, we had some good times together but like with most bands you just had to leave me.
B000H7JCG4|4.0|After years of saying 90210 (& Melrose Place) should be on dvd, I was so excited to see it in the stores. My husband purchased it for me for Christmas & I've already made it through most of the first disc. My husband & I both get a kick out of watching how the fashion has evolved, etc. Especially funny to me was seeing how huge the one or two cell phones were!<br /><br />I actually give it 4 1/2 stars-- not a five only b/c there are no scene selections; the pilot, which is listed as part 1 & 2, is not broken up, so be prepared to watch for 2 hours straight! Fine if you're not busy, but if you're always on the go, just make sure you make time for it! :)<br /><br />I already can't wait for Season 2.

0307237699|4.0|It's as if he's too good to be true. It's a pretty easy read, and entertaining but it all seems a little too easy. Still I enjoyed it especially after reading Dreams from My Father. I feel as if I have a good idea where he's coming from.
B00005JPAD|5.0|Some comments I have seen at various sites ask about The Departed's ending. Some feel it was too simplified or Scorcese just didn't know how to wrap up a film where most of the principals are now dead. The only principal left at this point is Sullivan (Matt Damon) and we haven't see where Dignam is since he left the police department after his superiors murder.<br /><br />How else could the film end? What ending would you suggest? Dignam has to exact his revenge by killing Sullivan. Sullivan killed his mentor and friend. I was left wondering whether Queenan was a crooked cop when I realised he was a good guy. Many of you are forgetting that most of the principals are now dead (including French, Costello, Costigan etc.. leaving only Sullivan alive). It only follows the progression of the film that he die; especially since he clearly deserves it. A rogue cop like that is just as bad as Costello.<br /><br />Notice how Sullivan kills Costello when many viewers might have thought that Costigan would. He finds out that the very person who made him crooked is an FBI informant. Notice how minor charactors like Sullivan's buddy from training end up in critical scenes. I like the way Sullivan is ready to die for the 2nd time. When Costigan attempts to arrest him on the building roof, Sullivan, after being beaten by Costigan, asks him to shoot him. In the last scene at his appartment, he is prepared to be shot by Dignam (Walburg).<br /><br />So, what other logical way could this film end? Maybe we could see Sullivan a year later leading an \\"elite\\" group of corrupt cops. I thought that seeing that rat running across the balcony railing against the backdrop of the mosque was an interesting choice.<br /><br />This is the film of the year and one of the best Scorcese films to date.
0307341542|3.0|As a self-described Thriller junkie, I was looking forward to a book by a new author, gifted to me for Christmas.  Unlike other reviewers, I wasn't roped in immediately.  It took a few chapters for me to get a handle on the main character, Camille, and the direction the story was headed.  Once I did, the rest of the story seemed to have every thriller-cum-hard boiled mystery stereotype: the throwaway sex references that didn't help the storyline at all, the obligatory roll-in-the-hay (such as it was) between the protagonist and the police officer, and the twisted-up history that is rooted in the hometown.  Oh, and one can't forget the eventual shock ending, that I figured out less than halfway through the book.  That said, I actually enjoyed much of the book, and the characters themselves, though steeped in seriously messed-up lives (and the aforementioned stereotypes), were likeable enough. The version of \\"cutting\\" described here was intriguing, and it was interesting to see how it played in Camille's experiences and choices as each event occurred.  Reading this book wasn't a bad way to spend an afternoon, but it won't be one I'd read again.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have always been a John Mayer fan, but never cared much for some of his early pop music, like \\"Your Body is a Wonderland.\\"  On \\"Heavier Things\\" you could hear him inching his way towards a different type of music.  Then came the stunning \\"Try!\\" which showed that he was serious about transitioning into more of a blues/soul role, and revealed his remarkable talent as lead guitar.  After hearing that album, I couldn't wait for his next studio album. <br /> <br />And he didn't disappoint.  Continuum is the best of both worlds.  If you like Mayer's earlier, radio-friendly music, there is something here for you.  If you are like me and prefer the bluesy Mayer, there's plenty for you as well.  \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" opens the album, addressing politics and society.  That theme carries over to \\"Belief.\\"  The catchy guitar riff and inspired lyrics make this one of the best songs on the album.  \\"Gravity\\" is the perfect song if you're in a mellow mood and just want to hear some great guitar.   <br /> <br />\\"Heart of Life\\" is one of the more interesting songs.  It flows nicely, and offers a somewhat positive message in \\"I know the heart of life is good.\\"  \\"Stop This Train\\" deals with growing up.  \\"Don't know how else to say it/ Don't wanna see my parents go,\\" is an emotional line that just about any young person can relate to.  It can be scary when you first leave the comfort and security of your parents and your home to face the world on your own.  This song touched me the first time I heard it, to the point I had tears in my eyes. <br /> <br />But the best song on the album might be \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room,\\" in which Mayer describes the end of a relationship (or maybe an affair).  \\"We're going down/ And you can see it too/ We're going down/ And you know that we're doomed/ My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room.\\"  The soul-inspired guitar intro sets the stage for an emotional song with wonderful imagery and lyrics. <br /> <br />I didn't even get intosome of the other songs, in the interest of time and space.  But rest assured, there is not a bad song on this CD.  John Mayer is growing in front of our eyes (and ears) -- not just as a person, but as a superstar.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The movie that reinvigorated the Disney franchise and set off the start of its Silver Age, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" has finally been properly restored and distributed in a DVD that's packed with lots of juicy extras.<br /><br />In creating \\"The Little Mermaid\\", the Disney Company tinkered a little with the traditional Hans Christian Anderson story - actually, tinkered quite a lot. The original fairytale ends with the nameless mermaid's tragic and selfless death: after she sacrifices all in order to be with the man she loves, she gives it all up so that he might live happily with his human love. Taking this basic premise of a water-bound mermaid who falls in love with a land-dweller, Disney makes the ending considerably more upbeat, packs it full of catchy songs, and throws in a few animal sidekicks for good measure. Purists of any work of literature that Disney have adapted (whether it be Chinese legend, French novels about hunchbacks, Native American history or the library of children's literature that Disney has delved into for inspiration) have always been somewhat scornful of the changes made in the name of the Disney brand-name, and in many cases I can see their point.<br /><br />But \\"The Little Mermaid\\" is based on a fairytale, albeit one that was born from one man's head as opposed to the collective minds of human culture. But this being the case, the story can get away more easily with changes to the story, without loosing the potency of its core themes and ideas. In particular, the filmmakers struck gold in their characterisation of the Little Mermaid herself; by making her a vivacious red-headed called Ariel, they unknowingly set the standard for animated heroines forever afterwards (the fact that the character is silent for much of the movie and still remains entirely `alive' is a testimony to both the animation and the characterisation). Ariel dreams of the mystery and excitement of the human world, much to the concern of her father King Triton and his valet, the Caribbean crab Sebasation. But since when have teenage girls ever taken notice of stodgy authority figures? Together with her best friend Flounder, Ariel secretly explores sunken ships, taking her finds to the scatterbrained seagull Scuttle for analysis.<br /><br />But when she saves the life of Prince Eric in a storm, a sinister outcast makes her move upon the hapless young girl. Ursula the Sea-Witch offers to turn Ariel into a human for three days, during which she must get Eric to kiss her should she want to remain with him on land always. The price is her voice, and the penalty should she fail is a lifetime of misery as one of Ursula's grotesque little plants. The clock is ticking, and there is more than just Ariel's future at stake...<br /><br />The restoration of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" demonstrates just how beautiful the movie is, and the painstaking work that went into each detail, right down to the last bubble. The pacing is perfect (neither too speedy nor dragging along), the characters are bright and lovable, and the story is a classic love/adventure/coming-of-age/fantasy story with just enough bittersweetness at Ariel's eventual parting from her family and friends in the ocean to leave a lump in your throat. And don't get me started on the songs: from the reggae \\"Kiss the Girl\\" sung by an array of aquatic animals that are desperately urging Eric to kiss Ariel (it always has me on the edge of my seat), to Ursula's villainous \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\\" which is so insistent and persuasive in convincing Ariel to accept Ursula's bargain that her rather stupid decision to sign away her freedom becomes completely understandable (heck, by the end of it *you'll* be ready to sign), and of course the award-winning \\"Under the Sea\\", which will get stuck in your head for days.<br /><br />It isn't entirely perfect of course; the makers never did quite reconcile Ariel's youthful fancies with reality, leaving a rather one-sided view of the dual worlds of sea and land.In her song \\"Part of Your World\\", Ariel wistfully dreams about land, imagining it to be a paradise where humans \\"never reprimand their daughters\\" and that everyone is happy and fulfilled in their extraordinary lives on dry land. For those of us living on land, we know the reality is quite different -  and it is a strange omission in the storytelling that Ariel never seems to learn this. Instead, she is treated with nothing but kindness and love once she's out of the water, and never experiences the darker side of life on earth. In other words, Ariel is completely vindicated, King Triton is proved totally wrong, and although letting your children go is a lesson every parent must learn, Ariel never really learns the equally important idea that sometimes parents can be right.<br /><br />But this is a sin of omission as opposed to commission, and the rest of the film is as close to storytelling perfection as any film could ever be (and was only topped by Disney's next offering \\"Beauty and the Beast\\"). As well as the movie there are plenty of special features; including several deleted scenes (mostly extended songs and some background information - such as the reason behind why Ursula was banished from Triton's kingdom), a virtual ride of a Little Mermaid-themed attraction at Disneyland that was designed but never built, a featurette on Hans Christian Anderson and his original fairytale (well done Disney, always acknowledge your sources!) and a pop version of \\"Kiss the Girl\\" as sung by Ashley Tisdale<br /><br />(who probably had a lot of sugar before this particular performance). I hate to say it, but it's actually quite catchy. Best of all though is a short-film based on Hans Christian Anderson's \\"The Little Match-girl\\". Much like a segment of \\"Fantasia\\", it has no dialogue, only music and animation, and it was apparently made entirely for the release of this DVD. It's a lovely treat, especially since 2-D animation is so rare these days.<br /><br />Great movie, great DVD, great enjoyment.and land.

B000GT7XXW|2.0|I'm thankful Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is available in digital format, given all the years it's been stalled out available only in VHS format.  But geez, what a hokey way of making it available.  As another reviewer points out, the Amazon \\"Unbox\\" video player required to access the movie on the PC demands that it be able to scan your system for whatever, and it likes to take it's own sweet time to be able to do it.  Just what we all want, another service dominating our system resources for it's own exclusive purposes.  If you're running with portable devices, add Amazon \\"Unbox\\" to the list of services that want to get sync'd up to your device.  And, unfortunately, despite the sys-requirements indicating compatibility with Windows Media Center, my hopes that the XBox 360 could access the video through the Media Connect back end did not pan out (despite the XBox 360 recognizing the video, it was locked out by Amazon's protection of the video).  Despite all this exclusive lock down of the content, they do make it possible to obtain one copy on your portable device.  So, I did the download (took a day!) got it running with Amazon Unbox on the PC, and sync'd up with a Zen Vision M, and then uninstalled all the Amazon Unbox stuff and now am able to only play it on the Vision M (and connected video devices).  Not optimal, but a somewhat improved over VHS copy playable until a high-def release comes out and we hopefully get sorted out on all the DRM quandry.

B000FDFVZ6|3.0|I just finished reading this book and I have do admit that I was quite disappointed with how Sebold chose to develop what began as a brilliant and intriguing novel. At first, I was completely immersed in the story - and yes, the book is a page turner for about the first 150 pages. Then, towards the middle Sebold starts losing my attention as she focuses on the rather dull and seemingly boring lives of the people left behind on earth. As hard as Sebold attempts to develop these characters' experiences in their \\"post-Susie\\" lives, she never hits a nerve or any true depth with any of them. And this is why they never take on a real existence and remain \\"fictional\\" characters throughout the book. (In my opinion good fiction is when it reads as if it were non-fiction. That's when the author succeeded in writing a bestseller).     Now really, I could not see the point of the next 100 pages. Yawn. But then comes the kicker: When I got to the part where Susi enters her friend Ruth's body I found myself throwing my hands up in the air in disbelieve: this book took a definite turn for the worst and actually managed to enter the cheese-ball cemetery where master pieces such as the movie \\"Ghost\\" have been laid to rest in my mind - for a good reason. Why oh why, Alice Sebold? This book had so much potential and now I could care less if it ended up at the bottom of that sinkhole next to Susi Salmon's body...
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I'm a long time fan, and while I was skeptical of another \\"same old\\" Christmas CD, this is the most refreshing CD I have heard in years. Her renditions are fresh and heart touching. They strike chords in my heart that have not been touched by the spirit in years. It seeks out the joy and peace that belongs in the season. It makes us aware of the pain and the joy in the life of Christ. There are sad and joyous times at the Christmas season for each of us. It will touch your soul with the sadness we feel for those we have loved and lost and the happiness of spending time with the dear loved ones we still have among us. It made me melancholy, sad, spiritual, thankful and filled with peace. <br />Thanks Sarah, for the awakening!  <br />

B00005JOLI|1.0|I am the only member of my family who didn't read the books.  That said, we all saw Eragon the movie together.  It was noted beforehand that I alone had no expectations.  The rest of this review is a spoiler, so proceed at your own risk.    I'm sorry to report that none of us enjoyed the movie.  It was all about the animation.  The story was recycled.  The dialogue was inane.  They repeated one line at least three times, and I'm told it was never in the books...\\"One part brave, three parts fool.\\"    This project had the depth and imagination of Ralph Bakshi's \\"Lord of the Rings\\", meaning not much.  My family (the Eragon fans) were intensely disappointed, outraged and offended.  They said it was like taking a novel and condensing it to a four-frame comic strip.  I wonder what the author, Christopher Paolini thought?  There is mention of elves and dwarves, but you never see them...or so I thought.  I was told afterward that the female lead character, Arya, was an elf.  The movie never revealed that.  At the end, I thought she was Minnehaha the Indian princess.    Personally, I did not hate Eragon as much as the others in my family, but I would not recommend it.  I thought that as presented, this movie was a bold-faced rip-off of Star Wars; the king is a dragon-rider who turned against his brethren to gain ultimate power...there is a secret encampment of rebels, waiting for a leader to appear...that leader has no idea he is the chosen, or why...the hero's adoptive family is slain in the search for him by the evil king...the hero's mentor is slain by the evil king's more evil minion.  Sound familiar?  On and on it goes, a regurgitation of the same old thing.  Even the dragons are reminiscent of the worms in Dragonheart and Dragonslayer, nothing innovative.    The computer graphics are very good, but that's about all you'll get in this offering.  Given that, even the best of the CGs will remind you of Lord Of The Rings, but not as good.
0670034711|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love  is one of those books that I really enjoyed reading.  The author, Gilbert comes across as an easygoing and a friendly person. In fact she goes to the extent of declaring  that she could make friends with a dead man or for that matter even talk to walls. When I started reading the book I got the impression that the writer was sitting next to me and narrating her experiences in Italy, India and Indonesia. As an interesting aside, notice that all three countries start with the letter \\"I\\" and each country has a different dominant religion. However Gilbert's journey through these three countries is not about a religious quest. She undertakes this journey to find herself.  Eat, Pray, Love  is conveniently organized into three sections  - you guessed it right - on Italy, India and Indonesia respectively.   While in Italy Gilbert seems to be in a buoyant mood; she  learns Italian and  indulges herself in all   the culinary delights that Italy has to offer (pastas, gelatos, cappuccinos etc). Not surprisingly, this section of the book  takes on a light-hearted mood reflecting the author's state of mind.   To focus on the spiritual side of her personality, she travels to India where she spends four months in an ashram close to Bombay.  No more pastas and gelatos here, just wholesome vegetarian food. This is also an introspective phase in Ms Gilbert's journey of self-discovery.  She spends a considerable amount of time meditating and  doing some intense soul-searching.   In Indonesia she is both a bit of a monk and  a carefree soul.   While I cannot say that the book inspired me to do something out of the ordinary (hence the 4 star rating), the book is a breezy read and Gilbert does a fantastic job telling her story in plain and conversational English.   She has a keen sense of humor, which at times is self-deprecating.  Last but not the least, she is  candid and honest when it comes to talking about her relationships, be it her painful divorce, her disastrousaffair on the rebound or for that matter, taking a Brazilian lover in Indonesia. All in all an enjoyable read.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|This is certainly a different Megadeth but this is a really cool sounding CD.  There are a lot of good songs on here but I agree with one of the earlier reviewers...the original CD is better than the \\"remastered\\" version.  JUST GET THE ORIGINAL!!!
1401359418|5.0|I always thought that I was \\"unlucky\\".  So after I saw this TV show featuring Dr. Richard Wiseman (the author), I bought his book. Normally I'm a skeptic, but after reading his book, I really believe his principles are true, and that if I follow the advice in his book, I can become a \\"lucky\\" person! <br /> <br />He doesn't just give his opinions about the topic of luck.  He actually performed numerous SCIENTIFIC experiments to test lucky and unlucky people.  So the book is based on science, not superstition. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I will never buy another book about luck -- I don't need to!  This is the one and only book I will ever need to be a \\"lucky\\" person!
0060254920|5.0|This is a great book for children and adults.  I have used it in a classroom and the kids love it.  It really shows children the fears they have can be conquered.  Good lesson.
B00005JOCU|5.0|I've never seen the Broadway production and I dragged two friends to see this movie though they've never heard of the film or the buzz going around it.  I just told them to trust me and crammed them into the theater.  This is the first time I went to a film after hearing the Hollywood buzz and had not been disappointed.  This movie and especially Jennifer Hudson deserves everything that's happening right now.  In my theater after the BIG number Hudson received a thunderous applause and again at the end of the movie.  My friends raved for hours after the show-so overall it was great music and great performances.  You will not be disappointed.  Highly recommended.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My sons watch this movie a minimum of 5x's a day!! Geesh.. I can't get this away from them!<br /><br />And to the reviewer who was \\"shocked\\" at the movie using the words \\"moron\\" and \\"idiot\\" and that it was rated \\"G\\".. oh my gosh how horrid! GET A GRIP! Do you honestly believe your kids do not hear these words while in school? Are you going to protect their little ears when they turn 18 and go out into the real world? Oh man.. I totally wish that was all I had to worry about with my sons. Take a chill pill and be more worried about global warming then your kid(s) hearing the word moron. Good Lord!
0618680004|5.0|This book is full of the sanest and most compelling reasons to believe in a god. Dawkins explains the most common and commonly accepted reasons given by theists, then calmly and efficiently dissects them, showing that they are without substance.<br /><br />There is also a good measure of science, explaining some of the most recent findings regarding evolution, and the results of surveys showing the starkly negative correlation between belief in a \\"personal god\\" and intelligence.<br /><br />This book is entertaining, valuable, and extremely useful for rebutting some of the \\"unanswerable\\" arguments trotted out by religious apologists. Enjoy!
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I loved this movie. I am not usually one for British films but really enjoyed this one. The opening of the movie was very quaint and touching. The movie ended up being a great \\"feel good\\" movie with some laughter also. I would definitely recommend this movie for others.
B00005JOLI|4.0|I never read the book, though I do plan to read it. Regardless, I don't see a movie expecting it to be just like the book, and I never read a book and expect it to be just like the movie. To me, that would be boring. Having seen this movie, and thought it was great, I am now excited to read the book to see what was left out. Only thing keeping this from being a 5-star rating is that, for an epic film, it was short, but since the book was geared towards a younger audience, and the movie is geared toward a young audience, I can't fathom a child sitting still for 3 to 3 and a half hours without losing focus.
B000FGGE68|4.0|As an overdose of eye candy, Ultraviolet can be marginally recommended as the second-half of a double-feature with Aeon Flux. Both films are disposable adolescent fantasies featuring a butt-kicking babe (in this case, the svelte and sexy Milla Jovovich) in a dystopian future, and both specialize in the kind of barely-coherent, video-game storytelling that's constantly overwhelmed by an over-abundance of low-budget CGI. Director Kurt Wimmer fared much better with his earlier film Equilibrium, but he's trying for a lively comic-book vibe here (beginning with Hulk-like opening credits) with a digitally enhanced, Tron-like color palette. It largely suits this late-21st century story of a \\"blood war\\" between the ultra-violent Violet (Jovovich), member of a vampire-like group of resistance fighters infected with a man-made virus called the Hemophage, and the human Vice Cardinal Daxus (Nick Chinlund), who's determined to eliminate Violet's kind once and for all. Wimmer takes all of this way too seriously, crafting a plot involving Violet's rescue of a human clone boy (Cameron Bright) that's intended as an homage to John Cassevetes' 1980 drama Gloria, but Wimmer's good intentions are mostly lost in a repetitive series of chaotically choreographed fight scenes, mostly involving the tight-bodied Jovovich wiping out dozens of armor-clad enemies. It's all too numbingly hectic to qualify as a satisfying movie, but sci-fi buffs should give it a look anyway, if only to see how locations in Shanghai and Hong Kong contribute to the film's futuristic design.--Jeff Shannon
B000002JS6|5.0|What I wouldn't give to have been born 20 years earlier.  I'm only 23 but I appreciate great rock and roll when I hear it.  In a time when most radio station music consists of junk like Fall Out Boy and Beyonce, it seems amazing to me that the airwaves used to be dominated with real music like AC/DC.    This cd is incredible.  The 6th best selling cd ever is filled with 10 strong songs, no filler or weak songs.  Brian's voice here is the best it ever was before he became all raspy, and the guitars and drums are great as always.  If you appreciate loud, real rock and roll, this cd is for you.    There's a reason these songs are played at every baseball and football game, still played on the radio, and why people are still buying up AC/DC albums like they were just released.  Best album ever from the best band ever.
B000000OU0|5.0|I love this CD!  Everything they sing about is so true to life.  It's a great arrangement of songs.
B0000029LG|5.0|The media has attacked this album since day one! Why? Well, the reason is that this album is viciously attacking the media! After they tried to destroy Mr. Jackson with the FAL$E 1993 Allegations. This is Michael's most heart-felt album & definitely one of my favorites. The album still sold 18 Million Copies (36 Million Disks) worldwide. <br /> <br />This album mixes anger for injustice, racial equality, saving the planet and love. It is a truly wonderful album & Mike expands his musical abilities by producing the whole album and playing most of the instruments on the album. <br /> <br />Favorite Track - \\"Scream\\" feat. Janet Jackson <br /> <br />Least Favorite Track - \\"Little Susie\\"
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Wolfmother's music is simple with lots of repeated riffs. Uncomplicated bass, guitar, drums and little else.  The lead singer's voice sounds a bit like a cross between Rush's Geddy Lee and Zepplin's Robert Plant, but not as good as either of those. <br /> <br />Yet, in spite of all of that, the sum is greater than the parts.  It's a very enjoyable album with enough diversity of song types that the songs are distinct. While few of the songs, if any, reach greatness, nearly EVERY song is pretty damn good.  <br /> <br />That's why I give it 4 stars, because the entire album is good, not just the couple songs you might have heard on the radio.
B000006IUQ|5.0|This is truly a thrilling movie, and they couldn't have chosen a more beautiful setting. I've seen wilderness survival movies before, but none have conveyed to me how savage the wild can be as strikingly as this movie. The dialogue is also extremely clever and, thanks to the great acting, believably impromptu. <br /> <br />If anything, watch it for the ending. That still gets me every time I watch it. Truly amazing and inspiring. <br /> <br />Oddly enough, I'm not usually a fan of Anthony Hopkins nor Alec Baldwin, but this movie certainly has me singing their praises.
B000I0QL82|5.0|White Christmas sung by Bing Crosby, first solo followed by duet with Marjorie Reynolds with his pipe hitting the bells of the Christmas tree, in the first half hour of the movie alone is a classic number not to be missed. However, the movie offers much more than meets the eye.<br /><br />The plot itself is simple yet clever. The trio Hardy(Bing Crosby), Hanover(Fred Astaire), Lila(Virginia Dale) separated after one Christmas performance, with Hanover stealing Lila, Hardy's fianc&eacute;e, leaving Hardy to retire alone to his Connecticut farmhouse. In the second Christmas and New Year's Eve, Hanover, deserted by Lila, could only find consolation in visiting Hardy at his farmhouse converted Holiday Inn. There Hanover met a mysterious and perfect dancing partner in his dream, Linda(Marjorie Reynolds), whom Hardy was eager to hide and keep. With sheer determination and tricks, Hanover could again outwit Hardy to discover the true identity of Linda, Hardy's fianc&eacute;e, and lure her (again!) to Hollywood. It took a third Christmas for the four of them to free themselves from this tangled web.<br /><br />The idea of having a holiday inn which opened for 15 holidays throughout the year is ingenious. In no more natural setting can attractive numbers be inserted at Christmas, Lincoln's birthday, Valentine's Day, Washington's birthday, Easter Parade, Independence Day as in this movie. The elegant and radiant Marjorie Reynolds sang beautifully with Bing Crosby and danced gracefully with Fred Astaire, so was Virginia Dale. Added to it the lively performance of the trio's agent (Walter Abel) and Bing Crosby's cook Mamie(Louise Beavers) with two cute child actors. This is such a warm and delightful holiday movie that one can thoroughly enjoy every of the 100 minutes of singing and dancing. Plus, the B&W quality is superb.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|if you thought eminem had gone soft, and turned into vinilla ice cause of his last 6 horrible meaningless strip club dance songs in a row, you were soooo WRONG, this cd is the stuff, and it'll refix ur outlook on shady he's still the best, and his ppl are jus as good if not better. i loved them all. it was a great x-miss present to feel the luv again. murder, no appologies, jimmy crack corn, the cry now remix, and all of stat quo's songs, were the best tracks =0)
B0006A9FKA|1.0|I am afraid zombie-movie fans won't agree with me, but this is my personal opinion ... here it goes:<br /><br />What a stupid movie. It is definitely only for zombie-movies fans, which I turned out to be not.<br /><br />On a positive side, there is an actual PLOT (I suspect that most zombie movies don't really have a plot).  And, the tension doesn't come from dread and gore but rather from the plot itself. Yes, I laughed couple of times, and felt disgusted another couple of times.<br /><br />I could recommend dozens of comedies which are funnier and dozen of better thrillers to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I thought it was a waste of time.
B000CNFC76|5.0|I was blown away by this movie.  A great and true story, perfectly cast and perfectly filmed, it's hard to name many movies as well done as this.  I would recommend that every family watch this.  It is both inspiring and heart warming.  I really can't say enough about it.
B00004RITP|4.0|Make no mistake, this is a very fine performance. But once again, a strong Simon Rattle effort receives too little support from his home label, EMI. This IS available on a DVD-A, and I've yet to hear that. But the plain, old CD of it is relatively constricted and mute sounding. As a performance, I find this to be a significant improvement over his earlier Bournmouth recording. Yes, Bournemouth has a stronger low brass section, and the winds generally play with more color to their sound. But the Cooke version of the Mahler 10th is very dependent on strings to carry much of the load. Needless to say, the Berlin strings deliver the goods in spades, as do the Philadelphia strings for Ormandy (my favorite!). Interpretively speaking, Rattle makes a couple of important changes here. Most notable, is that he ammends the solo bass drum strokes at the begining of the fifth movement to a plain forte, as opposed to the totally unmusical - and biographical wrong! - fortissmo shots heard (clear into the next county) on his Bournemouth one. But just as important, Rattle makes a smoother transition into the fifth movement; by way of taking the concluding section of the forth movement (second scherzo) slower than normal - everythig that happens after the final expressionistic outburst. If this makes things sound too smooth in your mind, rest assured that Rattle does, indeed, lean heavily on that final outburst in the fourth movement. I find that these changes make greater sense of the ongoing narrative. Rattle's first scherzo (second movement) is nice and fast - rhythmically incisive - and the short \\"Purgatorio\\" movement has its day as well (not so with Gielen, I'm afraid). <br /> <br />For the Cooke version, I'm still a big fan of the old Ormandy recording. But if you own a DVD-A player, it may well be worth investigating the Rattle on a DVD-A disc. If you wish to explore beyond Cooke, as an addendum, you couldn't do better than the outstanding Litton/Dallas S.O./Delos recording ofthe wild and wooly Clinton Carpenter version. Yes, Carpenter over-extends himself; stepping deep into the sound world of Alban Berg. But once you get used to it, his remains the most satisfying - in terms of the work's narrative -  and idiomatic sounding \\"completion\\" of the lot. He simply captures more of the ebb and flow of Mahler's extreme emotions and mood shifts (this was a rough period for him, shall we say).
0307346609|3.0|The documentary style of the book was an interesting and creative format, and many of the short stories were gripping. My favorite was the thread with the Chinese sub crew and the Ukrainian tank commander. Realistic would not be the most appropriate term to describe the book (obviously), but Brooks obviously spent a great deal of time laying out a fairly plausible global reaction to a Zombie menace.<br /><br />A couple things really disappointed me however. First, as some reviewers already mentioned, Brook's political leanings scream out in far too much of the book.  You don't have to be a mind reader to see that the courageous Vermont \\"whacko\\" VP who saves America is Howard Dean and the aging wrinkled woman on the beach is Ann Coulter (and was her friend Bill Maher?). And how many times do \\"right wing separatists\\" have to be singled out as a boogeyman on par with the hoards of undead? Secondly, why is it that every Japanese protagonist in a post-apocalyptic genre is always a sword wielding samurai .... I mean come on, get a new idea here. Lastly, too many of the \\"interviews\\" read is if the reader already had an intimate knowledge of the events described in them. A few more pages of background would have been really helpful. I found myself scratching my head a few times saying \\"what the hell is he talking about\\", only to have it explained 50 pages later in the book.<br /><br />That said, I really did like the book, I sat down and read the whole thing in just two sittings. A good overall read, hard to put down.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine is a family road movie with heart.  All the performances are excellent, especially Steve Carell in a wonderfully understated performance as the depressed brother Frank.   <br /> <br />But the real star is Abigail Breslin as Olive, whose wide-eyed innocence and hopeful optimism stands in sharp contrast to the cynicism and depression of her damaged family.  The 10-year old Breslin gives a completely natural performance and more than holds her own with the all-star cast.  The Academy rarely rewards child actors with nominations but I think they should make an exception this year. <br /> <br />If you like quirky heartfelt films like \\"About a Boy\\" and \\"You Can Count on Me\\", you'll love Little Miss Sunshine.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I'd give this album more than 5 stars if I could.  There's such a wonderful variety on this album, something for everyone.  His voice is as incredible as always and the album is incredible from beginning to end.  Run...don't walk to buy this one!  My personal favorites are You are Love (Don't Give Up) and Machine--the keyboard by Herbie Hancock has a great funk groove to it.  I have a feeling Josh is going to need add extra tour dates in for this album!
B000HT3P7E|4.0|How I Met Your Mother is the best sitcom to hit CBS since the King of Queens. Plus it's the best show about friends....since Friends. Every episode Ted (Josh Radnor)tells his children a story that is supposed to lead-up to how he met their mom. But he never actually gets to how he met their mom which is kinda funny in it's own right. Even if it's obvious that we probably won't learn who he married until the series finale which hopefully is a few years from now.<br /><br />  Anyway this season mostly has Ted trying to find the one after his best friend Marshall asks his g/f Lilly (Alyson Hannigan of Buffy fame) to Marry him. His friend Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) \\"who he wonders why he's friends with in the first place\\" has weird scheme after weird scheme to pick-up women. One joke that I never get tired of, is when Barney taps a random girl on the shouler and says \\"have you met Ted ?\\". Which actually helps him talk to the woman of his dreams one night. She's a news reporter named Robin (Cobie Smulders) on a channel nobody watches. After awhile they decide to just hang-out since he wants something serious and she doesn't.<br /><br />  The show is refreshing and fun with a good cast and if you miss Friends I strongly recommend that you watch this. Neil Patrick Harris does a good job getting his career rolling again with this show. He's a real scene stealer. Which is another good reason to watch the show. Hannigan and Smulders are both really good reasons to watch it too. Since they both are really cute. Plus as an actor I never saw before Josh Radnor does a good job as the lead of the series. His date scenes can be pretty funny and maybe a little insightful too. Since if you're guy you should probably never say or do what he does. Like never tell a girl you love her on your first date or break-up with her on her birthday...2 times.
0440178002|5.0|I believe, as do many, that Shogun is the best book I've ever read.  The Japanese culture is so fascinating, proud and loyal.  The characters in this book are so deep, the story so vast, yet everything gels together.  The love story is one of the greatest I've read.  The writer shares his knowledge of sailing, Japan and it's tradition in a very skilled way. You will live this book while you read it and it will stick with you for a long time.  It is one of those books that you will read again.
B000J10EQU|5.0|I have to admit that I thought it was just another superman movie, but I was so WRONG !!!  I love this movie, it has a variety of entertainment !!  The romance just gets to me, there's a chemistry between Superman & Lois Lane. I also enjoyed Lex (Kevin Spacey), he never fails to deliver !!! Adding a son for Superman was a fantastic idea & good twist to the story, it's about time, somebody did this!!  I also read that they are doing a sequel sometime late 2007 !!  I can't wait to watch the sequel  !!
B000HEYVD6|1.0|This writer is not even close to Grisham in story telling talent.  He uses shallow characters and a lame story to spout his USA bad/Middle East innocent opinion.  It's all very tiresome.  I stuck with it hoping the characters might blossom but they are way too weak.  Don't waste your time.  Get a Vince Flynn or John Grisham and enjoy a good story with interesting characters.
0812975219|4.0|I recommend this book highly because it points out how `professional' investors are less than professional in believing that they are significantly smarter than average.  It might seem obvious that not every stock or bond trader can be above average in intelligence (compared to every other trader), but the author's thesis is deeper than this.  He explains one important and costly problem as the black swan mistake, and I don't want to spoil the effect by explaining the concept for potential readers. But if you want an interesting short article on the subject by the author, see [...]
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Reviews for \\"An Ancient Muse\\" seem mixed between those who expect some radical new departure from Ms McKennitt, or from fans who will love everything she does. This sounds odd, but I think of her as being in a similar space to Sting. Quite out of the over-stimulated mainstream, where people expect more outrageous heights and highlights every time an artist hires a studio. <br />An Ancient Muse fits into a slowly developing style, but with craftsmanlike fingerprints that go back to the earliest McKennitt work available. This album is a welcome contribution from an artist unlike any other, and the mix of folk, celtic background, mysticism, romanticism, and an eastern slant would sound great, even if this was the first I had heard of McKennitt's work. <br />
B00005R87K|2.0|This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this \\"score\\" was \\"written\\", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition.
B000002GY9|5.0|In a career full of vastly dissimilar masterpieces, Small Change is one of those handful of Waits albums that markedly stands out from the rest.  This is only Waits' fourth album, continuing his evolution into ravaged-voiced, drunken nighhawk beat poet that came into fruition on his previous record, Nighthawks at the Diner.  But this time around, Waits merges this persona with a set of truly moving, melodically rich and diverse tunes.  On the albums immediately following this one (Foreign Affairs in particular), Waits' character was beginning to show signs of stagnation, empty role playing.  But in 1975, on this record, none of these signs of wear come through.  What's left is a completely unique and compelling atmosphere, with excellent songs to compliment.  'Tom Traubert's Blues' is arguably the greatest thing here, one of Waits' most recognizable songs and one of his most moving lyrics, not to mention the phenomenal melody.  Elsewhere, all the sides of early Waits have a spot, from hilarious beat-rap poet, desolate drunken piano balladeer, sinister storyteller; all of them have a place here, and arguably are at their pinnacle.   <br /> <br />If you have an interest in early Waits, Small Change or the more accessible, gorgeous 'Closing Time' are the places to start.  In the 1970's, Waits was also a major innovator within the rock and roll genre (as he more famously was in the 1980's), but efforts such as this go slightly un-noticed due to the more familiar efforts such as 'Rain Dogs'.  Small Change deserves a listen from anyone who digs Tom Waits.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|I like Steve Carell, that being the reason I was interested in seeing this movie. He was a very serious character in this movie. The acting was good. The story was slow. My favorite part of the movie was the ending where it finally got a little funny. In the trailer for this movie they make it look funny, but don't be fooled.
0671027344|2.0|Being a female teen, this is not my kind of book. It was an ok read, but I only read it because it was given to me as a gift. I would never have bought it on my own.
B000089CJI|5.0|Okay, okay, I admit that it's not a good idea to buy CDs just because you hear one song on TV, but this CD is one of the few exceptions where I do not regret it.  It has far exceeded my expectations, and I am incredibly impressed by the whole album. <br /> <br />Rarely do you hear this type of music on the radio, but I am satisfied that I have finally gotten this CD to lsiten to.  I may only be a teenager, but my ears are pleased with the sound.  Each song is unique from the last, unlike alot of music I hear today.  The composition is unsual, yet interesting, and the imagery you get from listening to the album is phenomenal.  The booklet indluded with the album has the lyrics you need, but I am also fascinated with the design.  The photographs included are exactly what you picture when you listen to the songs.  I suggest settling down with a nice pair of headphones and taking the time to relax and listen to all the individual details in the music. <br /> <br />I hope you enjoy this album as much as I do, and will continue to for the years to come.
031236198X|4.0|Years ago when I was a student hit by the initial waves of change happening in urban India, I was given a book by one of my all time gurus..a book that tells the story of a seagull that wanted to fly - Jonathan Livingstone Seagull by Richard Batch. I am not sure if it is a coincidence or my guru realized that we are going into an increasingly changing world and to face it we need to be armed with lessons to be different and face all kinds of difficulties to achieve what we want. It has changed the way I thought and reacted.<br /><br />When we reached the thick of change being a part of the evolving software industry in India I faced the situation of inability to understand the change that may come and react to the same. I found Spenser Johnson's Who Moved My Cheese?.<br /><br />While going through the blues of middle management and not finding which way will bring deliverance I found an all time classic Sidhdharth by Herman Hesse.<br /><br />Now when I am moving into my first level leadership role and learning the lessons of working on strategies and handling large groups of people to achieve business success I was hit by the challenge of changing people to orient them towards the expected performances - in a nutshell demanding excellence from the team. This needs change of mindset which can be achieved only with a strong action plan..I started reading Leading Change and started looking at the eight step process to achieve the same. That is the time I found this new book `Our Iceberg Is Melting'. This book reflected the eight step process in a subtle way to impact each reader even without knowing the eight step process. In addition, it has provided lessons of different behaviour patterns of leadership and each one leading to different success. Each character Louis, Alice, Buddy, Fred and the Professor represent five different characteristics required to make a complete personality. Each one of us need to be level headed and show ability to take responsibility like Louis at the same time we also need to be go getters like Alice. The humility of Buddy, Inquisitiveness of Fred and the Intellect of the Professor will make each one of us a complete personality.<br /><br />I am now looking at using this in my next team training program to measure its impact on the teams. Gem of a book a must read for each one of us irrespective of what we are doing.same time we also need to be go getters like Alice.

B000HT3Q3M|5.0|There are enough reviews on this collaboration to know that if you are a fan of either artist you should buy this album.  The icing on the cake is that you get the incredible inter-play between Jarreau and Benson along with the incredible musicianship of their all-star guests.  As an \\"Al\\" fan dating back to his work in the 70's it is amazing to still hear that perfect tone and musicality he brings to every song he touches.  If there was ever a need for proof that the human voice is a musical instrument, Al Jarreau is Exhibit A.  George Benson is no less astounding today as he was in his prime; and proves that he is still one of the masters of jazz guitar.  Like most albums, there is a song or two that may not resonate as a favorite, but overall this is great a great addition to any collection.
B00005JOCU|5.0|I'm sure that \\"Dreamgirls\\" will rank with some of the more famous musical play adaptations, and rightfully so; not only is it a thoroughly entertaining film, it's also incredibly well made, from the performances to the costumes to the overall look. We have writer/director Bill Condon--who penned the screenplay to 2002's \\"Chicago\\"--to thank for this adaptation of the original Broadway musical. Here's a film that's truly alive, with vibrant colors, energetic, soulful music, and singing voices that definitely do justice to the material. I can't say whether or not these qualities will result in a successful movie; over the past a couple of years, a number of well-made musical films were overlooked or flatly rejected (\\"The Phantom of the Opera,\\" \\"Rent,\\" and \\"The Producers\\" come to mind). Here's hoping for some recognition.    I say this because, within the scope of the narrative, \\"Dreamgirls\\" is a winner, from the very first frame to the last. Never once did it seem as if something was lacking or improperly handled; everything felt absolutely right. There are a number of possible factors: good casting; decent script; a simple yet significant story; a gathering of exciting, show stopping musical numbers. This film has it all, and it's sure to completely satisfy those in need of Broadway experience outside of Broadway. I'm afraid I can't say how faithful this film adaptation is to the original play, nor can I speculate on how accurately it portrays the real life story of The Supremes. What I can say is that this film is able to stand on its own, and making comparisons to different material is unnecessary.    The basic plot is about three singers and their whirlwind journey through music superstardom. Beginning in mid-1960s Detroit, Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), and Effie Melody White (Jennifer Hudson) are part of a struggling girl band called The Dreamettes. They're about ready to give up because they've been together a number of yearswithout having gotten a break. But then they meet Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), a smooth talking music producer/used car salesman (which already should be indicative of an interesting journey). He offers them the chance to sing backup for James \\"Thunder\\" Early (Eddie Murphy), both locally and while he's on tour. Naturally, the girls accept (although Effie needed a little more convincing than the other two).    Meeting Early is like hitting a brick wall, for both the girls and the audience. He's not charming, but he sure is magnetic, a trait that barely surpasses his wild onstage persona and offstage arrogance. Even his manager, Marty Madison (Danny Glover), isn't in a position of control; Early will only do what he wants to do. I got the sense that Murphy put everything he had into this role, which is good because it resulted in one of his best, most memorable performances. The same can be said for Knowles, who at last has been given the chance to show some acting talent (which couldn't have been said for films like \\"Austin Powers in Goldmember\\" or \\"The Pink Panther\\"). She gives Deena a sweet yet determined demeanor, fueled by the desire to sing. Her desire only gets stronger as the national tour becomes successful and recording offers are made.    Deena and Lorrell begin the film as backup singers for Effie, who clearly has the more dominant voice (and Jennifer Hudson certainly lets us know this; just try to keep your hands apart after her renditions of \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\" and \\"Love You I Do\\"). But as the three drift apart from Early and begin their own act, Taylor insists that Deena become the lead singer. Understandably, Effie isn't happy about this. Thus begins the first of many ups and downs the girls will have to endure, not helped by the fact that Effie and Taylor are romantically involved. Everyone begins to feel as if Effie is too demanding, too outspoken, and too inflexible for the good of the group. After much offstage squabbling, she'sunceremoniously replaced by Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal).    The story then stretches out for about eight years, bringing the story into the 1970s. Many things happen during that time, both good and bad: Deena and Taylor get married; Lorrell and Early continue a love affair; many new albums are recorded; Deena is signed on to play Cleopatra; and Effie struggles to revive her career, a situation made worse by the fact that she's now a single mother. We also witness the growing tension between Taylor and songwriter Clarence Conrad \\"C.C.\\" White (Keith Robinson), Effie's brother. For years, C.C.'s songs--sung by Early and The Dreams--were subject to heavy revisions, both in terms of the music and lyrics. From Taylor's point of view, it's strictly a matter of business; songs have to be a certain way if they're to make an album sell. But from C.C.'s point of view, the integrity of his work is suffering. None of this is helped by the fact that he and Effie haven't spoken in a couple of years (C.C. supported the rest of the group instead of her).    All the human drama prevents the film from losing itself; it's not too bright and bubbly, but it's not too melodramatic, either. This very easily could have turned into a hollow story, something that was all glitz but no substance. A real story is being told here, one that would work even if it weren't told in the language of song. I also appreciated how it plausibly portrays the roller coaster ride that fame is; we're not spared the reality that celebrities can crash and burn much more easily than they can climb to the top. Such ingredients made for one of the year's most entertaining films, one that ends just as strongly as it begins. I can't say whether or not everything turns out okay for The Dreams (assuming you've never seen the play), but I guarantee you that finding out will be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
0446528056|1.0|It starts off and continues to move slowly. The prologue tells you right away that it probably won't end well. He's socially \\"crippled\\" and sabatoges his chances at happiness repeatedly. I kept hoping there would be some happiness other than the brief time they spent together on his first 2 leaves.<br /><br />I know life is not all roses and happiness, and I know true love sometimes means letting go. But this was just depressing. The narrator's voice even sounded defeated and uninteresting, almost the whole way through.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|Amazing! The box is lovely; black and velvety with the black parade marked on the front. The picture cards are great for fans and the book is really interesting too. Finally the album? well no words to describe it :D <br />totaly worth the price.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I brought this album, not expecting a lot, because I'd read sooo many reviews complaining about how uninspired and trite it is. So, I brought it to check it out for myself. Thank god I brought it.<br /><br />Exciter is so, so underrated. I'll admit, it isn't \\"Black Celebration\\", or \\"Violator\\", or \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\". Those are 10 star releases. But, it's awfully hard to live up to those kind of masterpieces. Exciter deserves all five stars. It is an excellent album. Maybe not flawless as the others, but excellent.<br /><br />My personal favorites are Dream On, Dead Of Night, Freelove, Comatose, and Breathe. Dream On is a perfect album opener, with it's western sounding guitar melody giving the song a slight ruggedness. Dead Of Night is just a fun song. The lyrics are cheap and tawdry, and the song makes you feel a litle dirty just listening to it, with lyrics like \\"We're the horniest boys/With the corniest ploys/We take the easiest girls/To our sleaziest worlds\\".  It is dark and a bit perverted, and it sounds like NIN could have easily done this song.<br /><br />Freelove is simply put, gorgeous. It's easy to get lost in the ethereal sounds and music in this song. Also, if you are completely smitten with Dave Gahan and feel lightheaded at the sound of his voice, you just might pass out upon hearing the way he sings this song. Comatose, sung by the incomparable Martin Gore, is weird and otherworldly, and a really beautiful song. As he sing the line \\"Don't be afraid/I'm floating away...\\", you might feel as though you yourself are also floating away. It is a very atmospheric track, another easy-to-get-lost-in song. Breathe is just perfect. Also sung by Martin, it is an almost bluesy sounding track. Martin's smooth, impeccable vocals on this song are nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />Another gem that I don't listen to as much as the others, but is still a great song is I Feel Loved. It has a techno sounding, thumping beat that you cannot help but dance to. All in all, Exciter is an awesome cd.ce to. All in all, Exciter is an awesome cd.
B0009UVBQI|5.0|Just a blast! You'll never view martial arts the same way.
B000005JAX|5.0|Now, I'll admit this. Even if Martin Gore were to release a cd where he sang the Hokey Pokey for an hour straight, I'd buy it and love it and listen to the whole damn thing. His voice is that beautiful, that pleasing to the ear.<br /><br />With that said however, anyone with working ears and a real sense of music would have to admit that Counterfeit is a masterpiece. Even if I'd already known any of these songs before hearing Martin sing them, I'd still forget that they are actually remakes. Martin sings these songs with such intensity and meaning that it sounds as if he's the original writer.<br /><br />My two personal favorites are \\"Compulsion\\" and \\"Never Turn Your Back On Mother Earth\\". Compulsion, the opener track, has a very strong melody and great beat that makes it imposible not to move. What a way to start off an album!! \\"Never Turn Your Back On Mother Earth\\" is just simply beautiful. Martin sings it with such fragility and softness, as if he's singing a lullaby. His voice, high and lilting, is clear and perfect on this song, as it is perfect on pretty much anything that he sings.<br /><br />I only wish it were longer than six tracks. But, it is a must have if you are a Depeche Mode fan.Hell, even if you aren't a Depeche Mode fan (though I can't understand anyone not being a fan, since they are literally the greatest band on Earth, period), you should still check this out. If you buy this cd, it will stay in heavy rotation in your cd player.
B00005NG9Z|4.0|Awesome collection of videos from one of the greatest bands of all times. I think you won't feel disappointed with the content, as it includes all the videos ever made by the band as well as some additional `on the road' footage shot by the band and crew members.  <br />The only reason, why a hardcore Alice in Chains devotee like myself would not give this one a flawless five-star rating is because for some reason someone did a terrible mess-up with the audio mix making it almost a crime to hear the now hideously disfigured vocals in `We die young', or how the arrangements sound in `I stay away'. <br />If you can live with that, then I guess this is the ultimate AIC deal ever.   <br />
0380807343|5.0|Neil Gaiman has penned a wonderful tale in Coraline. When you look through the book and see all the lists this book has been listed on and then you read it yourself, you will find yourself agreeing with all the critics. Yes, it's that good. <br /> <br />There has been comparisons to Alice in Wonderland and I suppose there is some truth in it. But Coraline is a much darker tale and better suited for these troubled times. The plot in a nutshell is Coraline Jones, a young girl living in a partioned house with her parents discovers a door that leads to another world and her \\"other parents\\" who love her and cater to her every whim, but all isn't as it seems... <br /> <br />Dave McKean, Gaiman's longtime collaborator contributes with a handful of his own quirky but effective illustrations helps complete the package. <br /> <br />Yes, it's a book for young readers, but the book's genius is that it can be read by all ages (This is true, I'm in my mid 40's). And better yet, Gaiman never panders to the reader (in other words, he doesn't treat you like a dummy).  <br /> <br />Just buy this book and enjoy. <br /> <br />One last note: Coraline is being made into a film by the same people who made James and the Giant Peach and master comic illustrator (and occasional Gaiman collaborator) P. Craig Russell is working on a graphic novel on this book (you can see examples on neilgaiman.com). <br /> <br />5 stars!

B00003CXDV|5.0|Some movies can be watched once and enjoyed, but forgotten. Other movies can be watched repeatedly and only get more funny with each watching. Galaxy Quest definitely is a multi-watch movie!<br /><br />The basic plot is that the cast of a long-gone sci-fi series is living off the fan conventions. They are sick of each other but plod on for the cash. Suddenly, a group of space aliens - who thinks these actors are real spacemen - drag them into an interstellar war. The actors try their best to help out and to overcome their petty quarrels.<br /><br />The cast is stellar. Alan Rickman is hilarious as the serious alien played by a \\"British Actor\\". \\"I had five curtain calls,\\" he complains while sitting at yet another fan convention. The tiny details he pulls are are brilliant. Tony Shaloub, now best known for his up tight detective \\"Monk\\", is fantastic here as the kick-back, relaxed engineer. In one scene, they land on a strange planet and he blithely sticks his head out and smells the air to see if it's safe. Talk about an anti-Monk!<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver, one of the most famous actresses in the \\"space world\\" because of her Alien series, is fantastic here as the blonde, busty \\"talker\\" who was only on the show for her looks. All she gets to do is repeat the lines the computer says.<br /><br />There are definitely jokes here that make more sense if you've watched shows like Star Trek. One of the guys is convinced he'll die because he's the \\"spare crewman\\" and those extras are always killed off on shows like this. In another scene, the captain wildly does shoulder-rolls to approach the enemy. The other crew-members tease him about his showing off. The \\"chompers\\" which make no rational sense on a ship, and which Sigourney complains about quite vocally.<br /><br />There are just so many tiny details that you pick up on subsequent watchings. The way all the \\"Thermians\\" walk with wiggly hand movements, betraying their octopoid origins. The way the watching Thermians try to be brave and stay in place even while Laredo nearly crashes the spaceship into them. There are lines I laugh out loud at no matter how many times I've seen the movie. \\"Rudimentary Lathe\\" gets me every time :)<br /><br />The DVD doesn't have many extras - but I love that they have an ENTIRE soundtrack in Thermian! You can watch the entire movie with the squeaks and squalks of the Thermian language. Just in case they're watching!<br /><br />One of my favorite movies, highly recommended.to be brave and stay in place even while Laredo nearly crashes the spaceship into them.

B000G8NY4U|5.0|I can only sum up this DVD in one word...INCREDIBLE! <br /> <br />To watch Yanni interact with the musicians and to see the musicians interact with one another is SO much fun to watch. And to see the pride and the enjoyment in Yanni's eyes as he hears his music played was such a thrill to me. I can't imagine being in his shoes and to hear the music being brought to life. You could tell from all of the musicians that THIS was the music that they were meant to play and THIS was their moment. <br /> <br />Never has a concert DVD thrilled me as much as this one did. I was truly enthralled and mesmerized by the entire concert (much more so then just listening to the CD...if you even remotely like the CD, you will LOVE this DVD!!!)

Definitely a set of stories that keeps one's attention. Three of the stories involve Juliet in various stages of her life. One wonders why a novel was not written - but the author knows best.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Got this one for Christmas and liked only some of it at first, but then it grew on me. My suggestion for the Beatles fans is start at While My Guitar Gently Weeps, then play through to the end of the CD before going back to track 1. This way you get to hear the improved sound quality and some of the more subtle changes first. On Eleanor Rigby and I am the Walrus the transition tracks work really well.

UPDATE::  (I'm afraid that my sarcasm didn't come out.. I guess that the title of the review wasn't enough)
0385491026|5.0|Despite the casual and unassuming tone of the story, this book has been crafted to the smallest detail. Nothing here is said without a reason. Words are elegantly economized so that what goes unsaid is as important and as clearly felt as the written parts. This creates a sense of subjectivity very befitting, since the narrator is rendered real by the unreliability of her memories and the limitations of her necessarily incomplete knowledge of her own  past.<br /><br />No wonder many readers, unable to grasp the many levels on which this book can be read, found it dull. Interesting that even then, many of them acknowledge the authenticity of the narrator's voice, like the one who qualifies it as \\"Paragraph upon paragraph upon paragraph of childhood angst\\" Well, isn't this precisely the point?<br /><br />I found particularly appealing the underlying thesis that the bullying and the bullied mingle with each other by a constant swapping of their roles, among each other and in their relations with third people. Also the distortions of the memory involuntarily introduced by the mind as a means of survival.<br /><br />Incidentally, I found it very instructive on certain episodes of my life, which were half buried in the rapidly decaying pile of my memory.
0618680004|3.0|Intelligent people everywhere always seem to assume that religion = God. Ask yourself did Jesus invent the Pope?  Who is the Lutheran religion named after?  Answer these questions and you find that human race is the architect of these organizations, just as much political and corporate organizations exist today.  Imperfect interpretations to the best of people's (not God's) abilities passed down over centuries.  When was the last time that any of us told a story perfectly to someone else the exact same way we were told it.  Are we not imperfect?  We give ourselves, the human race, too much credit.  We know so much, yet we know nothing. <br /> <br />What if the supernatural turns out to be natural and explainable?  What if God can't control the events he created on Earth much like mankind can't stop a nuclear reaction once it has started?  There is so much we don't understand.  That is why it is all about faith, and not scientific proof of God.  In fact, when the Earth was discovered to be round, it was just as much proving that is was round as much as proving it was not flat.  It all depends on the side of the arguement the you choose.  Each of these critics of round vs. flat put their \\"faith\\" that their belief is right. <br /> <br />Where will you put your faith?  In the chance that we are the product of some purely scientific statistical series of events, or that we are intelligent beings for some reason that we can't prove?   The answer lies in your faith. <br /> <br />Thanks for reading my thought provoking message. <br /> <br />Scott Clark, Engineer and Entrepreneur, New York
0380799006|5.0|Besides all the raving reviews here on how helpful this book is to raise more than one kid together, with which I agree, I would like to add this point:<br /><br />For adults coming from a background of extreme hate and rivalry among siblings, this book gives an incredible insight on their identity and the forces that shaped their characters (which are not always so obvious to the involved parties)By reading it, one gets to know oneself better. Are there so many books which can claim the same out there?<br /><br />Oh, and it might be worth reading to normal people too. Easy to follow despite the casuistic approach, which, in general, I find very annoying.
B000I2JKC4|2.0|\\"Christmas Vacation\\"(CV) is one of our favorite  Christmas movies, along with \\"A Christmas Story\\"(ACS), so I was anxiously looking forward to watching them in HD.  We were terribly disappointed when we saw CV!  Instead of a sharp, vibrant picture as we have seen in other redone oldies, this was grainy and dull (unlike ACS).  After watching it, I put my non HD dvd of CV in the HD player, and saw little difference in picture quality. At times I felt the non HD version had better color!!??  ACS was like watching an entirely new movie, however, and I could see many things clearly for the first time in the HD version.  I rated CV 2 stars simply because I love the story, but would rate it as zero stars for HD quality!  What happened WB?    Update: After posting this review, I sent an email to Warner Bros complaining about the quality. I receved a prompt reply with instructions as to how to get a prepaid return envelope to WB so they could replace it. Dubious, I followed the instructions, returned the DVD, and received a new one after a week or so. Yesterday, still dubious, I watched it. OK, now I have a good quality HD version of Christmas Vacation - just what you would expect from an HD-DVD. Thanks WB! I would now rate it as 5 stars.
B000J103PC|4.0|I expected to dislike this movie. In fact, my wife and kids picked it out -- I would not have chosen it left to my own druthers. To my surprise, this is a funny, clever, well-acted movie about a smart young woman who accepts a punishing role as assistant to a Manhattan style-magazine maven. Of course, I should have expected no less with Meryl Streep playing the unrelentingly cold, brutal fashion queen. Streep is brilliant and shows once again she's the most brilliant actress of her generation. This is my first exposure to Anne Hathaway -- wow! A bright new talent: smart, pretty, credible.
1400043662|5.0|Kafka on the Shore is my first Murakami read, and I was very impressed.  The characters in the novel were rich and well developed, each having their own unique qualities, but bound by being outcasts from society.  The fantasy and mysticism blends well with the social commentary.  One disappointment was the fact that the novel made connections for you without letting you figure them out on your own.  Despite this, I found myself thoroughly engrossed, entertained, amused, intrigued, and disgusted... sometimes at the same time.  Definitely, pick this book up and give it a read.  You won't regret it.
031286504X|5.0|This is really a gem of a short story - on par with really the best of American fiction.  While it uses horror conventions and mythos as the props, on a deeper level the story is a seering examination of isolation, loss, and, perhaps most interesting, the way in which the perspective of object-subject impacts ethics and norms.<br /><br />Frankly I think a movie CAN'T be successfully made of this book - it is written in the first person and it relies on the thoughts of the narrator to drive its plot forward.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|Awake is a magical album, taking me on a musical journey that is breathtaking. The title song is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. I wish it had been on the regular edition so more people could hear it, but it is worth the extra cash for it. There is more variety on this album, which may not sit well with some, but I loved listening to Josh expand his range. I suggest listening to the CD a couple of times before watching the DVD, because it helped me understand better what Josh meant when he talked about the songs. Overall, this album was everything I hoped it would be, and more. Thank you Josh, for sharing your gift with the world.
B00005JPDJ|4.0|Romantic comedies abound in cinema. Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry Met Sally, French Kiss, Bridget Jones' Diary, and The Whole Nine Yards are just a few of the more recent ones in this genre. THE HOLIDAY certainly falls headlong into this category, but does so with the addition of it taking place around the Christmas season. Writer/director/producer Nancy Meyers is very familiar in the RomCom arena. Her repertoire contains such gems as Private Benjamin and Father of the Bride (we'll forgivingly overlook the Father of the Bride II debacle for the moment).<br /><br />What The Holiday has going for it is some good dialogue and even better acting. Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black round out the prime roles. The story starts with Amanda (Cameron Diaz, In Her Shoes) as she ejects her live-in boyfriend from her home. She's an intense young woman who's the CEO of her own upstart company that makes movie trailers. Her lifestyle is getting the better of her and she decides she needs a holiday.<br /><br />Iris (Kate Winslet, Finding Neverland) is in love with one of her close working colleagues and decides she needs a mental health getaway from the constrained English countryside. But what to do. Ah! House swap!<br /><br />Iris and Amanda fly across the Atlantic and take over each other's residences. Iris lands in L.A. to find a beautifully manicured house with every possible accouterment, while Amanda drags herself up the snow-laden driveway to a cramped but quaint English cottage. Initially Amanda hates what she finds. The quiet life doesn't suit her. But then she runs into Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law, Closer) and a one-night stand turns into something Amanda never thought possible. Iris, in L.A., struggles with falling out of love with her ex-beau who is soon to be married but won't stop bothering her (he calls, sends emails, etc.). But Iris develops a unique friendship with Miles (Jack Black), a sound mixer for films, and she sees in him the same failings her own relationships have.<br /><br />Although very predictable, the powerhouse actors and actresses with the superb dialogue made this flick enjoyable. The handsome Jude Law will make young viewers swoon and the sexy Cameron Diaz will appeal to men who still have an inkling of testosterone flowing through their veins.<br /><br />Jack Black has toned down his hyperactivity and settled into a fine role (although some may miss his outlandish behaviors of ol'). His \\"breast graze\\" lines are funny and poignant, making us love him for his calmly delivered antics this time.<br /><br />Kate Winslet sheds her Titanic persona and goes back to what she knows: being a regular English actress. Her simple demeanor was quite well pulled off for someone who tends to have a more haughty acting history, showing that she can ugly down a bit and act in ways we may have forgotten.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a pretty predictable romantic comedy but the script is so strong and the acting so well done that it deserves plenty of accolades.same failings her own relationships have.  <br /> <br />Although very predictable, the powerhouse actors and actresses with the superb dialogue made this flick enjoyable.

B000J103PC|3.0|The reason why I didn't give it a 2 or less is because the movie has a couple of good fashion scenes and decent acting. This movie was much hyped up about from critics and audience ratings, so I decided to give the movie a shot. Andrea, played by Anne Hathaway, acts as a supposedly motivated and determined writer trying to get a break into a publishing career by kissing her boss' rear end, played by Meryl Streep. I thought Meryl's acting was excellent. She portrayed herself as a woman of a keen sense of good fashion who puts her career ahead of her love life, even though her kids are somewhat of a second priority. She pulls off her character really well. During the entire movie I thought \\"wow, she's a major bitch. if i were andrea, i'd quit\\".  <br /> <br />Andrea's character is average, the only worth seeing was when she dressed well to try to impress her boss. Other than that, her acting is no different than all her other movies. So all in all, the movie is not that good. I don't understand why the critics and some of the viewers gave it the rating they did.

The other was a series in the Mandrake the Magician comic strip, where the Clantons were the villains.  (I also did visit Tombstone once.)  I desired to learn more about the shootout.<br /><br />The first scene starts with Wyatt Earp's brothers telling him that the Clantons were out by the Okay Corral, and they left.  Then, the movie goes to Earp's childhood.  At the end of the first of the two VHS tapes, Wyatt and his brothers were on their way to Tombstone.  This movie reminds me a little of Ben Hur.  Ben Hur's chariot race was not the climax of that movie, just as the showdown at the corral was not the climax of this movie, though the chariot race was much more exciting.<br /><br />Another movie I thought of when seeing this movie was \\"The Untouchables,\\" which also starred Costner.  I see a common ground between Earp and Eliot Ness.  However, I found Ness a more sympathetic character than Earp.  Earp was a stubborn adulterer who didn't have any real concern for his wife.<br /><br />Not only did Costner fail to win me over in his role as Earp, but the Clantons were not effectively dealt with.  They never came across as the villains who needed to die.  The shootout almost resembles an example of police brutality.<br /><br />The two redeeming things in this movie were the performances of Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday (a major change from his role in \\"The Rookie\\") and Mare Winningham as Mattie Blaylock, Wyatt's wronged wife.  These two performances were both worthy of supporting role Oscars.<br /><br />This was not the first time that director Lawrence Kasdan worked with Kevin Costner in a Western.  Silverado was definitely a better movie.
0385470819|4.0|Well as usual the book is WAY better than the movie.  Looks likes this one is Grisham's first novel and I see why people fell in love with him so fast!  I've seen the movie and there are some pretty glaring differences but that just makes the book even better.  I find out that one of Samuel Jackson's most famous lines isn't even in the book....<br /><br />Anyway... I loved this book like I love all of Grisham's novels!  Extremely fast paced, twisting and emotional plot, and humor that comes out of nowhere to catch you off guard and laughing despite yourself.  Since everyone knows this story I won't get into that, all I'll say that this is a MUST for every Grisham fan and a great one to start with if you aren't.
B000J103PC|4.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is an example of how the right talent can help elevate somewhat trite material into an enjoyable and decent film. The script itself is really a very straightforward \\"fish out of water\\" story of a young aspiring journalist named Andi who takes a job at a high fashion magazine called \\"Runway\\". In order to survive and adapt, she has to learn to accommodate her ruthless boss, Editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly, and an environment full of snotty fashionistas. And, of course, along the way she learns important lessons about what she wants out of life.<br /><br />Meryl Streep, arguably the greatest film actress ever, chews up the scenery as vicious, powerful, unapologetic Miranda. One scene, in which Miranda is able to destroy a designer's spirits simply by curling her lip subtly at the sight of one of his dresses, is especially telling. However, a lot of credit also belongs to Anne Hathaway. There are few young actresses who could act alongside Meryl Streep without being blown off the screen, but she not only stands her ground but delivers a subtle, charming, comic performance as a smart, yet naive, everygirl facing her first taste of the grownup world. Streep and Hathaway save the film from mediocrity and help make it a charming, lightweight comedy.
B000001EXB|5.0|I was surprised to read the negative reviews for this CD. This has been, by far, my most favortive CD since I've gotten it. You know the one, if you were going to a deserted island and could take ONE cd with you. Yeah, this is it for me. It's relaxing, it has some tunes with pep. Anytime I'm in a bad mood, I put this on and by the end, I'm right as rain. The only song I skip often is \\"Live like Horses\\" - I just don't get it, it's slow, just doesn't do anything for me. But that's it, the rest of the cd fits me like a glove. It's got songs for when you are bummed: Long Way from Happiness, Recover your Soul. Happy love songs: The End Will Come, Something About the Way you Look Tonight, The Big Picture. Sad love songs: Love's Got a Lot to Answer For, I Can't Steer My Heart Clear of You. And then just good toe tapping, sing alongs: January, Wicked Dreams. I really am surprised with the number of negative reviews. To each his own I guess!
0553804367|5.0|This is an interesting book in that it explains basically all that a person WITHOUT A SCIENCE DEGREE would need to know about the current state of the theories of the universe. So, if you are interested in physics and want to attain a basic understanding of the current theories and how they evolved to be, or if you know someone who does, then this is probably the right book.
B000002ORU|5.0|This is one of the best greatest hits box sets to buy. Four discs with awesome bass lines, explosive guitar chords, crazy drum beats, and a great and very distictive voice to top it all off. <br /> <br />Disc 1 covers the early 60's. It has four songs from when they were The High Numbers (I'm The Face, Here 'Tis, Zoot Suit, and Leaving Here). Then it moves onto non-album tracks such as I Can't Explain, Anyway Anyhow Anywhere, and Daddy Rolling Stone. Then it moves to their first album, My Generation. Then it moves to the album A Quick One (Happy Jack). Then it moves to some of The Who Sell Out. <br /> <br />Disc 2 kind of picks up where disc 1 left off, at The Who Sell Out. It features tracks like I Can See For Miles and Armenia City In the Sky. Then it has a few non-album tracks, then goes to Tommy with Overture, Pinball Wizard and I'm Free. Then it has some more non-album tracks. <br /> <br />Disc 3 has their early 70's work (Who's Next and Quadrophenia). Then a few non-album tracks. <br /> <br />Disc 4 has hits from 1975-1991.  <br /> <br />This box set also includes a number of Dialogues (Pete Dialogue, Studio Dialogue, etc.). And two Keith Moon skethes. It is a must have for fans and non-fans alike.
B000H305U0|3.0|Overall this CD is alright, i like it. The first 6 tracks are good, fun, upbeat, get you moving tracks about love. Tracks 7 -12 is where it starts to go downhill and get lame. 11 is a good track though and shockingly not about love, but life. He doesn't sing as much as his first CD but he does rap a lot more and the beats are a little more repetitive this time around and so are some of the lyrics. Such as in \\"damn girl\\" he repeats \\"damn girl\\" over and over again and is just laughable. If you like justin then you will probably enjoy this entire CD but if not you might be better off grabbing a few tracks off itunes.
0375703764|2.0|I had never heard of House of Leaves until this year, and when given the opportunity to read the book which had excited my friends so much, I decided to take a chance. Intrigued by its length and varied structure, I was in for quite a ride. The plot hooked me, I was amused and interested by some of the rhetorical and academic flourishes of the author, and found it to be a fun read. <br /> <br />...for the first hundred or so pages. <br /> <br />A lot has been said about this book, to the point where writing another review does little but add another voice of dissent to a book which has been praised with outrageous comparisons to Nabokov among others. While one might compare the author's use of language with that of Nabokov's, particularly his sometimes overwhelming rhetorical flourishes, the former's writing flowed magnificently and accomplished something - this goes nowhere and is at times painfully strained. If this is a parody of academic pretentiousness as many claim, did it really need to be over 700 pages? The plots are rather interesting, and at times the author's alternative page layouts exacerbate feelings of tension or fear. However, there are literally dozens of pages of boring, obtuse, or extraneous writing which add nothing or almost nothing besides another exclaimation point on the punchline: \\"get it, academic writers are pretentious!\\". As a meditation on space and existence, would be much more effective trimmed by some 3- or 400 pages. That being said, I found it compelling enough to continue reading, if only to resolve the plot of The Navidson Record. Worth checking out if you can get it for free, though probably nor worth the time it's asking for.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is based on author Chuck Palahniuk book. The movie could not be made exactly true to the book because it would never work BUT it still stays as true as it possibly can. Although the movie is called Fight Club it's not really about fighting. It's about anyone who has broken from the mold of society and was no longer a sheep. If you ever felt like a slave to society and realized how messed up some of the practices humans involved themselves in every day or ever felt like rebeling against it, then you will love this movie. It's witty, brilliant, and amusing. The actors and actresses are amazing and play their characters perfectly. This is by far one of my favorite movies.<br /><br />Of course if you are just some yuppie or someone perfectly fine with how society is, you will hate this movie and not understand it at all.<br /><br />Some great quotes..<br /><br />\\"Its not until you lose everything that you are free to do anything.\\"<br /><br />\\"On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.\\"<br /><br />\\"Listen up, maggots. You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else. \\"<br /><br />\\"If you wake up at a different time in a different place, could you wake up as a different person? \\"<br /><br />\\"The things you own end up owning you.\\"<br /><br />\\"You wanna see pain? Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights. See the guys with testicular cancer. That's pain.\\"
0385339682|5.0|If you liked \\"A Painted House,\\" then you'll like this book too.  It is not one of Grisham's intense law dramas, but is more of a humorous coming-of-age book about life and interpersonal relationships in a small town.  It was very well written---one of my favorite Grisham books.
B000GY729M|4.0|This is a solid sophomore effort by the Killers.  The songwriting is strong and there are some real gems here: \\"Read My Mind\\", \\"For Reasons Unknown\\", \\"When You Were Young\\", and \\"Bones\\" (complete with Adam and the Ants-style horn work).  The songs can take a little while to grow on you but once they do, the rewards are plentiful.  The real masterpiece on the album is \\"This River is Wild\\", a widescreen epic of a song that comes barrelling out of the speakers like a freight train. It's a cross between Bruce Springsteen and the cowpunk genre (think Blood on the Saddle or Rubber Rodeo) and shows just how well this band can write songs. There are enough great songs here to avoid the sophomore slump and solidify the Killers place as one of the best of the current crop of alternative bands.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson is amazing, and along with Jimi Hendrix and Shawn McDonald, is my favorite solo artist. This is his masterpeice. He is the true acoustic guitar-mellow man. Every song just takes you away from the blah-blah-blah of every day life and makes you feel good, and makes you slow down, and simply enjoy life as it is, as well as make you conscience of what we are making it. A genuis lyricist and musician, definitely a 5-star.
B0000026NC|5.0|Gilmour nails the solo on Comfortably Numb in such a way that left me speechless the first time I heard it.  There are some pedestrian versions of other classic PF songs and great mistakes like Sorrow, the worst Floyd song ever - well, maybe not as bad as The Trial from the wall but really awful.  But this is mostly a very good live cd.  Nothing compares to the classic line up that included Roger Waters but seeing as how Waters opted to become impossible to work with I think the rest of the band carried on well.
0316066524|5.0|Modern (post-modern) Hamlet.  In structure, as well as theme.  Yes, it's a big book, but no, it's not bloated: every character performs a meaningful function, and every word is chosen for a particular reason.  Read it multiple times, and the annularity of the novel becomes apparent: concepts repeat, circle around, trace themselves in endless arabesques. A wonderful, worthwhile book.
0684824906|5.0|At 750 pages plus another 100+ of reference material, I think it's the longest book I have ever read. I enjoyed Doris Kearns Goodwin's freshman work, \\"LBJ and the American Dream\\", because of her first person relationship with the subject and not so much because of her research and insight. Accordingly, I had doubts that I would ever finish - much less, enjoy - this one. <br /> <br />So first I listened to the abridged Audible version and was extremely pleased, and then I resolved to dive into the hardback. I found the author had very much matured and had done her research. While it took me several months to get through it, I literally enjoyed every page.  <br /> <br />The book begins as interwoven biographies of Seward, Chase, Bates, Lincoln and eventually Stanton, but by the midpoint the focus is all on Lincoln and his relationship with these individuals and the myriad of others he dealt with during his presidency. To truly understand his talents, one has to understand the Cabinet. I am amazed at how his self-confidence allowed him to recruit those that were ostensibly more worthy than he for the job and that had simultaneously been his rivals. And I am further in awe at how he was able to build the \\"team of rivals\\" into a constructive and cohesive unit. <br /> <br />I have a small gripe with the book, although it still deserves five stars: \\"Team of Rivals\\" abruptly ends with Lincoln's assassination and then a short epilogue. I really would have enjoyed more detail about how the Cabinet coped with the loss of their chief and how they continued (or not) to carry out his vision. It seems as if the majority of the characters fell apart after Lincoln's death and never recovered. <br /> <br />\\"Team of Rivals\\" is a wonderful book and must be placed on the booklist of anyone seriously interested in Lincoln or in the politics of the war. <br /> <br />
B000002JS0|5.0|So many good songs... <br /> <br />High Voltage <br />Long Way to the Top <br />TNT <br />Live Wire <br /> <br />Those are my favorite, but the others rock as well.   This is my favorite AC/DC album.   It's arguably equal with Back in Black, but I love this one better because of Bon Scott.   What can you say?   This album is AC/DC all the way and it's amazing!!!
0060594888|5.0|Recommended by a friend, I started to read this book while traveling on the subway.  Thank God I get out at the last stop because the train got there before I knew it.  That morning I found myself walking a little lighter with my head lifted higher.  I spoke with new confidence and clarity.  Those around me seemed puzzled, but the reactions of both friends and foe were positive.  My old dreams had new life and I saw new visions for my future.  It was a strange and wonderful feeling.<br /><br />I almost stopped reading because I didn't agree with Mr. Canfield's principle on divorce.  It does not fit with the Bible.  But, in the subsequent chapters, I realized the value that Jack Canfield put on his wife and his own marriage.<br /><br />The more I read the more I wished I was 20 years younger.  I gave this book to my dad and he told me that he wished he was my age.  Then, I realized that I am virtually 20 years younger in my children, nephews and nieces.  So, I gave a copy to all of them for Christmas '06.  I gave one to my wife and even gave one to my Pastor.  If he gets to Principle 61, he might give a copy to everyone in the church.<br /><br />Today, I read the last principle and plan to read the book again spending more time applying each principle.  I am usually not fanatic about anything or anyone.  But, this book has had a huge impact on me.  I wish I could shake Mr. Canfield's hand and thank him personally.  I will keep this book next to my Bible on the bookshelf, and read it again and again like a child watching his favorite cartoon.<br /><br />If you want something more out of life (Ready), take some time out of your busy schedule and read this book (Fire), even if only a few pages a day (Aim).  You will be pleased with the outcome (O).
B000002KHF|5.0|\\"Moondance\\" may have been the first CD I ever bought when that format was introduced in the late '80s (or perhaps it was Sgt. Pepper).  I heard the CD played, in all places, on the local public radio station.  I was familiar with the title song from the movie \\"American Werewolf in London\\" (where it aptly backs up a steamy shower scene).  I was ready for Van beyond \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" (still a Karaoke favorite), so I bought \\"Moondance\\" (and several Van CD's thereafter).<br /><br />Almost 20 years later, \\"Moondance\\" is still a CD that I enjoy from front to back.  If you've got about 45 minutes to go on a long car trip, just pop it in and the time will float by, starting with the first note, as Van sings \\"Half a mile from the county fair...\\" from \\"Then It Stoned Me\\".  The jazzy title track comes next; then \\"Crazy Love\\" with Van and his backup singers cooing back and forth.  Saxophones accompanying a visit with gypsies in \\"Caravans\\".  \\"Into the Mystic\\", another song of the water, has a feel in keeping with its title. \\"Come Running\\" is another love song, ala \\"Crazy Love\\", but from the other lover's perspective.  \\"These Dreams of You\\" leads seamlessly into \\"Brand New Day\\"--it always feels like one when I hear Van sing this song.  \\"Everyone\\" and \\"Glad Tidings\\" close the joyful musical celebration.<br /><br />For the most part, I'm a lyrics guy.  Van's lyrics are often enigmatic and a little challenging, but moreso they come straight from his heart, where the real attractiveness of his music lies--stirring melodies and soulful singing.<br /><br />\\"Moondance\\" gets my highest possible musical recommendation--after almost 40 years it still ranks as one of my top 10 favorite CDs.
B000002MP2|4.0|This is probably on of the better green day albums.  If you are into pop-punk or whatever the genre is called nowadays, you will probably like this.  That being said after reading most of the reviews aboust this album, I've come to relize that these reviews mean nothing. Just some friendly advice to the people that are on here to purely hate on music. If you are not a muscician you have no right to tell someone they suck especiall when said band sells as many records as green day has because apparently they don't. Making music is harder that it looks. Just playing an instrument well doesnt make you a good musician. Creativity does. The whole recording process also is not an easy one. And to all the people here to glorify their favorite band or whatever. Please rethink your review. no one give a care if you think Billie Joe is hot. really also saying green day has really good instruments also isnt a real smart thing to do. They play punk music instuments are normally not good in punk. It is what it is. simple songs with catchy hooks. If you don't care for the genre than you have no business buying and or reviewing this album. No disresect to anyone.
B000088E7Y|5.0|I've always loved this recording-- I had it on vinyl and then recorded it to cassette tape and listened to it in my car for years until cars went to CD players, then I bought the CD.  But that's just the first half of my back story.<br /><br />In October, Randy came to my hometown to play two concerts. My wife and I had tickets to the second show.  We arrived early and ate dinner at a restaurant adjacent to the theatre.  Soon after we arrived, a whitish-haired gentleman in jeans and a young woman sat down at the next table. \\"Psst!\\" I whispered to my wife, \\"That's Randy Newman!\\"  I held off accosting him until he finished his dinner, but to get ready, I wrote a request on a napkin (this is standard Louisiana practice at piano bars).  I introduced myself and made my request.  I also reminisced about a show he did at the New Orleans Jazz Festival about 10 years ago. He remembered singing \\"Louisiana 1927\\" and \\"Rider in the Rain\\" in the rain that day.  He gave me an autograph and said he'd try to play my request.<br /><br />The show lasted about two hours and near the end, Randy introduced a request \\"from my friend, Dave Zimmerman\\". Wow!  He proceeded to mention jokingly how the song would \\"break up the flow of the concert\\", but that he'd play it anyway.  He then explained how the song was written about Albania, but that he had to change the setting to an southern US county for the American market.  The song is \\"Wedding in Cherokee County\\" and it's on \\"Good Old Boys\\", Randy Newman's best album in an illustrious career as singer and composer.<br /><br />The title comes from a line in the CD's opening and most controversial song \\"Rednecks\\", which features repeated use of the N word as he decries both Southern and Northern racism.  \\"Louisiana 1927\\", the story of the Great Flood of that year, has become the unofficial second anthem of my state (after \\"You Are My Sunshine\\", which was written by a former governor) after the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Newman includes Huey Long's campaign song, \\"Every Man a King\\", and his own version of Long's life in \\"Kingfish\\".  \\"Birmingham\\" is a gritty tribute to that Alabama industrial town.  \\"Marie\\" and \\"Guilty\\" are just too beautiful to convey in words.  \\"Naked Man\\" and \\"Back on My Feet Again\\" are observant and funny.  Every song is a gem.  I highly recommend this album to everyone.  Randy's movie music for Pixar (Toy Story, Monsters Inc, etc.) is great and has gained him Oscar nominations, but his best work is still the wry \\"Good Old Boys\\" of 1974.mpaign song, \\"Every Man a King\\", and his own version of Long's life in \\"Kingfish\\".  \\"Birmingham\\" is a gritty tribute to that Alabama industrial town.  \\"Marie\\" and \\"Guilty\\" are just too beautiful to convey in words.  \\"Naked Man\\" and \\"Back on My Feet Again\\" are observant and funny.

1400082773|4.0|****<br /><br />This book is the 1995 memoir written by Barack Obama, the African-American senator from Illinois, updated in this 2004 edition. It is an introspective and earnest account of his search for meaning and identity as an African-American males. Somewhat anguished, it insightfully illustrates the struggles and dilemmas black people face in this country. I learned a great deal from his experiences, foreign to me as a Caucasian female. The book describes the author's journey to community and political involvement, his personal development, and his family background.<br /><br />I had been curious about this senator with a mother from Kansas, a father from Kenya, especially since he may in the future be a candidate for the Presidency of the United States. This book answered many of my questions. It probed Barack Obama's roots in a sensitive and personal way that I will not soon forget. If you want to really understand who he is, read this book.<br /><br />I would not call \\"Dreams from My Father\\" an entertaining read, but more an educational read because of the intensity and heaviness of the subject matter and the anger, cynisism, and frustration the author experienced. It would be, however, very wortwhile for those who wish to know more about Barack Obama, and for those who wish to know more about what it feels like to be black in America.<br /><br />After reading this memoir, I'm continuing on to read Barack Obama's second book, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\".<br /><br />****
B000K7VHQE|3.0|The story behind the movie is good, disfunctional family trying to pull together to make a little girls dream come true.  How we get the story told to us is another thing.  The grandpa character is way over the top, I thought they could have made him crazy and loud without all the F bombs, and references to sex.  I liked the movie but was glad I didn't pay to see it. I would like the movie industry to take storylines like this and make it a family movie, one you wouldn't be embarrased to take your mom too.
0307237699|4.0|****<br /><br />No matter what your political party, this book is worth a read to find out where you stand on Barack Obama's candid book detailing his views on [these are the chapter titles]: (1) Republicans and Democrats, (2) Values, (3) Our Constitution, (4) Politics, (5) Opprtunity, (6) Faith, (7) Race, (8) The World Beyond Our Borders, and (9) Family. I found that reading Mr. Obama's views helped me to clarify where I stood on these issues. The book had a fresh approach, with the author seeming very honest and transparent---and therefore likeable, even when I didn't agree with him. Barack Obama tends to focus on values that unite instead of divide, a breath of fresh air in the political scene.<br /><br />The book is basically the author's brainstorming of all of the above topics---including some solutions, and frankly admitting where no solutions seem obvious.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book greatly, especially after reading the author's previous book, Dreams From My Father. I would recommend this to any reader to help him/her clarify positions and to decide what they think of Mr. Obama based not upon media spin but upon his own words.<br /><br />****

0553208845|5.0|Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha (1922) is a masterpiece. This book was on my wish-list for a while but it was just couple of days ago when I finally checked it out from NYPL. Its a fine little book to own. My only regret is not having read this book earlier. To get a deeper understanding of its contents I would recommend finding out more on some of the popular Sanskrit words used in this book and their origins. Hesse's lead character Siddhartha portrays a familiar human condition- the constant internal struggle to find purpose and meaning in life. In the process he meets several people erudite and the commons and he learns something about himself and how this wisdom fits in the larger scheme of things. This book is as laconic as can be yet leaves you thinking, self-contemplating and enlightened. There is much to be gained from Hesse's lifelong works in literature and this should be at the top of your list!

B00005JOCU|4.0|Movies and Music: a natural combination. Yet  it is possible to count on one hand the so-called classic, successful musicals and even these are wide open to discussion. The musical most often mentioned as the \\"best\\" as in the most cogent blending of music, comedy and performance is \\"Singing in the Rain\\" already some 50 years old. \\"An American in Paris, \\"42nd Street,\\" \\"Funny Girl\\" (whose success owes more to Barbra Streisand then to the film surrounding it) are also mentioned as the \\"best.\\"<br />On the stage, being a more synthetic art form than the more naturalistic movies, bursting into song somehow seems more appropriate though even in the theater it's a stretch. Whether we accept it in movies or the theater has to do with whether we are willing to suspend our disbelief: are we being romanced and convinced by what we see and hear though what we hear and see might be pure fantasy? And though it is fantasy do we really care?<br />So now we have Bill Condon's (screenwriter of \\"Chicago\\" and director of the sublime \\"Gods and Monsters\\" and \\"Kinsey\\") \\"Dreamgirls\\" and the dynamic, electric performance of Jennifer Hudson as Effie: one of the Dreams a girl singing group that also includes Deena (a subdued yet magnificently-voiced Beyonce' Knowles) and child-like Lorrell (Noni Rose).<br />In a nutshell, \\"Dreamgirls\\" is best when it is singing: Effie's 10 minute \\"And I'm Telling You I'm not going\\": a tour-de-force full of rage, passion and heartbreaking candor,  Deena's \\"Listen\\" which Beyonce' delivers with conviction and dignity in her trademark velvet tones.<br />Director Condon is after more  here than a fluid blending of movie and music which he definitely delivers. But he also shows us the inevitable dumbing down of formidable talent as a prerequisite to making it in Pop Music: i.e. the decline and decimation of Eddie Murphy's James Brown/Sam Cooke-like Jimmy and of course of the Dreams themselves: both of whom have their roots firmly entrenched in the gospel tradition who are convinced/forced into changing their styles by the svengali-like Curtis Taylor of Jamie Foxx  so as to take advantage of the more lucrative anglo pop market. Taylor is right of course and the Dreams become superstars while Jimmy's career takes a nose-dive.<br />One of the best things about \\"Dreamgirls\\" is the fluid manner in which Condon directs this film: scenes flow seamlessly and naturally from one to another giving you the feeling of a stage performance as hydraulics change scenery effortlessly and quietly.<br />Some of the scenes between the musical numbers are lifeless but others are not. Where \\"Dreamgirls\\" shines though is in the mostly breathtaking musical numbers: Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce', Eddie Murphy ( a brilliant performance in which he displays a heretofore untapped vein of desperation he has never exhibited before) and of course, the songs and lyrics of Harry Krieger and Tom Eyen.<br />This film is not perfect but when it is good it definitely packs a whallop. \\"Dreamgirls\\" is many things but ultimately it is a serious musical film made with exquisite taste, an extraordinary sense of character and motivation and a reverence for the source material.

B000000OAN|5.0|Much like their fellow countrymen Led Zeppelin, Queen acheived perfection on their fourth album, 1975's 'A Night at the Opera'. This album had it all and for a musically diverse band such as Queen, that was plenty. The power of four would never again be surpassed and why this album doesn't make a consensus top ten of rock albums in history is....well...dumb. Though Queen has never been the darlings of critics even the most misguided of these fools had to acknowledge the songwrtiting genius of Freddie Mercury whose \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is rightfully considered one of popular music's greatest triumphs. Combining hard rock bombast with classical music wasn't new, but this song's impact and popularity was staggering. The song and album fullfilled the promise of 'Queen II' and 'Sheer Heart Attack' to make Queen a supergroup, a status they held on to worldwide until Freddie's death. What makes 'Opera' a special album is obviously not just \\"Rhapsody\\". John Deacon achieves the albums second huge hit with his beautiful \\"You're My Best Friend\\", a fantasitc love song. Not to be outdone, Brian May displays his usual axe brilliance throughout the record but also comes up with an epic, \\"The Prophet's Song\\", metal in \\"Sweet Lady\\" and the awesomely folky \\"'39\\" where he also supplies the lead vocal. Roger Taylor rocks hard on another favorite from the album, his own \\"I'm In Love with My Car\\", his best performance as a singer and a songwriter. The album, although a true group collaboration, was of course dominated by Mercury, who not only contributed \\"Rhapsody\\" but also the metallic bitchathon \\"Death on Two Legs\\" (for their ex-manager), \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\" (as campy as they get) and the second great ballad from the album \\"Love of My Life\\" (with Brian on harp and Freddie out Baching Bach on piano). An almost flawless masterpiece brought to you by Queen and their frequent early collaborator, Roy Thomas Baker. God Save the Queen indeed!
B000002P72|5.0|BB King's Live at the Regal is a recording of a great show performed at the Regal Theater in Chicago in 1965. Considered among many, including myself, as his greatest album its a must for any blues collection. King is at the top of his form and you can hear it in his guitar playing. His band gives their all and, importantly, the song selections are magnificent.<br /><br />Its a great recording of a great performance. Its also a perfect introduction to the blues for neophytes as well. Highly recommended.
1401302378|4.0|The Long Tail validates everything most people suspected about digital marketing, thanks to Anderson's diligent research and sound analysis. Among the many key points--<br /><br />1. Maintaining digital inventory is essentially cost-free; therefore digital inventories can be infinitely large.<br /><br />2. As a result, consumers can buy anything they want (think music, books).  Consumers are no longer limited by what media producers feel like supplying.<br /><br />3. Infinitely large digital markets obviously suffer from information overload. Thus, the key to effective marketing is filtering--helping the consumer drill down to the very specific areas of interest he/she wants to explore.<br /><br />4. Hits and blockbusters are still with us, but their market share has shrunk as the \\"long tail\\" of niche products has lengthened.<br /><br />5. Long tail economics have broader application than purely digital products.  Anderson gives several examples, including the highly instructive story of how LEGO created thousands of niche markets by digitally packaging pieces into thousands of specialized sets.<br /><br />The marketing implications of all this are merely fascinating. It is the social and cultural implications of the Long Tail that are profound.  Will endless consumer choices shatter our shared culture, which is to an extent built on shared reading, viewing, listening?  Will people become isolated in their own tiny worlds of special interests?<br /><br />Anderson defends Long Tail culture, but presents a fairly balanced appraisal of what may come. I suppose one of the scariest aspects of the digital age is the value-neutral foundation of Long Tail thinking.  Reading Anderson, one gets the impression he considers a niche to be a niche, that all consumer interests are equally valid. There's no difference between buying pancake mix or pornography--a market is a market. How this cannot lead to cultural fragmentation--and probably worse--I don't understand.<br /><br />Still, Long Tail economics are a major force and here to stay.  Anyone who wants to understand the topic is off to a great start with this book.  It's clearly written, comprehensive, and again, well researched.  Can't wait for the sequel!.  <br /> <br />Still, Long Tail economics are a major force and here to stay.  Anyone who wants to understand the topic is off to a great start with this book.

B0001I561E|5.0|What is there to say, I love this movie. Well casted, written, directed, animated, and produced. Recomended to Disney fans.
B000H305U0|5.0|I was one of those people who liked *NSYNC. A lot of people did when they first came out, but now most people don't admit it. I grew out of *NSYNC before they broke up (they didn't officially, but let's face it...Justin Timberlake has no reason to go back), but pretty soon Justin Timberlake released his first solo album \\"Justified.\\" I liked a few of the songs that I heard, but I never bought the album. When this album came out, I had no desire to buy it. I didn't even pick it up and look at it while walking past it in a store. Then the 2nd single off the album came out (\\"My Love\\") and I found myself hearing that song in my sleep. If a song gets stuck in my head, I'll buy the album and that's exactly what I did. After listening to the whole album I'm amazed. Working with superproducer Timbaland was a great decision for Timberlake, because this album is awesome. I don't even like this kind of music that much, but this CD is great. It's got good lyrics (I have a couple of complaints, but I'll get to those in a second), the beats are fantastic, and Timberlake has really matured as a vocalist. He can sing in falsetto, his normal voice, a distorted voice, or whatever. This album kind of signifies that Timberlake has grown up...Note the \\"Parental Advisory\\" sticker on the cover and the title of the album of course. Here are the songs separated in the categories Great, Good, and Worst Song on album... <br /> <br />GREAT: <br />SexyBack, My Love, LoveStoned, Damn Girl, Summer Love, and Losing My Way <br /> <br />GOOD: <br />FutureSex/LoveSound, Sexy Ladies, What Goes Around, Chop Me Up, (Another Song) All Over Again. <br /> <br />WORST SONG: Until the End of Time <br /> <br />The \\"Great\\" are all catchy as hell and most will get stuck in your head easily. SexyBack has cocky and narcissistic lyrics, but is a fun song anyway. My Love, with Timberlake's falsetto and Timbaland's terrific beat, is one of the best songs of 2006. \\"LoveStoned\\" has an interesting title, although soundslike a little throwback to his *NSYNC days. \\"Damn Girl\\" I'm really fond of. It sounds like a 70's disco song. \\"Summer Love\\" is very cool and \\"Losing My Way\\" I like for the lyrics, which are in the vein of the lyrics Timberlake sung on The Black Eyed Peas \\"Where is the Love?\\" The good songs are good, but have some imperfections. \\"FutureSex/LoveSound\\" has lame verses, but a great chorus. Sexy Ladies is a song that is O.K., but I don't skip past it while listening to the album. \\"Chop Me Up\\" has one of the dumbest lines I've ever heard this year (we could watch Sex & the City or Desperate Housewives). What Goes Around and Another Song are just a little too slow for my taste. Until the End of Time is the slowest song on the album and seems like a filler. I didn't buy a lot of new CD's in 2006, but this is one of the best I've bought. <br />The Great songs on here make you want to listen again and again. As for the lyrics, they're good but contradictory. In tracks 1-5 Timberlake talks about how happy, sexy, and cool he is. Then in track 6, he goes all depressive and sad. I couldn't help thinking to myself...This guy is dating Cameron Diaz, what does he have to be sad about? Despite being cocky, and slightly arrogant, <br />Timberlake is a talented musician who has established himself as a real artist not just \\"that dude from *NSYNC.\\" This is a damn good album and I highly recommend it. As for his the \\"cockiness\\" I mentioned, I guess Kid Rock was right. \\"They say I'm cocky and I say what? It ain't bragging mother****er if you back it up.\\" <br />GRADE: A- (The less-than-spectacular songs aren't bad enough to warrant the CD a 'B')
B00005JMFQ|4.0|There are so many problems with \\"Love Actually\\" that I don't know where to begin. There's the obvious. It's a Christmas movie devoid of any religious message, rather it revels in life's carnal appetites. One character flies to Milwaukee, Wisconsin  and ends up having group sex. Another couple meet on the set of a soft porn film, while other characters of this film have a Christmas cocktail party under giant posters of naked men and women covered strategically by Santa hats. Then there's the not so obvious,  Colin Firth's character, Jamie, learns basic Portuguese in less than a month. A young boy, Thomas Sangster,  learns to plays drums in less time than that. Then there's the whole Prime Minister business. None of it makes any sense, so why do I love this movie so much?    Let's start with the plot, and it's a loose one, it's five weeks before Christmas and a dozen or so people in London live out their lives over the holiday season. There's the newly elected Prime Minister played by Hugh Grant who's attracted to a worker in his office, there's the aging rock star, played brilliantly by Bill Nighy, trying to make a Christmas comeback, there's the husband (Liam Neeson) who just lost his wife and is struggling not to loose his connection with his son as well, then there's the business owner (Alan Rickman) who's contemplating an affair and so on and so forth. The stories operate, for the most part, independently but also interconnect, even if it's in some small way. It's a killer cast that pulls this off, aside from the above mentioned we are treated to performances from Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney, Billy Bob Thornton, Rowan Atkinson, Elisha Cuthbert, and  Martin Freeman from BBC's \\"The Office'. The story and direction is brought to us by Richard Curtis, who's previous screen writing work includes, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and \\"Notting Hill\\". \\"Love Actually\\" is his first foray into directing and though it's a tad uneven at times, Curtis pulls off acomplicated maneuver by communicating these multiple stories while giving us a satisfactory, if not sometimes silly, conclusions to all of them.    The extras are decent, a number of deleted scenes fills in some of the questions a viewer might have after watching the finalized film, it makes me wonder if a director's cut isn't too far down the road. There's also a music video by Kelly Clarkson, who sang a song for the film. The commentary is enjoyable in a boys night out sort of way, as Richard Curtis, Bill Nighy, Hugh Grant and Thomas Sangster gather around the mike to laugh at Colin Firth's manly walk and lovingly acknowledge the physical attributes of some of the female cast.     The movie works mostly because there is no theme other than love. Love connects the characters, love is what's lost or won in the end, and love is what makes the audience relate. That's why we don't care that Thomas Sangster learns to play drums in two weeks. He's doing it for love. That's why Colin Firth learns Portuguese. Or why the Prime Minister is willing to make a fool out of himself. And it's why this movie has become a holiday tradition for me, it's just too bad I can't share it with my kids until they turn 17.
B000ILYYJE|4.0|I bought this boxset from the tought finally to have all the studiowork of one of the most exiciting bands together and I am sure this one comes the most close to that but after reading through the songlist found out that at least the lesser known (blues)song \\"Woman is a Devil\\" is excluded and am annoyed by that because what else is left out? A couple of years ago there was already a 6 CD-set \\"The Complete Studio Recordings\\", with all the studio-albums, without so much as extras, but the aforementioned song was in that compilation present. So I wonder who is respondable for putting together so much songmaterial etc. but overseeing, if that is what happened, an obscure track which every buyer of this extended set will delight to have included. The point is not only that the song is not available but also information about its whereabouts is missing (i.e. when is it recorded, who played on it, for what album was it intendend, why exactly is it left out and so scarcely to find, only if I am not mistaken on \\"Essential Rarities\\" but therefore not on the also outstanding \\"The Doors Box Set\\",  which has E.R. divided on 2 CD's but has all the other performances as well, how strange can that be?).  Besides this comment on one missing song this is the best thing anyone with an ear for good songs can wish let alone the Doors fans, which still are so many. With the dead of Jim Morisson the world is bereft of one of is greatest true singers/performancers, who knows what could be generated after the final album \\"L.A. Woman\\". But on the other hand now we have the legacy of an outstanding band that will keep the music alive and that is all that matters.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|I am not up on the latest in the world of popular sing, certainly not on what might be called, light jazz. But hearing Diana Krall sing for the first time I had the sense that this is a real star. Her voice is rich and melodic, her phrasing is exact. She loves the words and pronounces them with a deftness, sureness and at times rifflike distinctiveness. Comparisons are crazy but I hear a bit of Nancy Wilson, Doris Day and the master maker of poignancies in popular song, Barbra Streisand in her voice.<br /><br />Distinctive and wonderful And a real pleasure to listen to.
B000021XR5|5.0|I think everyone at one point in their lives has liked STP. I have. I still do. This is their most complete work. Way more accessible than some of their earlier jams. They rock it out, they slow it down, and show what they are truly capable of. Definately not locked in grunge mode unlike bands they rivaled back in STP's early days. In the long run, this CD didnt change music like Wicked Garden, but I think it is much better than it.<br /><br />Without writing a documentary, I really think it is such a shame to see Scott in Velvet Revolver. Pick up what you had brother and run with it!
1881273989|4.0|Before reading this book I thought I was one of the few who felt that I couldn't figure out what was my love language. Then I read this book and BAM, there is was right in front of my face. I am so thankful for this book being rewritten to target single. It shined a light on so many things that were helpful and will always be helpful for me as I operate in my love language(s). Yep of one of the few who can operate in all five areas but I do have dominate ones!
B000J103PC|5.0|Ms. Streep is in fine form as the main character of this film.  It is funny and probably closer to the truth than those in the fashion industry would ever admit.
0743289412|3.0|if you buy this book expecting a second 'Misery' you'll be sorely disappointed. The most interesting aspect of it is the relationship between Lisey and Scott, that rings true, but I got tired of all the babytalk, the irritating made up words, the vulgar sayings of Lisey's 'good ma'.  The alternative reality place was quite interesting - if you didn't think about it too much - apparently catatonic people go there in mind, but not in body - but people can go there physically as well and bodies can be hidden - or not depending apparently on whether it fits in with the plot.  There is a monster called the 'long boy' which seems particularly horrible and threatens first Scott and then Lisa - until the end when King decides it's not really such a big threat at all - clearly he can think of nowhere to go with that particular storyline.  Also, as another reviewer has commented, I found it hard to buy that an extremely rich woman would decide to tackle a dangerous stalker with no-one to help but her mentally disturbed sister!  At this point Lisey was irritating me in the same way as the character who insists in going into the haunted building/dark woods in a horror film and lost a lot of credibility.    However, the central relationship between the two characters is strong and believable and towards the end the plot does start to take off and some interesting stuff happens - the book like so many of his others just needs some serious editing, maybe it could have been great.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|This release is a blasphemous release. It butchers the Beatles' music in ways I could never have nightmares about. It is an uncreative, pointless album. Most of the songs play as normal, with a few interspersed samples from other songs thrown in for good measure. It's like they didn't even try to create huge differences, so it isn't even that creative. Furthermore, the remixes completely ripped the soul out of the music as originally intended. It rips out some of the best parts of songs, such as the end of Revolution or the chorus at the end of Hey Jude. It uses the crescendo sample from A Day in the Life far too much. In a nutshell, it massacres and dessicates the way these songs should be heard. If you MUST hear this music, copy a friend's CD, but don't say I didn't warn you.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|...out comes this. <br /> <br />Ir's a truly amazing compilation. The songs that we've all heard before sound breathtakingly new, the transitions from song to song are smoother than anything I'd ever heard before, and lots of the cuts will have you thinking either \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\", or \\"How in the world did they imagine (no pun intended) THAT amalgamation?\\" <br /> <br />Some of the interspersed songs come through loud and clear (The Word), some are hinted at (Helter Skelter, if you can believe that!), and some leave you guessing (Gnik Nus....you'll get it, I promise). <br /> <br />The selections are primarily Lennon/McCartney (natch!), but every Beatle is represented here. <br /> <br />Some favorites. <br />1.) Blackbird/Yesterday. Maybe one of the most beautiful cuts here, and it flows from one to the other seamlessly. <br />2.) Get Back. This one uses 3 different songs to get to one. <br />3.) Eleanor Rigby. I've just always loved this song and the 5.1 really brings out all the reasons that I'd loved it in the first place. <br />4.) While My Guitar Gently Weeps. This arrangement just pulls the sadness of the song even further forward. <br /> <br />I could go on and give a reason for loving each song, but I won't. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that this is a must have for Beatle fans, and for those who haven't quite clicked with them, here's your chance to \\"give it another go\\".
B000J3EEBY|5.0|An Ancient Muse, a little off course for Loreena-wish she stuck to her old traditions of pure Celtic music. However, I still give it five stars-ten years was too long to wait for this album. Her angelic voice gets better with age, just like a fine wine.
B000J103PC|5.0|At first I had no interest in this, it seemed to be geared more toward women viewers, & although most women could probably relate to this better than men, there are some bosses who don't discriminate, as a guy, I can really relate to this movie, my wife was Andrea herself back in 2003, & had a boss just like Miranda Priestly(Meryl Streep) who is as ruthless as they come, my wife walked in Andrea's shoes & just about everything that happens in this movie happened to her, or should I say us, although it wasn't the fashion world,(it was retail), she experienced pretty much the same treatment & abuse, in this Anne Hathaway portrays Andrea, who is Miranda's assistant & is expected to act & for lack of a better word...\\"suck up\\", Miranda expects perfection & will not tolerate excuses, one scene has her stuck in the Bahamas in a tropical storm demanding that Andrea get her a flight out ASAP, Andrea tries her best, but is unsucessful, & totally degraded by Miranda once she is back, & has no problem making her feel guilty about it & even knocks her down a notch later on because of Andrea's inability to do sonmthing else for her, then comes a trip to Paris in which she makes Andrea go, it is here that Andrea soon begins to see that it is not worth it, Meryl Streep enbodies Miranda so well that my wife refuses to watch, the character of Miranda is that of my wife's ex-boss, & anyone who says this isn't real or exaggerated needs their head examined, like Andrea, she was knocked down a notch too, & like Miranda does to her art director who has been promised a big promtion, her ex-boss also gave other positions to other people than the ones promised, while this may be true for the fashion industry, it goes on everywhere else too, I could not have watched this three years ago, but now my wife has a more happy & fulfilling job, & I can look at this now & not hate it, definately reality!!!
B00003CX9W|5.0|I would like to see the original, uncensored version of Fantasia, the one Walt Disney and his 1940 crew actually made, and hope one day the powers that be at the Disney Corporation have the courage to quit sanitizing the past, and deliver the true edition of this masterpiece, but even with all that said, Fantasia is an astonishing work of brilliance and imagination, and I never grow tired of watching it unfold. It transports the mind, rouses the soul, and  alters individual states of consciousness, accomplishments few other films ever could achieve. This DVD brings new life to Fantasia, and it is absolutely worth owning.
6305308659|5.0|An amazing film!  And the viewers say:<br /><br />\\"I liked it!  Creative!\\"<br /><br />\\"I thought it was well done, and the transition from black and white, to color, was well done.  Great symbolism!\\"<br /><br />\\"Great acting!  For the type of movie it was, it was quite believable.\\"<br /><br />\\"Book burning, 'colorism', gender issues, and change... this film touched on many subtle parts of American society.\\"<br /><br />The introvert and the extrovert, brother and sister, get \\"pulled\\" into a 1950s black and white TV sitcom, \\"Pleasantville.\\"  They also bring new ideas, and Pleasantville begins to change.  Is it for the worse, or the better?<br /><br />There you have it, folks.  Pleasantville was a success!
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I am not old enough to remember the Beatles from their original conquering of the US. I grew to know them during the 70's through others doing their work: Stars on 45 and the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton's Sgt. Pepper movie. Then in college, I took a history of rock 'n' roll course focusing on the Beatles. That is where I grew to know and love much of the Beatles' music. We were required to learn who sang lead on which songs and the songs on both the EMI releases and the Capitol releases. When CD's first became widely available in the late 80's, I waited anxiously for the staggered releases of the Beatles' music on compact disc. I remember a reviewer saying how clear Lennon's indrawn breath sounded on \\"Girl.\\"  <br /> <br />But recently, I have skipped past most Beatle's songs on my iPod. Familiarity breeding contempt maybe. My wife purchased \\"Love\\" for me for Christmas. I sat in my family room and listened on my old stereo to this new take on some very familiar songs. I agree with other reviewers that songs like \\"I Am the Walrus\\" sound very much the same as the originals. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is definitely the most stunning departure, stripped down with new lyrics added. The stripped down section in the coda of \\"Hey Jude\\" is also one of my favorite departures. There are lots of little changes buried in the mix. Listening on headphones reveals many of those changes. <br /> <br />Overall, I have very much enjoyed getting reaquainted with some of these songs in their new format. It is a testimony to the Beatles and their wonderful producer George Martin that these songs retain such vitality after all the years. I'm sure John and George would have approved of this new take on their work. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was prepared to hate this film.   <br /> <br />I sat down to watch it with the sole purpose of cutting it to ribbons; I found myself at the end going \\"wait, that was not so bad!\\".  I watched it again and found that I really loved it; I was pleasantly surprised!   <br /> <br />Having been an avid reader of all Jane Austen books and the happy consumer of each Jane Austen inspired film, I felt I was a moderate expert on the subject matter.  The film has a few problems, the hand holding before consent of marriage and the fact that some of the language is very \\"un-Austen\\" being a couple, but the filmmakers caught the essence of Lizzy and Mr. Darcy in a way that I have rarely seen.   <br /> <br />Kiera Knightley is actually good as Lizzy, she's a little too pretty for the part; yet it works.  And MacFadyen was amazing as Darcy.  He took a different direction than Firth and I like his better!  I can't believe I'm saying that but it's true!  <br /> <br />I think people should look at this film for what it is; an excellent interpretation of Pride and Prejudice.  No film will ever please everyone.  If you want the full, un-edited version go to your local library and check out the book.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|First, I haven't played the video game. I was hoping for a decent creepy movie. Did not deliver.<br /><br />Things aren't explained well throughout the movie. The mother drives her child to West Virginia. They don't tell you that they're going there all the way from Ohio until much later on when it's mentioned that her vehicle has Ohio plates. Which is the only time that it makes sense that the father cut off the credit cards. I thought she was just going down the road, not halfway across the country.<br /><br />The West Virginians have no accent whatsoever.<br /><br />It's tough to figure out what's happening, why people are doing what they are doing. A car crashes through a chain link fence and gate, and there isn't a scratch on the car.<br /><br />There are too many things that are shown, but not in enough detail to make out why the characters are so frightened. Why was the mother freaking out when she looked at a table? What was up with the scaffolding-type floor? Why wasn't there more shown of the janitor than a hand, a throat, and barbed wire? How did the mother know to take something out of the corpse's mouth? Who in their right mind walks up to a corpse and fishes around in its mouth for something that the audience can't even see in the first place? Why did the pyramid-head guy have a pyramid-thing on his head?<br /><br />It just... didn't make sense. It had the potential for being a real scarefest, but fell sadly short. Maybe if you liked the video game, you'll like the movie. But I wouldn't guarantee it.
B0000017CA|5.0|A must have for anyone who is serious about music. SCREAM OF THE BUTTERFLY is hands down one of the best songs out there.
B00005JMEW|2.0|This is about what we have come to expect from Mr. Tarantino.  If you are a fan of Tarantino movies then you will probably enjoy this one as well.  If you are not familiar with his work, then this may be the least offensive you might start with.  The gore is mostly phoney but still prevalent.  Ms. Thurman is an attractive young lady, no doubt.  But her attractiveness quickly disappears in the gratuitous mayhem and glorrification of blood revenge.  The fight scenes are pure martial arts fantasy of the cheesiest variety and are only props for additional blood-spurting \\"entertainment.\\"  There seems to be little of value in this one but Tarantino fans are die-hard fans and this one is classic Tarantino.
B000067FP8|5.0|\\"Gremlins 2\\" is a hyperactive sequel to the 1984 Gremlins film, featuring a lot more types of Gremlins and Mogwai, as well as a few guest stars (like John Astin and Hulk Hogan). <br /> <br />Billy Peltzer and his girlfriend Kate have moved to New York, and are struggling a bit to get by. They'd like to get married, but they need a little more money before they can settle down properly. They both work in the Clamp building, run by Daniel Clamp (Smallville's John Glover). It's full of new gadgets and inventions, but half of them stuff up. Up in the higher floors, a genetic scientist (Christopher Lee) is toying round with DNA mixtures, and his assistants have caught Gizmo the Mogwai to experiment on. They found him on the streets, as the old man who ran the store he lived in died, the building knocked down for a Clamp Chinatown development. Billy finds out, and rescues Gizmo, and would take him home, but a janitor accidentally sprays Gizmo with water, and he multiplies, creating more Mogwai. Chaos soon covers the building, getting worse when the fully mature Gremlins discover the genetic laboratory... <br /> <br />It's light hearted, and a pretty intense sort of film. So much going on, so many ideas, so many characters, and its good that way. There's a bit of satire too with the Clamp corporation. Worth a look for fans of the first film.
B000E33VWW|4.0|This great film does a wonderful job of portraying one of the great literary minds of recent times, Mr. Truman Capote.  It tells the story of how he came to research and write his classic, _In Cold Blood_.  Through the telling, it delves a bit into the psychological contradictions of the author's life.  How he could become so self-indulgent and self-absorbed as to be detached from all those around him.  Even leading to his lies of omission to cover the indifference of which he was ashamed at other times.  A brilliant pyschological drama of the haunted loner so often associated with creativity.  Still, the old classic film, \\"In Cold Blood\\" with Robert Blake, is difficult to improve.  This was the same story only with the author rather than the murderer under the lense.
0380725398|5.0|I've read this book several times.  First as a 14 year old, again in my twenties and again recently.  It is a gripping tale set on the windswept moors in the south of England.  I've actually been to the moors and visited Jamaica Inn itself and it is a lonely, wild and windswept place.<br /><br />It is a gothic tale seen through the eyes of a young woman sent to live at Jamaica Inn.  It involves wreckers (people who draw ships to the rocks in order to get their cargo when they sink) and it is full of intrigue and surprises.<br /><br />If you like this one read [[ASIN:1844080412 Frenchman's Creek (Virago Modern Classics)]](my favorite DdM book), [[ASIN:B0006ASZYM My Cousin Rachel]] and [[ASIN:B000VEQISS Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier]].<br /><br />I'd also really recommend [[ASIN:014018869X Cold Comfort Farm]] by Stella Gibbons, a darkly comic parody written in the 1930s where poor Flora encounters all sorts of eccentric relatives. It is a slim volume but extremely good; humorous rather than scary and absolutely worth reading. Not all the ends are tied up, and what the dotty aunt experienced in the woodshed is left to your own imagination.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Thought provoking and not for those easily depressed. It has a ring of truth to it as I have actually met men and women who are aggressive in the way they speak and manipulative in their actions such as the main characters in this film, regardless of their marital status, etc. <br />So no matter how emotionally brutal this film may appear, it has a ring of truth.
0316779237|4.0|This collection of short stories is great for those cold holiday nights when you're curled up by the fire with a plate of cookies.  The first story, \\"SantaLand Diaries\\", is by far my favorite.  It's the tale of a Macy's Christmas Elf who witnesses the worst humanity has to offer in the form of overbearing, stressed-out parents, overexcited kids, disgruntled Santas, etc.  I laughed so much that I almost spilled hot cocoa all over myself.  <br />Some of the other stories are good, too.  I liked \\"Dinah\\", which is a story about one of the author's sisters' less sophisticated friends, and \\"Front Row Center\\", which is a scathing critique of those lovely Christmas pageants we faithfully attend each year.  \\"Seasons Greetings to Our Friends and Family\\" takes the form of the ubiquitous Christmas newsletter, but with an interesting twist.  Honestly, the last two stories, \\"Based Upon a True Story\\" and \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" weren't my favorite, but that's not to say they weren't well-written ~ it just wasn't my sort of humor.  But overall, a good, witty, gift book for the reader on your holiday list.

B000C65Z1G|4.0|... with a few of the same fine actors.<br />And any two would make a nice double feature.  'Gardener' and 'Fugitive' share the BigPharmaCorp conspiracy theme, while 'Cafe' and 'Gardener' fold in abject world poverty.  The first two are actioners, while \\"The Girl in the Cafe\\" is quiet but powerful, and my favorite of the three.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I LOVE MOVIES WHEN THE \\"MONSTER\\" KILL THE POLICE! MOST HORROR FLICKS LIKE TO HAVE THE POLICE JUST TELL THE \\"CHARACTERS\\" ITS NOT TRUE WHAT YOU SAW! BUT THIS MOVIE HAD THEM SAY THAT, AND THE POLICE GOT TO SEE THE \\"MONSTER\\" AND GET PARTS OF THIER BODYS EATEN! COOL MOVIE, DON'T YOU PEOPLE AGREE!
B00005JPCA|5.0|My wife and I literally high-fived when we heard Daniel Craig had been selected as the new Bond.  We've been fans for years, most notably of his work in 'The Mother' and 'Layer Cake.'  Besides flat-out looking like a movie star, the guy is simply a great actor...and one not afraid to take chances.  Check out 'The Mother' if you doubt that.<br /><br />So, to hear doubters and naysayers pooh-pooh the Craig selection smacked to us as coming from people who'd simply never seen Daniel Craig in...anything.  Now that the movie is out, all those negative opinions have disappeared.  Hats off, for example, to CNN's Jeanne Moos, who typifies the type and went on air to apologize.  Craig had simply bowled her over...as he has everyone.<br /><br />Craig's selection was but one part of an effort to strip-down and re-tool the Bond series from the bloated buffoonery of the last Brosnan-era releases.  Everyone seems to be in agreement that they'd turned ridiculous.  Producer Barbara Broccoli has done a masterful job protecting and re-inventing the franchise managed for so long by her late Dad, Cubby.
B00005JPFF|3.0|oh my god...............why did these producers do venom this way? i mean.......this movie was a major disappointment! venom deserved his own movie with spiderman like boring goblin and dr oct! everybody who came to the movies had on venom shirts and everything, and we all left the movies shaking our head like....what happened? venom was completly nothing like the comic's! his role was short,and he even didn't introduce his self as venom! but other then the let down to all of venom fans,the movie was still a good movie! it had alot of humor,romance,great battles,and a little to much crying!

B000K7VHQE|5.0|The story of a family of real oddballs who are determined to take the little daughter to California to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine pagent. Satirical, touching, hysterically funny and terribly sad, this film is a must-see. The entire cast is incredibly good. Standout performances from Abigail Breslin (the daughter), Greg Kinnear (the father), Alan Arkin (grandpa), and Steve Carrell (the disallusioned, suicidal gay brother). Highly, highly recommended. Oscars all around for this film!
0307341542|3.0|I bought \\"Sharp Objects\\" after reading a short review of it in a magazine while on a cross-country plane trip.  Given the comments in the review and the blurbs contained on the book jacket, I was expecting an edge-of-my-seat, creepy thriller.  What I found was a mildly unsettling book that lacked any real suspense.  I can't say too much without spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say I had both mysteries figured out before I was halfway through the book.  In addition, I found all the characters to be almost one-dimensionally unpleasant; it was as though Flynn was afraid to show the good side of anyone, including her protagonist.    <br /> <br />This is not to say that the book is without redeeming qualities.  It is well-written and nicely paced, and the author does a good job of conveying the protagonist's thoughts and feelings.  I'm not sorry I read it, but I do wish I'd waited for it to come out in paperback.
B000089A07|5.0|I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's one I find myself watching alot. While all the performances are above average, I found Fiennes and Watson to be the most interesting part of the film. Their tragic romance, coupled with the infamous scene w/Hoffman, help liven up what could have been a very average thriller. I thought Norton was a little ho-hum, and while I like Hopkins alot, I was somewhat disheartened to see him primarily used as comic relief. But these are actually minor flaws, and while this film is far from perfect, it generally sticks to the novel by Thomas Harris(one of the best thrillers ever written; if you haven't read the book, you should...). An enjoyable, B-grade masterpiece.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|This movie was almost unbearable - the only funny part was at the end.  The language was horrible and senseless...and definitely do not let children watch this because of it...all I can say is that - if you have 104 extra minutes - go for it but it is not going to be worth your time.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|To tell you the truth, metal is my least favorite genres. I hate Slayer, Judas Priest, Linkin Park etc..... Im more into hip hop/funky type of stuff. But a friend of mine said I have to litsen to this cd, This is unbelivebly awesome. So i figured what the hell. And he was right, these guys blew my fu**in ears away. Hangar 18 is one of the best songs I ever herd. These guys has such amazing guitar solos that Im actually banging my head like crazy to it. The is got to be one of best rock band in the 90s and not just that I think theyre one of the best in rock history. <br />Thats all I got to say...COP THIS ALBUM
1400079276|3.0|This is a very good read - literature wise, that is. This is not something for everyone, especially those looking for a light read.  I do think the book could have been about 100 pages less without damage being done, however. In any case, its writing style is excellent and the characters are developed to quite an extent. I like Mishima and Kawabata a bit more than Murakami, but that says nothing against Murakami - just a personal preference.<br /><br />I did not like the Oshima character because this character just tends to have too much knowledge... a know-it-all of sorts. A character that seems to be there just to give the writer a method to lecture or to be a device for explanatory necessities. Oshima is annoying. The main character, Kafka, is 15 years old, but has more intellectual knowledge than most 25 year olds. I can accept a bright 15 year old, but this kid is beyond genius, and thus it is easy to forget, as you read, that he is 15.<br /><br />The sexuality typical in Murakami is, again, present here. Which is fine if you are familiar with Murakami - after all, this novel is about an oedipal sort of tale.<br /><br />I liked this one more than Norwegian Wood and I recommend it to anyone who can handle a lot of esoteric/psychology instead of an action/thriller plot.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie after my dad sent it to us labeling it a \\"have to watch as soon as possible\\" movie.  So we watched it right away, and it didn't disappoint.  We will probably be watching several times over again for years.  We cried, we laughed, we cried some more, and we laughed a lot.  And I screamed out of embarrassment during a pageant scene, which I won't mention, because the plot kind of revolves around it.<br /><br />Yeah, there's a lot of language, and it's not supposed to be a kid's movie.  I don't think the language was gratuitous - it fit the characters.  There are plenty of kids movies out this holiday season already.  Just because this movie is about a family doesn't mean that you should take your whole family (especially the little ones) to see it.<br /><br />This movie is raw and emotional.  The tension in Richard and Sheryl's marriage was almost unbearable.  You could tell that both of them wanted to do what was right to take care of their family, but they just had wildly opposite ways of getting there, and they didn't have the communication tools to actually talk about things, so instead they just shouted.  Actually, Richard pretty much shouts at everyone.  The irony of him being a self-help author is poignant.  Grandpa swears, is practically obsessed with sex, and snorts heroine, as others have mentioned.  But he was also in WWII, so I figure he earned the right to do just about anything he wants.  The family seems to think so too.<br /><br />The best part is, as others have mentioned, the fact that this functionally dysfunctional family was able to come together to support each other when they need to, and the love and acceptance that they ultimately give each other.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this movie.  It's great to see Hollywood doing movies that aren't all sugary and sweet, but deal with real  problems of real people, in a real way without neatly wrapped up endings.
B000001FI7|5.0|This album was the soundtrack of my teenage years, and i still listen to it. Beth Gibbons sings with her soul... this is the best portishead album, and the best trip hop album ever. Love it.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|This is a very different hostage/bank robbery drama.  A group of bad guys led by Clive Owen take over a bank in lower Manhattan.  Instead of taking the money and running, Owen's band take all the people in the bank hostages and make them all wear the same uniform and masks that they are wearing (so the cops can't tell the good guys from the bad guys and neither can the hostages too as a matter of fact).  They then make it clear to the police that arrive on the scene outside that they have a hostage situation in the bank. <br /> <br />Denzel Washington is called in to be the hostage negotiator for the police.  Washington was recently involved in a scandal that prevented him from getting a promotion.  In the meantime the Bank's CEO (Christopher Plummer) is meeting with Jodie Foster.  Apparently there is something in one of the bank's safe deposit boxes that Plummer wants protected.  This causes Foster to call in some favors (with the mayor and others) so she can be let into the bank without interference from Washington and talk to the bad guys directly. <br /> <br />I keep saying this movie is very different.  Firstly you are never too sure what the bad guys want but you suspect it has to do with what Plummer doesn't want them to have.  Also the movie has some interesting directing and story telling which seems to go back and forth between the hostage standoff and interviews with people that were in the bank after everything was resolved. <br /> <br />Washington and Owen both give brilliant performances and Willem DaFoe is excellent in a supporting role.  It is a well conceived and brilliantly executed movie.  The only drawback to me is that it was never quite clear how Owen learned what he did about what was in the bank. <br />

B000ICL3KG|5.0|The point of watching this movie is to begin to familiarize oneself with some of the most basic scientific facts behind the impending global environmental crisis, which is by far the gravest danger that humankind has ever faced.   <br /> <br />Even beyond the more immediately obvious consequences of storms and droughts, rising sea levels and ecosystem disruption, a recent Scientific American article (Oct. 2006) points out compelling evidence that several of the Earth's past mass extinction events (including ones that destroyed >95% of all species) were caused when high CO2 levels from ancient volcanoes resulted in extensive acidification, deoxegenation and heating of the oceans, killing most marine species, and causing a build-up in the oceans of toxic gases produced by anaerobic bacteria, gases which then upwelled into the air in large plumes, killing most land animals as well.   <br /> <br />If present trends continue, we could be faced with CO2 levels comparable to those that apparently caused these past mass exinction events by near the end of this century.  Even today, we are already beginning to see increasing numbers of deoxygenated \\"dead zones\\" in the ocean, produced by some of the same effects, which are already beginning to kill shoreline animals via red tides and so forth.  As CO2 levels triple over the next century, as they will if we bury our heads in the sand with a \\"business as usual\\" approach, the possibility of these dead zones growing into another world-wide mass extinction event, this time caused by our own negligence, becomes frighteningly plausible.  If this happens, we cannot just blindly assume that humanity will be among the small percentage of species that will be lucky enough to survive the environmental cataclysm.  Thus, taking steps TODAY to begin to normalize CO2 levels could be essential for the survival of humankind beyond the coming century. <br /> <br />So, if you don't want your grandchildren and great-grandchildren to wind up choked to death by poisonous gases spewing out of dead oceans, then PLEASE, see this movie, get to know the science behind it (which is thoroughly documented in numerous high-quality, peer-reviewed scientific journals), and then TAKE ACTION - for, changing the world begins with our individual and collective political will.

0307346609|3.0|There are many impressive things about this book.  Max Brooks has an intricate imagination that borders on psychosis, but is solidly based in rational cause and effect to avoid being too neurotic.  I greatly appreciate his author's bio in his first book, _The Zombie Survival Guide_, that painted him as a survivalist freak living in an undisclosed location, while the plain bookleaf bio that presents itself in the introduction of this book as well seems to show a bit of a weakness in the work itself, and that is an overinflated sense of the narrator as a world-defining reporter (Studs Terkel comes to mind, only in part because of the acknowledgement at the end), which in the end keeps an unsurpassable level of removal from the 'human factor' that is attested to, the element that truly thwarted the zombie takeover and kept civilization alive, according to the book.<br /><br />This omission is curious, because Brooks sets up what should be the classical metaphor for zombies, a metaphor that is present in all monster tales but most prevalent, I believe, in zombie stories: that is, that the monsters ultimately represent humanity.  Take the classic George A. Romero _Dawn of the Dead_: zombies walking around a mall because the place represented some fond memory for them in their lives?  What better comment could you have about commercial America?  In fact, every stage of Romero's Living Dead series reflects more upon the nature of humanity than on the zombies themselves.<br /><br />And Brooks seems to understand that in this book by focusng more on the effect of the war on the people involved rather than focus on the zombies themselves.  In other zombie stories, the zombies themselves are used to mirror human nature, but in this book, Brooks decided to keep the zombies (or Gs or Zach, according to who is talking at the time) out of the main picture and relegate them to background animosity.  This would normally leave a lot of room to delve into the depth of the characters involved, but Brooks' ability to draw characters is rather thin.  In the end, Brooks left himself but one device to sketch his characters in this book, and that was through the use of monologue, which ultimately is a poor method of characterization, for there is little action to base the character's words against.  Also, Brooks is more focused a times on the events themselves than the characters involved (for example, the Yonkers massacre), and so there is a lot of encyclopedic references to foreign culture disguised as first-hand knowledge and a lot of invented military terms for this fictitious war.  The depth of Brooks' imagination is, as I said before, impressive, but this book fails to truly delve into that human factor promised from the start, since the mirrors of humanity (the zombies themselves) are but a background veneer in this, and the narration is delegated to monologues of characters whose reliability is hard to weigh most of the time.<br /><br />I found this a good book and a fun read, but my impression of it won't be a lasting one, when there seemed to be such a good opportunity to write a classic.rs involved, but Brooks' ability to draw characters is rather thin.

B000002OVJ|3.0|That's right, but only because this version is far from complete. The only one to buy is the Deluxe Edition of Live at Leeds which contains a whole other CD with the rest of the concert, namely the band playing Tommy, easily the best versions of those songs available, so superior to the relatively tame studio versions. This version should really be withdrawn: who in their right mind would want a truncated version when the whole heavenly experience is available? And the Tommy sequence really tops everything that came before. I don't know whether the sound is the same on this version and the Deluxe Edition, but certainly on the latter it's perfect: music that sounds like music, a million miles away from the nauseating slickness of The Beatles' Love, with all its shallow sugariness (I'm commenting on the sound, NOT the songs).
B000J10EQU|2.0|I could get \\"in depth\\" on why this expensive movie was not entertaining to me but part of the problem is I am spoiled for entertainment. I have seen so many movies lately that \\"special effects\\" are not so special anymore. When a movie like this is left on it's own merit by way of story and plotline.....well the comic books have a better story. Compared to similar movies such as Batman Begins, it really fails to deliver anything original or new on the old superman theme. So wait until it's in the bargain bin if you can.

1573225517|4.0|This is one of the rare occasions when I actually enjoyed a book more than the film (and I did like the film). Nick Hornby has a knack for just writing about things I like. The regular references to Top 5's is a clever touch as it nudges the reader to compare to their own. This is entertaining from start to finish, not too dissimilar to the film and very easy to read.
0553328255|5.0|Why is it that one of the user reviews says it ends with THE FINAL PROBLEM? If they are in order that should not be the case. Sherlock Holmes returns later. (THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE) Is it defenetly the complete collection?
0061015725|2.0|I read Jurrasic Park with great enthusiasm. I'm no scientific genius but I could easily follow the science in the plot, which made the book very enjoyable. Not so with this one. The science in the beginning seems like it could be comprehensible to a knowledgable person. However as the novel goes on, it begins to wheel completely out of control, and in the concluding sections just gives way to slam-bang action. Mr Crichton seems to have no consideration for the familiarity of the reader with the scientific aspect of this story. A dissapointment to me.
0802130208|2.0|With so many people raving about this book this is hard for me to say, but somebody has to. This book is not that good. It is frustrating, self indulgent and ridiculous. As I read it I couldn't help but think that I was stuck in the front row watching bad British Theater. You know, the type of theater where the main character is a bumbling buffoon and everyone around him reacts to his antics in a manner designed to only encourage him. Meanwhile you're sitting there screaming in you head, \\"Just stop it! STOP IT! Stop behaving like complete idiots.\\"  <br /> <br />The reviews of this book use phrases like, \\"comic masterpiece\\", \\"obscenely funny\\", and \\"explosion of comedy.\\"  Wow. With praise like that how could this book be anything but hilarious? But it's not hilarious nor is it obscenely funny and I am still waiting for the explosion of comedy. Ignatius is one of those characters who everyone has run into at some time in their life and has made every effort to avoid. He is a train wreck. He is outlandish, misguided, loud, arrogant and overly impressed by his own intellect. I wouldn't want someone like that in my life and while I was reading this book, I couldn't wait to get him out of my head.  <br /> <br />If you have not read this book, please, by all means, read it. When you are done come back and post your thoughts. Don't be intimidated by all the positive reviews. I have a feeling that there is a huge silent majority that is simply afraid to speak the truth. The emperor is naked and this book is not funny. <br /> <br />I would bet that those that give this book such great reviews think that Benny Hill is a comic genius.  <br />

B000J10ERO|3.0|Superman Returns has much going for it. The action scenes are well done, Brandon Routh is very good as the man of steel and it has some good plot twists. However there are too many scenes that drag on a little too long, and the film would benefit from having about half an hour chopped out of it. Overall very enjoyable but I can't help feeling I'll be fast forwarding past some of the scenes when I watch it again.
0393061434|5.0|<br />I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and read it every chance I got. <br /> <br />Some people seem to have misconceptions about the book - it is more of an autobiography than a step-by-step guide to how Apple was founded. <br /> <br />I found his history and stories to be very interesting. It's amazing that so many people related to those first computer/game systems were living in the same area and actually knew each other. And the whole section on the black box was very interesting - I didn't realize that Steve had met Captain Crunch. <br /> <br />You don't have to be technically minded or a PROGRAMMER to read this book (whoever said that is being ridiculous). At times Steve does delve into engineering terms and logic, and does his best to explain it to those who are unfamiliar. But he doesn't dwell too long on the subject - he uses the info to illustrate how important a certain discovery or achievement was. <br /> <br />Though on the other hand if you're reading the book, you probably have at least some interest in the history of computers or electronics and you won't mind a bit of technical speak at times. <br /> <br />Overall I found this book very enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone interested in the beginnings of the personal computer. <br />

B00070Q7VO|5.0|If you have yet to hear about Pop vocalist sensation Michael Buble, then it's high time you get caught up on your entertainment news. Since his 2001 self titled debut album `Michael Buble', and his sophomore follow up `It's Time', the twenty-something native of Vancouver has taken the world by storm. As if his polished pipes weren't enough, the Canadian crooner also possesses the looks, charm and attitude as if he is a missing member of the fabled Rat Pack.     `It's Time' continues the winning formula of Buble's previous release, by taking classic well known songs, and putting a fresh and unique spin on them. The opening track is a slow, steamy take on the timeless Nina Simone tune 'Feeling Good' followed by an up tempo version of the Gershwin penned `Foggy Day in London Town', what follows is a terrific mix of songs from several different eras and artists including The Beatles and Ray Charles. We are even treated to a Buble original composition, a ballad called `Home', in which we hear of the complexities and struggles of life on the road.    This is a great album, and if you are a fan of the standards, pop genre then you should really check this one out, I don't think you will be disappointed.
1573223085|5.0|According to Daniel Pink, three trends will require professionals in western countries to re-evaluate their thinking if they wish to remain competitive: <br /> <br />1) Abundance - we have everything we need, and are satiated with material goods <br />2) Asia - high-quality work can be obtained cheaper overseas <br />3) Automation - all 'left brain' behavior will be replaced by technology <br /> <br />These three forces will eventually affect nearly every aspect of business. To combat these 'threats' to our careers, we must shift our thinking from analytic to creative. Specifically, we must master six new \\"right brain\\" abilities to be effective. In the second part of the book, Pink expands on these six abilities, and explores practical applications for their use in real-life situations. <br /> <br />Want to avoid failure in the future? Then reading - and applying - this book is absolutely essential. Daniel Pink has a very thorough understanding of current economic trends, and knows what you must do to succeed in the future marketplace. <br /> <br />For this reason, I have named A Whole New Mind the #1 most influential book I read in 2006.
0307275639|5.0|A simple book with a great message(check out other reviews for synnopsis)that will have an effect on your outlook at life; if nothing less than while you are reading it. My youngest son was required to read this for a frshman college class and he told me he cried; it was the first time he had cried while reading a book. I had heard of it and decided to read it at his suggestion. I too got misty eyed while reading it and like so many other good books didn't want it to end, especially knowing the inevitable road the book was going. Although it has it's sad moments it is an uplifting story more than anything else, the human spirit is revealed and the lessons are life changing that can and should be applied to our own lives. It is a very easy book to read and can be read in one good sitting. You will  appreciate life more  after reading this book. Read this book and enjoy it and life more.

This could only have been imagined, created and produced by the man who knows the songs better than anyone else, Sir George Martin.

It shows once again the miraculous talent of the band and their producer that changed the world forever.
B000088E6D|4.0|After wining a talent contest in Canada, and later being disqualified for being under aged, Michael Buble toiled in relative obscurity, until his big break came in 2000 while singing `Mac the Knife' at a wedding in which award winning producer David Foster was attending. Foster immediately signed Buble to his record company, and in 2001 released this self titled debut `Michael Buble'.  <br /> <br />Although it achieved modest success in his native Canada, it went largely unnoticed in the United States. However with the huge success of his sophomore release `It's Time', in both Canada and the U.S. many people have gone back to sample his early recording. <br />  <br />Though critics have accused Buble of attempting to be nothing more that a Frank Sinatra clone, I believe that he attempts to channel the spirit of The Chairman more than he tries to imitate him. Sure, if you compare `Come Fly With Me' with Sinatra's Capitol recording, the two are nearly indistinguishable, but it's in the other tracks that you find Buble hitting his stride and strutting his stuff.  <br />My favorite tracks are 'Fever' (made famous by Peggy Lee) and the classic Van Morrison tune 'Moondance', both of which really swing with an attitude of excitement for a genre of music that seems to have been forgotten or ignored by an entire generation. <br /> <br />This CD spans several eras from artists like Lou Rawls, Dean Martin, and even The Bee Gees and Queen. There is no mistake that Buble takes these classic tunes from the 40's through the 70's and makes them his own as he belts out some original, catchy arrangements. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the Rat Pack era music, or if you have just become a fan of the old standards due to the cross over success of artist like Rod Stewart you should really enjoy this album. <br />
B000BI0WOA|5.0|For the MTV generation, the mention of Dire Straits conjures up images of their groundbreaking video for the mega hit \\"Money for Nothing\\" (three weeks at No. 1 in 1985). For this aging Baby Boomer, my love affair with the music of Mark Knopfler came six years earlier with the release of \\"Sultans of Swing.\\" I bought every album (yes, vinyl!) through 1985's BROTHERS IN ARMS. I didn't upgrade to CD until 1998's BEST OF. Now along comes this two-disc collection which all but duplicates the earlier anthology and adds a second disc primarily devoted to Knopfler's solo work.<br /><br />There are no real suprises on disc-1. The primary difference is that this release uses the studio versions of \\"Love over Gold\\" and \\"Your Latest Trick,\\" in addition to adding the 14-minute-plus \\"Telegraph Road\\" (by far the longest track in the Dire Straits canon). [Although I do miss the exclusion of \\"Twisting by the Pool.\\"] What makes this a worthwhile purchase is the tracks from Knopfler's solo career--including his soundtrack work. Standout tracks are the celtic-flavored \\"Why Aye Man\\" and his duet with James Taylor on \\"Sailing to Philadelphia.\\" [I also would have enjoyed a track from his 1990 collaboration NECK AND NECK with one of Knopfler's influences Chet Atkins.]<br /><br />All told, this is a concise, albeit brief, overview of an ongoing career by one of the music world's distinctive voices.  [Running Time - Disc One, 77:29, Disc Two, 61:30] VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000BOH8XW|3.0|I really like this CD not as good as laundry service, but i still enjoyed most of the tracks. what my complaint is that hips don't lie is not on the first release. I feel cheated, I am not going out to buy a second CD just for a new song. I feel that the record company shouldn't add a song the re-release the cd. I notice some other bands are doing this as well, maybe thats why cd sells are dropping. <br />
B000002L99|3.0|Don't get me wrong-this album is great. I was weary at first with Hagar in the picture.  It took a little while, but the \\"Van Hagar\\" sound caught on.  I give this album 3 stars due to the TERRIBLE mastering process done with the original 1986 CD release.  Given, it was CD tech in it's infancy- but listen to it!!  Where's a remaster?  Even the Japan import release from 2002 is no improvement.  Listen to 5150 tracks from the \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" release from 2004-you'll hear a major difference.
B00064MW6K|3.0|I rented this film not too long ago to see how terrible it was and I find that the criticism was mostly justified! I say mostly because I rather liked Halle's performance as Patience Phillips/Catwoman and not just for the suggestive poses and the skin tight leather! Her acting in this film is actually quite good in my view. Too bad the script sucked a*#! Her supporting cast was mediocre at best. Bennjamin Bratt (who is usually pretty good) was flat in this and Sharon Stone was just plain awful! <br /> <br />I actually didn't mind that this was a different Catwoman but I though some nod to the previous character Selena Kyle should've been included somewhere. <br /> <br />Overall, its not the WORST film in history but I wouldn't recommend it for a buy. A rental or if you must buy it, get it used or at a reduced price. Again, Halle is the only redeeming thing in this whole film for BOTH her effort as an actress (considering the script she was given) and the outfit! Beyond that, I can't really recommend this film.
B000EGDC14|3.0|OK, so Alison goes mainstream. Yeah, she vamps it up (big time) in the videos (supplied on the DVD disc included in the deluxe edition), and even alludes to doing heroin in 'Ride a White Horse' (how chic). Her stage show (also shown on the DVD) even features faceless, latex laden dancers luridly prancing about, sort of like a Madonna debauche-fest. It's all supposed to sell records and get folks off their large butts to see her show. And, sure enough, she's sold a bunch of units and her stage show is a big hit. But the question begs to be asked: is this yet another talented artist who went for the big payday and instantly became irrelevant (a la The Dandy Warhols)? Well, maybe ... not.<br /><br />Goldfrapp remains committed to the music. And the seemless blending of '80's pop, electronica, and glam sensibilities really works here. On the first track, 'Ooh La La', I thought Alison was channeling Marc Bolan (of T-Rex fame - before you were born, remember?). No question, she and Will Gregory made a calculated turn away from the prosaic emotionalism of \\"Felt Mountain\\" (their first LP). \\"Black Cherry\\" (their second LP) got them on a roll and, frankly, I would have preferred less glam on \\"Supernature\\" and more straight ahead alternative rock (a la 'Crystalline Green' found on \\"Black Cherry\\"). With this new LP, despite its pop leanings, there isn't a whole lot to complain about. Every, and I mean every, track has a solid hook, soaring vocals and harmonies, interesting sonic treatments, or something else going for it.<br /><br />Alison's voice is amazing. Coupled with the electronic wizardry of Will Gregory, Goldfrapp has put the music world on notice. Hopefully, with their next LP, they'll add a percussionist and pour something more meaningful than campy schmaltz into the mix.<br /><br />For now, having just discovered this CD, I'm munching on the candy and enjoying the flavor by the mouthful. I know, deep down though, that this candy probably just won't endure after 15 or 20 listens (at most). It'll eventually cause cavities, in my brain.ter 15 or 20 listens (at most).

B000IJ79WU|5.0|I asked for this film to see how subtle differences in the director's style and tone can improve a film or make it worse. Without giving too much away, the coherence added simply through Marlon Brando's presence alone makes this film worth the price. Everything other alteration is just the icing on the cake. Yes, there are things noticeably missing from Lester's version. However, overall, this is clearly the superior cut. If nothing else it proves pulling Donner off the film was a huge mistake by the movie studio, regardless of their budget concerns. Had Donner had been given a chance to finish, the movie would have easily trumped the orinigal Superman.
0307276902|5.0|... as a person. I do not know if he is a fraud, or a liar. What I do know is that this book is one fantastically, scary, riveting read about an intensely personal struggle of the main character, James. I'm a HUGE fan of Marion Keyes' book Rachel's Holiday, which is also about addiction - and though I know there is no Rachel in real life, I found her a heroine and took many valuable lessons from that book. I find myself doing the same with the character James and this book. The book hits with the force of a fist and does not let you look away. An excellent read.
B000JBXXZ4|1.0|I'm not sure why I expected anything more than a pile of heaping, steaming brown poo, especially since Crow Left of the Murder sucked so bad.  They seriously either need to go back to making good rock or just throw in the towel and give up.  It's sad to see the #1 rock band in the world at one point go from EXCELLENT to Crow Left of the Murder and the even worse Light Grenades...it's insulting.
B000002U82|5.0|I first heard this album a few years ago and it completely blew my mind. From start to finish, it is amazing. This is an album that you can't skip around on. It should be treated like one big piece of music, cause that's what it is. If you like this album, I also reccomend the Wall and Wish You Were Here. Pink Floyd blows me away every time.
B000J10EQU|5.0|I just recently watched the \\"Christopher Reeve collection\\" all four Superman movies in a row, so when I watched Superman Returns I had a proper visual in my mind to compare it too. Is it fair to compare them? Of course, because growing up with Christopher Reeve as \\"the\\" only superman makes me an expert skeptic, and with all the remakes and rip offs out there now, if you choose to make one you must be open to comparison. Superman is a seminal character in comic book, pop culture and movie history, essentially an alien story he has become the ultimate earth champion. I was afraid that making a new superman movie would pull him out of his gentleman old fashioned movie star ways, and recast him as some idiotic CGI modern superstar. Thank God they got it right!<br /><br />From the opening scene, with Brando's voice I just knew they were going to honor what came before. Brandon Routh is eerily similar to Reeves, both in looks and mannerisms. I am not sure how much of that is planned, or if Routh just carries himself the same way. Kevin Spacey as Lex is also like looking at Gene Hackman they both can carry off the \\"sneering, comical criminal mastermind\\", and look darn good bald. In the original movies I personally couldn't stand Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. Kidder never embodied Lane the way the comics fleshed her out to be, a strong reporter headstrong woman but feminine and just a bit naïve, She was to abrasive and manly and quite frankly not all that attractive. So I hoped they would cast a better Lois, and that is the only thing they failed in. Kate Bosworth? Who's range of acting roles at this point have been to play surfers and horse lovers and Sandra Dee (who she also messed up). She is really a blonde, and the wig they used for her was awful, too high on her forehead. She is also too skinny and angular and just has one face for every single emotion. Routh deserved a better Lois just as Reeves did. As for the character of Kitty, played by the marvelous genius Parker Posey (who should have been Lane instead) she almost stole that movie altogether.<br /><br />As for the content of this movie, the plot, it was acceptable. They kept it simple and straightforward and executed it correctly without going too overboard and inserting too many CGI moments. (if you have ever read my reviews I abhor the misuse of CGI) the only time I cringed a bit was the close up of Superman flying and it was obviously not a green screen profile. The costumes were magnificent (love the new Superoutfit), the sets were breathtaking,  Bryan Singer made his own Superman, while honoring the old, and that is how it should be.er Posey (who should have been Lane instead) she almost stole that movie altogether. <br /> <br />As for the content of this movie, the plot, it was acceptable.

0735619670|4.0|This book presents numerous tips, hints and practices that minimize the effort needed to understand and maintain software code. The author seems to be a strong advocate of self-documenting code that doesn't need comments to explain its purpose. As a result, his suggestions are mostly centered around this idea. Sometimes he tends to take things to the extreme (e.g. declaring a class that includes a separate object that implements it), but most of his ideas and propositions make sense. <br /> <br />The author sometimes repeats a lot of his suggestions and tips in some form or the other, which may get annoying. This does however, allow the reader to read the book in a non-sequential fashion. <br /> <br />Occasionally, the book may present contradictory suggestions. At one point for example, the author strongly advocates passing individual parameters to routines in order to enhance decoupling (instead of passing objects that contain these parameters). At a later point however, he argues (correctly) that passing objects into routines is OK if it satisfies the abstraction of the routine. A more consistent picture would be nice to have in future editions. <br /> <br />Overall, a great book for those looking to improve their coding styles and practices.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|This album is different from a lot of their other stuff, but it is very good in the sence that it delivers a strong anti-war message.  The first couple lines in The Postwar Dream, the first song on the album, are,\\"tell me true, tell me why, was jesus crusified?  Was it for this that daddy died?\\"  It is an album that you actually have to listen to a few times to get what its saying but it is well worth it.  And trust me I know my Floyd.  I have 13 out of their 15 or 16 albums so I know a good amount.  Plus this album has classics like When The Tigres Broke Free and The Fletcher Memorial Home, but the best song on here besides those is The Gunners Dream.  Give it a try.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I bought this album about 6 months after it came out, and I thought it was very good. It wasn't mind blowing or anything, but it's one of the better records out today. This was the first Green Day album i've bought, and ever since I've been buying some of their older stuff. All in all, this is a solid album.
0441172717|3.0|This book would be a great gift to a younger reader (age 12 or so) to get them interested in the science fiction field.  However, for older readers there are just a lot of better books out there.  To some a three star review is bad but this is not a bad book.  It is just not a great book.
B000FSME1A|5.0|I am a big fan of Apocalypse Now, and watched it when it first came to the theaters back in the late 70's.  There are many films endings and variations of this film, which makes it the more interesting, I also got the Redux version with the additional scenes, which makes the movie even more stranger, but I have to say, this special edition is excellent due in part to the commentary by Francis Ford Coppola.  I know the movie by heart, but it is nice to know the inner workings and stories that come straight from the Director himself.  So far this will be the fourth DVD added to my collection.  If your a fan of this movie, it is worth getting this edition.  5 stars !
B00005JPDS|4.0|I just left the theater a few hours ago with my sister inlaw, seeing this very inspirational movie about struggle, hardship, perserverance and pride.  Will Smith did an excellent job capturing every heartfelt moment of his character. Its very rare that I cry watching movies, but the scenes that left me speechless and in tears were the bathroom scene, and the boardroom scene (near the end of the movie). Will deserves an oscar nom, if not the award for this movie, he was excellent.  The bathroom scene was so moving, especially the way he got his son to believe that they were hiding from dinosaurs.  It was by far the best acting scenes ever by any actor.  I know in a lot of movies when actors have to cry, you know its not real tears, but Will sure had me fooled. His emotions throughout the movie were so intense, I swear those many of his tears were real.  The courage the real life Chris Gardner had, to hold it all together despite his struggles to maintain some sense of self-respect, while trying to provide food and shelter for himself and his son. So many people complain about how bad their life is and some turn to drugs and violence as a means to survive, but this guy represents what it truly means to stand and deliver and that he did.  As Malcom X said \\"A man who stands for nothing falls for anything\\".  Chris Gardner stood for plenty and it paid off.  Little Will was so adorable in this movie, but yet his compassion and humor throughout the movie gave you hope for what would become of him. (probably an actor like his dad) Great movie!!  If Will does get an Oscar or Golden Globe for this, it is well deserved.
B000AQJPQE|5.0|This is really neat.  It lights up and spins and all that good stuff.  The \\"comet maker\\" is really only a tiny flashlight... and be prepared to put some pretty good size holes in your ceiling... but it is a great thing to watch and very educational when used with the soundtrack.
0930289234|5.0|This is defintely not a normal comic book.  There is so much going on in this story that you will want to read it at least twice.  If this book were not written, I truly believe that there would not be many graphic novels being produced right now.  This is the granddaddy of them all so buy it now and enjoy.
B00004TH7Z|1.0|Matter of life and death is much better.  Brave new world is lame progressive rock NOT heavy metal.  They don't even do a good job at making progressive rock either.  Check out Therion, Iced Earth, or Dream Theater instead.
B000M341XW|5.0|if marty doesn't win an academy award this time i will never watch the academy awards again. dicaprio should win too. best performance i've seen all year. i've quickly become a leo fan ever since the aviator. much better then the orginal film it was based on in my opinion.
B000002J0N|4.0|I became exposed to Deja Vu back in fall 2002 once, and I started to seriously listen to them last fall. I then heard Shadow Captain for the first and fell in love with it IMMEDIATELY! I especially like to listen to it when cutting through small towns. I like that bit of a country sound in it. It was someone else's cd, and now it's mine.<br /><br />I'm just now seeing the cover (the origional cd owner didn't have the cover and case). Looks cool.<br /><br />As of last fall, Crosby is my favorite group. I play the heck out of Captain Shadow. And I mean playing it repeatedly for up to an hour straight. Listening to that song made them my fave group. I do love a few other cuts by them, and love hearing all their voices at the same time, even when Young was in the group.<br /><br />Funny, this album came out a year after I was born, but I just recently got exposed to it!<br /><br />Rock on, CSN!
B000HCO83Q|1.0|And the winner of the worst movie of 2006 goes to..... X-Men - The Last Stand. Congratulations.  I don't know how anyone who likes the X-men, which I do, could ever like this movie.  By the way I am a big fan of the first two movies and I thought there was no way they could mess this up.  Boy was I wrong.  There idea for a \\"good\\" movie was to take the best storyline in X-men lore and change it drastically, and not for the better.  Who thought this was a good idea.  The makers of this movie probably did not think it was a good idea but they knew that fans of the first two movies would come watch this no matter what crap they made.  Unfortunately, they were right.
B000LC55F2|2.0|When I went to see this movie I had no idea of what to expect.  This movie was often interesting for a film consisting of a weak plot.  It is about two aggressively competitive magicians that rival against each other for the duration of the movie.  As the plot slowly unfolds there is an accidental killing, a suicide, revenge, hatred brewing, and one of the characters goes to prison.  There is a twist at the end that I will not give away.  The aura of this movie is drab, lachrymose, and abject. This is not the feel good movie of the year. In fact it is probably the feel depressed movie of the year.  The actual magical acts shown in this film are redundant, retro, and not so creative.  David Bowie's acting is actually impressive.  He portrays a retired yet burnt out and depressed magician.  The acting in this movie is excellent and so is the film direction.  The constant flashbacks are unique for a movie like this but can confuse and annoy the casual viewer desiring only to be entertained.  The main characters are narcissists and at times I felt their pain and anguish and at other times I felt put off by their cold, selfish, and evil ways.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Pick up some really good headphones while you're at it (trust me..).  It's impossible to pick out all of the subtle samples from Beatle songs as they are sprinkled here and there. Some are very obvious but a lot of the time you find yourself going 'I know that, but I don't know where I know it from; what song is that??'.  I think that was the idea.<br /><br />There was a bit of a wtf moment when I popped in the DVD and was disappointed to see the logo on my screen with just the music playing in the background.  It would have been better to have some kind of images or SOMETHING rather than just staring at the stupid logo.
0440180295|5.0|Every time I read this it gets better. This time around it was for a course I took called \\"Modern Novel\\". I love this book, but if you aren't into abstract thinking and are easily confused by alien philosophy, and social commentary it's probably not for you. For the true Kurt Vonnegut or Douglas Adams fan it is a masterpiece.
B00005JPDS|4.0|When Oprah Winfrey interviewed the real Christopher Gardner, I found his story absolutely amazing, more so than the film adaptation of his life, \\"The Pursuit of Happyness.\\" There are many things to appreciate about this kind of film: it's an inspiring Rags to Riches story with a main character who must overcome adversity if he's to succeed. It also reinforces a number of life lessons that many have yet to learn. However, something different needed to be done if the intention was to actually impress me; yes, this film is inspiring, but so is \\"Working Girl,\\" \\"Cinderella Man,\\" and \\"Erin Brockovich.\\" This kind of film has been made many, many times before, and frankly, it's getting tiresome.    So why am I giving it four stars? I suppose because, as worn out and cliched as this story is, it at least has some decent performances and a good message. And it delivers exactly as you expect it to: if you want a feel good film, you've got a feel good film. I'm sure those of you who aren't as jaded as I am will be reduced to tears by the plight of Gardner, played in the film by Will Smith. He overcomes a number of difficult circumstances, ones that many wouldn't be able to handle if they were in his place. Living in San Francisco in 1981, Gardner tried his hand at selling bulky bone density machines to hospitals, thinking that such a technology would be preferred over traditional x-rays. Unfortunately, most of the hospitals considered them to be unnecessary luxuries and weren't willing to invest.    As a result of slow business, Gardner and his family are in a financial crisis: their rent is months overdue; they owe the IRS; and they can't rely solely on the wife's income. How fortuitous that he should pass a man getting out of his Ferrari. \\"What do you do and how do you do it?\\" asks Gardner. \\"I'm a stockbroker,\\" replies the man, pointing to the building they're both standing next to. He also says that you don't necessarily have to go to college to be a stockbroker; you only need to be good with numbers and good with people. This inspires Gardner to apply for the internship program at Dean Witter. He's offered a position (aided by his ability to solve a Rubik's Cube). Despite the fact that he'll receive no salary, and despite the fact that he's down on his luck, he accepts the offer, believing that if he can work through the internship, something better will come along.    Unfortunately, it's too little too late in terms of his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton). Years of financial strain have pushed her to the breaking point, and she decides to leave for New York. Of course, she wants to take their five-year-old son, Chris, Jr. (played by Smith's real life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith), but both she and Gardner know that she can't care for him. Thus, Chris is left with his father. This suits Gardner just fine; early on, his voiceover narration says that he didn't meet his real father until he was twenty-six, and that no matter what, he would make sure his children knew who their father was.    For most of the rest of the film, it seems as if everything will continue to go downhill. For one thing, he can no longer afford to pay his rent, meaning he has to leave his apartment. He and his son move into a local motel, where he pays half of what he paid for rent. But then the IRS finally catches up with him, taking over six hundred dollars out of his bank account. He's left with just over twenty dollars, which is not nearly enough to pay for their room. This paves the way for one of the film's more devastating scenes; with nowhere else to go for the night, they lock themselves in a subway bathroom. The impact of the scene is heightened by the fact that someone continuously rattles the door on the other end.    The effectiveness of this scene depended on its originality. I say this because the rest of the film is unflatteringly run of the mill. At one point, when shooting hoops with his son, Gardner says, \\"Don't let anyone tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. You want something, you go for it, period.\\" It's a fine sentiment, certainly, but haven't we heard such sentiments before? And consider the character of Alan Frakesh (Dan Castellaneta), the Dean Witter employee who trains the new interns; while he never talks down to Gardner, he does ask him to do degrading menial tasks, such as getting him coffee, buying him donuts, and re-parking his car to avoid the street sweepers. I can't help but wonder if he was included merely as a counterpoint to Gardner's good spirit; are villains of these kind required in such films?    Nonetheless, I was moved by Gardner's tenacity, which is another reason why I went ahead and gave the film four stars. He clearly doesn't know the meaning of the word \\"quit,\\" which is one of the best attitudes to have in life. Even when forced to wait in long lines to stay in homeless shelters, he refuses to settle for what he has been dealt. He's determined to make a better life for himself and his son, which is difficult considering Chris, Jr. doesn't completely understand what his father is going through. He's merely a boy of five, with a basketball, a little multicolored backpack, and a Captain America figurine in his possession. There's no denying that the kid is as cute as a button, which is probably what enabled me to look past the heavy-handedness of his line, \\"You're a good papa.\\"    I don't think there's any question of whether or not Gardner overcomes adversity; the real life Christopher Gardner is now a multimillionaire in his own firm. The fact that he succeeded clearly makes his story inspiring, and for that, I'm recommending \\"The Pursuit of Happyness.\\" Still, I got the sense that this film adaptation altered the story to make it more appealing for a mass audience, which resulted in a number of tried and true elements that have long since worn out their welcome. It can't be a good thing when a five-minute segment on \\"Oprah\\" is more interesting than a two-hour film; Gardner told Oprah his childhood Christmas Day experience. While he was taking a bath, his abusive stepfather stormed in, held a gun at him, and told him to get out of the apartment. Naked and wet, Gardner was left outside on a freezing December night. That kind of material would have made more of an impact than the material in \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" did. Unfortunately, I'm forced to settle for yet another feel good tearjerker.
0143036556|5.0|This book is read-worthy for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. The author is a Pulitzer-prize winner for the Book Guns, Germs, and Steel - of which this book is its sequel. He spends a great deal of time explaining in his first book how and why societies rise to greatness, this book then deal mainly with their collapse.<br /><br />2. The argument for sustainable development is not uncommon but this author make the case a great deal more solid by including dozens of examples of societies who overextended their capacity and eventually caused their own collapse. The warning has significant teeth when seen through this historical lens.<br /><br />3. The underlining theme is that societies often do what is necessary in order to survive; they feel compelled to do so as survival is paramount. Diamond questions at what cost is their survival. By over-harvesting, over-using, over-populating, over-building, and over-extending their resources for economic gain the very eventuality they were hoping to avoid becomes their reality.<br /><br />4. An incredibly comprehensive text using a plethora of sciences to make his point, hundreds of examples and stories, as well as spanning 1,000's of years of human history and vastly diverse geographic locations to add further evidence.<br /><br />5. As an extra bonus he includes at the end case-studies of modern societies that could very well be in a stage of collapse. He also adds several pages worth of additional reading recommendations and sources used that are particularly varied and informative.<br /><br />6. Bottom-line, this book is worth the time and effort it takes to plow through its length, though it could be read divided up by case-study and still be effective. The argument is clear and almost chilling in its possible ramifications for the modern world. Overall it's an excellent follow-up to his previous book but certainly a stand alone masterpiece in its own right.
1592402038|5.0|As an English teacher, finding this book was a Godsend. Lynne Truss, fed up with the same things that drive me crazy on a daily basis (such as misplaced apostrophes and commas), has composed a wonderfully witty book that explains proper punctuation with good humor and clever phrasing. She includes a lot of information about the history of various grammatical rules, explains how technology has always -- and is currently -- influencing the evolution of the language, and explains things in such simple and plain language even the weakest of would-be-writers can easily grasp her points.<br /><br />I never thought I would find a book about punctuation that was this much fun, but I loved every page of this quick-reading volume. I can promise you, I'll be using some of the lessons of Lynne Truss when I get back to my English class in January.
B0000255CL|4.0|This release marked a clear change in sounds for Immortal.  More clearness in their production value, and a general increase in the guitar sound resulting in clearer melodies and complex riffs (compared to their earlier releases).<br /><br />Immortal trivia: this record is the only Immortal record to not have the band members on the cover!
B00005JKG7|4.0|I orginally watched this version before I saw the remake of it. I definately liked the remake better than this version. Probably because it was more updated than this one. Also, in this version it is like they took the thriller affect only so far. They did not tip it over the top like they did in the remake. I did like this version as well though. It was very scarey in it't time and also this is a very well known movie. All in all, it was a very fun movie to watch on a cold winter's night. I do recommend this movie to all of the \\"horror classic fans\\".
B00005JPDY|5.0|The Good Shepherd is a fascinating look at how the counterintelligence unit of the CIA began. Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a priviledged Yale graduate and former Skull and Bones member who is recruited to help the United States stave off the growing threat of communism both to our East and later our South. The movie centers around the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and how and why our mission in Cuba failed. Much of the film is told through flashbacks as Wilson trys to determine how and why this mission has failed. The pacing of the film is slow, but the plot is layered, intricate and engrossing. Damon does an admirable job as Edward Wilson, he is as cold and calculating a character as I can ever remember on the screen. A man of very few words even when it comes to his wife and child. Obviously this affects his marriage but the film thankfully does not overbear on this point. For anyone whose read about CIA interrogation tactics, this movie will not shock or surprise you. Overall, a look inside of one of the most secretive organizations in American history should be reason enough for you to see this film, but if it's not then the superb acting and direction of De Niro will nonetheless draw you to see The Good Shepherd.<br /><br />Best Line EVER:<br /><br />Joseph Palmi (as played by Joe Pesci): The Italians we have our families and our kids, the Irish have their homeland, the Jews have their traditions, even the N----rs have their music...what do you people have?<br /><br />Edward Wilson (as played by Matt Damon): We have the United States of America, the rest of you are all visiting.
B00000K31V|5.0|This movie was very spell binding to me and to everyone that watched it with me. I just loved this movie and it was this movie that turned me on to David Cronenberg films. I love the way he directs his films in a way that you don't know what is going to come next. They all have you on your edge of your seat right up until the end. Unique plot, great acting and wonderful story with this one. I hightly recommend it to everyone that loves supense and thrill rides in a film.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I would have to say its not her Best work but still a solid album if you are a fan. Three Songs I really enjoyed.
6305949980|5.0|I finally found this movie to purchase on e-bay and have enjoyed watching it ever since. I had to avoid the \\"DVD scalpers\\" on this website and I was very glad that I did. This movie is a \\"stand alone\\" classic that has turned into a cult movie for some cultures. The story is wonderful and the animation is even greater. This movie is also great for watching from Halloween to Christmas and beyond. If you can't purchase it, rent it. It is well worth the owning.
0142000663|5.0|What else can be said about a classic. It brings today's reader back to the 1930's. This is truly a timeless classic. Steinbeck undoubtly defines the era, a people, and the hardships that occurred.
0307341542|2.0|I read this book because it was recommended as one of the top mysteries of 2006. Give me a break! Who done it was pretty obvious early in the book. There are mystery writers out there with much better writing skills. <br />Try Michael Connelly, John Burdett, Lee Childs, James Lee Burke,PD James or Sue Grafton.
B00000J2KR|4.0|I got this as part of the Kubrick box set. I had never seen it before that. <br /> <br />It took a couple viewing to absorb it all, but it is a fine story and a great piece of cinematography.
B00005221L|5.0|This is an amazing film. The tension is completely covincing, in fact, this is one of the rare films that had my heart pumping big time. It seems that after seeing enough creature-action thriller films, you become desensatized to the thrill, that's why this film shocked me so much. Everything from the heavy action, to that onimous drumbeat that means, \\"predator is near\\" screamed complete surrender.<br /><br />If you are a Schwarzenegger fan, or just like really good movies, see this.<br /><br />PS<br /><br />Don't see this if you're the least bit squeemish, as some of the violence tops Saving Private Ryan.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I initially dismissed \\"Smallville\\" because it was airing on the WB, a network known for its propensity for catering to the \\"teen crowd.\\" I assumed that this take on the Superman character would be geared to that age group and would not be of interest to those of us more \\"mature\\" viewers. However, after seeing one episode of the show, I was hooked and have been a staunch supporter of the series for the past six years.<br /><br />In revisiting the season one episodes, I've discovered how the show has grown and remains one of the best-written, acted, and enjoyable shows on network television. The series, as fans of the show know, deals with the young Clark Kent as he adjusts to his developing superhero powers while he struggles with growing up and finding his destiny as the future \\"Man of Steel.\\"<br /><br />Season one is a great start for the show, introducing the viewer to the characters long a part of the superhero mythology: Lex Luthor, Lana Lang, Jonathan and Martha Kent, along with new characters developed for the show (Clark's friends Pete Ross and Chloe Sullivan, along with Lex's father, Lionel). Each character gets a chance to shine in stories where they take center stage or have some necessary interaction with the development of Clark Kent.<br /><br />The cast is superb with special kudos to John Glover (Lionel), Michael Rosenbaum (Lex), Allison Mack (Chloe), John Schnieder (Jonathan), and Annette O'Toole (Martha). Star Tom Welling is appropriately strong yet vulnerable in his assessment of the young Clark. Kristen Kreuk is devastatingly beautiful and does well in the role of the object of Clark's desire. Sam Jones III does well in an underwritten part as Clark's best bud, Pete.  Even the lesser character of Whitney, Lana's boyfriend (Eric Johnson) grows from dumb jock to a sympathetic character that becomes essential to events during the run of the first season.<br /><br />Also, the show has an impressive line of genre guest stars: Joe Morton (\\"Terminator: Judgment Day\\"), Corin Nemic (\\"Stargate: SG1\\"), \\"George Murdock (\\"God\\" in \\"Star Trek: The Final Frontier\\"), and Shawn Ashmore (\\"The X-Men\\" movies).<br /><br />The writers have been careful to add freshness to the well-known upbringing of Superman in the mythical town of Smallville, Kansas. For much of the first season, the stories dealt with the effects of \\"meteor rocks (remnants of the exploding planet Kryton) that accompanied Kal-el (Clark's Krytonian birthname) as he descended to his new earthly home. It appears that the small Kansas town became a haven for things weird and unexplainable.<br /><br />Each single word title is crafted to be both a revelation of the story but also a peek at character insight and development. For example, \\"Hothead,\\" features Dan Lauria as a fiery and determined-to-win-at-all-costs football coach, infected by the \\"meteor rocks,\\" that is able to summon up flames with just a single thought. \\"Reaper\\" is a macabre offering about a recently deceased young man, brought back from death by the aforementioned \\"meteor rocks,\\" that is able to \\"take away the pain\\" of terminal patients, as a harbinger of death.<br /><br />Music is an integral part of the show and Mark Snow, formerly chief composer for \\"The X-Files,\\" does an outstanding job in creating music that is appropriately mysterious, thrilling, and poignant. Also, each installment makes use of musical snippets by contemporary pop/rock artists and the theme by Remy Zero (the group appears in the season finale) fits perfectly for this retelling.<br /><br />Impressive special effects and eye-popping pyrotechnics abound but never overshadow the story.<br /><br />Vancouver locations are beautiful, though a bit too picturesque for Kansas. Even The Kent farm has an idyllic quality and is a tad too \\"upscale\\" for a family that appears to be always struggling financially. But, those are just two complaints for an overall top-quality production.<br /><br />It also appears that the meteor rocks must havegiven everyone a resiliency to withstand severe falls and knocks on the head. From the number of times the Lex, Chloe, Lana, Pete, Whitney, and Jonathan get tossed around on the show, they should have reserved rooms in the Smallville hospital.<br /><br />And the Kent family truck must be built out of the same material as Clark's spaceship for it takes many a tumble but keeps on ticking...until the last episode of the year.om the number of times the Lex, Chloe, Lana, Pete, Whitney, and Jonathan get tossed around on the show, they should have reserved rooms in the Smallville hospital.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|First of all I'd just like to say, that critics are really a pain in the butt. It's unbelievable how this group has been called the \\"New Stepford Wives\\", and their sound is \\"nausiatingly pretty.\\" As a musician you are always taught that your proficiency must be like the instrument itself. You must become so much a part of the instrument that you can produce music as though that instrument were alive and doing it all by itself. Here you have an example of pinpoint note efficiency and all the performance points that go with singing and performing being done at the top of the game. But I guess in an America where mediocrity is king, it's not a good thing to be professional. I suppose Michael Jordan was just too good on the court. Joe Montana shouldn't have been such a winner. Celtic Woman needs to be more average and raw so the critics will like them.   Anyone who wants to see how music is to be performed and sung needs to grab a copy of this video or the CD. There's enough mediocrity out there,   haven't we had enough of it?
0553573411|4.0|This is the second installment of the Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb. In this installment we find FitzChivalry, [...] son of an ex heir to the throne and king's assassin, growing up.  He has become an accomplished young man with the burden of many responsibilities.  The six duchies that are Fitz' home have been under furious and relentless attacks by the Red raider ships who wreak havoc on the coastline murdering, burning villages and \\"forging\\" others by through an unknown process turn people into uncaring savages bent on destruction and death.    King Shrewd is in ill health and King in waiting Verity goes off on a quest to find the mysterious elderlings, of which ancient bards's tells proclaim can save the realm.  This leaves Fitz at Buckkeep with little between he and the spiteful and treacherous Prince Regal.  FitzChivalry soon finds that he may be little more then a fly caught in an ever growing web of intrigue.    Robin Hobbs' continues this captivating tale and plundering the depths of Fitzchivalry's psyche:  His thoughts, his motivations, and his emotions, as well as adding layers and texture to the world she has created.  While the book will serve to draw one in deeper and deeper into fitz' story, it does have its moments where it can be a bit overly descriptive and plodding.     This book is a second entry in the farseer trilogy and it should be recognized as such. This trilogy is not really three seperate books in as much as it is one very long book, so one should not expect there to be big climax's at the end, but instead part of the tale that builds the momentum to the climax at the end.    This trilogy is excellent and this book is excellent.  Don't let yourself miss out on something well worth your time and effort!
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins has written a very good book of how to reason, and test the theorys of God and creation. Some parts of it are very deep, but all in all very easy to follow and understand. I had been a devout Christian for some 40 years, but my 'faith' has been wavering for the last 2 or 3. After reading this book, (among others), I can finally shake off that gullible belief in a personified deity, and I acutally feel relieved and free! I can't say if it will do the same for you, but at the very least it will give you several different angles to question the God concept.
B000F1IQMS|3.0|This could have been much better done. The love scenes could have been left out as they served no purpose except to take up time. The movie reminded me of one of the old Three stooges, or gangster movies with a bunch of amatures running around in trench coats instead of one of the best trained and secret intellegence organizations in the world. As I had seen The'Sword Of Gideon' some years back and was very pleased, I thought this would be a good one. I was very disappointed so went out and reordered THE SWORD OF GIDION for my collection and gave Munich to one of my kids to watch so they will not waste money on it. Sad, Spielberg, you should have done better. Worth a one time look if your into spy movies.        Edwards 832
B0002PUHF6|5.0|Nice.  I remember seeing this one back in the big 80s, and to me it was an instant classic.  Jeffrey Combs is the perfect actor for Lovecraft movies, and that's probably why he's in most of them....and hopefully he will be in more in the future. <br /> <br />Okay, keep in mind, that this WAS made in the big 80s, so it won't have the latest special effects technology, but still kicks major butt in the gorefest area. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen it yet, and claim to be an HPL fan, shame on you.  run right out, buy it and come right back home anbd watch it.  <br /> <br />Well, go on.  I'm waiting. <br /> <br />DO IT! <br /> <br />NOW!
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Have seen both versions of The Parent Trap and both are excellent. For a first time viewer would recommend the newer 1998 Double Trouble version for first viewing with the original also recommended for second viewing. First because as an adult watching both movies I found the tension between the parents more interesting and believable in the Double Trouble version and second because the print quality of the newer Double Trouble version is/was superior to the vault version of the original. The contrast of print quality is striking because Disney restored the vault version of Pollyanna also starring Hayley Mills and it looks brand new with sharp images, excellent color and a print that is not faded at all whereas the vault version of the original Parent Trap does not have as sharp images, has darkened slightly and the color while good is clearly not of the same quality as the restored Pollyanna vault version. The acting in both Parent Trap versions is excellent including both Hayley Mills and Lindsay Lohan. So would recommend Double Trouble version for first viewing and if you get hooked as I did going for the original version second. The Vault version is loaded with extras, so for me I am glad to have both versions.
B00009YXHN|4.0|Well, basing this on the quality of Lovecraft screenplays, and taking into account the budget et al, this movie definitely holds its own.  It's not the genre's fault that the only people brave enough to pick up the ultimate master of horror's gauntlet are the lower budget variety (sorry, Gordon and Yunza, no offense intended).  Of course Jeffry Combs steals the show, as usual.  This movie is loosely based on Herbert West, Reanimator, and does have a very well done Lovecraftian mood throughout the whole film.  Defintely one of the \\"must watch\\" movies in the Lovecraft arena.  Watch it, buy it, own it.  Three tentacles up! <br />

B000IJ79WU|4.0|First let me state that this is a must have for any Superman fan. I was excited to hear about this release. I was looking forward to these never before scenes with Marlon Brando and Christopher Reeve and I was not dissapointed. The tone of this version has more in common with the original than the theatrical version which added more humor and camp. The new fight scenes in Metropolis were better too. <br />My main faults with this version is the order of some of the scenes and the inconsticency between scenes that were filmed at different times ( For example Lois Lane having different hairstyles and looking older in various scenes) and the one thing I did not like about the Superman movies as any diehard comic fan like myself knows that Superman cannot tun back time by flying around the Earth, and by doing so why would he have to go back to the diner to get revenge on the bully if they nver met? <br />Regardless Warner Bros and the Salkinds should never haved fired Richard Donner and instead of being cheapskates the series could have been developed into great movies not the mistakes we had with Superman III and IV.
0060763280|3.0|This book was a good read. A very good self help book.
B00005JNEI|5.0|There are a lot of people who deserve blame for the fact that the worst President in US history is still in the White House. Michael Moore is not one of them. Long before it was fashionable, long before most of the country woke up and realized how harmful and unnecessary the Iraq war is, Michael Moore was a powerful (and often lone) voice that spoke truth to power.     Fahrenheit 9/11 is not only a must-see film because of its relevance. It's also witty, engaging and very often funny. That Michael Moore manages to take such serious material and put it into a context that makes for a riveting documentary shows that, as a filmmaker, he's second to none.    After Katrina, I heard a lot of people who tried to avoid blame for having voted for Bush saying that they didn't know, they couldn't imagine how bad he would be, they thought the was right about the war, blah, blah, blah. Well, screw them. Fahrenheit 9/11 was out there, proving beyond any doubt that emperor Bush has no clothes. You weren't intelligent enough to realize that after four years of his miserable government? Shame on you. As for Michael Moore, I just want to say: \\"Thank you.\\"
B000H4JGZY|4.0|After the whole scandal with Janet Jackson, I said I would not buy another Justin Timberlake CD, but....I did and I love this CD. Timberland and Timberlake are a great combination. I don't know which song I like best, but \\"My Love,\\" \\"Sexyback,\\" and \\"Damn Girl\\" are some of my favorite songs that I keep on repeat. I did elect to get the clean virgin, so it isn't half as good as the original but I enjoy it all the same. The beats are fresh and funky. I find myself singing the chorus or my favorite part of a song. this CD is addictive.<br /><br />Sorry Janet.
B00008972S|5.0|There is no getting around the fact that this 1961 musical melodrama is a monumental work by theater masters at their peak - Leonard Bernstein's timeless music; Stephen Sondheim's clever, character-driven lyrics; and above all, Jerome Robbins' dazzling choreography, an unprecedented blend of ballet, jazz and modern moves that uniquely belong to this show. Fortunately, all of this is beautifully captured on the pristine 70-mm print and audio transfer found on the two-disc 2003 Special Edition DVD. What's more, the cinematic translation of the Broadway hit co-directed by Robbins and veteran Robert Wise shows a film that not only conveys the vibrancy of the original show but adds dramatic texture in the reshuffling of its renowned songs in order to better propel the familiar storyline.<br /><br />The home turf Jets and the recently arrived Puerto Rican Sharks are at war in the tenements of New York's Upper West Side in the late 1950's. The ethnically divided rival gangs are already at a boiling point when Tony meets Maria across a crowded floor at the community dance. The problem is that Tony is a founder of the Jets who quit to work as a stock boy at Doc's candy store, and Maria is the coddled little sister of Bernardo, the Sharks' leader. Needless to say, things don't go well for the teenaged lovers but not before the respective sides confront each other with the most athletic, macho-driven dance moves not seen since Gene Kelly's golden MGM period. Starting with the highly dramatic overhead shots of Manhattan, the prologue is justly celebrated as a stunning expression of Robbins' genius in formulating dance moves that fluently convey the gangs' swagger and menace.<br /><br />As the story settles on the core romance, the movie maintains its momentum and high energy through the memorable score, in particular, the three powerful ensemble pieces - \\"America\\", in which the Sharks boys and girls playfully but pointedly argue the merits of living in the U.S.; the \\"Quintet\\" with its dynamic cross-cutting showing the diverse shades of anticipation for the final rumble; and \\"Cool\\", in which the revenge-driven, post-rumble Jets plot to find Tony before the Sharks do. The slower tempo songs have long since become a part of the established American songbook. What holds the music and action together is the strongly individualistic visual style set forth by Daniel Fapp's color-saturated cinematography (the reds really pop) and Boris Leven's impressive production design (only the prologue was filmed on location). Even though Arthur Laurents' original book and Ernest Lehman's screenplay have retro-hip dialogue that now sounds quaint next to today's youth-oriented movies, the story still maintains a dramatic gravitas that has certainly worked since Shakespeare's day.<br /><br />Although obviously not a Latina, 22-year old Natalie Wood is still picture-perfect as Maria. Carrying most of the pathos of the love story, she completely nails the final tragic scene with tear-jerking aplomb. Less successful is the toothy Richard Beymer as Tony, looking too freshly scrubbed and acting too naïve to be credible as a former gang leader. Yet despite the obvious vocal dubbing, they play their duets with poignancy. Russ Tamblyn, already a longtime film veteran at that point, plays Tony's best friend Riff with gusto and shows off his amazing acrobatic dancing skills with fervor. George Chakiris, a far more polished dancer than Tamblyn, is a searing presence as Bernardo, though the best all-around performer is a fiery Rita Moreno as Bernardo's fast-assimilating girlfriend, Anita. Singing (with one notable exception), dancing and acting up a storm, she lends a scene-stealing energy too infrequently used in a film career that goes back to 1952's \\"Singin' in the Rain\\". The rest of the dancers perform in nova-like bursts with amazing precision and synchronization.<br /><br />The first disc of the 2003 DVD contains the movie itself and surprisingly comes with no commentary track. While this is an unfortunate omission, it is more than offset by the second disc's main attraction, an hour-long documentary called \\"West Side Memories\\", which is about as good a retrospective making-of feature as I have seen on a DVD. Almost all the surviving contributors to the film are interviewed albeit briefly in some cases - Wise and Lehman (both of whom died just last year), Sondheim, Laurents, Beymer, Tamblyn, Moreno (especially sprightly) and a couple of the Jets, Tony Mordente (Action) and Harvey Hohnecker (Mouthpiece). Interspersed throughout is not only footage from the movie but production stills and home movies recorded by one of the dancers, Robert Banas.<br /><br />There are nuggets galore in the documentary, for instance, remembrances of Robbins' choreographic brilliance, taxing perfectionism and insensitivity to the budget (which led to him being fired midway through filming); Wood's valiant but wavering singing voice (which was subsequently dubbed by the oft-used Marni Nixon); and the dubbing of Moreno's and Tamblyn's voices for key numbers. The other extras are not nearly as interesting - a five-minute montage showing storyboards translated into the actual shots; the original intermission music interlude; a couple hundred production stills in a clickable format; and four separate trailers. The biggest extra is actually a hefty scrapbook that includes the entire text of the screenplay and other related material essential to only the most die-hard of fans.nfortunate omission, it is more than offset by the second disc's main attraction, an hour-long documentary called \\"West Side Memories\\", which is about as good a retrospective making-of feature as I have seen on a DVD.

B000J103YI|5.0|Jennifer Hudson clearly stole the show.  When I saw the movie, people were cheering every time she came on the screen.  The girl is going places.  I loved her in this and I didn't even like her on American Idol.  Beyonce who??
B0002234LS|4.0|Great movie. While most would say that its great because of Depp, i disagree. It would have been good with another actor.  <br /> <br />Story is about a mystery writer (Mort) who is going through a divorce. One day he is confronted by \\"a man\\" who says that Mort stole one of his stories and created it as his own. The man's threats become violent, killing people of whom which Mort is looking to for support. The story leads you to believe that you know exactly what is happening, but gives a sudden twist toward the ending that changes the whole story. <br /> <br />It is a marvelous story, well explained at the end, and good acting. Highly recommend it if you like psychological movies.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|For all those complaining of the poor-quality non-anamorphic film transfer of this release, realize that LucasFilm dind't just turn the telecine machine to 'craptastic' and hit record for a sub-par transfer.  This is an older transfer from the 1993 Laserdisc masters.   <br /> <br />I too am unimpressed.  Lots of details are available at the OriginalTrilogy website.
0143034901|5.0|A brilliant story.  One of the best books I've read all year.  I couldn't put it down for the life of me and actually missed the characters at my final ready.  I highly recommend this book!
B00005JNS0|5.0|I went and saw this movie when it was in theatres, after seeing multiple commercials for it on tv. It looked like a cute movie, plus I'm a big NASCAR junkie. And no, I was not forced to take a younger sibling with me (im an only child ;)). I went on my own free will, and loved it! My favorite was Mayner the tow truck, he cracked me up. I would recommend this movie for anyone, no matter how old they are!
B000001EMW|2.0|So these guys have a gimmick; they play arrangement of Metallica songs for four cellos, as the title of the album makes clear. Well, that sounds like an interesting idea, and it is somewhat, but unfortunately the execution here is lacking. When you get past the novelty of hearing these songs like this, it's the little details that determine whether the recording will have any lasting value to make you want to listen again and again. Unfortunately in this case we have sloppy playing, including bad intonation (out of tune notes) in many places, and in a lot of places the transcriptions are just plain wrong. They also aren't particularly interesting arrrangements, really. Once you've heard one track you've pretty much heard the approach they take on every piece. <br /> <br />Overall, an interesting gimmick but doesn't hold up to repeated listenings.

After my angioplasty/drug eluding stent ordeal I got a second opinion (too late). The second Doctor prescribed this book.   I read it, believed it, and have lived it for 8 months.  I lost 30lbs.,  my stamina and physical performance has improved dramatically, and my cholesterol has dropped from 270 to 130 and I have gone off some of the drugs.  Now whenever someone I love develops symptoms of lifestyle disease, diabetes, obesity or heart disease I give them the book.  I thank you Dr. Campbell.

0060888695|5.0|Having seen the excellent film adaptation, I felt the need to fill one of the many holes in my literary knowledge and read this classic book. I had trouble finding the time, so I compromised and listened to the unabridged audiobook narrated by Sissy Spacek (published by Caedmon). Her accent is perfect and her reading is excellent. <br /> <br />The story is a marvelous coming-of-age tale: it has delicious, comfortable prose, delightful and funny vignettes of a young girl growing up in a Southern town in an age of change, and two powerful and engaging subplots. One deals with respect and kindness - that of Arthur Radley - and one deals with race relations and integrity (and at one point brought me to almost-tears). The character of Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, is a paragon of integrity just human enough to be real. The characters in this novel are wonderfully rich. If you haven't experienced To Kill a Mockingbird or if you'd like to experience a wonderful re-interpretation, I highly recommend this audiobook.
B000J10ERO|3.0|I loved watching this film in the IMAX. It took my breath away. When I saw it again at home, I realized that the story was lacking.<br /><br />That being said--Routh does a terrific job as Supes. Spacey is (of course) incredible and Bosworth is a wet washrag. (66% on casting, eh?)
079073639X|3.0|When a movie starts with almost five minutes of slow, dull, opening credits, you know that is not a good sign of things to come. While the original book by Michael Crichton is not the best science fiction that he has written, it is a story told by a competent author, however, the movie version is not nearly as competent as it has some plot holes an eighteen-wheel truck can roar through. But putting aside the plot, the directing and the acting by its stars, Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L. Jackson-- makes the movie fairly watchable. <br /> <br />Critics complain about the ending, though, and rightfully so. But the fault lies not with anybody associated with the movie, but with Michael  Crichton himself who seems to have written himself into a corner and didn't know how to get out of it in a better way. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it's sometthing of a disappointment. But right up til the end, the movie is enjoyable enough so for that reason I give it three stars .  <br /> <br />As an added feature we get, among other things, some less than thrilling look at the production designer's job, which can be forgotten about, but also Samuel L. Jackson's commentary on the film which is both really nteresting and enjoyable to hear. <br />

If I could give it 3.5 stars I would but I don't think its 4 star material.  10,000 Maniacs fans will like it but would be fans are better off getting some of their studio stuff.  That's my 2 cents.  Enjoy the music!!!
B000LC55F2|5.0|Great plot, acting, and filming.  This extremely well-made movie takes place in the late 19th / early 20th centuries and paints an excellent picture(as far as I can tell) of what Victorian Era theater magic was like.  Its complex structure requires that you pay pretty close attention, but if you do its plot is easy to follow.  My one complaint is that one of the tricks actually used magic (maybe \\"pseudo-science\\" is a better word), which is a complaint only because otherwise the movie would have been very realistic, and these kinds of mystery films are always better when they're plausible.  In any case, it allowed the plot to make sense, and it's not really a very big deal anyway, and i hope i didn't give too much away, which i don't think i did. <br /> <br />In short, this is by far the best \\"murder mystery\\" i've ever seen, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes movies that twist and turn about, make you think, AND still make sense in the end(that last one is rare).  I've rambled on enough here, so until next time, you stay classy _________(your city's name here)
0684135051|5.0|My mother had attempted unsuccessfully to teach me knitting when I was a young gal. When I really wanted to learn how to knit much later on, I taught myself from this book. This book contains the very basics of knitting from start to finish, and then branches out into various projects: a slew of different styles of sweaters, socks, mittens. The greatest thing about Zimmerman's books is her can-do spirit, making knitting less daunting and more approachable. She provides a fool-proof formula for knitting sweaters to fit anyone -all knit seamlessly on circular needles, simplifying the whole process. I have to mention here, that her method for certain styles of sweaters entail taking out the scissors and cutting into the knitted fabric that has just been labored ever so much over. This can be a very hard thing to do, but it works, believe it or not - and it works very well. (Just make sure you follow the directions before you cut and sew with sewing machine before cutting...) I personally do not enjoy this method, and have worked around this step (by turning around and knitting back). Regardless, her basic formula for shaping sweaters is flawless and most worthy to note. Anyone with basic knitting knowledge can take out a pair of circular needles and some yarn, and after careful measurements, start knitting a sweater.     Elizabeth states in her book that although there is no wrong way to knit, she advocates the \\"German,\\" or Continental way. One will primarily learn the Continental way of knitting in her books; she does say, however, that it is good to know both methods, especially with two-color knitting, with one color of yarn in one hand and the other yarn in the other hand.    I find myself reaching for this book again and again, when I have forgotten and need to know how to do some very basic, but vital, steps.
B00005JPAO|5.0|As someone who has been a \\"royalist\\" all my adult years, I was thrilled to see someone come out with the \\"Dianagate\\" saga from Her Majesty's point of view, and from what I can tell, it is spot on!

B000KKPN5C|5.0|What impressed me most when I opened package from amazon was size of the flash unit. Very small and light. I used to have regular size flash unit which was too bulky to carry around. This one I plan to carry around just in case if I need something more powerfull than build-in flash or bounce the light. In combination with wide apperture Nikon promised up to 20m usefull range. The head of the unit moves 90 degree so you can use bounced light to make portraits. Overall, I like the unit. Doesn't take space or weight. <br />Plus price is right.
B000J10ERO|2.0|I thought this sequel could've been a lot better then what it is, like many of today's sequels & remakes of classics, they put all there time and effort into the effects they can do now that they couldn't do back when the originals where made and after that they decided to try & write a script around it. <br /> <br />PLOT: Superman has left the planet and hasn't been seen for years since the last movie, apparently he left the planet because astrologers thought they had found his planet of Krypton, so he went to see for himself only to return to say it wasn't there to his Earth mother who they may as well have not included in the movie as she plays in scenes that aren't relevant to the story and she has nothing to do with anything in this movie.  <br /> <br />So Superman's back, he discovers Lois Lane had moved on with her life and settled down, gotten married and had a kid. Lex Luther managed to get out of his life sentence and has managed to steal the crystals of Superman's arctic home and use them for world domination. So Superman has to come back and save the day while feeling unloved.... boo-hoo. <br /> <br />I didn't enjoy the storyline to this one, I think they tried to show Superman's heartbreak over discovering Louis was married and had a kid, but quite frankly i never felt for him at all, nor did I feel one bit sad for him at the end of this movie with what happens or feel touched by his words to his so...mthing ... and I think they where trying to show that Superman excepted the husband, but man, that needed a huge re-write to tell it better along with so much else that you can pick up on and say \\"I get it\\" but I doubt anyone could say they felt it. <br /> <br />The whole thing doesn't have the feel of the 70's/80's versions that this is a sequel to. There is just way too many visual effects, too much sickening CGI that is not needed to tell a story, I couldn't adjust to the characters not even resembling the original actors, and I suppose they did some ground breaking CGI effects and showed things that wasn't possible in the other movies, but again, use them to a well written plot instead of making a movie around the CGI. <br /> <br />For the first half of the movie I was a bit confused not being able to work out what the hell was happening, I guess it all kind of made sense by the end, and speaking of the end, as I predicted, leave it as a set-up for a sequel.  <br /> <br />I didn't like the way the movie started, it was slow, confusing and boring, the middle kind of picked up a bit and became a little bit better, then the ending just had no satisfaction at all, an end to a superman movie should be climactic, not just be over and done with then fly around for 5 minutes. <br /> <br />And another thing about the CGI, what is with this greyish looking fog thing all over these days' movies? War Of The Worlds did the same thing, have producers and moviemakers in Hollyweed got something against using more then 5 colours these days? Why can't they add some bright colours? Why cant trees be green and oceans be blue? Why do they almost have to be grey and dark all the time with fake fog and mist all over the place? It might be a work of art to those developing it, but give us a break and try and do something that looks real and doesn't make you nauseous for crying out loud. <br />Bottom line is, this film was made simply by going to Warner and someone saying, \\"hey we can do more visually now then what we could back then with Superman, here is an hours worth of CGI, what do you say we cash in and make some money out of it? Don't worry about the plot or acting or a good script, you know the title alone will be gold\\"
B00005JPE7|2.0|Having never seen any of the Rocky movies before this film, I can rate this movie objectively. <br /> <br />Obviously, story is rare in extreme sport movies, boxing, football, and the like; let alone in third sequels -  this is to be expected.  Rocky Balboa doesn't even attempt to draw us in the story, and I'm glad for it.  Story or not; the movie has roughly five characters, your typical moral comeupance, and paints a good picture of a boxer's prime in the aftermath.  The first half an hour has Rocky walking around saying \\"hi\\" and signing autographs to random people, the second act has Rocky eyeing a cute girl and her son, and the last half has some of the cheesiest boxing sequences availabe via camera. <br /> <br />The movie is not an aim for success, but another in a big trilogy to bring us into Rocky's interesting world and I respect the film for it.  However, if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen Rocky Balboa in it's entirety.

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|In no way does this version compare to the A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  The actors, the inferior cinematography, the condensed story, and the lesser costume designs - all sorely disappointed me.  I'm sure those that have never seen the A&E version will find this a good movie, but I just don't see how anyone who is familiar with the Firth/Ehle film can be satisfied with this new version.  I have no desire to ever watch this film ever again.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Let's be real, folks. The theatrical version of Superman II is ridiculous in too many spots. Re-shaping Mt. Rushmore? The silly altercations with the \\"middle America\\" townsfolk (to say nothing of the sheriff)? Superman floating amongst tropical flowers? The man in the phone booth during the wind storm? You get the picture.<br /><br />The problem is that the movie was made in the seventies and finished by someone who obviously didn't know how to make a GREAT seventies movie. All the instances of baffoonery only diminish the effect that a Superman movie is supposed to have, and the decade's love affair with \\"disaster\\" movies is only too noticeable during the Metropolis showdown. (To be fair, act three of the first movie WAS basically a disaster movie.) It's amazing to me that critics like Roger Ebert and David Denby raved about the theatrical version, but it just goes to show that mentalities can change a LOT over the years.<br /><br />Richard Donner's cut salvages this movie to the point where it is finally, finally a worthy successor to Superman I. Almost every silly scene is gone - thank God! The added scenes with Brando obviously lend more gravity to the overall structure not only of this film but of the first two together (as Donner speaks of). The sequence of events with Lois trying to unmask Clark is much more entertaining, and even though one of the scenes has to be a cut-and-paste audition, it still works. It fits into the big plan and it's also endearing to see a fresh-faced Margot Kidder and what was Christopher Reeve's earliest interpretation of Clark Kent.<br /><br />Also, I'd like to say that with the restored scenes with Marlon Brando, I've never seen more acting out of Reeve. He is absolutely superb. What a terrible shame we are only now getting to see it.<br /><br />I know some people have a problem with a little recycled footage, but I'd rather sit through improbable time-shifting than the even more improbable memory-stealing kiss.<br /><br />The tone of a movie is crucial. The way Donner cuts back and forth between short scenes of Superman/Lois and Zod/Ursa/Non creates a flow that never lets us forget what is happening in either situation. Thus, the movie flows, it moves forward at a perfect pace. Contrast this with Lester's cut, which has overly long scenes especially of the villains, and creates a disjointed feel to the movie.<br /><br />The only letdown for me is the commentary. It's more Donner and Mankewiscz (sp?) shooting the breeze and reminiscing rather than speaking about how they crafted particular scenes. I want to hear how they feel about Lois looking bloody in the tomato cart - Zod walking on water - the removal of the Mt. Rushmore scene (and replacing it with something much more believable) - how Lex slipped and fell in the Fortress and they kept that in - Reeve's acting - I want to hear about their movie-making process! And instead I get anecdotes. It's unfortunate, but I'm sure some people out there will enjoy it.<br /><br />Richard Donner's cut of Superman II is far superior to Lester's cut and now stands on par with the first movie, in my mind. It makes sense for Superman Returns to follow a movie of this caliber. At last, my memory is salvaged.e of a movie is crucial.

B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead's \\"The Bends\\" is a remarkable achievement.  In the summer of 1993, the song \\"Creep\\" off of the album \\"Pablo Honey\\" was a mainstay of American radio and MTV.  I loved the song, but put off purchasing the album, fearing only the one hit track would have any substance.  It turned out that \\"Pablo Honey\\" was a good album, but was certainly not an indicator of what was to come. <br /> <br />Before \\"The Bends\\" was released in the spring of 1995, Radiohead released a collection of B-sides that came to be known as the \\"My Iron Lung-EP\\", this was where their ascent to \\"only band that matters\\" and \\"greatest band in the world\\" territory began.  Songs like \\"The Trickster\\" and \\"Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong\\" featured that dark, menacing soul and outstanding musicianship that would soon become the hallmark of future Radiohead albums. <br /> <br />By recording \\"The Bends\\", Radiohead captured a moment in time where they were creatively exploding through the stratosphere and into realms unknown (OK Computer).  They took the rock/alternative genre and remolded in a way no one else had.  This is an emotive album.  This is a complete album. This album is a masterpiece virtually without rival. <br /> <br />Every song is different.  Each is perfect.  I particularly love the way the album opens, with the sonic monsoon of Planet Telex, and closes eerily with Street Spirit (Fade Out), where the darkness is only broken by the final line of the album, instructing the listener to \\"immerse your soul in love\\"(Radiohead have seemingly always had a knack for writing killer opening and closing tracks).  There are moments of bombast, moments of reminisce, moments of longing and desperation and sedation, and fits and bursts of anger and outrage.  It covers the emotional spectrum. The album is never flat.  The album is always brilliant.  This is a landmark.  It is one of those rare moments of brilliance adrift in a wasteland of corporate musical garbage.   <br />

B00005JOLI|1.0|Just saw Eragon... and sincerely it proves that to make something \\"to sell\\" you dont need to make anything new. <br /> <br />Eragon is just a piece of trash made with elements from Dragonlance D&D world + Star Wars + Lord of the rings. <br /> <br />We start with the dragon, saphira, i would call \\"winged monkey\\". Man, there are TONS of AWESOME dragons styles around (especially Dragonlance D&D world), but what they do: a monkey with chicken wings (no scales, only fur). <br /> <br />Them we have master yoda/obi-wan Brom and luke skywalker Eragon.... \\"you not ready, you may not use the force\\"... ops... magic. Also uncle owen death. <br /> <br />Dont forget the Legolas in the bad specter fortress... <br /> <br />Beside... where are the elves, the dwarf or better, WHERE IS THE VALDAN (if it so written) Fortress?? <br /> <br />Waste of money, and i hope it wont turn down the hype of the upcomming dragonlance movie.

B000IZJZLM|3.0|My sister asked what I would like for Christmas and I requested a Il Divo CD from Amazon.Com.  It did not state in was not in english so I was very disappointed.  I too, have watched many TV shows with Il Divo singing and they always sang in English so now I wish I had asked for another CD.  One I can understand the words too.  They are great singers but I wanted a CD I could sing along with.  Amazon should state the language of their music. I also wanted their Christmas CDs but would I be able to understand them?  Maybe Simon Cowell should be notified.
0553573403|4.0|I don't want to rehash what many have already said. This is an excellent fantasy novel that is the first in a series of 7 projected books. It is loaded with suspense and intrigue. What I liked most was that there was no dark lord and some relic that the young farmboy had to go on a quest to find in order to destroy the dark lord. Which is basically every other fantasy novel. Tolkien ripoffs. This book avoids all cliches. My only complaints are it is 100 pages too long and what is with all the graphic descriptions of animals, mostly horses being killed. That kind of bothered me. Also as others have pointed out, the sex in this book at times borders only slightly on romance novel stuff. I'm not a prude and did not expect a sanitized story, but seriously\\"His manhood glistened wetly\\" that's an actual line from the book. I could have done without some of that. I would recommend A game of thrones to all readers, not just readers of fantasy as long as you're 17 or older. It is a trip to read. Awesome. can't wait to read A clash of Kings.
0393061310|1.0|In this case, Jared Diamond's only tool is a geography. That's his specialty. Therefore, he tries to argue that most things in the world can be explained with geography. If you understand geography, all else follows, so he implies.<br /><br />With over 2,000 reviews on this book, I'll be brief:<br /><br />PROS: The prose just flows. Diamond writes so well, so fluidly, it's just fun to read. The book is data rich. Most of the arguments are well researched and correct. Yes, geography was an important factor in determining the fate of the world and this book is great at showing the importance of geography.<br /><br />CONS: Diamond ignores the importance of economics, free trade, liberalizing thought and the economy, oppressive regimes, democracy, religion, DNA, inherited traits, and other important factors that are more important than geography. From 400 AD to 1,400 AD, the Europeans made relatively little technological progress. It wasn't until they unburdened themselves from a tight dogma (i.e., the Renaissance) and opened up their economies that their technology really exploded.<br /><br />Diamond's argument is truly weak when he argues that Eurasia has an east-west axis and Africa/America have a north-south axis. I've walked across America four times. It's taken me years to do that. Trust me, there is a large east-west axis on the American continent. There was plenty of trade between Native Americans on an east-west axis. Same goes for Africa, which is HUGE on an east-west girth. You can see it across the Sahel. Meanwhile, Eurasia has something called the Himalayas and the (not-so-tall) Ural mountains which impede its supposed east-west axis from working very well. There's a reason why it was easy for China to isolate itself for centuries from Europe. The Silk Road is one of the few easy ways to cross Eurasia, and even that isn't easy.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I've read all of Diamond's books and I love them all, except this one. It's disappointing that this one is his most acclaimed one. I like this book because it does explain why geography explains a lot. Many won't read it with a critical eye, but many Amazon reviewers help point out the flaws. I would highly recommend reading one of his other books, like &#34;The 3rd Chimpanzee&#34; or &#34;Collapse&#34;.is most acclaimed one.

B000000W5L|5.0|This is a great album (influenced by Gram Parsons who was practically a groupie at this point before he took off the create his two solo lps). However the complaints about the sound quality expressed elsewhere are apt. The limited edition LP cover CD is much better mastered; there's probably even better to be had if they ever remaster the tapes again - the bootlegged outtakes are all in great sound.  <br /> <br />The Stones were always oddly cavalier about technical matters - Bill Wyman expressed frustration that their mid 70s albums sounded like they were recorded on mono cassettes and he couldn't get his bass lines audible on them. Well, hunt the limited edition CD and you won't have that problem.
0345457684|5.0|As a lifelong sci-fi fan, I value originality more than anything, because there is so little of it! Everything has been done before, right?  <br /> <br />While there are some very 'classic' elements to Morgan's masterpiece they are dwarfed by his innovations. The cortical stack preserves the human mind, allowing 'resleeving' - discarding bodies like clothing. Morgan is gritty, creating a hard and believable world of urban sprawl, with the rich being immortal and the poor struggling to pay the 'rent' on their bodies. Justice is nowhere and vengenace is Kovac's trade. His protaganist is a terrific creation, a dark hero who both impresses and inspires sympathy. Morgan creates a seamless world, exploring the societal ramifications of the cortical stack - including posing the mystery of does it contain the soul? He builds an impressive universe and character backstory without losing track of his main plot, which is action packed.  <br /> <br />The sequel, Broken Angels, is even better.
1580493939|5.0|After reading some of the contemporary reviews of this book, I was more than a little curious to see how awful this book really was. I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant. Wilde weaves a story like few authors could ever dream of doing, and of course his wit is played out beautifully in this book as well. full of quips and quirks, this book is a must read for anybody who has a love of sharp, intelligent writing.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I was very sceptical when I heard they were remaking Dr Who. I had two main concerns; the BBC's trademark cheap special effects that make some of the older episodes almost comic, and the impossibility of this leather suited northener and ex-Britney Spears wannabee pulling off the Doctor and his companion.  <br /> <br />The BBC came through spectacularly on both counts. The Special Effects are as good as anything I've seen (and way better than in most US SciFi channel shows). Classic villains like the Dalek's were redone in a way that both moderrnised them and yet preserved the classic elements that made this show great.  <br /> <br />Most spectacular of all is the performance of Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, which is just brilliant. Billi Piper does a good job too. <br /> <br />Some of the newer bad guys are disppointing, especially (I thought) the Slitheen. However, I am still very happy I purchased this - and it might just be better than the original.

B000IU3XU6|3.0|To quote the currently most infamous television music critic Simon Cowell, \\"What's the problem here?\\"  The problem is that Josh Groban is highly overrated as a singer.  He has a pleasant enough voice and at times, his big rich sound captivates.  Unfortunately, he delivers many of his lower notes in an almost gravelly fashion.  The way he strains on the high notes really scares me.  I'm afraid he'll lose his voice if he doesn't learn to support his sound.  I believe he studies with a coach who believes in natural singing -- singing like you talk.  I think it's time for Josh to find a coach who will teach him how to use his body in order to facilitate his singing. <br /> <br />The good news -- I love the variety on this CD.  I admire Josh for insisting on putting \\"Machine\\" on the CD -- a radical, but successful departure for him.  My personal favorites on the CD are \\"Weeping\\" and \\"Lullaby.\\"  His voice blends beautifully with Ladysmith Mambazo on these songs. <br /> <br />I do think the producers made a huge mistake by not including the title song on the regular release.  I think it would be a huge hit and also satisfy the fans who enjoy Josh's more lyrical outings. <br /> <br />Although I am somewhat dissatisfied with Josh's voice on this CD, I still enjoy listening to it often.  If you are already a fan, you will probably love it.

B000ION79Y|1.0|I thought Seagal hit an all-time low with Submerged. Oh, how wrong I was. I keep hoping that he will make a good one and keep laying out the cash for the rentals. What a mistake. When I heard the voice emanating from the screen in the first five minutes, I had to do a double-take. It wasn't even in a close proximity to seagal's voice. I actually stopped the video and checked the dubbing to make sure it wasn't being dubbed over in English from another language. It was more like a very bad old Japanese film as the voice and lip sync was totally off. Plot?  What plot? Nothing went together. Nothing made sense. Seagal's cute blonde companion made it from location-to-location in the blink of an eye, and she was on everyone's side. What was THAT all about? Special effects? Probably the best was making seagal look less bloated and slow in several scenes than he really is. I think I've learned my lesson - finally. I'm done with the Seagal movies. He's hit the bottom and I refuse to be dragged down with him any more. <br />  <br />I give it a huge P-yew! <br />  <br />
B000GCFO0I|2.0|Okay so some adopted girl sleep walks and says Silent Hill so the mother finds Silent Hill and decides to take her daughter there without the husband knowing about it. On her way there she gets pulled over but then for some odd reason she starts to speed away to Silent Hill with the cop chasing her. Once she gets there her daughter is missing so she teams up with the cop to try to find her. While there they run into monsters and a crazy cult of people who live in a church that keeps out the monsters. While all that is going on the husband tries to find his wife and daughter and he tries to uncover the mystery of Silent Hill. <br /> <br />The good things about this film are that it has some good atmospheric moments through the film and the effects are also pretty cool to say the least. However I found there to be too may problems with this film like it goes on way too long. A film like this should only be 80 minutes long but this is 2 hours long, so it just drags out in some parts. I felt that like I had to force myself to watch it, which isn't something you should be doing with a horror film. Also the ending is kindda weird, I get it but I don't understand why it happens the way it does. It got out of control with the killings and effects towards the end when the girl gets her revenge on the cult. <br /> <br /> <br />This movie does have some good parts to it but they don't make up for the rest of the movie so I would suggest that you see this movie without buying it if you feel the need to see this movie so bad. That way afterwards you won't feel cheated out of your hard earned money.

There is also a cop who's trying to find V and is trying to find out if his government is corrupt. <br /> <br />Through the movie there are some references to America's war on terror and the kind of horrible consiquences it brought onto the world which I thought was a nice touch because it could be like that in the future but we won't know for a while. My only problem with the anti Bush type themes is that they do it way to much and over and over again which got very repetitive and it seemed forced and they wanted to bring it up as much as possible. The few action scenes that they do have are good but there aren't too many of them. Also what's up with V's hair seriously. <br /> <br />Anyways due to the lack of action scenes and all the way too much anti totalitarian goverment talk makes this just an okay movie which should at least be seen once or twice but beyond that it's not really a movie you'd watch over and over again.
630469654X|5.0|I saw LakyHawke when it first came to the Theaters...and loved every<br /><br />minute of it. A lot of men might not fully appreciate this movie, this<br /><br />one does. It's not perfect...you do have to adjust the sound at times.<br /><br />But when you look at the story, beautiful cinematography, I think the<br /><br />music is wonderful, the actors/cast are great and well, you have to get<br /><br />past the fact that Mathew Broderick was Ferris Beuler...but he has some<br /><br />of the very best lines in the moview. I think when you consider this was<br /><br />a very early period of Mathew's career, it was oustanding in this role.<br /><br />When the movie became available to the public, it was on VHS and I had<br /><br />to have a copy...it was $75.00. Easily the most I've ever spent on a<br /><br />movie. The script is so well written and very moving. I have watched<br /><br />this movie easily 15 times and it never gets old. Few movies have such<br /><br />a positive effect on me. If you are a romantic person, this is a must<br /><br />see. And guys, if you use the term \\"chick\\" flick, maybe you should skip<br /><br />this one. But I think it's worth seeing...to see two people this much<br /><br />in love...well, it makes me want what they have. This movie may not<br /><br />have won any academy awards...but I would rather watch THIS movie than<br /><br />some of the movies that DID win academy awards. Like I said, it's not<br /><br />perfect, but I don't watch movies and look for flaws...if you haven't<br /><br />seen this movie yet, you will be very surprised at how really good it is.
B000GY729M|3.0|The Killers first album, Hot Fuss, was a wonder.  Every single song had a unique stile to it wile keeping within a theme.  I reseved it as a gift sevral years ago and it very quickly became one of my favrit CDs.  So needless to say I had huge expectations of Sam's town.  The first time I listend to it I didn't know what to think.  It had lost the sharpness of Hot Fuss, instead having a softer more flowing feel.  It had acward backup vocals and peices remenicent of the worst aspects of Queen and Bruce Sprigstien.  The lyrics were less direct and less varied.  On a second listening I felt different.  The falts remained but I saw more in it.  Though the other side of the coin from Hot Fuss, it did have a stile of its own.  Its more subtle, more clean. The Killers paint a picture of a man in a run down bar telling his woes to the bar tender, or anyone who would listen.  Some of the feel from Hot Fuss comes back in When You Were Young and there is also a refreshing sharpness in Uncle Jonny.  And inbetween were soft, lyrical songs.  It was almost as if it was a different band from Hot Fuss, but its a band I would listen too.
B00005JOCU|4.0|Truth is stranger than fiction.  Or at least it's very familiar in 'Dream Girls, a triumphant survey of modern black music interspersed with behind the scenes drama of backbiting, drugs, egos, and deception.  The thinly veiled look at Motown (Rainbow Records) and the debacle between key members of Diana Ross and The Supremes almost makes this whole musical historical fiction--or, I should say, non-fiction.     It all starts, of course, with earnest talent like a James Brown-like performer (Eddie Murphy) who wows audiences and a girl group who tries to break through the fixed Detroit talent contest.  (They groom a B.B. King-like performer to win.)  Once they lose, they must depend on managers to see them through (Curtis, a very Berry Gordy-like figure played by Jamie Foxx, and an older entreprenuer (Danny Glover) who depends on his old-hand skills for catapulting stars.)  They all seek the top, but only Curtis sees what's necessary to get a black act there.  For all their talent, their records are stolen and sanitized by white singers (more than a little reminiscent of Pat Boone) and brought to the top of the charts.  Using gambling and mob money, Curtis bribes the D.J.'s to play his own music.  More galling is his maneuvering to unseat Effie White (played with spunk by Jennifer Hudson), the talented but overweight lead singer, to the backdrop and put Deana Jones (Beyonce') to the head of the group.  Even though her own mother is even perplexed by the venue change, Curtis, to his conniving credit has, cynically, the winning formula.  Everyone is at his mercy until they all either become washed up or leave his productive but overly possessive nest.  (And how many parallels can be made when Deanna and Effie  are nearly dead ringers for Diana Ross and Mary Wells?)  If that doesn't convince you that this musical movie is hardly fiction, then the near replicas for The Jackson Five surely will.    'Dream Girls' is a glorious display of modern black music since the advent of the girl group in the early sixties.   It also intersperses well events like the riots and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's presence.  But one objection remains:  The backstage bickering is necessary, but also burdening.   When they expose the politics of alliances and talented people burned, they do it well.  That is until they sing about it; then it becomes awkward and maudlin.  Numbers like \\"When I Saw You\\" and \\"We Are the Family\\" seem sappy next to the splendor of the numbers they perform on stage.  See 'Dream Girls' by all means, but realize that it has limitations.  It is sometimes overly sentimental and embarrassing when they sing about their troubles--not as well integrated as, say, 'Chicago' in this regard.  Despite its flaws, 'Dream Girls' has a likable ensemble, a good story, and, most of all, glorious music.
B000GDH9J6|5.0|Mountain Patrol: Kekexili is a truly powerful film that draws the most poignant of contrasts between the beauty of nature and the brutality of men.  The film plays on many levels, as this story of a group of brave volunteers fighting to drive out the poachers from their land ultimately turns into nothing less than a spiritual journey for one character and most definitely for the viewer, as well.  This is much more than just a good story, however, as it was inspired by actual events.  With poachers decimating the herds of Tibetan antelope in Kekexili, a volunteer patrol was formed in the 1990s by locals to patrol the area and stop the poaching, even at the risk of their own lives.  We're talking about a huge area of mostly barren land in the unforgiving mountains (over three miles above sea level) of Tibet, one of the coldest places on earth.  Some of these men gave their lives to the struggle, but they did ultimately succeed in bringing international attention to the problem and the establishment of Kekexili as a natural animal reserve by China, and the number of Tibetan antelopes has now begun to rebound strongly.<br /><br />We initially see events play out through the eyes of a reporter from Beijing, sent to write a story on the Border Guard's struggles against the poachers.  Ga Yu arrives during the funeral for a guard who had been murdered.  Westerners may be perplexed by what they see here, as the funerary tradition of this land is, to put it far too simply, to feed the dead body to vultures.  Soon thereafter, Ga Yu joins Ri Tai and his men on patrol into the mountains.  As he gradually bonds with these men, who have left family and friends behind to take part in this dangerous journey, the story evolves into Ri Tai's story.  Ri Tai will risk everything, including his very life, to stop the poachers from polluting his land.  The viewer gets a visceral look at the destruction the poachers leave in their wake, as the men come upon a snow-white field completely covered with the carcasses of dead antelopes.  When they spread out hundreds of seized pelts, the effect is similarly powerful, particularly as it shows how the animals were basically mowed down with large caliber weapons.  After finding and arresting a group of skinners, Ri Tai knows he is on the trail of the men behind all the killing, and he won't stop until he finds them.  The journey could not be more dangerous: extreme, dangerous weather conditions, a dwindling supply of food and supplies, and the threat of ambush attacks by the men Ri Tai seeks.  The Border Guard numbers dwindle down to almost nothing by the ending, setting up the viewer for a most memorable and in some ways shocking conclusion.<br /><br />Director Chuan Lu has made a masterful film, overcoming innumerable challenges along the way.  The beauty of the environment, the camaraderie of the Border Guard volunteers, and Ri Tai's unflagging determination are all presented exceptionally well, while the cast of predominantly non-actors is really superb.  You can't help but be inspired by the unbounded determination of these local men, volunteers all, to take a stand and make a huge difference in the land they call home.covered with the carcasses of dead antelopes.

B00005JPDJ|4.0|Excited as I was to see `The Holiday' I was very skeptical.  I had heard some horrible things about this movie from some of the critics, and while I generally avoid anything the critics have to say, when the critics say something bad about Kate Winslet (an actress who NEVER gets a bad review) then I get a little scared.  As the credits began to roll though I realized that critics are seldom ever right and if it stars Kate Winslet it can't be bad...I mean really, when has she ever gone awry? <br /> <br />`The Holiday' ends up unfolding as a double feature, and for the most part it's split right down the middle, the first half dealing heavily between Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Graham (Jude Law) and the second half dealing more with Iris (Kate Winslet) and Miles (Jack Black) and this works well beings that for the first half Kate comes off somewhat dull and Jack is all but nonexistent, and right about the time of the movie that you start losing interest in Cameron, Kate steps up her game and Jack appears in almost every frame...it really does work well. <br /> <br />So the story follows Iris and Amanda as they, sick and tired of their lives at the moment, decide to trade homes, cars and lives for the Christmas holiday in an attempt to escape the stress and find themselves.  Iris has been pining for her co-worker and ex-boyfriend Jasper (Rufus Sewell) for three long years only to have him get engaged to another co-worker without having the decency to let Iris know.  Amanda has become all but detached from her cheating boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) and has lost herself in her work.  Both Iris and Amanda realize they really, truly NEED a vacation.  <br /> <br />So, after meeting online Iris heads to LA and Amanda to London and it's there that their lives are soon forever changed.  Like I said, the first half of this movie BELONGS to Cameron and Jude, especially Jude who in actuality owned this whole movie proving that he is such a talented actor.  Kate and Jack quickly become background characters as Amanda and Graham (Iris's brother) begin their passionate affair.  Right about the time that they encounter the same trouble most couple endure Iris and Miles begin to get closer and closer and take over the film, becoming the focus of the second act sort-of-speak. <br /> <br />Nancy Meyers, who also wrote and directed `Something's Gotta Give', proves that she is capable of making a sweet comedy that grabs you and makes you smile.  Cameron is delightful here, and her redition of the crying fits that made Diane's character so wonderful in `Something's Gotta Give' is priceless.  Kate, shines bright in the second half, and her meandering in the beginning of the film I blame solely on the script that kept her strapped until she was needed.  Jude Law is utterly fantastic, and as I mentioned, the best performance here and Jack Black is funny and witty, and while he may have been a bit miscast he wasn't as dreadful as he could have been.  Let's just say that by the time he's on the screen Kate has picked up so much slack he could have drooled in a corner and he would have been fine. <br /> <br />So, `The Holiday' may be just what you need this holiday, something sweet, funny and smart...something you'll remember as a delightful experience and one I'm sure you'll revisit.  I will say that there is one scene in particular that almost made me cry, the scene where Iris, after befriending screenwriter Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach), is in the company of an Oscar...I mean how cruel to have one of our greatest actresses (in my humble opinion Kate is our finest working actress today) in the presence of an Oscar when she herself has been SNUBBED four times (I still can't believe she's been nominated for four brilliant performances and hasn't won one of them)...I mean, I was almost in tears it was so depressing!
B000E3DE0Q|5.0|The original and - after 30-plus years - still the best of the astronaut auto-biographies (and bios).  Put simply, it is the benchmark against which all subsequent astro bios are measured.  Only Cunningham's \\"All American Boys\\" and in the last year Mullane's \\"Riding Rockets\\" come close, but \\"Carrying the Fire\\" is still by far the best book. <br /> <br />I have either read or hold copies of all the astro biographies, and \\"Carrying the Fire\\" is my favourite.  Written in Collins' modest, self-deprecating style, the book is an excellent account of the human emotions - as well as the technical detail - of two extraordinary spaceflights.  Collins was clearly a gifted person - as Walter Cunningham would later write in \\"The All American Boys\\", Collins was clearly a more capable test pilot than he gave himself credit for in his own book, but he also had a touch of poet in him.  He tells the story of waiting to board Apollo 11 on the morning of 16 July 1969, and closing one eye to see only the launch tower and spacecraft and then closing the other eye to see nothing but the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida beaches - \\"the Florida that Ponce de Leon would have seen\\" centuries before.  A very thoughful juxtaposition from a man no doubt nervously waiting to board a spacecraft on man's first moon landing attempt. <br /> <br />He also writes candidly of his emotional roller coaster journey leading up to Apollo 11 - especially the disappointment and uncertainty surrounding spinal surgery in 1968 which cost him a seat on the first mission around the Moon (Apollo 8) but which resulted in a seat on the first landing mission.  He wrote of the irony of his journey along the highway to the San Antonio, Texas hospital, which if followed on to California ended at the plant where \\"iron men\\" asembled the Apollo spacecraft, but which in his case stopped short, where he ended up in major surgery, possibly which his Air Force and NASA careers at an end. <br /> <br />I have never met Collins, but through his book I am sure I would have liked him, not only as a boyhood hero of mine but also as an honest story-teller, and one who has a fabulously clear and captivating writing style. <br />I must have read this book 20 times, and every time I find something different. It is a refreshing book of one man's amazing journey and the almost accidental role he considers he played in history. <br /> <br />This book comes recommended in a way that no other book about the US space program does.  I have given it 5 stars, but it deserves 6, 7 or 8. <br /> <br />An essential book for anyone - everyone - interested in the astronauts.
B00005JMX6|4.0|Okay, so it's not brilliant by any means, and while the plot is a different turn than most new sex-comedies, it's still not all that new, if you know what I mean BUT and this is a big BUT, `The Girl Next Door' was so much fun it didn't matter.  First off Elisha Cuthbert is not only beautiful as Danielle, the adult film star who wants to leave the business behind, she's also very convincing acting-wise, delivering a stand out performance here.  Emile Hirsch also does well, living up to his breakout role in `The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys' and proving that even the sex-comedy trap that all to often destroys careers won't hurt him any.  The story, about a young girl who happens to have a dirty little secret who falls in love with the nerd who sees her for who she is and not what he can get from her is a sweet one at that and while it's been done before it's done well here.  Timothy Olyphant steals the show here as Danielle's producer Kelly and Paul Dano is as dorky as ever, and it works wonders!
B000JJRIN4|2.0|I was very excited about getting this CD.  I wanted to like it so bad but it just does not sound good to me.   I listened to it again and again hoping that the third, fourth, maybe fifth time would be the charm.  A couple of the songs have good beats but bad lyrics and vice versa.  I gave 2 stars in instead of 1 because I do respect that she at least tried something different in trying to keep up with the ever changing trend in music, it just didn't work.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|\\"Trying to control isn't the answer. When we find the true `God Experience', the fight over whose religion is best--it fades. There's just one truth.\\" - From the movie<br /><br />A New York Times best-selling book published in 1993, The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield has sold 14 million copies and has been translated in over 45 languages. Written in novel form, The Celestine Prophecy describes the synchronistic adventures of John Woodson as he travels to Peru to find out more about an ancient prophecy that describes modern life in startling detail--as well as the future evolutionary path of humanity. While there, he meets up with Father Jose, guardian of the scrolls, as well as others who are dedicated to disseminating the transformative nine Insights found in the Celestine Prophecy.<br /><br />Redfield had wanted to make a movie version of The Celestine Prophecy, but despite offers from several big studios, the timing didn't feel right. In the spirit of the book, which advocates following intuition and gut hunches towards a more aware, purposeful life, Redfield waited--and now the time has come for the film to be birthed into the world.<br /><br />After seeing the Indigo movie debacle and the mediocre acting in What the Bleep Do We Know!?, I admit that I didn't hold much hope for the movie version of The Celestine Prophecy. However, after watching the film and its special features last night, I was surprised and delighted at the results.<br /><br />The Celestine Prophecy was one of the first \\"New Age\\" books I read while in the process of coming out of organized religion as both an adherent and a minister. It's been years since I read it, but I remembered that the prose was a bit clunky and didactic, but the information on synchronicity, auras, and control dramas were spiritual gold. I was especially impressed with the types of relationship control dramas humans use to \\"steal\\" energy until they learn to tap into their own internal reservoir.<br /><br />Because the novel was heavily instructional (as I recall), I figured that the movie would be more \\"telling\\" than \\"showing\\"--one of the biggest mistakes a writer can make. Yet, Redfield's screenplay was utterly elegant--translating the nine Insights into a compelling demonstration that both the characters and audience experience for themselves. For example, instead of explaining the types of control dramas, one scene shows John trying to coerce Marjorie into getting together with him. Through seamless special effects, we see his red aura extending and then encroaching upon Marjorie's shrinking blue aura. John is new to the world of energy, and through interactions with Father Sanchez, Wil, Julia and the other characters, he learns what it means to generate energy for himself through openness and awareness.<br /><br />Another example of \\"showing\\" instead of telling occurs when the characters vibrate to such a level that they become invisible. Rather than explain to the viewers about vibration (in fact, I don't even think the word \\"vibration\\" is used in the movie!), we are shown how focused intent and awareness made them invisible to the violent Peruvian rebels and corrupt law enforcement agents.<br /><br />The beautiful musical score supported gorgeous cinematography and first-rate acting. Next to the screenplay, perhaps this was the most surprising of all: the convincing performances by a fine set of actors. Annabeth Gish, resembling a young Sigourney Weaver, looked so familiar to me--and then my husband pointed out that we had just seen her in the holiday TV movie Candles on Bay Street. The actors who played Father Sanchez, Wil, and Jensen were especially compelling, and while watching the performance of Sarah Wayne Callies, I had the thought \\"Boy, she would have been a much better Lois Lane than Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps one reason these actors were so amazing was because Redfield wanted, specifically, actors that were on a spiritual path thatwould \\"get\\" the gist of The Celestine Prophecy movie. (Needless to say, Hollywood would have royally botched this movie.) One by one, the players came to HIM, as we find out in the special features. Especially intriguing was how actor Thomas Kretschmann, who plays Wil, relied on intuition and hunches to escape East Germany as a youth. He felt to talk to someone on the street and this person happened to be a central cog in the underground railroad that smuggled individuals across the Iron Curtain into the West. Because Kretschmann \\"lives\\" by following intuition, his character was even more believable. In fact, in less deft hands, Wil could have come across as superior and preachy--but this fine actor portrays his character as humble, wise, and laissez faire.<br /><br />On a personal note, I had three synchronistic events happen to me concerning The Celestine Prophecy movie:<br /><br />1. A few days ago, I received in the mail The Intention Experiment by Lynne McTaggart. Unaware of the book, I hadn't even requested a copy from the publisher. Yet, somehow, someone in the publicity department of a major publisher had my name and address--and sent me the book. I'm four chapters into this book and it's extraordinary: if you're scientifically minded and want \\"proof\\" for the Insights that Redfield writes about--especially the reality of energy, light, and consciousness in living organisms--you MUST get this book.<br /><br />2. While watching the special features of this film, Redfield mentions that Barnet Baine produced the movie What Dreams May Come. I received only one DVD for Christmas (from my husband), and guess what it was?<br /><br />3. Last night, I was taking a bath and was debating on watching The Celestine Prophecy (I had the film for a week, but couldn't bring myself to watch it just yet). I opened up my copy of New Age Retailer that I received in the mail that day, and guess what I turned to? A full-page ad for The Celestine Prophecy movie!<br /><br />Several of the inspiring truths found in this movie include:<br /><br />* Follow hunches!<br />* Instead of taking energy, give it.<br />* We are helped--we are not alone.<br />* Wonderment can be restored--and curious, fearless living opens unexpected doors.<br />* Powerful change is coming in the world--and the shift has already begun.<br />* \\"The guidance within evolves the world towards a heaven that is already here.

B0009MAP90|5.0|It's hard not to listen to early Dylan with total awe.  This is just a great set, and I'm one of those people who still wonders if someone should have gone up to him and said, \\"Bobby, you cannot put the Martin aside for a Stratocaster.  The sound is just not as good.\\"<br /><br />Great album.  Lots of other good ones by Bobby out there, too, but this is a sure bet.  Live the eternity before Newport.
B0007LXPBI|3.0|This film improves on the original in some ways, subject to reservations which I'll keep to the end.<br /><br />In the original, one of the girls' hometowns (Boston) was univerally slated ('Boston is no place to rekindle romance'), which is why the reuniting had to take place in Texas. Here, London is not slated in the same way. London is shown as cool, the Abbey Road scene is a treat! The actors all play their parts well, especially the supporting cast (the two domestics are great). The nods to the original - one of the twins humming 'Let's Stay Together' - are also well done.<br /><br />However, the treatment of Meredith at the end is nothing short of brutal, and even socially irresponsible. When the original was made, divorce was seen as bad; a married couple seen as married forever, and so any 3rd party was seen as an interloper who deserved everything they got. In the 1990s, the makers of the film should have realised that many kids will go to the film with mum or dad PLUS A STEP-PARENT!!! Mrs Doubtfire had a much more responsible take on the realities of divorce than this. Following from this, am not sure parents in the 1980s would split up twins so thet they'd never hear of each other, or of the other parent. That would be downright nasty.
B000002I25|5.0|How could one band have created such a masterpiece?  Great vocals, great keyboards, good guitar and drums and the song cycle just works.  Even when the lyrics get silly, Morrison still sells them.  Next time I'm in Paris, I must bring my Ipod and go back to Pere Lachase and listen to this with Jim.  Great job--maybe not worth Morrison's dissapated life but then again it just sounds great.  If only you could be like Kiki and Herb and come back to life.

B000J4QWMC|4.0|Michael Mann's much criticized re-imagining of the hit 80's cop drama Miami Vice features much of what makes Mann a master of the crime drama, and though it is far from perfect, it is nevertheless exciting and exhilirating.  Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell are Tubbs and Crockett respectively, who go on a very dangerous undercover mission to bring down a drug czar and his vast empire.  This is easier said than done, and things don't go as planned as Rico's fellow cop/lover (Naomie Harris) is targeted, and Sonny falls for the business brain (Gong Li) on the opposite side of the law.  As you've no doubt heard by now, Miami Vice the film resembles nothing of the series it is spawned from, and that is quite a good thing here.  Mann orchestrates a cool yet chaotic atmosphere with the escalating tension that anything can happen at any time, something that he's always excelled at doing with classics like Manhunter and Heat, and even his last film Collateral.  The only real downpoints of the film are some of the actors themselves, including Foxx and Farrell who never seem to click together as the rough and rugged partners.  Other cast members, including Ciaran Hinds (HBO's Rome) and Justin Theroux (Mulholland Drive), are pretty much wasted in their limited screen time, but foreign superstar Gong Li is quite good, and her chemistry with Farrell is as well.  There are also bits of goofy logic here and there (I don't think if someone suffered burns do a good percentage of their body, namely their back, and went into a coma that they would be laying on their back in the hospital bed, but that's just me), but this is forgiveable in most cases (except that one).  All in all, Miami Vice isn't the best work from Mann, but you can do far, far worse.
1400079276|5.0|I've read a number of Murakami's work and I must say this is his best outing to date (over-shadowing the wonderful and expansive \\"Wind-up Bird Chronicle\\"). What amazes me most about his writing is the clarity with which Murakami brings some of the most bizarre and off-putting stories out there. \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" is the perfect example of a writer who continues to push and to improve his writing and the final product is some of the best fiction I have read in a long time. <br /> <br />This novel is filled both with the bizarre and the familiar. The novel alternates between the story of a young boy who runs away from home and an old gentleman who can't read but can talk to cats. The connection between the two seems constantly about to be revealed and it is this drive to find out what links te two of them that made me race through this book in less than two days (what else am I going to do on my break but read great fiction?).  <br /> <br />The novel resonates with much of what Murakami has written in the past - weird connections and happenings that within the context of the story seem both strange and common even to the characters that experience these things. Leeches falling from the sky, ghosts, and gateways into different worlds are met with a shrug of the shoulder as if this is something to be expected. I want to go so far as saying this is a new form of magical realism, but it works differently from what we see in Marquez and some of the other popular South American writers. The things that happen in Murakami's novels are more central to the text and are in fact represenative of turning points in the novels rather than details that flesh out or make a character more interesting as I've seen it used in the past. It borders on fantasy, but fantasy grounded in today's reality with references to the Beatles and Led Zepplin as common as a guy who cuts off the heads of cats to construct a magical flute. <br /> <br />I love this book and I think Murakami is the beststoryteller out there today (even better than McEwan, Zadie Smith, and Didion).
0465011047|5.0|My reading of human-rights literature is a little slender, but THE AQUARIUMS OF PYONGYANG ranks as one of the best I've thus far discovered.<br /><br />The symbolism of the title is one of the only real literary devices on display here (and it is both apt and effectively used); otherwise this very straightforward account of a family and a childhood turned inside out by the absolute moral corruption of the North Korean regime is a dry, devastating and informative read.  Kang's writing successfully balances between the matter-of-fact and a conversational informality that manages do almost accomplish the impossible:  to have not experienced the politics and controls of North Korea, I don't think any of us could truly see the world through his eyes, but he does manage to get close enough to make this a scary piece of literature, and an enraging one for anyone who cares about the state of human rights, which would hopefully be all of us.<br /><br />Throughout, I was reminded specifically of the late Dr. Haing Ngor's A CAMBODIAN ODYSSEY.  Dr. Ngor survived the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge years in Cambodia, only to subsequently gain fame in the west through the film \\"The Killing Fields;\\" a powerful film greatly overshadowed by the grim detail of his own autobiographical account.  THE AQUARIUMS OF PYONGYANG is very similar - both in the undeniability of Ngor and Kang's repective insistence upon levels of human dignity that most of us take for granted, and in the parallels between the two nations.  The current state of affairs in North Korea inspires very little hope; this updated edition of this book provides a link to the website of the NGO organized by Kang, and this resource is valuable - this must-read book is only the beginning, in many ways.<br /><br />I will state that I am a cynic and a skeptic about just about everything that I read and hear; and I came away from this book firmly convinced that it's author is one of today's more heroic figures, and that this book is absolutely essential.<br /><br />-David Alstons book is absolutely essential. <br /> <br />-David Alston
B000065KBZ|5.0|It is so interesting how this film became a Christmas classic. Its dark side reveals just how wonderful life can be. James Stewart is terrific and gives one of his best performances. You can feel a genuine stress in him, as he sees no way out of his dilemma, which is at the center of this film. It is great performance. The film is greatly enhanced by it. Dimitri Tiomkins score though truncated and barely audible at times is one of his best. The DVD is wonderful.
B00004W221|5.0|I'm not even a huge football fan and 'Rudy' is one of the most inspirational films that I've ever seen. If you've ever had a dream that you wanted more than anything, but were told by almost everyone that you just didn't have what it takes to realize that dream, then 'Rudy' is for you. It is the true story of someone who ignored everyone who told him what he couldn't do, and set out to realize his dream through sheer heart and determination. It is a story about so much more than football. I've watched 'Rudy' probably half a dozen times and it brings me to tears every time. Tears of joy, that is, because it reminds me that yes, dreams do come true after all.

B00005JKMQ|4.0|The movie was good, but there were no special features on the DVD, and that disappointed me.  Will Smith's performance was good, but not as good as Jamie Foxx's.  The script didn't seem to let you 'inside' the feelings of Ali, except for his tears when Malcomn X was assassinated.  This film made Bundini (Jamie Foxx) more real than Ali (Will Smith).  But all in all, very worthwhile watching.
B00005S6K8|5.0|This story was beautifully weaved by a group of amazing actors, and deserves each of the five stars. I think Julia Ormond portrays Sabrina in a way that we can all familiarize and side with her. Harrison Ford shows Linus as the \\"worlds only living heart donor\\" but Sabrina helps him realize that love and time off work is a good thing. Greg Kinnear offers the comedic relief as David, the fun-loving playboy that Sabrina is in love with. The romance is believable, and the whole movie has a poetic but realistic feel. I love the tie ins of \\"Sabrina Fair\\" and the \\"America is my country and Paris is my home town.\\" A beautiful movie with a beautiful romance that, in my opinion, is so muc better than the original.

B000IMUYJM|5.0|It's certainly up there. While films like \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre, \\"Halloween\\" and \\"the Exorcist\\" will always be the juggarnauts that the are...this film has it too. The funny thing  is...this film was made almost around the exact same time as two of those, it just happens to be less known. This isn't a bunch of cheese people... it works. While nearly all slasher films share identical plots and boring character traits, \\"Black Christmas\\" seems to have its own sugar-cookie covered recipe. The basic premise of having some sorority girls being killed by a man(who hangs out in their attic) is laughable. I wouldn't go see that film either, yet, that is exactly what this film is about and its brilliant. The actors are fantastic, the subplots are real and effective. The murderer \\"Billy\\" has something going for him that others don't...he's insane. He insanely insane. And one other thing...he's real. He's walking the streets, he's climbing through your windows. He's so good that he's actually keeping bodies in your attic and you have no clue. \\"When a stranger calls\\"?....are you kidding me? THIS GUY knows how to make threating phone calls. You'll cringe.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: This is the real deal folks. This is what horror is all about.

0691084459|5.0|Binney has cleary established Galactic Dynamics and its companion volume Galactic Astronomy as the definitive works on the subject. The NASA Astronomy Abstract Service lists 3411 citations for this book as of 12/2006 so it is clearly an important part of the literature of astrophysics.<br /><br />This book is written at the graduate or researcher level. As it deals with the behavior of galaxies, potential theory, energy distribution, angular momentium and dark matter so the mathematics employed are quite powerful.
1400049628|2.0|So maybe you're like me.  You picked up Max Brooks' \\"World War Z\\", and couldn't put it down.  Thought it was a refreshingly unique twist on tired zombie horror fiction.  More than clever - cynical, ironic, hip.  And having missed \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" when if came out three years earlier, maybe like me you're thinking \\"great, more of the same - more of WWZ's zombie satire, tongue in cheek mayhem and gore, but made special thanks to Brooks' wit honed with his keen insight into what really makes this culture and society tick.\\"  So if that's you, then maybe like me, \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" was likely a big letdown.  Yes, it's a clever parody, and yes, it lampoons both zombie horror and survival guides.  We got that.  But come-on, after a couple of chapters, reading this is just about as tedious - and as engaging - as reading the instruction manuals that this parodies.  Beyond the concept, the accompanying humor - tongue in cheek or otherwise - just isn't there.  Brooks does such a great job of making this read like an authentic survival guide that it is just, well, boring.<br /><br />So unless you're one of those reviewers who really believe zombies walk among us (besides 49ers fans), and therefore were bummed because they were expecting MORE technical survival detail, then do yourself a favor, save six bucks, and skip this one.  Read WWZ, and if you need more zombie satire, just watch \\"Sean of the Dead\\" again.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'm listening to \\"LOVE\\" for the first time right now, and I am digging it!    I know that some people might not like that The Beatles' music was manipulated, altered, etc. But, to anyone who is hesitating buying this CD for this very reason, think again! This is an incredible achievement on the part of George and Giles Martin. I am as hard-core a Beatles fan as you will find (short of dressing up in a collarless jacket every year and attending Beatlefests in every U.S. city on a yearly basis). I am the first to object when I hear Beatles music being misrepresented (can you say \\"TV commercials\\"?), but this is far from a mis-use of their music. This is simply a new way to appreciate The Beatles monumental musical legacy.    The way elements from different songs are combined to create such landscapes of sound is truly breath-taking. For life-long Beatles fans like me who have always strained to hear everything in the mixes of every Beatles song, you'll appreciate \\"LOVE\\" that much more. Bits that you'd never really been aware of before, because they were were hiding somewhere in the original mix, are brought to the front. By placing elements from different songs into the framework of another song, the sounds are audible in a whole new clarity!    None of the \\"LOVE\\" tracks can ever \\"replace\\" the original tracks, but that was never the intent. It's a \\"soundtrack\\" to a Cirque du Soleil show, and perhaps now the greatest soundtrack ever released.    I am seeing the show in Vegas in about a month. My anticipation of seeing the show has just jumped about a million points!
B0000AK0D5|5.0|It's no surprise that Freddie Hubbard won the Grammy for this album in 1972!  It is a masterpiece and more!<br /><br />Creed Taylor brought together some of the finest jazz musicians in the business for this tour de force.  Beginning with Freddie Hubbard on trumpet and flugelhorn, Richard Wyands on piano, Hubert Laws on flute, Herbie Hancock on the Fender Rhodes, George Benson on guitar, Eric Gale on guitar, Ron Carter on bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums, and Airto Moreira on percussion.  And that's just to name a FEW!!!<br /><br />In addition to the who's who in jazz names, there are within the credits, various musicians on the vibes, flutes, bassoons, English horn, oboe, clarinets, French horns, harp, and violins.  Oh, yes, THIS is a work of a grand nature!<br /><br />Apart from the original LP, this CD includes two bonus tracks, one being a sixteen-minute live version of the title song.  If you love Freddie and if you love Creed Taylor productions, this is a must for your collection!
B000I5X80G|3.0|this is a good live show at a great point in Neil's career, but the show is short and Cowgirl In The Sand is not a good version - the bass is way out of tune and completely unlistenable.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|When I saw the CD it stated that there  were new remixed versions by George Martin.   That was enough to make me bite and purchase the CD brand new which is something I never do. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed it.   Several songs didn't sound like there were many changes to them - perhaps there weren't.   However the song that were \\"combined\\" were very clever and worked for me.    The different version of Strawberry Fields is a favorite.   George's acoustic version of \\"While My guitar gently weeps\\" is absolutely awesome.   In my opinion that song could be re-released today as a new single. <br /> <br />For the die-hard fans who don't want the originals \\"messed with\\", consider the fact that it is George Martin doing it.  That should be reason enough to appreciate it.   Either way, I am a HUGE HUGE Beatles fan and I thoroughly enjoy this CD and would recommend it to others.
B000002I53|5.0|I once heard that the rock group, the Doors patterned \\"Light My Fire\\" after John Coltrane's, \\"My Favorite Things\\" with the long solos, and the crashing back together for the final climax. Maybe that's a real possibility, but what I know for sure is that this is a great album with the title track being one of Coltrane's best offerings.<br /><br />Coltrane offered us so much, didn't he? He poured himself into everything that he played. The test of a true musician, I believe, is if you can feel their presence, their soul in the room with you when you listen to their recordings. Every time I listen to Coltrane, I know that he's in the room with me. I feel his soul, his spirit welling up from within my heart and taking over everything. My wife knows enough to not even try to get me to do anything while listening to Coltrane. I used to use him for \\"background\\" while I wrote or painted or worked on projects, but I realized, how disrespectful that was to this genius. Now when I put on Coltrane, I must be fully and completely present and available to my favorite jazz musician.<br /><br />Sometimes I play the game, \\"What If?\\" What if Coltrane lived another five, ten, twenty, thirty years? What would he be putting out? I guess it doesn't matter because his physical self has been gone for a long, long time...but maybe he understood...maybe he knew at a deep soul level that he was only going to be on this earth for a little while so he had to pour all of himself into each and every Coltrane Creation. He does not skimp one bit.<br /><br />This is a great recording. John will baptize your heart and soul with a sacred holiness, a joyous lovliness, a magic that will give you the ability to see the true for what it is. If you are a serious jazz fan, you already have it...if you want to be taken seriously as a jazz fan, put down the Kenny G and get the big JC.<br /><br />You're gonna love it and it really will become one of your \\"favorite things\\".<br /><br />Peace and BlessingsBlessings <br />
038073186X|4.0|This is a typically well written Lehane stand alone story. Just a bit too obvious for me. A good brain vacation book, page turner, but no Mystic River, and not as fun as one of his Kenzie/ Genarro novels,but Shutter Island is still good enough to keep your mind off of a flight delay.<br /><br />If you like detective books you should enjoy Shutter Island, but if you haven't read Lehane before, I would suggest Mystic River, or any and all of the Kenzie /Genarro tales.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|The first time I heard John Mayer was at a graduation party for someone I used to babysit and I'm much older than her. She had the song \\"No Such Thing\\" incorporated into her slide show of her growing up. Then I heard \\"Daughters\\" and thought how unique of a voice he had. Then I saw him on CSI performing \\"Waiting On The World to Change\\", I decided to buy the CD. I love every song on it. This week my favorite is \\"Stop This Train\\". I enjoy the fact that he has a different voice. I'm a jazz fan and every once in awhile I dabble in other genres such as the Blues and again, I'm glad I did. I plan on checking out his earlier CDs but I've read this one is by far the best.
B000A3OS14|4.0|This album is great and the songs picked are great some songs are better than others, my favorite is Don`t you (forget about me) by the stella starlight trio. But I`m more a fussion jazz fanatic so I was expecting some songs not to be too chilly and maybe a little more agressive. I think a couple of songs should be instrumental and performed by different artists  to have a good blend. All songs are equally chilly , soft and sexy that`s cool but I thought a more vibrant style should be better for a compilation like this. Anyway it`s a very nice album, you should get it.

I have read two other books by Margaret Atwood and I liked this one the least.  (Oryx and Crake, The Edible Woman)  I feel the book was too long for the material covered.  Also, the book talked about the children too much and the last half of the book has little to do with the first half.  I wouldn't recommend.  I also have a friend who read the book who had a different view of what the story was about (feminity/coming of age as a woman in a different time), but she also found the story to be lackluster.
0316779237|4.0|Sedaris has written a collection of holiday gems! Although the quality of story goes downhill after the first of the book, \\"The Santaland Diaries,\\" it should be noted that this is only the case because his account of life as a Macy's SantaLand elf is the most hilarious retail story ever put on paper. Anyone who has ever worked at a busy store around the holidays will be unable to contain their laughter while reading this. I recommend you don't do it on the subway.<br /><br />Other great shorts include \\"Front Row Center at Thaddeus Bristol\\", an account of Catholic School Christmas shows from the perspective of a grade school theater critic, and \\"Christmas Means Giving\\", where a wealthy family gives their limbs, major organs, and children to charity in an attempt to best their neighbors in philanthropy.<br /><br />Holidays On Ice is a must have for the stressed during the holidays.
0131103628|4.0|I read and heard all the hype about this book and I had to check it out.  I ordered the book and started reading the first few pages and even got the famous \\"hello, world!\\" to print on my screen!  After that, the whole terminologies and technical aspect of programming in C went right over my head.  I put the book aside.<br /><br />I purchased another book called Absolute Beginner's Guide to C by Greg Perry which really was simple and easy to understanding C.  I then went back to this Kernighan/Ritchie book and it started to make a little more sense.  Again, however, as I started to read more of this book things are still too technical and goes right over my head.  Hopefully one day I'll be able to pick up this book and REALLY understand it.<br /><br />Update 7/22/2012: After several years of programming (PHP, Javascript, Visual Basic, BASH, Python, Perl, Powershell, C/C++), this K&R book is a nice reference book to have.  I still stand by my original review that it is NOT a book for beginners getting into programming.
1586210912|4.0|I read this book in 2 sittings, so that should tell you I liked it.  It was full of eye-openers (most of it is common sense, but most of us still need to hear it) as well as great little sayings, which could be found on almost every single page. <br />I have to tell you though, it is overly easy reading and very verbose.  This can be good for newcomers to understanding money, but I found that I skimmed most of the book, since he repeated himself A LOT (actual sentences and almost paragraphs repeated) and said the same ideas over and over.  The entire book probably could be condensed to about 20 pages, with these following points as the most important: <br />-dont be scared of money. if you want money, you must dedicate time to thinking and acting on it. become financially educated. <br />-put your earnings into your assets as much as possible, limit liabilities (and your house & car are liabilities, not assets, since they dont make money) <br />-working for somebody else is pointless ;) <br /> <br />So I would recommend the book as a starter text -- right now I'm searching for other books on finance to learn more.  But, if you read the book, you'll see that that was really the purpose of the book in the first place: to pique my interest.
0618526412|4.0|The American south amazingly resembles Wales in producing an astonishingly great number of writers from an unpopulated source.  Urban readers flock to read the works provided by these often small town writers. Carson McCullers is one more great southern small town writer. This is where: To Kill a Mockingbird meets Faulkner; The Secret Life of Bees meets Fitzgerald.<br /><br />In the small Georgia setting in pre-war times, McCullers has blacks converse with whites which include Jews.  One black character is named Karl Marx, a white character espouses Marxism, and the tony town politely or cordially embraces each. Everyone works with one another in accommodating others on their bills, providing services when required and being good neighbors even when times are hard. But, amid the seemingly \\"socialistic-like\\" existence of everyday life in the small town belies an uncontrollable  hatred or anger which can ignite with the slightest spark.<br /><br />This book starts out calmly.  Then an  injustice is shown as the best friend of  Mr. Singer - a deaf mute who everyone adores - is evicted to a sanitarium because his cousin cannot be bothered with his eccentricities.  The book returns to the town's mellow character, and another injustice occurs.  Before the end, numerous murders, racial injustice by prison guards, a public beating by the sheriff of a black doctor,  and a suicide ruin the wonder of the seemingly sane existence of the town.<br /><br />The dialogue is wonderful. Amazingly so.  And, to have been written by a 23-year old, it is almost unbelievable.  For the dialogue alone, this book is worth reading

0446528056|2.0|I have to say that this book was a bit of a let down. Part I was the best part of the whole book, full of vivid depiction of character, both in the town and in dialogue. Things fell apart in Parts 2 and 3, mainly because Sparks falls back on cliches, generalities and vagueries that are frustrating to read. It almost feels like in the fear of getting things wrong, it's better not to get them at all, or capture things as blandly as possible.    And it IS bland, which is unfortunate. But, on the upside, at least he's original. Or as original as you can be in a genre that's been mashed to a pulp.     Not that I am a fan of abandoning a read, but if your time is important to you, close the book at the end of Part 1.
B000002G87|1.0|When this first came out I thought it was embarrassing crap. Imagine someone ripping off Delaney and Bonnie! Now the passage of years confirms it. Sentimental, adolescent, heart-on-sleeve stupidity with pretty lousy guitar work -- all unmelodic fills w/ Clapton's new-found Stratocaster fixation. Yuk. There's more filler here -- crummy versions of blues classics -- than a rusted out Chevy. Everyone who knows anything knows that BLUES BREAKERS and the 1st CREAM were, essentially, IT for Clapton. Well, w/ the Arabic origins of LAYLA we now know that if Clapton's God, he must serve Allah, right? I thought that was Cat Stevens, in whose class Clapton must be considered. One of the records that ushered in the sickening indulgences of 70s rock and stomped on the legacy of the 60s. Oh, the rhythm section's pretty good. Rock and roll for those who don't rock and roll, hence selection as one of the GREATS. Thank you ROLLING STONE, or whoever.
0739325760|4.0|****<br /><br />This book is the 1995 memoir written by Barack Obama, the African-American senator from Illinois, updated in this 2006 large print edition (which is the same as the 2004 paperback edition). It is an introspective and earnest account of his search for meaning and identity as an African-American males. Somewhat anguished, it insightfully illustrates the struggles and dilemmas black people face in this country. I learned a great deal from his experiences, foreign to me as a Caucasian female. The book describes the author's journey to community and political involvement, his personal development, and his family background.<br /><br />I had been curious about this senator with a mother from Kansas, a father from Kenya, especially since he may in the future be a candidate for the Presidency of the United States. This book answered many of my questions. It probed Barack Obama's roots in a sensitive and personal way that I will not soon forget. If you want to really understand who he is, read this book.<br /><br />I would not call \\"Dreams from My Father\\" an entertaining read, but more an educational read because of the intensity and heaviness of the subject matter and the anger, cynisism, and frustration the author experienced. It would be, however, very wortwhile for those who wish to know more about Barack Obama, and for those who wish to know more about what it feels like to be black in America.<br /><br />After reading this memoir, I'm continuing on to read Barack Obama's second book, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\".<br /><br />****

The youngest person living in my parent's house is 18, but we all still enjoyed this movie. My dad also loved Toy Story (my brother and I were children when that one came out). I've seen all of the Disney Pixar movies, and this is my second favorite, behind the original Toy Story, but above The Incredibles. I wasn't a huge fan of Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc, or Finding Nemo.

B00005JPDY|5.0|Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a somber, quiet man. Every morning he leaves his middle class home in the suburbs and along with his neighbors boards a bus for downtown D.C. But unlike his neighbors, who presumably work as office functionaries, Wilson is a top, experienced, \\"higher-up\\" for the C.I.A. and though, on the surface dressed exactly like his neighbors in felt fedora and Sears trench coats, Wilson is headed for the monolith that is the C.I.A. headquarters.<br />As written by Eric Roth and directed by Robert De Niro (De Niro's only other directing job was \\"A Bronx Tale\\"), \\"The Good Shepherd\\" traces the genesis of the C.I.A. as it evolves from the World War II O.S.S. and central to this terrific, fascinating, intelligently written and passionately directed movie is the story of Wilson himself and the ultimate tragedy of his life: a life that begins to unravel the moment he agrees to become a spy right out of college.<br />Wilson, as portrayed by Matt Damon is the perfect spy if there is such a thing: he is without humor, looks like a thousand other men, dresses like a small town banker and is passionate about only two things: his son and his miniature ship in a bottle hobby. And anytime he strays from these two things, as in women or sex, he fails miserably.<br />The world of Espionage is a dirty business, one that defies and twists the basic notions of truth, loyalty and pride. For Wilson there is almost no room for anything else: upon marrying he leaves his pregnant girlfriend, Clover(Angelina Jolie) for six years to serve in Europe without thinking about it twice.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|King Crimson created one of the earliest masterpieces of progressive rocking, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King,\\" that didn't push the envelope of rock, it ripped through the side of the envelope.  \\"Red\\" is an incredible album that marked the end of an era for King Crimson, an era that also heralded the imminent demise of classic progressive rock.<br /><br />The album starts with \\"Red,\\" an instrumental that has elements similar to some of the elements on \\"In the Court of Crimson King.\\" The song kicks off with a series of guitar riffs, drums and bass, leading into exploitation of the musical theme. While the lead guitar periodically uses the theme as a launch platform, it returns to the same theme once again to maintain the continuity of thread. At nearly 3 minutes into the piece we get string bass taking the lead in the theme, and the lead guitar falls into the background. The string bass provides an ominous feel, a sense of impending something...doom perhaps. Then the lead guitar takes back over, repeating the original theme with variations. The instrumental ends with a series of climbing riffs into a discord that make you start to feel like perhaps there is a positive ending, but the discord ending on a downbeat immediately changes the feeling of the end.<br /><br />\\"Fallen Angel\\" implies a younger brother dying in a drug deal gone wrong (\\"Risk a life to make a dime\\"). The cornet is prominent until about halfway through the song, when the song segues into a bridge. After the bridge the lyrics are repeated from the second verse, until the \\"Fallen angel\\" chorus when all the instruments play counterpoint to the fade out.  This song is very sad.<br /><br />\\"One More Red Nightmare\\" starts with heavy bass and drums, adding in mellotron, sounding ominous. This song is actually hilarious. The singer is on a plane when the plane starts dropping out of the sky. However, the singer wakes to find that the whole flight was a dream, he's actually on a Greyhound bus. The supporting music is about as whimsical as King Crimson gets on this album, which is to say, only modestly. There is an extended bridge after the first two verses where there is a dream-like feel to the music, leading to the third verse where the singer finds that he is on the bus. After that the music takes on a joyous/relieved feel, celebrating life. The ending is abrupt and...<br /><br />the beginning to \\"Providence\\" is as slow as the end to \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" was abrupt. Violin leading to small pieces of additional music, in and out. Think \\"Moonchild,\\" but done better. This instrumental would make a good soundtrack for a horror film. At about 5 minutes in the music begins to accelerate, and the instruments begin a serious counterpoint that seems improvisational, and perhaps is, leading to the string bass that finishes off the instrumental, not abruptly, but not in a fadeout either.<br /><br />\\"Starless\\" finishes the CD with 12 minutes of song and instrumental. The song kicks off with about 4 minutes of beautiful lyrics and music that transitions into bass and lead guitar with drums and blocks, slow...building, building, building, almost forever, it seems, but at almost 8 minutes in the lead guitar starts into a fevered pitch, sustaining what came before, until at 8:40 or so you are on the runway, blasting off at just past 9 minutes. The music moves and rocks, the saxophone providing the lead for a while...then mellowing back out, the calm before the raucous, rocking end.<br /><br />The CD is ominous. It is dark. Do not listen to it when you are feeling down. Mellow, okay. Down, no. One small thing: this music is addictive. Once you listen to it, the diode photons may wear the plastic off...<br /><br />Enjoy!upporting music is about as whimsical as King Crimson gets on this album, which is to say, only modestly.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|Regardless of the opinions of this cut, there seems to be some confusion of what this version of the movie is supposed to be. The Donner cut is supposed to give you a rough idea of what Donner's Superman II would have been like had he not been fired. It is not a replacement of the theatrical version, for  it is far too incomplete for that. The ending to this Superman II is redundant to the first because he originally intended it for part II, then moved it to Part I and planned to have a new ending for II. He didn't get to do that, so they put his original ending back into part II, so they could show his ending footage that follows up his time reversal. Remember, the idea is to show all of Donner's footage while minimalizing Lester's footage, not create a definitive version of the movie. In my mind, a definitive version would be some of this version combined with the ABC extended edition that was aired years ago. <br />Finally, this edition was not a marketing gimmick at all. The entire reason this version was released was due to years of requests from fans to see Donner's footage (see the intro on the DVD).  <br />I am 100% sure that if Donner had never been fired, his version would have been the best. As it is, don't throw out your theatrical DVD (unless they release the extended cut), but be sure to pick up this version as well.
B000053GTF|5.0|This dvd was a Christmas present.I have to say it is my very favorite one. <br />This dvd includes videos and live performances.The videos are beatifully done and settings are lavish.The taped live performances are lovely and exciting.Celine has the most beautiful voice and performs in such a heartfelt way.I highly recommend this dvd to fans and to newcomers to celine.  <br />
B000I2IT44|5.0|First off, if you have not heard of Porcupine Tree, start hearing and purchase this DVD. There is nothing like a live show, therefore I hate live CD's or DVDs. They just do not capture the real thing. They are not loud enough, not as emotional as the really being there, and flat. But this one changes the rules and is like no other. I was at the shows that this was recorded at, and this represents those shows as closely as any live recording put on album, tape, 8-track, CD or DVD EVER has. <br /> <br />Porcupine Tree is the most innovative, original, heavy, mellow, beautiful, emotional and techical band on the planet right now. Steven Wilson is a musical genius. His work with Porcupine Tree is only a portion of this man's talent. No-Man, Bass Communion, Blackfield and all his other side gigs are pure perfection, Porcupine Tree being the best of them. This DVD represents this band to the T. The band is so talented it is scary. The show was incredible, even the mess up on Trains was great. There is a great blend of what this band represents on this DVD, all of which will not let you down. <br /> <br />If you are into extremely talented musicians, beautifully heavy, orchestral and mellow, progressive and original, this is THE DVD to purchase. <br /> <br />If fact, bundle it up with MUST HAVE Porcupine Tree CD's that you can get here as well, DEADWING, IN ABSENTIA and if it is still here, LIGHTBULB SUN. These 3 albums are a roller coaster ride in music, beautiful and soaring vocals and harmonies, Heavy instrumental pieces, infectious pop and progressive brilliance.
B00004RW7Z|5.0|An inspirational movie about the victory of the human spirit over the imperfections of the body. A young man, who was born with a medical condition on his heart, wants to be a space pilot. But his health characteristics are not as good as they should be.<br /><br />He is not tall enough, his vision is not good enough, so he is \\"invalid\\". Nevertheless, he is determined to enter the space navigator academy (Gattaca) by using a false identity. By using false blood samples, false fingerprints, etc. (borrowed by a suitable \\"valid\\" person), he passes the tests and is approved to be a space pilot on a mission to Titan. At the very end before the flight, his true identity is discovered by one doctor, but the doctor sympatshises with his dreams and allows him to fly in space. The donor of the blood samples, unfortunately, commits a suicide, because he was confined in a wheelchair and probably got tired of living like a cripple.<br /><br />The movie really suggests that by training our mind and body (and using some help from our friends) we can achieve our dreams, regardless of the unfavorable conditions that we were born with.<br /><br />I recomend the movie, because the story is really dreamy, and also the actors and the actress (Uma Thurman) are very good looking, and the building facilities of the training center Gattaca are really beautiful and futuristic. If you have to pass some tests in your life in order to get accepted for your dream university or a dream job - then you should see this movie. Don't let anything stop you on your way to success - such is the message of the movie.<br /><br />The idea of using a false idendity is fraudulent of course, but as the proverb says: \\"The purpose justifies the means\\".<br /><br />And all is well if it ends well. These are the movie's main ideas.
B00081U7HC|1.0|I purchased the 10th Anniversary Edition years ago.  I still find it hard to watch with additional scenes.  And, now that I have a 5.1 sound system, the absence of Dolby Digital 5.1 on the 10th AE is quite evident.  If only the 15th Anniversary Special Edition offered the original theatrical version (very happy to see the 5.1), I would give into this marketing trap. <br /> <br />Dear Hollywood, stop jerking us around.

In that time, I've read several of them and loved them all. I read this one in two days.         In this series, there are three children: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire. Their parents are very rich and die in a fire. The children's new guardian is a man named Count Olaf. He's extremely evil and makes their lifes miserable.

B000GCFO0I|3.0|Much has been said about Silent Hill, the adaptation of the successful horror video game series. A lot of it has been negative, from both the general movie going audience and the hardcore fans of the series. I myself agree with some of the critiques, but unlike most critics and some fans of the games, I don't believe Silent Hill is a complete mess of a film. There are some positives to be found, even if they don't outweigh the negatives.  <br /> <br />The plot summary given by Amazon is very accurate, so rather than rehash it, I'll just concentrate on the ups and downs of the film in general. One major area where Silent Hill succeeds is the visual effects. Christophe Gans and his crew have successfully replicated the atmosphere of the games to an extent I wouldn't have thought possible. Gans is a huge fan of the games and it's made evident in the way even the smallest nuances of the town come to life. Silent Hill is a decaying, misty wasteland of a town. It's ominous, bleak and incredibly imposing, taking on a life of its own (much like the mental hospital from Session 9, another visually intriguing film). And when the town gets engulfed by Darkness the first time, you will be amazed at the nightmarish landscape that arises. It's like nothing ever before put on film, and the experience is worth it just to see the environment from the games come to life.  <br /> <br />Then there are the monsters. Twisted, deformed, and in one case, extremely menacing aberrations of life, these are also creatures very unique compared to what's been done before. They are both distinctly human and disturbingly non-human. Nowhere is this more evident than in Pyramid Head, a monstrous fiend that puts horror icons like Jason Voorhess to shame.  <br /> <br />Much of the visuals are unexplained. That's intentional. One reviewer mentioned below that every little detail of the nightmarish world and its monsters should have been explained. Well, Silent Hill doesn't work that way. Just like mostzombie movies don't tell you why the zombies eat human flesh, Silent Hill doesn't tell you why the monsters look the way they do, or why the environments are so damn hellish. That's up to the player (or in this case, the viewer) to figure out. Silent Hill is a series that does not spoon feed its followers all the answers, preferring to let them figure out certain things for themselves. It's surreal and mysterious, a quality that more horror films could use nowadays, in this day and age where too many viewers expect all the answers to be handed to them on a silver platter. Isn't horror supposed to be more about the threat of the unknown? <br /> <br />That being said, the plot of the film does not match up to the wonderful imagery created by its dedicated crew. Fans had high hopes when Roger Avary was cast, but this is not one of his better scripts, and it's clear that he wasn't sure which direction he wanted to take the story in. He wanted to do something new while staying faithful to the games, and the direction he took was not one suited towards a serious Silent Hill adaptation.  <br /> <br />The actors do what they can, but there's no salvaging some of the bad dialogue in the movie. The story is also too muddied by religious zealotry in the later parts, and it detracts from what could otherwise be a very emotional story. Without spoiling too much, the story behind a character named Alessa Gillespie is one of the most tragic aspects of the game series. Had it been done properly, it would have left audiences shocked and repulsed at what was done to her, and stirred some genuine sympathy for her character. Instead most people seem indifferent to it, precisely because of the bad dialogue involved. Avary was not at his best here, and it shows. Perhaps he needed more help from the writers behind the games, or perhaps he let certain other films influence him a bit too much.  <br /> <br />Gans and Avery were right to take the story seriously, as Silent Hill IS a seriousstory in the games. Resident Evil is campy. Evil Dead is campy. But Silent Hill? An hour of playing the games will show you otherwise. It is one of the most mature and disturbing video game series around, and executed properly, it would have been a revolutionary horror film. Unfortunately the script stumbled far too often for that, and the result is a film that while visually stunning, is only mediocre when it comes to the plot.  <br /> <br />Still, it's not a total loss. As I mentioned before, the visuals are worth a look regardless of who you are. And if you're a very dedicated horror fan, you might be able to overlook the flaws of the script and enjoy the film for what it is: an aspiring video game adaptation that nailed certain elements of its source material while stumbling on the most important one. Christophe Gans was right when he said that if there's one video game series perfect to adapt into film, it's Silent Hill. It has the story and the visual elements most others don't (save for ones like Metal Gear Solid, Legacy of Kain, and a few of the other heavyweight storytellers). But finding the right balance for an adaptation isn't easy, as Gans and Avary proved here. Better luck next time, guys.  <br /> <br />One last note about the film: the soundtrack is absolutely excellent. Taken entirely from music and ambience from the game, it's a riveting experience that deserves to be heard by both fans and non-fans alike. It does an incredible job of setting the mood for the story, which is another reason why it's disappointing that the plot fails to live up to expecations.
B00005JOLI|1.0|This movie had the possiblity of being another Lord of the Rings and then threw it away. This bares little resemblance to the book. There is NO character development..you really do not care what happens to these people, the director and writers of the script left out everything that made these characters important and endearing. The only one they manage to leave alone is the dragon. There are no elves, what did they do to the Urgals? And who cares about the Varden? The only interesting character beside the dragon is the shade..and what happened to him? His makeup suddenly changed and you are left wondering if this is the same bad guy? This movie butchers what was a fantastic book and makes it into a mockery. Lets just pray they do not go ahead with the sequels. So please read the book and ignore the movie.

B000GFLAI0|4.0|Dylan latest work takes the best of American music over the last 125 years or so and distills it into a very palatable product.  I love the sound he achieves, which is a sort of swing-shuffle-blues.  My only objection is that he should give credit where credit is due.  \\"Someday Baby\\" is obviously an adaptation of McKinley Morganfield's (Muddy Waters) \\"Trouble No More\\", which was effectively covered by the Allman Brothers Band.  Dylan's chorus:  \\"Someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry poor me, anymore.\\"  Muddy's:  \\"Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble poor me, anymore.\\"  Granted, Dylan did write his own verses for the song, but I think he should have indicated that his song was an adaptation of the Muddy Waters song.

Otherwise they may see the simple brilliance. <br /> <br />Just a note to other reviewers.  Autistic is not a noun.  It is an adjective.  Referring to a person with Asperger's or another form of ASD as an \\"autistic\\" is extremely offensive.

B000007491|5.0|Having heard Supertramp saturate the airwaves in the early 1980's with songs like \\"Give a Little Bit\\", I was very uncertain as to whether I would actually like this album or not.  To be perfectly honest, as a teenage prog fan in the early 1980's who was obsessed with bands like Yes, King Crimson, and Pink Floyd, I was a bit provincial in my listening habits.  Fortunately, I have revisited several British Symphonic pop bands (apart from Supertramp) that I dismissed in my youth and found them to be generally quite good.  Supertramp's debut album has three things going for it that made this purchase virtually frictionless: (1) it was released in 1970; (2) it reportedly sounded nothing like their later material; and (3) a lot of my fellow proggers have heaped praise upon it.  After listening to the album several times I am happy to report that everything that has been said about the debut is true.<br /><br />The musicians on this album include Richard Davies (Hammond organ, piano, electric piano, harmonica, and vocals); Roger Hodgson (bass guitar, flageolet, acoustic guitar, cello, and vocals); Richard Palmer (electric guitar, acoustic guitar, balalaika, and vocals); and Robert Millar (percussion, harmonica).  Although all of the musicians are decent enough, Richard Palmer is excellent on the guitar and quotes from styles such as jazz and blues, while staying strictly in a rock context.  I guess it is also worth noting that Richard went on to join the ranks of 1973-1975 phase King Crimson as a lyricist (at least I think so at any rate).  The spacey Hammond organ work of Richard Davies is also superb, although I really wished that he had used the mellotron - there are some supremely melancholy passages on this album that would have been made more so by several orders of magnitude.  Come to think of it, the use of the mellotron would most likely have made this album nearly as hallowed as the eponymous debut album by the English rock band Spring (1971).<br /><br />This is a fantastic spin that is stylistically somewhat similar to other English rock bands lumped under the \\"progressive\\" umbrella in 1970 that were interested in pushing boundaries (including Spring).  In short, very moody and haunting rock, with some attention paid to things like arrangement and dynamics.  The tracks on the album range in length from 0'31 to 12'03\\" and blend together somewhat, imparting a song-cycle feel to the album.  Although musically this album is still largely indebted to psychedelic and spacey blues-jam styles (you will not have your mind blown by intricate ensemble work), I did notice brief references to the emerging progressive rock scene as it developed in England.  For example, there is an experimental passage on the lengthy piece Try Again that would not have been out of place on the track Moonchild from King Crimson's 1969 debut.  Specifically, the section is structureless (no melody or meter) and consists of little \\"bleeps and blurbs\\" on the organ and guitar, with a little bit of percussion thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />As far as the remastering of this CD goes, it is just so - so.  While the sound quality is fine, the CD \\"booklet\\" is about as skimpy as they come (no lyrics or notes about the band).  There are black and white photos of each band member however.<br /><br />I was really impressed by this debut album by Supertramp and like it just as much as any of the other early experimental English bands like Spring, Gracious!, and Cressida.  Although I have a tendency to give a lot of albums five star ratings (I really can't help myself), this album definitely deserves it.  Recommended to fans of the bands previously mentioned along with (perhaps) 70-71 Pink Floyd.a fantastic spin that is stylistically somewhat similar to other English rock bands lumped under the \\"progressive\\" umbrella in 1970 that were interested in pushing boundaries (including Spring).

0684830485|5.0|I revisited this book in my early 40's and came away resold on Hemingway as one of America's greatest writers and an artist who stands the test of time. It's a shame, in fact, that Hemingway's caricature-friendly persona, life and writing style have sometimes obsured his work. Forget the macho image and the stories of drinking and hunting. He is an artist of the first order. <br /> <br />For Whom... is a novel about the important things -- life, love, death, fear, the attraction and horror of war. What struck me throughout was how innocent the characters are and how genuinely Hemingway depicts the most difficult subjects, be it war (in this case the Spanish Civil War) or the love between Maria and Robert Jordan. <br /> <br />Hemingway is a writer we need in our times. He focuses on the big, important issues without cynicism, and never shies from exposing what is in our hearts and minds. A classic.
B00005OWIU|3.0|It's obvious the man was still feeling out this Harry Potter thing with this first score.  There is a lot of repetition, but by later soundtracks it seems to have been necessary.  This soundtrack contains the original, lovely and full settings of the main Harry Potter themes.
B00005JPCD|5.0|I thought that this movie was wonderful!  I should mention that I'm profoundly hard-of-hearing (almost completely deaf) but even being deaf, it was worth seeing.  I do admit that there are some topics that a young child may not be able to grasp, such as discrimination, pollution, animal rights, etc. but please don't let that stop you from letting your child see it.
B000000WFZ|4.0|Not as epically gorgeous as 'Once Upon a Time in America', but still lovely.  There's a South American influence that lends a very fresh sound to the entire soundtrack.  My favourite track is an Ave Maria--in Guarani.  Haunting.  However, \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\" is the theme that makes this score.  Being an oboist, it of course holds a particular appeal to me--and the oboe performing the theme is really something to be aspired to.
0099456761|4.0|The book portrays the point of view of a 15-year-old autistic boy, Christopher. It did it so well that I was tempted to rate the book lower just based on that because it was implied it's viewpoint was so accurate. It leaves you feeling that you might just understand what autism really is and does it so well that it implies that the specific range of emotion that Christopher has and how he deals with it is what it is all about.  My own experiences suggest that this boy's emotional range and response is just one vantage point.    In some cases the incidents that take place in the search for the dog are funny.  At the same time the focus on emotion and feelings are so well done that, rather than funny, it might be said that it is chilling.     It took a long time for me to be willing to recommend this book to those in my life who are closer to autism. The book, if anything, is too powerful in getting a message across that is a hard message. No one would want to think that someone they loved really had to spend their life dealing with emotion in this way. On the other hand the more you read the more you want to read. The book was one I read from beginning to end in one sitting.     The author did a great job of using the story to teach us but what he taught us may have narrowed our previous points of view more than it expanded them.
B000002OR4|5.0|This has the most gorgeous melody ever, pretty much.  The main theme is just the epitome of bittersweet *and* melody, I think, and is played beautifully throughout the score by the ridiculously talented Itzhak Perlman.  No two performances of the title theme are the same (and this is the kind of score that would seem to regurgitate a theme over and over), he incorporates such wonderfully clever nuances.  There are one or two secondary themes that express as fully as the main theme, as well as a few choir-centric tracks.  Ultimately, this a breathtaking, deadly beautiful soundtrack that everyone must own.

B00000IQMT|4.0|\\"Duel of the Fates\\"!  There are a few tedious tracks, such as \\"Passage Through the Planet Core\\", but these are easily skipped.  \\"Anakin's Theme\\" was sadly not explored in later movies, as it is a wonderful foreshadowing of what Anakin is to become (see the end of the phrase, which is a callback to \\"The Imperial March\\").  \\"Jar Jar's Theme\\" is, well, appropriate.  It is also the kind of theme that makes me hang my head in shame for playing an oboe.  But where this score surpasses expectation is in the fight music.  Much different from the original 'Star Wars' trilogy, Williams has found a formula for cohesive battle music.  It makes sense, it builds, and it's damn exciting--my favourite is \\"The Flag Parade\\".  The other highlight from the score apart from \\"Duel of the Fates\\", which I really needn't say any more about, is \\"The Droid Invasion\\", a theme that is repeated and developed in later movies (it becomes \\"The Arena\\", in 'Episode II').
B000JLTRJ0|3.0|.....and I do like it. It is a powerful story concerning the rescue of 2 trapped police officers from the rubble of <br /> the World Trade Center. How the 2 officers survived not only the inital collapse but being trapped under mountains <br />of debris for many hours is miraculous. Despite it's Hollywood budget (special effects are amazing) and engrossing <br />storyline, I couldn't help but feel that the movie missed the mark somewhat. <br /> <br />My main problem for me is the lack of emotion I felt. There was no 'goosebump' factor involved at any stage of the <br />movie. Perhaps it is due to 9/11 being the most photographed disaster of our times and I've seen (like <br />most other people) raw, gut wrenching emotion from real people on the day and afterwoods with relatives hoping for <br />a miracle that their loved ones somehow survived. I don't think the actors in the movie managed to reach that level <br />of emotional intensity. <br /> <br />Which leads me onto the performance of the actors. For me the performances were too 'Hollywood'. A strange statement <br />to make I'm sure, but as a regular viewer of indi and arthouse movies (especially foreign movies) where the actors <br />often go to emotional levels rarely seen in big budget Hollywood movies, the performances in WTC failed to match <br />them.  <br /> <br />Overall I would rate WTC as a 'good' movie, not a 'great' one. It is a compelling story based on the amazing survival <br />of 2 police officers trapped in the rubble of the WTC, though if Hollywood could look past profit and appealing to  <br />the lowest common denominator, perhaps it could have been amazing.  <br /> <br />Note about the special features on the 2-disc edition - worth the price of the DVD alone. We get an indepth look <br />at the film making process and a thorough insight in the lives and experiences of the 2 trapped police officers.
B000002OOZ|4.0|I heard the main theme on the Olympics opening montage thing during the last Summer Olympics--big surprise, right, seeing as he wrote most of the Olympic themes--so that should give you an idea of the grandeur in it.  Of course, he dabbles in synthetics for tense Mission Impossible sneaking around scenes, and there's plentiful creepy Raptor runs (think of the Dementor stuff in 'Prisoner of Azkaban'), but the main theme is what really sells the soundtrack.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This is by far one of my top ten favorite albums of 2006. I enjoyed \\"Trouble\\" but it's nothing I listened to very often. Sun is definetly different for me. As soon as I heard the raw emotion from \\"Be Here Now\\" I was hooked. The entire CD is a masterpiece and a treat to listen to every time. It's seriously one of those CDs that you can just lay in bed and listen to on repeat for hours. \\"Lessoned Learned\\" is one of the major standouts on the CD but that's not to say it's the only hit. I really hope he picks up some awards for this.
0895260131|5.0|After reading this book I was compelled to share it with as many safety minded friends I could. This book takes great pains to differentiate from Muslims and Radical Muslims. It also corrects many of the popular misconceptions you may have about such age old topics as \\"Why Columbus went to America\\".  Read the book and do not fall into the trap of politcal correctness.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|There just isn't enough room to write about how amazing this CD is. Even some of the tracks I was a little iffy about (Waiting, Heart of Life) have become favorites. If you seriously do not own this you seriously have a major hole in your collection. Mayer knows damn well how to make music. This proves it.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I had decided to check out clerks cause i liked Jay and Silent Bob Striked Back, and i wanted to see where it all began. I started out thinking that it would be T and A humor like JASBSB but what i got was one of the funniest movies that i have seen in a while.  <br />   At first i had trouble getting into it because of the low quality of the film, but before i knew it i was sucked into their dialouge, and had spent a day at the quick stop, with Dante and Randall. <br />   What i think is as intresting as the dialouge, is the making of the movie. It was basically made by a couple of clerks filming in the store after closing hours. It gives Inspiration to wannabe filmmakers like me. <br />Clerks. 5/5
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I haven't seen a film I've enjoyed this much in a long time.  Very much like Wes Anderson's movies (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) it works on a number of different levels.  It's hilarious and heartwarming at the same time, without venturing into cheeseball/emo territory (like the reprehensible Garden State.)  It does what every great piece of art does: it gives you a greater appreciation for those around you and for life itself.  And it does so without being pretentious, heavy handed, or contrived.  That's not an easy thing to do.    The film follows the Hoover family on their cross country trip from Arizona (I think) to California.  The mission: take daughter Olive to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.  Hilarity and chaos then ensue.  Whenever the mood gets serious is usually when the biggest laughs are about to occur.  This deft balancing between laughs and seriousness is what makes this movie truly amazing.  The high points are some of the funniest moments you'll ever see in a movie. The dinner table scene; when the family gets pulled over; the beauty pageant...those scenes are transcendent comedy.  It will probably remind you of your own family in some ways as well.    The characters are all expertly crafted and portrayed.  All of these are people whom you are instantly familiar with.  They may be friends, co-workers, neighbors, family....I don't think there is a single character in the film that most won't make a one-to-one correlation with people they know in their own lives.  Maybe not specifically, but we all know people whose personalities are similar to those of the Hoovers, without question.  This is truly what a \\"family film\\" should be, despite the R rating.  I can't think of a movie I would more greatly recommend than this one.  Can't wait for the filmmakers' follow up.  If you haven't seen it, just buy it already.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Firefly concept is the peak of Science Fiction series TV, bar none. This crew; the cast, writers, music and set teams, everyone who had a hand in the making of this masterpiece helped make history. FOX network had the premiere of our genre and threw it away. Over a half-million people now know about Firefly and Serenity, and everyone who sees this wants it ON. AIR. NOW. If anyone who is reading these reviews is working for any TV network you will wake the hell up and get it back up and running. NOW.
B000ICM5IK|5.0|If you're enough of a fan to want the most memorable Rocky themes on a CD, but not enough of a fanatic to buy all the individual soundtracks, then this is the CD for you. <br /> <br />All the sound is remastered and is crisp and powerful sounding, and the flow of the mix is pretty good. A neat touch is the dialogue clips from various Rocky flicks being played before certain songs.  <br /> <br />My only complaint would be the inclusion of some of the weaker songs from the Rocky mythos like Adrian when they could have included some of the training music from Rocky or Rocky IV like Philedelphia Morning or Training Montage. <br /> <br />But, it's so minor a complaint I can't deduct a star for a mix CD that'll please any Rocky fan. To have Redemption, Rocky's Reward, and Eye of the Tiger on a single disc is just great.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|It seemed like a risky move. George Martin, the legendary Beatles producer, and his son Giles, teamed together to create a compilation of newly remixed Fab Four classics as well as some lesser known gems from their catalogue, and remix, remaster and combine these classics to make a brand new collection of The Beatles like you've never heard them before.<br /><br />It pays off flawlessly. \\"Love\\" is a masterpiece, and possibly the best album of the year. \\"Love\\" is truly an experience to listen to: it's a sirring, often scary, often fun and always magnificent album. Kicking off with the bird sound effects of \\"Across The Universe\\" mixed in with the chilling a capella tune \\"Because\\", we thewn journey through snippets of \\"Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"The End\\" before seguing into a fired up \\"Get Back\\" that is better than the original.<br /><br />The rest of the album is a sonic marvel. Did you ever think George Harrison's gorgeous ballad \\"Something\\" would weave so seamlessly into his haunting \\"Blue Jay Way\\"? Probably not, but man does it work. Other standouts include the medley of \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite / I Want You (She's So Heavy) / Helter Skleter\\", the reworked \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", and the stunning solo George performance of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" complete with a haunting string quartet.<br /><br />\\"Love\\" is a masterpiece. It's not only great for diehard fans, but it's also perfect for introducing The Beatles' music to a whole new generation of fans. I hae not watched the dvd, but I'm sure it's great. Still, the music is the main attraction here, and it's magical, to say the least.
B000BNNLN4|5.0|This book has won an award for comic fiction; but, richly comic though the writing is, the story is for the most part essentially a tragic one.  I am reminded of Horace Walpole's dictum, `This world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel.'  Nikolai, an 84-year old Ukrainian-born widower who has lived in England since 1946 as an escapee from Stalinist Russia, marries a much more recent immigrant from the now independent Ukraine:  Valentina, 36 years old, who is here on a visitor's visa and marries him only to be allowed permanent residence and to gain access to his money and his house.  She exploits and bullies the poor and near senile old man mercilessly.  His two daughters, Vera and Nadia, are outraged.  They have  fought with each other all their lives, and they still do; but they make common cause to try to rescue their father and what might be left of their inheritance.  In the course of the story we are given glimpses of the history of Ukraine, the terrible sufferings of the civil war, the  terror and the famine of the Stalin years, the Second World War, a labour camp; also of the development of tractors - those symbols of the collective farms, of which the old man, a former engineer, is writing a history.  Towards the end, the book becomes a near farce, and then modulates into a mellower ending than we had any reason to expect.  We are even allowed for a moment to see the monstrous gold-digger as herself a victim, too. The descriptions of the individuals and the relationships between them is excellent, the somewhat fractured English spoken by the old man and the  even more primitive but expressive mauling of it by Valentina is spot-on.  A memorable book.
1400079179|4.0|I came late to reading The Da Vinci Code, wondering what the hype was all about. Having read it, I still wonder. This is an enjoyable read, an exciting thriller, and nothing more. Those who criticize the shallowness of the characters ought to realize that this isn't Faulkner and wasn't meant to be. As far as the religious (or anti-religious) message, again, people should lighten up.<br /><br />All this became fully clear to me when I read Angels & Demons, Brown's earlier book, after I read The Da Vinci Code. The two books are incredibly similar, one might say formulaic. That doesn't detract from their power as thrillers, but it does tell me that the complex religious plots in Da Vinci are no more to be taken seriously than those in Angels. So what if the Priory of Sion doesn't really exist -- something similar occurred in Angels as well.<br /><br />Brown is a middling-to-good thriller writer who caught lightning in a bottle with the Da Vinci book as far as sales are concerned. But just because a book sells umpteen millions of copies, it doesn't become Dostoyevsky, Proust, or Dickens, and need not be treated as such.
B000E6ES8A|5.0|Elisha Cuthbert may not be the first \\"hot porn star/prostitute with a heart of gold\\" love story, but it certainly is one of the best.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|After listening to every Beatle track countless times I'm very grateful to have something that is both Beatles and NEW to listen to!  What a wonderful treat; what a gift!<br /><br />IF you can accept the concept of a Beatles musical montage, I don't see how such a thing could have been done much better.  Some would have wanted ALL the tracks mashed up. But to me clever, creative, even brilliant manipulations abound.  There are plenty of exciting and surprising juxtapositions to satisfy the craving for something new.  AND, just enough of the music is left relatively untouched to satisfy the craving to hear good old Beatle music presented in extraordinary new sound quality (The surround-sound experience from the DVD is simply breathtaking).<br /><br />Beatle music is concentrated stuff.  Those guys could pack as many great musical ideas into three minutes as anyone before or since.  In combining the brilliance of several songs into one, Love contains passages that manage to offer us music that is even more concentrated!  What a rush!!!<br /><br />One reason that music by composers such as Beethoven will never die is that each new generation of conductors can bring something new and different to those compositions.  This keeps even ancient compositions alive and current.  Love helps to keep Beatle music alive and current.<br /><br />It is clear to me that Beatle music as the Beatles originally released it is ultimately superior. But Love gives us something NEW! (No small thing by my way of thinking.) And Love represents yet another golden nugget added to the Beatles superlative catalogue.  There is nothing else like it.  It is a unique testament to some of the finest music of the 20th century.

B000002UAC|5.0|Okay, so it's utterly lightweight, and not a shred as innovative as the Beatles' later albums. Normally, things like that matter. However, the exception is With the Beatles. Why, you ask? Because it's loaded with thirteen solid pop-rock gems. Sure, the cover of Till There Was You was a bad idea, but that's it: originals It Won't Be Long; All I've Got to Do; All My Loving; Don't Bother Me (Harrison's first, and most underrated, composition) and Ringo's showcase I Wanna Be Your Man are loose, fun, joyful, and bound to stay in your head forever. And those covers, they friggin' rock. Roll Over Beethoven's been covered by everybody, but nobody (except, of course, Chuck Berry) did it like the Beatles; Money and You Really Got a Hold On Me are also stellar, the latter being my favorite song on the album. And on Devil in Her Heart and Please Mr. Postman, the boys pull off convincing girl-group impressions.<br /><br />Please Please Me gets most of the ink, but this is my favorite pre-Rubber Soul Beatles album - in my mind, Please Please Me had some great songs, and several rough places. With the Beatles for the most part smoothes those places up (Till There Was You being the exception). This one's bound to put a smile on your face!
B000068PQ7|5.0|It really is more like a dream than reality that Gene Clark could make an album like White Light then all but disappear from the annals of American pop music history without ever achieving mainstream success and recognition.  This record is my first non-Byrds introduction to Gene Clark (excepting a great cover of \\"Spanish Guitar\\" by Plainsong).  Let me tell you, it's a purchase I'm glad I made and I can't wait to pick up more of his music (the other best are [[ASIN:B00000JAYN The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark]] and [[ASIN:B0000ACY0Y No Other]]).<br /><br />White Light, in spite of its comparisons to Neil Young, Dylan, etc. surprised me--it's a quite laid-back affair.  At its heart it's an acoustic record--the lead electric guitar is clean and the songs are always driven by the acoustic rhythm guitar and the percussion is generally not the standard in-your-face rock kit drumming that usually accompanies folk rock.  Admittedly, the album's overall mood failed to grab my on first listen.  However, this isn't dime store pop--the merits of Gene Clark and White Light aren't in throwaway hooks that get old after one listen.<br /><br />Here's what makes the album classic for me: Clark's got a great voice.  It's not derivatively Dylan-esque like a lot of similar artists of the day.  Clark sings simply and evocatively, channeling the emotions of his songs in a really compelling way.  The songwriting is great--excellent, somewhat melancholy lyrics that are accessible but ambiguous enough to retain a bit of mystery.  Last, the arrangements are great.  The lead guitar may not be hardcore, but most every song has a great lead line (often slide guitar) that really accompanies the mood of the songs and is actually pretty gnarly from time to time (i.e. the opening line on \\"The Virgin\\" and the melodic counterpoint on \\"One in a Hundred\\").  Despite the album's overall mellow vibe, there's actually some pretty rocking numbers, like \\"White Light\\" and \\"1975,\\" in which the drums really kick in and the country bass starts to accent the beat in a harder way.  The only weakness here, in my opinions are the keyboards.  They're pretty much buried in the mix on most of the songs, making them less of a part of the band and more of a support for the mood.  I guess they do add to the record, but I wonder what they could have contributed if used in a more melody-oriented position.<br /><br />Some highlights for me are the desolate solo guitar and voice on \\"With Tomorrow,\\" the immediately accessible and haunting \\"Because of You,\\" and the cover of \\"Tears of Rage.\\"  Although it doesn't obviate Richard Manuel's  soulful, definitive take from [[ASIN:B00004W50T Music from Big Pink]], it's definitely well-chosen and a rocking reinterpretation that really works.  Really, though, all the songs on here are great and essential.  I can't pick out a track (bonus tracks excepted) that doesn't contain meaningful lyrics, memorable musical moments, and characteristics that don't set it apart from  the others.  I highly recommend White Light to fans of Dylan, Young, the Byrds, folk, folk rock etc., and also to fans of similar newer music.  Congratulations on finding one of the 70's best-kept musical secrets--I hope you take the opportunity to capitalize on your discovery!and the country bass starts to accent the beat in a harder way.

0061020680|4.0|There is a reason for the caps in the subject heading, but you will have to read the book to discover it.  The fourth Discworld installment is similar to the others in its wit and humor.  Terry Pratchett has a gift for using the pen to create humor.  The following is an example of the humor employed in this book, \\"Mort was interested in lots of things...there was the puzzle of why the sun came out during the day, instead of at night when the light would come in useful. He knew the standard explanation, which somehow didn't seem satisfying.\\"  A skilled humorist, it could also be said that the discworld books lack an interesting story.  No one combines sci-fi humor and plot better than Douglas Adams, and the discworld books aren't on par with Adams' standard, but the comedy level of this discworld book and the others meet or exceed that of Adams' books.<br /><br />This story is different from the others in that many new characters are introduced.  The main character (death's apprentice) is new.  The main character's boss, death, has only made a few short appearances in the past Discworld books.  The likable main character from the first two books, Rincewind, makes a short appearance, but the majority of the characters are brand new.  These characters, and most of the characters created by Pratchett, are developed well.  The imagination can swirl around these characters in a way that makes the reader eager to discover the next page.  Summed up, this book is great in its character development and humor but it maybe lacks in the plot development department.
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|While I loved the original \\"Legend\\" with the Tangerine Dream score, this version of the movie caused me to drive straight back to Borders (where I got it) and demand my money back. There are scenes that are changed, missing, or added that were not apart of the American version I grew up with and fell in love with.<br /><br />This DVD doesn't even give you the option of watching the American version- and nowhere on the cover does it state that it's the Director's Cut only. Had I known that there WERE even two versions of the movie out there, I wouldn't have even bought the DVD in the first place.<br /><br />\\"Legend,\\" as was stated before, is an amazing movie. I suggest you own it- but not this version.
B00005JOLI|1.0|I admit that I considered the Eragon books to be entertaining, albeit a bit derivative. They had a certain charm to them about a young lad thrust into events far larger than he could comprehend. However I was disappointed to hear that when Christopher Paolini agreed to let his books become movies he gave up any chance of vetoing any changes that the studio may make. <br /> <br />The result was that the script writers took the rough outline of Star Wars: A New Hope, changed a few names here and there, and titled it Eragon. The end result was a storyline that felt rushed, a plot that wasn't even developed, sets and make-up that look like they hired the cheapest provider, a script that sounded like a 7th grader's creative writing project, and a painfully small number of extras needed for scenes that required more than 10 people on set. <br /> <br />The end result was a film that was painful to see, and felt like a total waste of time. My fiancee, who is an Eragon devotee, felt that they had butchered the whole story just so they could churn it out to make a quick buck from the popularity of the series. <br /> <br />If you want to experiance Eragon, read the book, it's much more involved and doesn't look like a professional script butcherer has mutilated it.  <br /> <br />Frankly, this film looks like a Uwe Boll project with a better budget.

B000006IUQ|5.0|I may like the untactically-named The Edge for the wrong or right reasons. Be it wrong or right, whatever these reasons are, they have yielded powerful results. This is a movie that has practically dominated me for over ten years now. It scares me still to think of it; it yields such a powerful, personal, emotional impact that I definitely think twice before watching. This may sound misleading, as it implies that the movie as a whole moves me. But it doesn't. As a matter of fact, aside from the main factors that make me like this survival thriller very much, which I shall get to in a moment, the movie feels too 'slow'. It lacks a balance - because the opposite end of that scale is heavy as a set of weights.<br /><br />What have we here? This certainly unique Lee Tamahori picture, script written by David Mamet, centres around two diverse personalities; multi-millionaire Charles Morse and fashion photographer Robert Green. Charles (Anthony Hopkins) is a rather secluded, awkwardly philosophical tycoon, married to fashion model Mickey (Elle Macpherson), while Robert (Alec Baldwin) is an ambitious while rather short-tempered man who's not all what he seems. The two find themselves in the Alaskan wilderness, staying with a darkly philosophical cabin keeper. When Charles and Robert go with assistant photographer Stephen (Harold Perrineau) to take a session with a local hunter, their plane crashes and they are the only survivors, with nothing to rely on for survival but one another. Charles, being the clear-thinking one, assumes the role of leader, and throughout the film, especially after Stephen dies, his and Robert's personalities clash, climaxing in their ultimate confrontation towards the end of the film.<br /><br />Interesting as it sounds, this dominating plot element would in my opinion have been more gripping had the pace been fixed. True, one extremely positive aspect about The Edge is the breathtakingly beautiful vista of the Alaskan wilderness, excellently captured by New Zealander Lee Tamahori. Still, it seems he sometimes went overboard with the vista and the result is an overload of scenes where the characters just walk and converse. I like interesting dialogue, but the tension seems to get lost in-between these drawn-out scenes.<br /><br />So far, not so good, you may deduce. It doesn't sound as though I like this movie at all. Why do I give it a full house? As I said, I like The Edge for personal reasons, and possibly the reasons most people will remember this movie for. Those are the riveting and almost achingly haunting highlights of this movie; the encounters with the bear.<br /><br />Excellently acted by the already humbling Bart the Bear, late bear actor extraordinaire, an enormous Kodiak bear becomes an ever-present threat to the party of three (and eventually two). The bear, who has a great liking for human flesh (Hollywood logic but all for the benefit of this film), relentlessly pursues them, eventually plunging the main characters into despair and hopelessness, as he is more than a match for all of them. It is thanks to this bear that the movie gets a rush of blood into it.<br /><br />Even though it may sound like it, this is not the typical animal-attack clich&eacute; so many B-movies are made of. None of the bear scenes, extreme though all are, cross the line as overdone. They all feel extremely believable, which makes them really chilling. \\"Savage\\" is definitely the word for them, and yet the bear doesn't come across as a mindless killer. His intelligence is heavily underlined, which is important, because without a sense of kinship, no sense of thrill would be aroused. The Kodiak bear's great liking for human flesh is informed to the audience by the cabin keeper before all of this takes place, and is a vital piece of information to lay the foundation for, as well as strengthen the intensity of, the encounters with the bear.<br /><br />The bear only appears four times during the course of this two-hour flick, and he makes you forgive its drawn-out pace. The first time when he appears, coming across the main characters in the forest and immediately setting his eye on them, his presence is immediately registered upon the viewer. Lee Tamahori has every reason to be proud of Bart the bear, going so far as calling him \\"the John Wayne of bear actors\\". Bart comes across astonishingly realistic in the role of the fierce bear. Each shot serves its purpose; the acting, the movements and sounds Bart makes are all perfect. In the shot where the bear roars and attempts to strike Charles with his paw, foaming, I got the first real sense that \\"Whoah, this bear means business.\\" No bear acting or perhaps animal acting as a whole has been this spot-on, in my opinon.<br /><br />Despite the often quite brutal scenes, beauty is almost ever present. This is even true for the second of the bear's appearances, which may be one of the most hair-raising pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen. If Lee Tamahori's reputation of being able to capture both beauty and brutality at the same time ever takes off during this film, this is where. The bear attacks the wounded Stephen during a thunderstorm, and despite valiant attempts made by Charles to stop him, the bear succeeds, almost effortlessly, in killing the helpless photographer. The bear is so frighteningly strong and Stephen's sheer terror so believable (Perrineau should have been nominated for an Oscar; I have never seen such terror radiate from a man's face in a film before or since) that I cannot keep my heart from racing during those few minutes the attack lasts before it's all over. Yet, and amazingly, the entire scene is astonishingly beautiful, extremely brutal as it is, so one is left torn over what one should be left feeling.<br /><br />The bear's surprise re-appearance later couldn't have been more spot-on, in my opinion. The way he just stands and growls at Charles, before taking off after him, is one of those movie moments that will haunt me forever. And then when he appears for the last time, in a deadly confrontation between him and the remaining two survivors, his threatening presence is absolutely perfect.<br /><br />Where would this movie be without the bear? I don't know; I never bother to watch any other part of it but Bart's scenes. Apart from the bear, the movie is too slow even for my liking, consisting of too much open space and too long stretches of time where nothing happens. Still, because eventually something does happen, and very much so, it can be forgiving. The bear becomes someone you wait for during the entire movie; a villain you root for. Still, despite his villainous role, I for one like him very much. That's typical of especially cartoon villains, who seduce you with their charisma. The bear certainly possesses charisma, no doubt about that. And it is only this charisma, in my opinion, which keeps one from feeling a sense of waste after watching The Edge. If you want to see possibly the best bear acting ever caught on film (Bart should have received an award for it), by all means see this. Just don't except much else.irst time when he appears, coming across the main characters in the forest and immediately setting his eye on them, his presence is immediately registered upon the viewer.

If you want to see possibly the best bear acting ever caught on film (Bart should have received an award for it), by all means see this. Just don't except much else.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|The Greatest Rock concert band of all time is bringing a DVD collection of their earliest performances, a collection of never before seen footage, full concerts & TV appearances from 1974-1977, It's the must have KISS fan DVD. Featuring audio commentary by Gene Simmons & Paul Stanley.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I have bought or downloaded most of this on VHS, DVD or digital over the years.  I'm glad Gene finally got off his AZZ to release this.  I can't wait until the future volumes.  Not much needs to be said.  Overall, great sound and picture for the time frame.  Make sure to look for the easter eggs.  The Ace wedding footage is \\"Classic\\".
0061150142|3.0|I love Jodi's books.  She has a penchant for picking a very controversial topic, exploring it from several different viewpoints through her characters, and oh that unexpected twist ending!  Of all her novels (I think I have read maybe six) this was by far my least favorite.  Maybe it was the general theme, the fact that the characters just seemed to be either overly angry or horny all the time, or this plot a little underdeveloped. Usually I can't put her guilty pleasure books down, but this was a bit of s struggle to get through.  Just my two cents.  I far prefer \\"My sister's keeper\\" and \\"Plain truth.\\"
B00007AJF9|5.0|The acting in this movie is superb, and I think that Cate Blanchett portrayal of Queen Elizabeth is the best I've seen.  Yes, this movie does have a few historical errors, but overall, this movie is really worth watching!
B000I2J2W2|5.0|The restored HD-DVD Forbidden Planet is simply beautiful. <br /> <br />The space shots of the ship are incredible with each star visible.  <br /> <br />The planet surface backdrops are finely detailed and quite realistic. Special effects hold up well with the id monster's attack on the ship looking more real than ever. <br /> <br />Morbius's home is finished in fine granites and woods. <br /> <br />All details never before seen outside the original 1956 big theater prints. <br /> <br />This is an well-done HD disc, as well as a classic must-have movie for any collection.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I admit to being a bit biased about this film.  After all, it has been in postproduction for the past 25 years!  It was worth the wait for me.  Christopher Reeve proves his worth as an actor in the charming and thrilling action film. Margot Kidder brings incredible spunk and humor to Lois Lane, who finds herself in a relationship with the man of steel.  She is superb and reminds us all why she was so good in the part-somehow she an Christopher Reeve balance each other so beautifully, and their chemistry is palpable.  Gene Hackman is quite simply, my favorite actor, and although his part in this film is not large, he is just great in every scene.  The only real qualms I have with the film are the problems with continuity (which are understandable considering its history), and the fact that in this version, there are certain conflicts with the other films in the series.  Taken on its own merits, this is a great film, and all of us who love Superman owe Richard Donner a big thank you for all of his work to make this project a reality!
0553062182|5.0|I enjoyed and learned from this book. I also think that the whole idea of a 'highly sensitive type' is an interesting way of helping many of us understand anew our own self and reality. Aron's explanation of the way this type of person is traditionally devalued in American and Western schools was interesting. She claims that there is a study showing that Chinese children are valued precisely for the kind of 'inward sensitivity and shyness' that our traditionally condemned in Western schools.<br /><br />Her aim is of course to help and encourage the highly sensitive person. She says that this type of person has traditionally been the 'advisor' of those in power. She has an interesting riff on the idea that the valuing of the counter- aggressive type comes from the kind of culture brought with them by the steppe-nomads who in conquering Europe gave it a fierce militant outlook.<br /><br />What I most appreciated was that the analysis made me better understand certain highly sensitive people I know. These are people who hate crowds and noise, do not want to fiercely compete with anyone, are not aggressive. They are the good and obedient people who ordinarily suffer greatly from the rudeness, inconsiderateness of those with the strong elbows. I doubt that many politicians are highly sensitive people.<br /><br />Aron estimates that twenty percent of the population fall into this category. She again points out that these people usually make an exceptional contribution in terms of their creativity, and ability to focus on work in depth.<br /><br />Her work in a sense provides a kind of support group for those who have felt isolated and depressed in their own sensitivity.<br /><br />This is a fine and insightful work, and is highly recommended especially for the highly sensitive reader.
B000L43AN4|5.0|What an absolute masterpiece.  While all three discs are excellent, I'm partial to Tom's (we are on a first name basis) ballads, and the Bawlers disc contains some of the most achingly beautiful songs he has ever done.  I'm too lazy :-) to review all of the tracks, but just take my advice . . . buy the CD!  You will be happy you did.  Happy New Year!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I am a lover of all types of music.  When flipping through the channels of the TV one night I came upon the PBS airing of Celtic Woman.  I was immediately captured by the celtic music and the beautiful voices of all of the women in the production.  I think that the Celtic Woman show has been one of the best kept secrets in the music world.  I immediately ordered four of their CD's and DVD's.  The addition of Haley to the program has really improved the show in my opinion.  By the time the show was over, I was in love with all of the women in the production.  If you like angelic voices, unbelievable harmony, and a wonderful variety of traditional and classical songs, you will absolutely love their DVD.
B000GYHVFC|3.0|This is visually one of the best movies I've ever seen. The director, Karyn Kusama, whom I never heard of before, did a great job of visual composition. The photography is also exquisite. Too bad the story and the plot are kind of weak. Charlize Theron does a very credible job as an action hero, but lets face it, this movie is all about looking great in tights and not about great acting.  She definetely got the \\"looking great\\" aspect right. Of the HD DVD's I've watched so far, only King Kong matches it for color depth and detail. The Berlin and Potsdam locations shine thru. Those lucky enough to have visited this amazing city know how many more achitectural marvels await to be exploited in film. If you enjoy eye candy and can appreciate the beauty of architecture, then this film is for you.
B000003S5H|4.0|When I bought this CD three years ago, I was astounded by the slowness and smoothness of the tracks - I hadn't heard anything like it before. These days, after becoming familiar with the likes of Zero 7 and Massive Attack (trip-hop), the vocals on Moon Safari detract from my enjoyment of the CD overall. <br /> <br />Still, \\"La Femme D'Argent\\" and \\"Le Voyage De Penelope\\" are among my favorite tracks of any genre, and \\"You Make It Easy\\" is a great romantic song. On the whole, I'm very glad I own this CD and although it's not for everyone, I recommend it to those of you looking to discover new genres or expand your collection of chillout music.
B00005AQF7|5.0|The put rap music in the main stream with super producer/writer/rapper Dr. Dre.  Nothing else can be said about cd other then it is perfect.
B000L43AN4|5.0|In a word, I would describe Orpans as 'amazing'. With a composition style that matches his voice, however, Waits puts together a compendium of work that isn't for everyone. Let me clarify what I mean: I don't believe that there is a such thing as a casual Tom Waits fan. You either love him or you loathe him. Outside of a couple of songs that have made movie soundtrack appearances, and a cover version of his work done by Rod Stewart, there isn't too much that he has put out that garners a whole lot of commercial exposure. An unfamiliar buyer would probably not pick this up. So far as \\"fans\\" who may be critical, what else would you expect? If you were expecting a perfect flow, or Easy Listening, then of course you will be disappointed. But, then, you probably aren't familiar enough with Waits to be able to appreciate what he does here. <br /> <br />What has he done? Assembled an incredible array of style and poetry that may be unparalleled by anything, save perhaps the Beatles White Album. It is not really possible to describe the range of Orphans without writing a dissertation, so I won't attempt to. I will say this: go with your gut. If you are a true fan of Tom Waits, then buy it immediately (...if you haven't already). You will not be disappointed. If you are new to Waits but are interested in his work, then I would recommend Raindogs or Swordfishtrombone as a better starting point. If you are someone who would describe yourself as a fan of conventional melodies and songwriting, who has never heard of Tom Waits, but has just heard a song that you liked on a college radio station, then I would advise you to stay away from this.
B000E97X66|4.0|This is a treasure -- Springsteen in London, staring down the hype over Born to Run and giving a two-hour show that is heartstopping and breathtaking.  His band has never sounded better, Bob Clearmountain's sonic magic teases out every piano run, every Max W. footstomp, every Little Stevie lick, and every growl, yell, and whisper of the Boss, clearly enjoying himself as he takes his band through an incredible setlist.<br /><br />Although every track is indispensible, I want to comment on the excellent pacing of this set -- Bruce clearly understands the long-form pacing of a great rock concert, as this show starts slow, builds, reaches several near-climaxes, takes a few breaks, then gloriously and joyously streaks down the homestretch.  There are too many highlights to mention in a single post, so I'll just say to even casual Bruce fans, or fans of mostly his earlier material -- this is a must have and an enduring example of how to put on a great rock show.  Bravo for bringing this one out of the vaults.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Easily one of the greatest \\"love\\" stories put to film. Fantastic ensemble cast. If you don't like this movie, something is wrong with you. Just sit back and enjoy.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|From the very opening of the movie, where the protagonist is holding a man over the side of the building, to the cilmax where everything fall into place, the movie takes you on an intense and emotional ride as a man tries to figure out why he was imprisoned for fifteen years. The cinematogprahy is beautiful. Park Chanwook is an excellent directer.  <br /> <br />The movie also contains a fight scene that leaves you speachless, as the protagonist fights his way through a team of foes in a narrow hallway. The camera follow him from the side as he goes back and forth trying to get to the end. Where most movies like the Matrix or Kill Bill show one man fighting a ton in a slow motion or with crazy effects just to look cool, Oldboy does it in real time, and the fighting looks real. You feel the slow agaony of the scene as it plays out.  <br /> <br />The film is suspencefull and full of mystery. You won't find many other films like this... asie from the rest of the trilogy this is a part of. (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance proceeds the movie, and Lady Vengeance follows.) Definately check this out.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. Just for the clothing designs alone by the legendary Edith Head, its a must see. The decor is amazing. Its like the Addams Family. Gloria Swanson is the perfect narcissistic diva in this film. After all those references to William Holden in the I love Lucy series, you can see in this movie what made Bill Holden such a heart throb. If youre from L.A. like I am, you will really appreciate the shots of a traffic-less sunset blvd and the old shots of the Paramount lot. Its really a wonderful story and you can watch it again and again.
B000IU3Y3W|4.0|The point of the DVD in this package is that it is high resolution audio but, unfortunately, not DVD-Audio (thus it won't play in the DVD-Audio player in my car).  To be annoyed that no \\"video\\" is included is a demonstration of the ignorance of high-resolution audio that is frequently displayed by the mp3 generation.

1593072937|5.0|I'd hate to see into the mind of Frank Miller. The place of Sin City is beyond dark, beyond grim.  Miller's illustrations are meant to come out of a nightmare.  The dialogue, as told in first-person by Marv, is gritty and exceptionally disturbing.  Everything about this is a living death.  Miller, unlike Alan Moore, relies on action, atmosphere and grit. Moore relies on thought, analysis and provocation -- two very different and very effective styles.  Where Moore acts like a scholar, Miller wants to keep you awake at night.  Everything is in your face.  The characters punch through the page, the dialogue is quick, blunt, ominous, and the plot is always filled with larger than \\"death\\" creatures.  <br />  Miller is brilliant in this novel and it is NOT for the faint of heart. The mixture of a detective novel interplayed with stunning graphic layouts is like nothing I have ever seen in my life. I can't imagine this being made into a film but I have not seen it.  If anyone ever tells you that Graphic novels are comics, have them read this (or any Alan Moore) for a tamer version.
0380789035|5.0|I have never been a reader of fantasy stories. I like Science Fiction, tending toward writers like John Varley and Neil Stephenson. Guys who write about technology and society in ways that become almost believable when fleshed out with large doses of detail and talented writing.<br /><br />My daughter is a big Neil Gaiman fan though, so I took along an audio book of \\"American Gods\\" on a long driving vacation this year. My wife and I started listening and it soon got too weird for us. We decided to listen to something else instead.<br /><br />But soon, we both said, I wonder how Shadow is doing now? We were willing to go back into the `weird' to find out because Shadow's character had already hooked us. He was just too good to abandon.<br /><br />Like all modern books seem to be, this one is written as a bunch of threads that seem to have nothing to do with each other and are then gradually woven together sometime much later on. The weirdness of some of these threads was what originally turned us off, because you don't know, early on, whether the worst of them is the main direction of the whole book. Fortunately, the threads come together into something that makes sense and the process gets more understandable and worthwhile as you go.<br /><br />Gaiman's Gods have power that is finite and follows a kind of internal logic, which makes it not so different from Science Fiction. Here the emphasis is often on how this power is created and maintained, the dirty underbelly of supernatural power.<br /><br />So, I have to say that Gaiman, writes about supernatural power and society in ways that become almost believable when fleshed out with large doses of detail and talented writing.
0743289412|5.0|What can I say? This is King's finest work to date and he's done some mighty fine stuff over the years.  He has an awesome ability to put us in a feeling place, cut to the core of the human experience, and get us in touch with our true nature: the shadow self as well as the side we show the world.  He's done this to perfection in Lisey's Story.  I read this in one long indulgent weekend as I could not put it down. King transcends mere horror and reaches deep into the land of grief, creativity, and the nature of love.<br /><br />Lisey, the widow of a famous popular author finally undertakes to deal with her late husband's study full of papers, mementoes, and tangible reminders of their quarter-century together. Entering the sanctum sanctorum triggers a flood of memories and then, in typical King fashion, reality twists to show us an alternate universe: Boo'ya Moon: to where Scott, Lisey, and others are able to transport when they change their vibration.  What happens at Boo'ya Moon is best left for you to find out. Suffice it to say that it is simultaneously the creative wellspring and the destroyer. Yin and Yang. The balance that contains the energetic force of all that is.<br /><br />Some speculate that this tale rises from King's brush with death back in 1999 when he was struck by a van on a remote Maine road. Trauma and subsequent pneumonia, it is reported, brought him to the brink of death. Could this be King's musings on mortality? King is quick to point out that he is not hero Scott Landon, and Lisey is not Tabitha King, his wife.  Still, this could be delicate homage; a sideways tribute to his lifemate. King himself has said that writer's spouses often don't get credit due, but are quick to get the blame. And the book is dedicated \\"For Tabby\\".<br /><br />King's marital patois (`bools' for treasure hunts and karmic retribution; `incunks' for ill motivated academics; `strap on whenever it seems appropriate' for summoning moxie) is bound to rapidly become part of the American lexicon.  One can only muse on whether King indeed visted Boo'ya Moon during his recovery, and from that misty pool netted a magnificent story that will endure for a long, long, time. Bravo, maestro.One can only muse on whether King indeed visted Boo'ya Moon during his recovery, and from that misty pool netted a magnificent story that will endure for a long, long, time.

B00000DD1S|5.0|This along with spiritual unity and vibrations are some of the best recordings in the history of jazz.  Live in Greenwich is the best example of this phase his development and has the perfect ballance between orchestrated themes and ferocious avant jazz interplay.  This is trully a masterpiece of american music.
6305537321|5.0|We all have dreams of such a place, and Holly Golightly's is Tiffany's.  Her new neighbor Paul, an author with writer's block, is drawn into Holly's world of partying but sees that there's really no glitter behind the seeming glamour. Circumstances dash their dreams - and can love penetrate the prisons they've built around themselves?<br /><br />This movie, despite its age, evades \\"Dated\\" and can be thoroughly enjoyed by younger, modern audiences. There's a bit of us in the former country girl with dreams of making enough money for a real home with her brother, and for a couple of hours our dreams can come true with Holly's. Highly recommend.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I ordered this CD simply to add a little variety to my eclectic Christmas collection? I never owned anything recorded by Sarah McLachlan before, wasn't a fan. Just thought she had an interesting sound when sampling Amazon's current offerings. Since that time, this has become my favorite Christmas CD of all time. Every time I put Wintersong on, I feel drawn away to a solitary place. Her music imparts a highly intimate feel, delivers a spiritual resonance, a feeling of the true Christmas. It's soulful, it's reflective. It's refreshingly orginal, unlike a lot of other Christmas music. This is a masterfully chosen compilation of songs that are superbly balanced. I especially like McLachlan's River; it's simple and perfect, perhaps better than Joni Mitchell's original version, which is saying a lot. I would buy this product for that song alone. Then there's Song for a Winter's Night, which showcases amazingly pristine harmonies. You might actually feel a tingle or two down your spine. I have become addicted to her sound; and yet, each listen brings newer delights. In the Bleak Midwinter reveals hauntingly beautiful vocals. The musical arrangements on this CD are incredibly fresh and surprising. MaLachlan's piano accompaniment is unrivaled. The Christmas standards likewise have a unique, completely original sound. Listen to the Persian sounds in The First Noel and you will see wht I mean. Perfect for reflection, a romantic evening for two, for a gathering of any size. Buy one for yourself and one for a friend. You will not be disappointed.
B000FDFVZ6|3.0|An absorbing first half, a pitiful second half. Sebold demonstrates an exceptional ability to get in the heads of her characters and develop them: the gradual maturation of her sister, the slow torment of her father and, best of all, the banality of George Harvey.    **Spoilers** But then Sebold seemingly didn't know how to finish it, and concocted a happy ending: Suzie finally makes love to her boyfriend - in the body of her lesbian best friend! Yuck; Mr. Harvey gets his comeuppance from a falling icicle dropped by Suzie from above - cheap irony and facile justice. Ughh.    Sebold exercises such restraint in the first half of her book I wonder if her editor said to her, \\"Alice, we need a happy ending for this thing to sell.\\" If so, it's a crying shame.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It was so good on TV I had to stop watching it there and buy the CD set to finish the series with the best of time and focus. Thank you cast and writers!!!  Appreciatively, James
B00005JOCU|4.0|I finally got a chance to see this film after much hype and great expectations.  \\"Dream Girls\\" is certainly one of the most entertaining films that I've seen in 2006.  The film depicts the life of three highly talented women in search of a break in the music industry.  With a star studded cast representing a collage of the experiences of many African American performers of old, \\"Dream Girls\\" is a musical that rocks, pops and rolls.  Yet, for all the originality in song writing and costume, the film lacks originality in nearly everything else.  It's often said that there are no new stories, the talent lies in being able to tell it originally.  There has been great buzz about the Oscar potential of this film but I simply don't see it.  There were no extraordinary performances by the cast.  Although the cast delivered good performances they weren't stretched much do so.  Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles sang exceptionally, but they are singer so there's no real stretch to do that.  When in an acting role, reciting lines and establishing presence on stage in character, Beyonce is simply average.  Although Eddie Murphy was highly entertaining as James Early, he is also a singer and entertainer and wasn't stretched much in the role (actually, I couldn't see him as anyone other than Eddie Murphy).  Jennifer Hudson, the neophyte of the troupe was by far the most convincing performance in the film although Tony award winning Anika Noni Rose did a superb job.<br /><br />I'm recommending this film for its entertainment value.  You'll snap your fingers, bob your head and pat your feet throughout the film.  Jennifer Hudson's soulfully gut wrenching rendition of \\"  . . . I'm Not Going\\", moved the audience to applauds and cheers and the neatly wrapped way in which the film ends will leave you heart happy but this is not an Oscar winning film in my opinion, unless Hudson get the award for her supporting role.  Enjoy!
B00005AREQ|5.0|No need to describe the songs, others have done it pretty well already. I just wanted to add my comments - the music on this album is sophisticated, soulful, cool, progressive, reflective, slick, funky and atmospheric. What more is there to add? Don't be without it!
0141439580|2.0|Reading this novel was slow going.  As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them.  The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered.  There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing.  Not one of Jane Austen's best.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|Quite simply, My Chemical Romance's \\"The Black Parade\\" is my favorite album of 2006. Mix the gloom of the Smashing Pumpkins with the bombastic orchestration of Queen and the end result would most certainly be \\"The Black Parade\\".  <br />I was initially drawn to this CD because of the lead single, \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\", and I was more than pleasantly surprised to hear that the remainder of the album was just as good, if not better than its first single. \\"Teenagers\\" is a sing-along emo-punk tune in the vein of The Offspring's \\"Why Don't You Get a Job\\" and \\"Disenchanted\\" could give any well-crafted Green Day ballad a run for its money. All of the songs interlock together to create a concept album about death, despair, and disillusionment. Surprisingly, the album toys with, but never resigns itself to hopelessness, and Gerard Way declares on the final track, \\"Famous Last Words\\" that he's \\"not afraid to keep on living\\". Thank goodness for that, because, MCR's \\"The Black Parade\\", manages to inject vitality into the pop music landscape despite its grim subject nature.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|I cannot but rise my voice and join it to those who critically reviewed this album.<br /><br />I strongly loved the first solo album and when reading a new one was going to be released in the late 2006 I was really expecting such a mix of good songs following the success of LAMB.<br /><br />So disappointed. When I firstly heard the Wordi it Up single (with some friends) we all remained astonished!! What is that?!??! The new Heide cartoon soundtrack or what??? I said to myself, listen to the album more than a couple of times and give it more chances. Well, at the end I can say I only like Wonderful Life. No way out for the other tracks. What is that? a mix of beats and R&B...but no melodies, no disco sound as in LAMB. What a delusion.<br /><br />Consider I am a DJ her ein Rome and I loooove to play Gwen during the dancing parties but....I am not gonna use any of the tracks of the last album...who'd dance it???<br /><br />Such a shame. A missed chance.<br /><br />Enrico
B00003JRCQ|5.0|It is not the greatest in terms of filming, but the acting is good and for what they could do, they did well. Of course, the book is excellent. Another rainy day movie fix!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I must respectfully disagree with some of my fellow reviewers and say that you do not under any circumstance need to have seen the short lived television series `Firefly' to enjoy, or understand its feature film continuation `Serenity'. I was never a huge fan of `Buffy the Vampire Slayer' but I had always heard great things about all of the Joss Whedon penned series, and since `Firefly' was canceled so quickly I never got a chance to sample it either. However, when I signed up for one of the on-line video rental services, I added `Serenity' to my queue. It arrived, and with little expectation I popped it in the old DVD player and sat down for what I thought would be your typical run of the mill sci-fi / action movie. I was hooked from the opening sequence, and decided by the time the movie was over that I had to own it. Not only do I own my own DVD copy, I also stop to watch it every time it shows up on cable. Obviously, I don't expect you to enjoy it as much as I did, but please don't be scared off by the sci-fi premise. It is not a typical CGI, special effects laden movie, this is a rarity in Hollywood these days; an actual story, with deep, meaningful characters that you really care about. <br /> <br />Serenity is the name of a decaying freighter, home to Captain Malcolm (Mal) Reynolds and his peculiar crew comprised of a faithful soldier, her pilot husband, a mechanic, a ruthless mercenary, a doctor and his traumatized sister, one of whom carries a secret that will cost them all dearly. As the Captain and crew attempt to avoid detection from the oppressive government know as the Alliance, a government agent known only as an Operative has been dispatched to recover this secret or cover it up, and he will stop at nothing to complete his mission. A deadly game of cat and mouse between the wily Captain Reynolds and the dangerous Operative ensues, and soon many innocent lives hang in the balance.  <br /> <br />What really makes this movie unique is not only the firstrate dialog (a Joss Whedon staple), but a plot that never becomes predictable. As the antihero, Captain Reynolds (played wonderfully by Nathan Fillion) seldom does anything you expect him to do, but always manages to make things interesting.  <br /> <br />As I said earlier, I had never seen the television show that inspired the motion picture, but after seeing `Serenity' multiple times, I did purchase the entire `Firefly\\" series, which I enjoyed as much if not even more than I did the movie. If you are an action/adventure fan I really think you will like this movie, and if you are even a fringe sci-fi fan, this is one you will want to check out. My wife, my 19 year old daughter, and my 7 year old son all loved this movie; I am guessing you will too. <br />
0062502182|1.0|I love inspirational, motivational books, but this was one of the worst books I have ever read. <br />The author beats a dead horse talking about having a Personal Legend- as if reading it once every chapter isn't enough, we sometimes have to read about it several times in several pages.   <br />The story has no flow, and was honestly difficult for me to read- I was expecting to zip thru this book in about 2 hours & instead it took me about 3 painful days to force myself to finish it to find out what wonderful things everyone was talking about.... <br /> <br />I guess I learned that if my dream was to write a book- I certainly could.  If this guy can sell 26 million copies so can I - that must be the lesson I got out of reading this piece of junk.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|I just wanted to clarify to potential buyers that the 3-disc version includes an entirely different set of special features than those included in the 2-disc version as well as a longer cut of the film. So if you are a die-hard fan, and willing, there is good reason to dish out $ for both versions. If you'd prefer only one version and are not interested in the special features, I recommend the extended cut as the scenes added back in are definately worth it.
B00005JOCU|5.0|\\"Dreamgirls\\" is far and away the best movie musical since the latest wave began with the enemic \\"Evita\\" several years back.  Pure entertainment, this is not a film for the deep thinking film afficianado.  However, for those who believe that a movie's first priority is to entertain, this is the real thing.  The two hours fly by with one spectacular song after another.  The story, supposedly based on the Supremes and Motown, is somewhat hackneyed at times as it covers classic \\"trials-and-tribulations\\" of \\"Show Business\\", but the performances are so uniformly astounding that they overcome this minor obstacle and make this a stirring experience.  From the first quadruple punch of four Motown-type performerances, energized to the max, you know you're in for a flashy ride.    This is the most complete rendition of the original Broadway score in existence and is vocally better in every way.  Jamie Foxx is the insidious promotor and he does not compromise his performance for likability.  But he's the slime who helps the \\"Dreams\\" reach their pinnacle, a needed fulcrum to the story.  Still, his cruelty is something to behold and, like Eddie Murphy, he surprises with a vocal expertise heretofore unexposed.  Murphy is the true surprise of the film, although Jennifer Hudson seems to be getting most of the press.  He's astounding, and he hits all of the right notes, dramatically, emotionally, and certainly vocally, where he sounds like the real thing.  Oscar should be paying close attention.    Then there is the classic triumvirate of Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose.  Knowles has received both kudos and slaps for her understated performance, but that's exactly how the character of Deena should be played.  She is the one character who truly grows in subtle shadings to the strong woman she has become in the film's energetic finale.  Knowles' charisma is undeniable throughout, and she reigns in her powerhouse voice for her Motown-like stylings, only to let loosein the astonishing \\"Listen\\".  When she is onscreen, you can't take your eyes off of her.  Her acting / singing talent demands attention.    Jennifer Hudson is a vocal delight throughout, though her tough characterization of Effie in the first half of the film comes off as a one-note, sassy and stubborn \\"broad\\" and it gets a bit tiresome.  However, by \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\", she hits her stride, displays Effie's vulnerability, and from that point on, she imbues her character not only with stubborness, but strength and dignity as well.  And the additional vocals, \\"I Am Changing\\", the \\"Dreamgirls\\" finale and \\"One Night Only\\" are some of the films many highlights.    Anika Noni Rose has a voice for the ages, and most of the back-up vocals benefit greatly from her range and expressiveness.  Her duet with Murphy on \\"Patience\\" is a truly exciting moment and the two performers connect emotionally in a stunning manner.  While not given the screen time of the other two \\"divas\\", she holds her own and proves that great things are in her future.    But everyone is at their best here, including director Bill Condon, who does a much better job here than in the massively overrated \\"Chicago\\".  He doesn't overdo the MTV style of quick cuts and allows his camera to hold on his actors to enable them to express their range of emotions.  And boy, does he make this film move.  \\"Dreamgirls\\" is top-knotch in every way.  Easily one of the best and most entertaining films of 2006.  And in some ways, a total surprise and a testament to the ongoing excellence of so many talented and underused African-American performers in the American film industry.
0440241588|4.0|The story is exciting.  And I think the pace was good.  Still, some of the plot seemed strained.<br /><br />I did not mind the descriptions of Italy and the Italian language lessons.  That's what Grisham wanted to write about, and it's as good a topic as any.<br /><br />One of the plot elements that looked marginal was the idea of having an armada of spy satellites that so few people knew much about.  There are issues with space junk and such that would quickly attract the interest of more than just a few highly security-cleared individuals.  But I'll let that go.<br /><br />There was, however, a silly typo that was so funny that I can't resist commenting on it.  In this book, there are some rather secret spy satellites around 300 miles above the Earth.  Well, that altitude is quite possible, especially for a work of fiction (I won't comment on whether it is ideal or not).  Now, how fast are these satellites moving?  This ought to be an easy question for anyone who has taken high school physics.  But Grisham made a minor error here, seeming to think that satellites can move at just about any speed they please, just as automobiles do on the highway.  In fact, satellites are pretty much in free fall around the Earth, and they can't choose to move at 120 miles per hour.  Instead, they move at well over 100 times that speed. A satellite's speed can be adjusted, but it takes quite a bit of propulsion to change it by a large amount.  If some objects were really moving at 120 miles per hour, it would be worth far more than a paltry few billion dollars to find out how.
B00062IDCO|5.0|I found these episodes well written and emotionally satisfying.<br /><br />The series ending is well-done, exciting, and just what we'd hoped for. The characters have been well developed, effects are great, and the crew make it home only with courage and self-sacrifice on the part of Janeway, Seven, and the rest.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|like anyone who knows anyone who even watches a little MTV i have heard this entire album entirely too many times.  Yes, it's better than their last batch of... songs?  but that really aint saying much.  And they're not the only ones out there.  Is this \\"new era\\" of music supposed to be this bad?  My god!
0385505833|5.0|With Skipping Christmas you'll get everything you'd ask for if you want to be entertained or just having a fun time while reading a book. John Grisham once again show me as a reader he's capabilities of being one of the most entertaining, smartest and at the same time easy-read authors that I know of. The best thing with this book is not only that it's entertaining, like most of his other books, but that it's full of humour and sarcasm throughout the whole book and it barely didn't leave me without laughter after reading a new page. A really good and entertaining story about a couple that decides to skip Christmas and the resistance and doubt they meet among their friends and neighbours.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a nice game.  I gave this to my 6 year old for Christmas.  Grandma and Grandpop even got into playing it.  One thing I like is it only takes 15-20 minutes to play one game. My 14 year old liked it too.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br />\\"Little Miss Sunshine is so funny it actually hurts. I was laughing so hard I was crying for most of the movie, its that good. That being said it is a fabulous drama. One of the best films of the year.\\" -- quote from fellow reviewer. <br /> <br />You people must not watch any good movies.  That is the only way I can explain it.  This is movie is 'ok' at best.  It isnt the best of 2006 or 2005 or any year for that matter.  It is just a sarcastic, dark comedy that has a laugh or two.  Actually, the actors weren't even meant to be funny, I guess.  I guess we are supposed to believe that this is how this family would really act and wasn't intended to be funny.  Nobody really cracked a honest smile except for Dad.  I had to fast forward through a lot of the scenes. <br /> <br />To be honest, in some of the scenes I felt kind of awkward, the scene between mom and dad at the hotel, dad dying, frank and that dude, the kid finding out about his eyes, the end of the beauty pageant?  Is this supposed to be funny?  I was expecting Steve Carell to give us something; in each one of his scenes, you almost expect him to take it a little further but NOPE he just kinds of stands there with a smirk.  Kinnear probably was the saving grace of the movie.  Except, he plays this same role in all of his films; so if you have seen it before, you may get tired of him here. <br /> <br />On the good side, it did kind of capture middle america pretty well.  Beauty pageants, family is almost bankrupt, family secretly hates each other but spend all their time together. <br /> <br />It is very similar to 'Squid and the Whale' and doesnt touch classics like 'The Royal Tenenbaums' or 'Rushmore'.  Don't let the reviewers spin it to be more than it is.  <br /> <br />Just trying to give you a real take on the movie.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|i just love starwars, what can i say?  if you liek the series this is a great buy, if not, then don't buy it.  simple and plain.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|The Donner Cut is probably one of the most significant Superman films to ever be released.   <br /> <br />The good stuff: All of Marlon Brando's footage and the cleverly edited screen test scene with the blanks. <br /> <br />The bad: The sound in some places is unnatural and obviously dubbed, the visual effects have that \\"direct-to-video\\" look to them, but otherwise aren't that bad. <br /> <br />All in all, Michael Thau has managed to deliver a good version of Superman II that we've been looking forward to for 25 years and Richard Donner has finally gotten his due for the Superman II that should have been.  This film is worth watching, even if you aren't a fan of Superman.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I, like so many others, am a huge fan of Gwen Stefani's solo debut, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. It has been one of my favorite guilty pleasures since the day I got it. Such a great, refeshing, fun pop sound. And when I heard she was working on her next solo record, naturally I was excited. I was also extremely curious as to what direction she would go in, because I had a hunch that Gwen wouldn't want to simply do another album that sounded exactly the same as its predecessor. I figured she wold branch out. Anyway, when I discovered the first single had dropped, \\"Wind It Up\\", I eagerly listened to it...and found myself in shock. Not the good kind either. In fact, by the time the chorus rolled around, I was actually covering my ears and I had to turn it off. After a while, after hearing the song on radio and seeing the video a couple of times, it began to grow on me. The first time I heard the entire album, I must say I was also disappointed. I thought a few tracks were incredible but as a whole, it seemed very bad, especially compared to the masterpiece that is L.A.M.B. However,  began listenng to it over and over, and just like \\"Wind It Up\\" did, it grew on me and now I love it. My point is, if you don't like this at first, give it time. You might find yourself loving it. I know I did. And I will without hesitation say it's better than the first. They're both very different, however. This record definitely has another sound and focus than L.A.M.B. Now a track-by-track review... <br /> <br />1.)Wind It Up-The first single. Like I said, I hated it at first, but hate has become love. Unique, awesome beats. Very catchy. <br /> <br />2.)The Sweet Escape featuring Akon-If I'm not mistaken, this has been announced as the second single. Very catchy and sugary-sweet, yet somewhat of a twist for Gwen. The chorus is vaguely reminiscent of the 80's. <br /> <br />3.)Orange County Girl-A simple hip/hop/pop song. Consists of a beat and piano. Very Brooke Hogan. I think this should bea single for sure. It's Hollaback Girl Part 2, in my opinion, only better. <br /> <br />4.)Early Winter-AMAZING song!! Gwen co-wrote this with Tim Rice-Oxley from the popular band Keane. It has an 80's indie feel to it. Emotional and powerful. The lyrics are good as well. \\"It's sad/a map of the world is on you/The moon gravitates around you/the seasons escape you.\\" Beautiful-one of my favorites. <br /> <br />5.)Now That You Got It-The only word that can appropriately describe this song, and I hate to say it because I think it's a stupid expression, is hot. Hot beat, catchy. The bridge is hilarious. This song also has the alarm sample used in songs like Beyonce's \\"Ring the Alarm.\\" But I think it works best in this song. Awesome track, all-in-all. <br /> <br />6.)4 in the Morning-Another highlight. An absolutely gorgeous song, co-written with fellow No Doubt-er Tony Kanal. Good beat, beautiful synths, beautiful chorus, just wow. Gwen has also said this is her favorite song on the album. It's easy to see why.  <br /> <br />7.)Yummy featuring Pharrell-Ok, I have NO idea why, but I absolutely LOVE this song! It's so fun and cute! Another unique beat, and the lyrics are so funny. Yes, it is mostly talking/rap with a few verses of singing, but I adore it. I can't seem to get tired of it or get it out of my head. Another fave. <br /> <br />8.)Fluorescent-I was surprised when I heard this, because it sounds like it could be on L.A.M.B. It's 80's Madonna/dance pop-esque. One of only three tracks that could have possibly been on the first album. I like it a lot. And I love the line, \\"and as I watch you sleep in the dimlight/I closemy eyes and pray/another fluorescent night/yeah, you and I.\\" <br /> <br />9.)Breakin' Up-Ok, like other reviewers, I didn't like this one either when I first heard it. It's your typical hip/hop R&B song, with a regular beat and piano. Yes, it is repetitive, but I love it. Very different for Gwen, although since it's co-written with Pharrell, I guessit shouldn't surprise me so much. Like \\"Yummy,\\" this is another song that I LOVE and I'm not sure why. Another favorite. <br /> <br />10.)Don't Get It Twisted-This song is so creative and inventive. The chorus is bouncy but not typical at all. I'd say this is the \\"Serious\\" of The Sweet Escape.  <br /> <br />11.)U Started It-Like \\"Fluorescent\\", this track could also have been on L.A.M.B. It combines 80's pop with a bit of a soul/Neptunes sound. Good. Although Pharrell's part in this song seems a bit unneccessary. Just let Gwen sing, ok, \\"P?\\" <br /> <br />12.)Wonderful Life-Ohhh...this song is SOOOOO AMAZING!!! Another favorite. This could also have possibly been on L.A.M.B., although it's much better than anything from that record. Co-written with Linda Perry, it's kind of 80's electropop and the song has a dark, bittersweet, longing feel to it. It's as if Gwen is struggling through the ennui and darkness that threatens to drag her down to sing, \\"It's a wonderful, wonderful life.\\" If only singing it could make it so. <br /> <br />I'm sorry this review is so long-winded, but I think this album is great and contrary to what everyone else seems to believe, Gwen did a great job. The Sweet Escape is NO sophomore slump. Give it a fair chance and if you truly liked Gwen's music before, there's no reason why you won't like this record. <br /> <br />PUT ON REPEAT: <br />Wind It Up <br />Early Winter <br />4 in the Morning <br />Yummy <br />Breakin' Up <br />Wonderful Life  <br /> <br />PUSH THE BACK BUTTON: <br />The Sweet Escape <br />Orange County Girl <br />Now That You Got It <br />Fluorescent <br />Don't Get It Twisted <br />U Started It <br /> <br />PUSH THE SKIP BUTTON: <br />None!
1884822312|5.0|I had the firm objective of solving all puzzles in this book, to improve my chess tactics skills. <br /> <br />As I progressed through the puzzles, I could definitely see improvements, to the point of reaching average solving times of 5 to 20 seconds. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, at about #1450, the book switches to puzzles that seem to be taken from newspaper columns (the author and year of publication is given for each one), and the level of difficulty rises by a huge amount. My average solving times fell to 20 to 30 minutes, if I was lucky to spot the solution at all! <br /> <br />Another problem I see with this book is that it contains only checkmate puzzles. It would be nice to have tactics leading to material gains, which are much more frequent in chess games. <br /> <br />
B00025ETIW|1.0|everyone was saying that this was an amazing band.  plenty of my friends were carting around their cd cases all day just to show off and all the indie and scene kids were head over heels.<br /><br />well, i borrowed a copy to see what all the fuss was about, almost had to pry  it out of someone's cold dead hands too, and i am lost.<br /><br />helena, if you listen to it five or six times, it's ok.  anything else on here, to call it good music?  i'm lost.  Especially I'M NOT OK.  well, i know he's not; he writes songs like that.  it's really just annoying.
1592401791|5.0|I say this because as you read the book, you can reflect on the song that the author was talking about and  identify the part or technique being described.  If you're a Beatles fan, you can probably remember how each tune goes and you will probably be able to match each part to the story.  If your memory isn't as good, break out the CD or the vinyl, if you have it.  I have. <br />This is a great book for the Beatles fan.  It gives great insite on how things were done during that time and explains quite a bit of why things were what they were.  I couldn't put it down when I started reading it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband loves to take out one of these Dvd's from time to time and watch it. This is a timelss series. We have lent it out to neighbors hat have had family night and watched all of the series with thier children. It is a great way to start conversation with your children about such things as war, milatary, ect. This is a Dvd collection that everyone should have, IMHO.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Look...there is no one out there more conservative than I when it comes to the Beatles.  I was VERY upset when Capitol decided to release the sonically sub-par American tapes in those horribly package box sets, and charge WAY too much for them.  I am still waiting for these wonderful remasters that were supposed to come out last year, and hoping that they will be in both mono and stereo.  So I was very hesitant to buy this album, but decided to anyway when I learned that there was some \\"new music\\".  I am pleased to say that I was not dissapointed.  There are some questionable parts here and there (Julia, Here Comes the Sun), but overall you can tell that this was done with respect and honor to the Beatles legacy.  Geroge Martin's new string arrangements for \\"While my Guitar...\\" are a wonderful tribute to the late Beatle, and give his early demo new breath. Don't think of this album as ruining the Beatles legacy; think of it as a rebirth, a fun romp with the music we all know and love (in AMAZING sound quality).  Maybe this will spur EMI on to remaster the catolog. Overall, a suprise to this very conservative Beatles fan. (Now we'll see if I can convince myself to try out the 5.1 remix)
B0002OERI0|1.0|ok, if you like pop sh** then you like pop sh** just don't you EVER think of calling this swill Punk rock.  EVER.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Finally, a love story that doesn't try to get everything right.  Love, Actually is a collection of interwoven tales about people falling in and out of love that is ambitious, intelligent, and only rarely clich&eacute;d.  The film is as completely unrealistic as a good romance ought to be, but not in a way that panders to the audience; plus, the clever script doesn't take itself too seriously, and the hard to swallow scenes are as much of the laugh-out-loud variety as the aw-shucks type.<br /><br />There's enough realism in most of the scenes to obviate completely suspending disbelief, and the film honors practical themes: some love is better left unrequited, and not every crush needs resolution.  Timing and Fate can play as much of a role breaking up unions as creating them.  Love isn't always pretty or fair, and manifests in the form of an aging rocker rejecting glitz and groupies to spend New Year's eve getting blitzed with his longtime manager, a guy falling for his best friend's new bride, and the British Prime Minister tempting scandal for the affections of his young aide.<br /><br />The star-studded cast delivers, and the wide variety of scenes prevents any character from wearing out his welcome.  As with so many great British comedies, Rowan Atkinson cameos.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|About two years ago, I came onto Amazon to order this series disc.  I missed the show when it came on air and I now partially blame myself because I could have been one of many vocal fans of this show begging the network to keep it on the air.  In any case, I had heard great things about the show and I skimmed the reviews.  I must admit to being skeptical of the gushing reviews and the amount of love for the show.  I thought: \\"how good could it be, there are only about 15 or so episodes.\\"  In any case, I picked up the set.  I cannot begin to describe how amazing, wonderful and yes, depressing, this show is.  Depressing because each episode got me one episode closer to the \\"last episode.\\"  Depressing because ever since that first viewing, I pray constantly that some wonderful network will decide to greenlight a second Firefly series show.   <br /> <br />Please, if you are a fan of great TV, great characters, and want to fall in love with the most wonderfully realized world/universe, get this show.  Now.  Right away. Today.  Immediately.  Pronto!!!!!! It is absolutely as great as everyone on Amazon is saying.  There is no exaggeration in my statement that Firefly is one of the best ideas and shows to ever grace television.  I have never felt as strongly as I do about this show.  It is flat-out outstanding.   <br /> <br />It is stunning that this cast, Joss, the writers, and others who worked on the show were able to create such a deep mythology in so few episodes. I can, and have, viewed and re-watched and re-watched these shows and feel that they remain fresh.  This is a universe that feels REAL, populated by characters I want to hang out with.     <br /> <br />Please, Get this set now!   <br />
B00008GKEG|5.0|I have not seen this special since the mid 90's!  I am so excited to have it on DVD with all the amazing extras, it makes it complete.  The sound is superb, and be sure to watch every disc, you will get some rare audio not included in the Anthology CD releases (studio outtakes and such).  A MUST for every true Beatles fan!!!!!
B000J103PC|2.0|I hoped I would never have to endure an experience as boring  as reading \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" (And I didn't finish it).<br /><br />Then I saw the movie. (I still didn't totally finish it).<br /><br />Predictable, cliche-ridden, and totally banal.  The only question I have is the one I posed in my title:  \\"Why would Meryl Streep be in this movie\\"  and, further, in this BAD a movie?<br /><br />I only wonder why I've never published a book, then had a movie made.  Because this book was so lame, and the movie, so much lamer, that I know I've missed a great secret that's lying out there.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is the ONLY reason to watch this movie.  And, sadly, even she isn't enough to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />Watch an old Woody Allen movie.  Much more entertaining.
B00005JPCD|2.0|There are lots of reasons for kids of all ages not to like this movie, despite its gorgeous arctic visuals.  The plot is flimsy at best, and more than anything else, seems aimed to provide giant holes into which tedious dance sequences and cover songs fall.  This might as well have been a lousy musical instead of a lousy drama failing in its comedic attempts (or is it a lousy comedy missing its dramatic marks?).<br /><br />For young kids, the villains are too scary and the characters' pain too omnipresent, particularly main character Mumble's near descent into insanity at the film's end, and the chronic choking torture of Robin Williams' character Lovelace.  Plus, the story is too complicated and nuanced for kids to understand: I'm sure for the most part, children can appreciate themes of celebrating diversity and fitting square pegs into round holes, but they're not going to realize the film's message of attracting a mate through a \\"heartsong\\" that most penguins communicate through singing and not dancing (despite the film's inextricably linking the two).<br /><br />There are heavier themes at work here that will repel older viewers, on top of their inevitable boredom with the oft-repeated song and dance numbers- namely the negative impact man has on the environment.  Few films are as clear in promoting an agenda of animals-good, humans-bad; even fewer seek to resolve the conflict with a ham-handed, last-minute reality check courtesy of the United Nations.  Please.
B000002V07|5.0|If you have never treated yourself to a Mazzy Star album - start with this one. Of course it opens with the incredibly sublime 'Fade into you' which still remains to be my favorite song of all time after so many years. Having said that, every song on the album is incredible and takes you to another place. Hope Sandoval is possibly the best female vocalist I've ever heard and it's a shame that she hasnt released more albums. <br />Absolute sublime classic disc that you will never tire of.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This CD blew me away the first time I listened to it. I am a bass player and I always thought metal was easy but this CD is a little challenging to play. I was very surprised with the riffs by the guitars and the consistant pounding of the drums. This is by far the best metal CD ever. If you want the best press, make sure you by the original. The remastered CD is good but not great. I think Dave took some of the intensity away on the remix. Not knocking Dave at all, he is a master at what he does. Buy the CD, you'll be impressed. It will go down in history.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you were there when they first arrived in the USA and felt the thrill of a sound that changed a generation then you are in for a treat with this album.  Get Back will send chills to your very rock and roll core.  As my Guitar Gently Weeps will tear at your soul.  For that person of a certain age who knew the fab four intimately, this new release will bring closure to the songs that you thought somehow incomplete.  Destine to go gold.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|This isnt a full review but i heard 'no apologies' and, damn, wow... one a the best em songs ive ever heard, you know a songs good when it sends chills through your body... a cold rushing full force flow that slowly goes down your spine like a ghosts shadow,a cold soft choke hold on your empty soul that makes your arms shudder-shake vibrate an fold, its time to shatter-an-break the same old mold as this untold brilliance unfolds  <br />

0140187537|5.0|When John Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1962, many felt that this book was what reminded the Prize committee of Steinbeck's greatness. Like all of his books, short stories and non-fiction journalism, this is very well written, has developed characters who readers will recognize and presents a useful moral at the end. This might be his most modern and recognizable story, however.<br /><br />Ethan Hawley is the well educated scion of a prominent Long Island family that has fallen on hard times and has lost its place at the top of society. Ethan is known throughout the community for his honesty and integrity, but there is pressure from everyone--his family, his boss, friends and local big wigs--for him to sacrifice his morales to earn a better living and make a name for himself. As he struggles with the temptation of a big pay day, he develops a plan which will destroy his own standards of decency, but will elevate his family back into the prestigious position he thinks they deserve.<br /><br />The story is well told and engaging, plus it gives readers a great opportunity to decide whether the modern society Steinbeck sees is really worth the price it costs. I would highly recommend this book to Steinbeck fans or people who enjoy good writing and stories that make them think.
0307341542|4.0|Wind Gap, Missouri; not a town to draw the attention of a big city newspaper.  The story of the abduction and murder of two young girls from Camille Preaker's home town isn't enough to wish her back there in her wildest dreams but unfortunately, her boss thinks otherwise.  The Chicago Daily Post needs a headline piece, badly, that is going to come out of the corner and kill the masses.  Editor Frank Curry has always had a strange kind of faith in his favourite reporter.  Camille is sure it's entirely misplaced but as she wants to please the man who was there for her in a dark time, she heads back to where her screwed up little life all began. <br />  <br />The abattoir and processing factory that still largely supports Wind Gap unfairly hasn't left a porcine stink on it's owner, Camille's genteel mother Adora, a whimsical and earnest person who was only ever happy when her children desperately needed her.  Camille feels it should have, as should have the circumstances of her birth with there still being a big fat question mark as to the identity of her father.  Adora still reigns, over her house, her family, and her town.  Camille's half sister is disturbingly like her mother in some ways, and reminds her of her own self in others.  The thirteen year old Amma dominates her fearsome little group of four like little blondes and is doing a damn fine job of doing the same to the residents of Wind Gap.  Finding it hard not to get sucked back into old, dark habits, Camille cozies up a little too much to the Kansas hot shot cop sent in to help out the police in the little backwater.  It seems her new partner has already made up his mind on this one, along with most of the town, that only a newcomer to Wind Gap could be evil enough to inflict so much on innocents who little deserved it.   <br />  <br />SHARP OBJECTS: a nasty little piece in the most delightful way.  Where would the creepiest thrillers go without turning to dysfunctional families that make our own look pretty good?  Okay, so writer Gillian Flynn all but bludgeons us about the head in pointing out the villain of the hour, very EARLY in the hour.  This seems to be the main complaint with this read; otherwise, it is very difficult to find anything to criticize in this polished debut novel.  <br />  <br />How refreshing to have the investigating protagonist not always operating from the moral high ground.  We mystery readers like our heroes somewhat brooding and damaged and the package here is the modern woman's version of just that.  With so much to hide of her own self and with not wanting to confront what's left behind, Camille Preaker's viewpoint of the proceedings is completely immersed in the swamp that is her own family.  The incestuous small town of Camille's childhood and its people are all in the murk with her.  The heavy, oppressive air that permeates this read is almost a tangible thing and if you're looking for hope and redemption with your mystery, you'd best look elsewhere than at this disturbing thriller.  SHARP OBJECTS pleases in an almost visceral way and revolts as it reveals; strange to think that one novel can do both.  Gillian Flynn has achieved much with SHARP OBJECTS and as much as it is a first attempt on the market, it is also quite the attack. <br />
1594200823|5.0|This is the best book I've consumed in a long time, and I recommend it highly. This is a great dissertation on food: where it comes from, how we relate to it, what it really costs us. He analyzes the sources of four meals as produced by the industrial food, industrial organic, artisanal farmer, and hunter/gatherer systems. Perhaps the highest compliments I can pay: it is deeply thought provoking; it will change the way I buy my food. <br /> <br />While there are a few moments when the author strays over the line and becomes a polemicist using literary and logical tricks to sway your thinking, that is not the basic tenor or thrust. His fundamental approach is to show you what is really there, so you are aware of what's really going on, and then you can make your own choices based on knowledge. Quibble as you will over the quality of research, the details of particular points, his attitude or approach on a particular subtopic. Thinking people can think, and this book gives you much to think about. This is not a vegan diatribe, or a PETA \\"animals are people too\\" broadside. It is a reasoned and intelligent recounting of one man's search for understanding, brilliantly told and beautifully written.  <br /> <br />If you wish to remain blissfully ignorant about something as fundamental as the food you eat, do not read this book. If you like to know what's going on around you, then this book is a real eye opener.

B000F5GNX8|5.0|Fans of Ellmore Leonard and/or Quentin Tarantino, rent or buy this immediately. I will spare you any plot summary as it really wouldn't be that useful and the film is full of fun surprises anyway. The fact is that this is an extremely well written and acted movie that will be sure to delight viewers across a wide range. It seemed to me like Quentin Tanantino on brain steroids... there was that sense of fun and unpredictability that made Pulp Fiction special(and that Quentin is so lacking lately)... the pacing is impeccable and every scene has it's own little gem that makes it memorable.   Val Kilmer, Robert Downey Junior and Michele Monaghan (who is so hot I couldn't believe she actually act) all give stand-out performances, perhaps especially Kilmer's incredibly natural portrayal of [...]Hollywood Private detective \\"Gay Perry\\", who radiates a regal impatience and businesslike comtempt for Downey Jr's loser wise-guy character.   In addition, the \\"gag reel\\" extra on the DVD is hilarious, consisting of very few bloopers and mostly the actors ad-libbing. They must have driven director shane black crazy with their in-jokes. The commentary is rather expansive and funny-- you wonder if the actors and director and enjoying weed and martinis as they converse. Director Shane Black has an interesting backstory, check it out in the editorial review above. It's a shame this movie was such a dud at the box office (Black says in the commentary that it made 1.50 at the theater- hey, I saw it!) but hopefully it will build up the cult following it so richly deserves.   Give Gay Perry his own HBO show!!!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is about a girl who is about 10 times smarter, sharp witted, and drama filled than anyone else around her, (not to mention she is 10 times prettier than everyone else).  She never fails to deliver a quick witted response to peoples slanders against her.  There is no case to hard, no villain to horrific, no relationship too broken to knock her off her feet.  The show is basically about a murder involving her best friend.  The mystery holds well, as do all the cases-of-the-week which never fail to involve great amounts of thought, no matter how silly the are.  The writing is as sharp as Kristen Bell's performance.  She can go from innocent teen one moment, to sarcastic know it all the next, to bubble head the next, to broken hearted girl on her own with an amazing ease.  The only problem with the show in general are the relationship plot lines.<br /><br />Beware of spoiler:<br />The Logan, Duncan, police man triangle is very weak, especially the break up scenes with the police man.  They way that is resolved makes this show almost of 4 star show.  I have never in my life seen such a terrible resolve.  On the other hand, the Logan relationship is bizarre and never really is believable.  Veronica and Logan have chemistry, but not in a romantic way.  Their chemistry is from the contestant arguing.  Duncan and Veronica have a mild but believable chemistry.  The policeman, who gets very little screen time, seems to be the one that she has the most chemistry with, making is almost impossible to believe that she would dump him.<br /><br />end of spoiler<br /><br />with that downfall, the show still gets a five stars because of the great season finale.  The guilty person is not the one I would have ever thought it was, and the cliff hanger, while a little set-up-for-next-seasons-mystery less, is not all that bad.  The show is fresh in this world of the same ol thing every week.  I hope it doesn't get cancelled.
0684857219|2.0|This is a great workout book if you have nothing else to do but workout. The routines in this book are quite effective but they are also long and demand much of your time. If you don't have any kind of responsibilities, then by all means, follow the routines in this book. Go ahead train, eat, tan, eat some more, sleep, have some sex, but if you have any kind of life this book may not be what you're looking for. I agree with some of the reviewers, it's good for a reference, but if you're looking for something that gets good results in a minimum amount of time, try a Bob Paris book or even a Frank Zane book. You can even use this book, but just cut the amount of sets in half.<br /><br />If you're in your teens and early to mid-twenties, you can do anything and get in shape. I remember those days. Roll out of bed, smoke a bowl, eat a cupcake and workout. I was ripped, defined, and in great shape. Nowadays, I roll out of bed with a moan, overshoot the toliet bowl, and the only cupcake I can have in my life without gaining weight is my wife. I'm in my forties now. I can't workout like I once did. I can't eat like I once did. I can't do a lot of things like I once did. But I'm still in good shape. If for some reason I can't go to the gym one day, I don't beat myself up over it, I'll do some \\"invisible training\\". You might laugh at this, but I \\"pretend\\" I'm lifting an imaginary weight. In my mind, I pick out an exercise, let's say dumbell presses. I see a 50lb weight in each hand and I go through all the straining, all the effort as if those weights were actually in my hand. After the seventh rep, I'm breaking a sweat, after ten reps, I'm exhausted. I'll do some \\"pretend\\" laterals, same thing, some \\"imaginary\\" upright rows, all for 3 sets of ten and y'know what? My shoulders are just as pumped up if I had gone to the gym.<br /><br />Arnold has always had kind of an \\"excessive\\" philosophy about training, anyway. If two hours is good, four must be better. If ten sets per body part does the trick, than thirty sets will make the results come three times faster. If you're young and enthused and inspired, go knock yourself out, but if you're approaching middle age or are already there, don't kid yourself...please, just don't. Go workout. Have fun. Go every other day. Watch your diet. Play with your children. Make love to your wife. Live your life. You can still get in shape without selling your soul to the gym.<br /><br />May 2007 be a brand new year of blessings to all...body part does the trick, than thirty sets will make the results come three times faster.

0393061434|3.0|This is an interesting and detailed book until the author gets to the founding of apple computers, which is the reason, I assume, that most people are reading in the first place.<br /><br />I guess the problem is that Steve Wozniak doesn't seem to be very interested in the subject. I mean he does talk a bit about it, but not as much as you'd think, considering it's the reason he's famous enough to write a book about his life. After Apple is founded he just seems to start to drift. Of course, perhaps that's what actually happened in his life. Apple became a huge fortune 500 company almost overnight and running a big company wasn't really Steve Wozniak's bag. Which one can hardly fault him for. It's just not what I expected.<br /><br />The early part of the book is interesting enough though, especially the history of what went in to buliding the first personal computers, and the discriptions of what that whole scene was like.<br /><br />I'd like to add that I am always hesitant to rate things three stars because, in my mind at least, three stars is usually an overly drastic diminishment from four stars. For me the implication of the difference is that it's the line between giving something a chance and not giving it one. So surfice it to say I don't feel that I wasted my time reading this book. (I listened to an unabridged audiobook version actually, not that that matters really. I liked the guy who read it, if that's helpful to anyone.)
B000002KGT|5.0|Thirty years ago this coming March, this album came into my life. Thirty years of listening to it and I am still thinking to myself, \\"Wow...this is incredible music...\\" Isn't it funny how certain things come into our lives and then we can't seem to remember the times when they weren't there?<br /><br />I love this album. From the moment I first heard this album in its entirety, I knew that this would be a \\"keeper\\". I made a promise myself to never get so old that I wouldn't enjoy this music. And even though my hairline has gone up and back while the rest of my body has slowly gravitated south, I still love this music. Perhaps I love it even more because now I can fully appreciate it and be grateful that I was introduced to stuff like this.<br /><br />You would think that those \\"Classic Schlock\\" stations (where they play  50 classic rock songs ad nauseum)would've made me want to stop listening to \\"Dreams\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" but everytime they're on the radio, I'm singing right along with the band. I do think this is probably why I have never made the leap to CD with this album because the \\"best of\\" this particular recording is always on the radio...which is good...which is real good because the way things are with music these days, I hear very little that will stand the test of time. I don't envision myself 55 years from now sitting in a loaded Depends diaper asking the convalescent nurse to put on Dr. Dre or Limp Bizkit for me, but I do see an aged hand, that was once young and tan, reach for this classic 1977 album just like I have reached for it over and over and over again in the last thirty years.<br /><br />It's weird getting older. It's strange seeing gray come onto a \\"field\\" that once was \\"toe-head\\" blonde or looking in the mirror and realizing that the creases that are on my face today weren't there yesterday, that after two beers, I'm out like a light, but it's a good thing. It's a very good thing. I was young. Youth was wasted on me like it's wasted on everyone, but age really makes me appreciate what I was given to be the person I am now and this recording is one of them.<br /><br />Peace and Blessings, you young \\"whipper-snappers\\"h was wasted on me like it's wasted on everyone, but age really makes me appreciate what I was given to be the person I am now and this recording is one of them. <br /> <br />Peace and Blessings, you young \\"whipper-snappers\\"

1592400876|4.0|As a person who loves grammar and notices the errors that so irk Truss, I found this book amusing and fun.  However, there was little in this book that I didn't already know.  I'd imagine that is the case for most people who decide to read this book; it seems to be a book more aimed at commiserating about grammar errors than actually instructing the ignorant.  The tone is a bit too condescending for a textbook.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I didn't know what to expect out of this movie, but decided to give it a chance because Steve Carrell is in it.  It is the most enjoyable flick of 2006, IMHO.  It crosses genres and is a bit difficult to categorize, perhaps a \\"dark comedy\\". <br /> <br />The movie starts slow, so you'll need some patience while the director sets up the characters.  It's well worth it.  I almost bust a rib laughing at the horn situation... \\"Mmmeeep meep... mbeep.. mmmmbeep meeep\\".  There are some unexpected twists and a creative ending.

B00065MDRW|5.0|After 35, or more years, this is still my favorite King Crimson Album/CD. The music is timeless to me. Believe it or not, I first bought the Album because of the Album art. Was I surprised to find out how wonderful the music would be. I've alway's loved Greg Lakes vocals/Bass and Robert Fripp's guitar work. Only within the last 3 years have I began listening to, and buying Crimson's newer work. It's great stuff too, but I always put this one at the top of my desert island list. The thinking man's prog rock music.
0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale was a literary treat. Diane Setterfield spins a tale rich with storytelling elements you've forgotten existed in modern fiction. I was sad when I finished reading it, even though I devoured it. I think both Daphne du Maurier and Victoria Holt would approve of this book.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|There are a few songs on this album that I really love (the two with Ladysmith Black Mambazo make that list -- great soft African rhythm / singing / chanting in the background) and there are others that I either  really like or like well enough.  Nothing that I downright dislike.  By personal choice I don't listen to a few of the songs during my leisure time, not because they are \\"bad\\" (i.e. not musically beautiful) but simply because the subject matter is more melancholy than I choose for leisure music.  I would give the CD by itself four stars (or maybe 4 and a half), and am not sorry that I bought it.  <br />The thing that pushes my rating to the 5-star category is the accompanying DVD. I found it very enjoyable.  It is one thing to hear songs on a CD, but it is definitely another (and better, in my opinion) to see what the artists were thinking when they put the songs together the way they did.  Seeing this with \\"Awake\\" actually makes me enjoy the music more.  Maybe it's partially the \\"ownership\\" idea -- once I saw the process that went into it, I felt more connected.  And just plain clued-in.  I had no idea beforehand that Josh Groban has a good sense of humor (I would even say he's hilarious in an understated sort of way)... I don't think I could have known that by listening to his music alone.  That is one benefit of seeing \\"behind the scenes.\\"  What clued me in to his sense of humor is the footage on the photo shoot & then later the video shoot.  Those who have attended his concerts or seen him on TV are probably a little more aware of his personality.  The DVD's interview of Josh & in-studio \\"behind the scenes\\" footage also clued me in a little bit to his honesty & graciousness... which I saw again in other on-line interviews.  It is refreshing to see these qualities in a world-famous singer, and it's a good example.  Josh, if you ever read this, keep that steady head on you :)
6305971145|5.0|'Santa Claus the movie' is a huge childhood favorite of mine. There are not many christmas movies out there that tell such an original story of how Santa Claus came to be. It is not only a mesmorizingly creative fairy tale that leaves you feeling like a warm chocolate chip cookie just taken out of the oven on christmas eve but it leaves all the religous aspects of christmas out so everyone can enjoy it,wich is the way the holiday truly deserves to be. My baby brother is 11 years old & although he is trying very hard (for his age) to hold on to the magic he has been asking alot of questions this year. So on christmas eve I read him Verginia O'Hanlons famous \\"yes verginia there is a Santa Claus\\" letter,afterwards we watched 'The Polar Exspress' & finished the night off with this classic & when it was all over the first thing he did was run out to the kitchen,grab some of the left over christmas eve cookies we had made earlier that night along with a couple of carrots,poured a tall glass of milk & wrote a note to Santa that said the following \\"Hello Santa! Even though my friends at school don't believe in you Don't you worry because I still do. Here are some cookies & milk for you & carrots for your reindeer. I love you Santa Clause\\". If for only one more year I could help him to believe,well then \\"mission acomplished\\" & I definitely thank the makers of this little holiday classic for assisting me in my magic capturing endeavor.

0618680004|1.0|Many years ago when I read the short volume by atheist Bertrand Russell, Why I Am Not a Christian, I thought: there is not much substance to this. Generalisations, straw men, red herrings and misrepresentations seemed to characterise the book. Dawkins' book is longer, more sophisticated and more comprehensive, but it bears the same traits as found in Russell's l927 tract.<br /><br />Indeed, there are atheists and there are atheists. The garden-variety don't like religion, don't like God and don't like people who do. Then there is the especially hard-core variety. These are atheists who are on a mission, an evangelistic crusade to save the world from religion. They hate religion and are convinced it must be eradicated at all costs. Such atheists have every bit as much zeal and fanaticism in their secular jihad as a religious person ever will. Richard Dawkins is a classic example of the atheist storm-trooper.<br /><br />His newest book continues his passionate crusade to rid the world of every last vestige of religion. For in Dawkins' eyes, religion is the source of all evil, while atheism is the path of enlightenment, brotherhood and liberation. One is either a blind, ignorant fool who is overwhelmed by delusion, or one sees the light through the lens of atheism.<br /><br />Dawkins is contemptuous of all religions, so he is an equal opportunity offender. But it is Christianity that he especially savages. He says that the Bible is \\"just plain weird\\" and \\"systematically evil\\". He speaks of God's acts as \\"God's jealous sulk,\\" \\"God's maniacal jealousy,\\" \\"ethnic cleansing\\" and \\"genocide\\". Yahweh is simply a \\"cruel ogre\\" and a \\"monster\\" according to Dawkins.<br /><br />But wait, there's more. Dawkins calls the atoning death of Christ \\"vicious, sado-masochistic and repellent,\\" and \\"morally obnoxious\\". So much for tolerance and open-mindedness.<br /><br />In Dawkins' view religion is the source of all evil, while atheism is the source of all sweetness and light. Never minds the millions of people killed in the name of atheistic utopias, be they Stalin's, Hitler's or Mao's.<br /><br />For all of his hatred of Christianity, Dawkins has to go much further if he wants to offer an intellectually satisfying debunking of this faith. His arguments are simply shallow and unconvincing. They are also poorly argued, with hardly any substantial documentation or evidence.<br /><br />At most, his arguments tell us more about his own twisted temperament, and his anti-Christian bigotry. They certainly do not offer us a telling critique of the Christian faith.<br /><br />Consider Dawkins' use of the term delusion. Not only is this not much of an argument, but if every time I spoke about atheists, and simply dismissed their claims as mere delusion, they would not think I was advancing much of a case. And they would be right. So in a sense this book is one long exercise in the fallacy known as ad hominem. Simply attacking the person and thinking you have won the argument.<br /><br />Of course by delusion he has certain ideas in mind. Dawkins holds to the standard worldview of the philosophical naturalist, which seeks to make a disjunction between faith and reason, religion and science. Science gives us truth, but faith is simply myth. But more sober minds on both sides of the debate recognise these to be false polarisations. Faith, at least in the Christian religion, is informed by reason. It may at times go beyond reason, but it does not run counter to it.<br /><br />And the scientific enterprise is also characterised by faith commitment. There are all kinds of unproven assumptions and presuppositions which may or may not be testable. The myth of complete scientific neutrality and objectivity has been countered by many important thinkers.<br /><br />But because of Dawkins' pre-commitment to philosophical naturalism, he rules our a priori any possibility of the supernatural. And anyone who does seek to escape the narrow confines of such naturalism (the idea that only matter matters) is, according to Dawkins, simply deluded.<br /><br />Thus by Dawkins' chosen framework, anyone who disagrees with him must be living in delusion. But his worldview, which is born not of scientific evidence, but philosophical commitment, itself can be challenged. A good critique of Dawkins in this regard can be found in Alister McGrath's recent book, Dawkins' God.<br /><br />Dawkins' acerbic attack of the faith of billions of people comes across as just another fundamentalist crusade or jihad. It is just as intolerant and judgmental as any religious broadside can be.<br /><br />The author's over-reliance on ad hominem, name-calling, red herrings, straw men, and selective use of evidence makes this book unconvincing at best and repellent at worst. Indeed, if anything, this book has all the hallmarks of what it claims is wrong with religionists: it is just too doctrinaire, arrogant, intolerant, bigoted, narrow-minded, and full of pomposity and venom.<br /><br />There certainly are more cogent and telling arguments that can be advanced against religious belief. But the reader will have to look elsewhere for them. This book succeeds in doing only one job well: showing us the arrogance and narrow-mindedness of militant atheism.<br /><br />With the brisk sales of this book, its author should be making quite a few quid. However it is the reader who is being short-changed. For a book that is meant to be an intellectual \\"case\\" against God and belief, this book comes nowhere close to demonstrating the irrationality of religious belief. It seems instead to demonstrate the bitterness and paucity of thinking of at least one famous atheist.uch naturalism (the idea that only matter matters) is, according to Dawkins, simply deluded. <br /> <br />Thus by Dawkins' chosen framework, anyone who disagrees with him must be living in delusion.

6305558167|4.0|Along with Ken Russell, John Boorman can be seen as a key figure in the modern British cinema... His interest in myth, dream, landscape and memory may be compared with that of Resnais, Leone, and Roeg...<br /><br />Boorman's 'Excalibur' is characterized by his use of jealousy and adultery, sex and sorcery... It is also characterized by fire and fog, shadow and moonlight, creating an air of mystery that is essential element in the Arthurian legend...<br /><br />Boorman's 'Excalibur' is a mythical presentation leading the viewers to travel with the flow of the legend... It is a magical story with wonderful exotic sets, and interesting camera-work in the lush green scenery of Ireland... (The Cinematography won an Academy Award Nomination).<br /><br />Boorman's \\"Excalibur\\" is both fantasy and philosophy... Love seems to be a destructive force, lyrically beautiful and bravely realistic...<br /><br />The film brings to life the fateful story of a solitary hero, his ascension to the throne, the love triangle of Camelot, the quest for the Holy Grail, the decline and eventual fall of Arthur and Camelot... Along for the ride are his indispensable Knights of the Round Table, particularly Sir Lancelot...<br /><br />The characters in Boorman's \\"Excalibur\\" are extremely well developed... Arthur is seen as a naive squire, who develops into an idealistic king... Arthur tries to use Might for the establishment of Right, and according to his own laws, he puts reason over love...<br /><br />A prominent figure in the film is Merlin... He lives backwards, which makes him \\"a dream to some, a nightmare to others.\\" He defines the cave of the dragon as a place where all things meet their opposite: \\"The future and the past, desire and regret, knowledge and oblivion\\". But when Morgana pronounces \\"love\\", one would expect Merlin to answer \\"hate\\", but he just says: \\"O yes.\\"<br /><br />Morgana knows that Uther and Merlin are responsible for the death of her father... She dedicates her life to revenge.. Her scenes with Merlin are full of fire and poison... When she steals the \\"charm of making\\" from Merlin, Morgana gets stronger... We feared her lines when she affirmed: \\"I can ease your loneliness.\\"<br /><br />Lancelot looks at himself as a sinful person who has betrayed a friend... He stays lonely in the forest, haunted by sorrow and pain... He dreams of a fight with himself... And when he wakes up naked, he sees his own sword stuck in his side... The film endures and inspires because it embodies mankind's deepest yearnings...<br /><br />Among the many elements that make the movie work is the cast: Nigel Terry, the rightful King who, accidentally, removes the sword of power easily, not once, but twice; Helen Mirren, the enchantress Morgana, Merlin's nemesis and Arthur's treacherous half-sister, who seduces Merlin, and then encircles him in a stream of vengeance; Nicholas Clay, persuasively ardent and athletic as the First Knight; Cherie Lunghi, the damsel in distress who loves her husband with her mind and Lancelot with her heart; Nicol Williamson, the wily Merlin who would see that the young Arthur receive the necessary training and guidance to fulfill his unlikely destiny; Gabriel Byrne, the hot-blooded Uther Pendragon, who plunges 'Excalibur' deep into a stone rock in one last act of defiance; Katrine Boorman, the woman taken as by a fully armored King; Liam Neeson, the knight who dares to accuse the Queen; and Robert Addie, the 'unholy child' who comes to Camelot to demand the throne of his father...<br /><br />One of the more fascinating aspects of the film (and there are many...) are the differences between Uther and Arthur...

1576751988|4.0|I study time, efficiency and effectiveness so you would think I do not have a problem with procrastination but sometimes I do. So, of course, I bought a book.<br /><br />The title comes from do the worst thing first thing and the rest of the day is easy.  My modification to this is to creat more than one first thing - eg first thing after lunch.  First thing after dinner etc.<br /><br />\\"Eat that Frog - 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less time\\" by Brian Tracy.<br /><br />It is a short and easy read. Good book. I did not put off reading it - I read it instead of cleaning up my den. As the title suggests, it has lots of ideas on how to get over procrastination.<br /><br />Brian Tracy is one of the most prolific self development authors and speakers. His stuff is good, although sometimes too shallow.<br /><br />One quote from the book:<br /><br />\\"There is one quality that one must possess to win and that is a definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants and a burning desire to achieve it\\"<br /><br />By Napoleon Hill.
0783226837|5.0|This has got to be one of the all time greatest movies , i wouldnt exactly put it into any genre but what i like the most about this movie is that it doesnt take itself seriously. the casting goes hand in hand and you can tell that they had a great time making this movie.  <br />I really didnt want to spoil my memorie of this movie by watching any of the sequels , this is one movie that really didnt need a sequel and then the t.v series ? too much. If you havent yet seen this movie , dont rent it , just buy it , you will be happy you did and it can sit proudly amongst your dvd library at the front so you can watch it over and over and over again -
630521610X|4.0|A killer stalks a small community, and a high school student (Neve Campbell) who is facing the first anniversary of her mother's murder appears to be marked for death.  This is a very well-written, clever slasher film that takes great delight in poking fun at the genre of slasher films.  It's full of trivia and self-aware clichés as well as some genuine thrills and a well-planned surprise at the end.  The whole cast is very good, but Matthew Lillard as an obnoxious high school boy and David Arquette as a deputy sheriff stand out.  Director Wes Craven, who is responsible for some of the slasher films (most notably the first \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\") that inspired Kevin Williamson's inventive screenplay, does the best work of his career here.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Harry Lime in the Third Man tells Holly Martins \\"in Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed, but they produced Michaelangelo - Leonardo Da Vinci, and the Renaissance...In Switzerland, they had brotherly love. They had five hundred years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce?...The cuckoo clock.\\" Great art stems from turmoil and pain and this movie reflects that paradigm. 2006 has been a year for bleak futures in film exemplified by Inconvenient Truth, V for Vendetta and now Children of Men. In the early 70s amidst the quagmire of Vietnam, the civil rights movement and the corruption of the Nixon administration the cinema produced Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green and THX 1138. Now amidst the quagmire in Iraq, the legitimization of torture, the suspension of habeus corpus, and the corruption of the Bush administration director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has woven a cautionary tale set in 2027 England but the issues at stake could not be more topical. The single take tracking shots drag the viewer by the hair through a world more terrifying than any horror film could conjure. I was riveted by this pre-apocalyptic drama to the very last frame. When the credits rolled I looked at an audience quite literally stunned and silent. I cannot recall another film that delivers such a punch. I felt so raw afterward I had to have a drink. It is without a doubt the best film of 2006.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is a movie I received for Christmas, and having never seen it before, I was so touched by it. It is a great movie to watch again and again, and Johnny Depp's facial expressions are so interesting and add so much to the movie. Great for everyone over 13.
0876855575|5.0|The reviewer Robin Friedman a couple of reviews back did an excellent job in describing this book without giving away too many important details.  There is no use telling you all what the story is about start to finish.  That's what reading the novel is all about.  Anyway, if you like Bukowski you've already read this and more than likely adore this novel.  Ergo, this review is suited more for those who have never read a Bukowski novel (a couple of poems don't count).  If you read this you need to be the type of person who doesn't take yourself and the world too seriously.  Otherwise, odds are you will be disgusted with Bukowski as a whole and dislike all of his novels.  Because unlike anyone I have ever read Bukowski is what he writes!  And what he writes about isn't pretty, it isn't politically correct, it isn't nice, it isn't tasteful or tactful, it isn't informative, it doesn't have meaning, etc... do I need to say more?  What it is, is real and gritty and funny and raw and honest and brave.  This guy can write like nobody's business and as much as you need to hate and pity him you just can't help but like and admire him at the same time.  The fact that Bukowski is so much more popular in Europe than he is in his home country would make for great coffee house debate (not that I ever have or as fun as it sounds ever will).  Perhaps his poking fun at the American way of life, that it wasn't all Norman Rockwell, Howdy Doody, Ozzie & Harriet bull.... like it tried to portray itself back then (many may argue that it still does today) in the early days of TV, radio, newspapers, etc...  Perhaps people in Europe see something romantic about an iconoclastic writer that doesn't have the same value system as the average Capitalist(myself included).  The good, old red blooded American automaton marching off dutifully to work everyday.  Perhaps in Europe they aren't as uptight with sex or politically correctness as the vapid Religious Right and the pretentious libs in this country are.  I don't really know, I just know that I really like this guy warts and all.  Forgive me father, for I have sinned.ountry are.

1401907725|5.0|Santa was sweet to bring me this deck for Christmas this year.  I was totally surprised, even though it was on my wish list.  This is my 7th Card Deck by Doreen Virtue.<br /><br />My first thought at opening this deck was happiness.  Doreen chose to add the same beautiful glided lining to this deck as she had to my all-time favorite deck, Magical Unicorns.  The gilded gold lining is SO pretty and makes the beautiful art from the decks just POP.<br /><br />The reason I like this deck most is because I believe any person could use it easily and find it a very usuable tool to connect to their Angels.  With most of Doreen's other decks, it's extremely helpful to get more information from your personal readings if you have a background study of the Angels, of Tarot and if your intuition is developed enough that you can read into the card and receive impressions from your Angels.  If you are just getting started though, in your journey to connecting with the Angels, this is definitely the place to start.<br /><br />Working with this deck, you will always receive positive, loving guidance.  You will never receive a message that will leave you scared or uncertain.  You will always have a sense of peace and love from them.  Some of the cards messages include, \\"Let Your Past Go\\", \\"Release and Surrender\\", \\"Have Confidence\\" and \\"There's Nothing to Worry About\\".  Doreen has lengthened the messages on each card to about three sentences, so you really have a great idea about what the Angels are trying to tell you.<br /><br />The art is just beautiful.  I also think Doreen herself is the one on the card, \\"Go for It!\\"  You'll have to let me know if you agree.  I really look forward to teaching people to use this deck as a 'daily draw', where you ask the Angels for guidance every morning and then pull a card.  As an Angel Therapy Practitioner, I highly recommend this deck.  Enjoy!  Thank you Doreen!
B00000E9PY|5.0|After doin' a little research I discovered there were 3 \\"Blood Pack\\" releases related to Seasons In The Abyss. The 'Seasons In The Abyss - Blood Pack - US - CD ALBUM - Promo', the 'Seasons In The Abyss - Blood Pack - US - CD SINGLE', & the 'Seasons In The Abyss - Blood Pack - UK - CD SINGLE'. But this review is for the US Single release. It's a 1990 US limited edition 3-track CD single, includes Album Version, Alternative Mix and Aggressive Perfector. Housed inside the PVC 'blood pack', this copy has dried up like most copies that are found nowadays!
B0000039LE|4.0|Good movie to start the sequels...Jamie Lee Curtis does a good job in her role.<br /><br />Story is about a 6 year old kid who kills his sister and spends the next 15 years in a mental hospital. He then escapes and goes back to start his set of slayings in his home of Haddonfield, Illinois.<br /><br />The movie is a little slow in certain parts but equally scary in others. Its a good beginning, seen as only a little part of the whole story is told and Michael ends up \\"escaping\\".<br /><br />I can see why other Halloween movies were made after this one. Recommended.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The vast right wing stupidity is trying desperately to dissuade use that Global Warming is real.  Here is the simple truth, if Al Gore and the rest of the world are wrong and we implement the changes to reduce CO2, then what have we lost?  Nothing, the old industries would be transformed into new, cleaner ones.  Worst case?  We get cleaner air and water.<br /><br />If the right wingers are wrong, we may loose everything.  If the arctic shelf collapses and 100million die, it will be a little too late to worry about blaming them for being wrong *again*.<br /><br />So, the simple truth is who cares if in the end which side is \\"right\\" we simply can't afford to take the chance.<br /><br />On the movie, the presentation is exceptional but I do agree that it would have been better without the Al Gore biography thrown in (even though I'm a big Gore supporter).
B00005JPCA|5.0|Before I start, I won't get all technical here with the film and unfold all of its nuances because many people have already done so, and I won't ruin the movie for anyone either. All of this is my own opinion of the film. This movie teaches you who James Bond is as a spy and as a person, and after you have seen it, you'll understand exactly why the world's coolest fictional spy is who he is.    Casino Royale is definitely the best Bond film in at least 10 years (if not my favourite one of all time). Yes, I too was upset when Pierce Brosnan was kicked off the series and I was a bit shocked when I found out that some blonde British guy was taking Brosnan's place, but honestly, it never really bothered me at all. Actually, I think I forgot about the whole thing. But now that I have seen Casino Royale, I do believe that Daniel Craig did an amazing job portraying Bond. I don't care about the way he looks (even though I think he's quite beautiful). Looks are not the most important thing. He's a great actor with the passion and the attitude that has been missing for so long. He defeated the stereotype for how James Bond should look and act, and for that he gets my approval and admiration. He was made to play this role. Go see his last two films if you don't believe me.     I went into the movie with an open mind and was completely hooked when the opening riff to \\"You Know My Name\\" started, and I wasn't disappointed for a moment after. James Bond wasn't a sophisticated and seasoned spy yet in this story, which is how he should be considering the context of the movie, when he first receives his license to kill and 00 status and starts his tenure as a spy. You would expect him to go on some sort of an ego trip and to not have all of these fancy gadgets floating around everywhere. If those were inserted into the movie, the movie would be too gaudy and parody-like. I think they captured the essence of who he was at the beginning and I loved every minute of Bond being a reckless, chauvinistic, egotistical s.o.b. The one-liners were great and I also really loved the romance between James and Vesper. We actually saw the emotional lovey-dovey side of James Bond in this film. He loved Vesper and Vesper loved him back...but Vesper Lynd really is James Bond's one and only true love and that's never changed in the last 21 films.    The movie was carried out perfectly, from the opening scenes and credits, to the theme song (which I love), and to the very end, which will keep you wondering. They definitely needed to save the Bond franchise after \\"Die Another Day\\" and they nailed it. I hope that Daniel Craig keeps playing Bond for a while because I will be sad to see him go. His work here has made a fan out of me and I cannot wait to see him in other films, Bond or not. The acting was superb by every cast member as well. If this movie doesn't get some award by the American or international motion picture community, then I'll be disappointed.    My only gripes with the film are that it was one big advertisement for Sony. Now, I love Sony products, but even though they own the rights to this movie, they did not need to pull the desperate plug and put all of their electronic devices in the film. They make enough money as it is. My next gripe is with Eva Green's makeup. She's a beautiful girl, but she doesn't need all that black eye makeup around her eyes. She looked just fine without all that black stuff. My last gripe comes with everybody comparing this movie to the Bourne series. This is not the Bourne Identity or the Bourne Supremacy, and even though there are a few similarities, these two movies are different and should be kept that way. It would have been really awesome also if this movie was set in the 1950's. It would have been true to the book and when this was originally written. That would have been an interesting experience.    I completely suggest that you go see this film. If you're not a Bond addict yet, this is the perfect intro to whathappens in the beginning and how things came to be. Then start watching all the movies and read the books if you're inclined to do so. (Read the books first...they're great and help you understand what happens in the movies.) If you're looking for a movie with crazy gadgets, bad jokes/sexual innuendo, unrealistic plots/villians, and a spy who acts like a pretty boy and eats caviar, this may not be the movie you are looking for. If you're looking for a modern and fresh James Bond with attitude and using his brains to get the mission completed, then by all means go see the movie...now.     I hope this review helps you to make some judgement on this film.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I know MCR are technically an \\"emo\\" band, but this CD is a refreshing return to the bombast of 70's rock. Great production, excellent musicianship(especially the guitar work). Loved it. One of the best of the year. Of course, the best CD of the year is RHCP's \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", but that's another story. Buy \\"The Black Parade\\", put in your earbuds, and remember a time when bands treated the album as an art form, and weren't afraid to be theatrical and showy.
1400032717|5.0|So much has been written about this book that it is hard to come up with original ways of describing the genius of it. So, I will pretend that you know nothing about it. The book starts with a murder... the murder of a neighborhood dog. The narrator of the book is falsely accused of being the killer so he decides to solve the crime and discover the true perpetrator. It doesn't sound too interesting except that the narrator of the story is a 16-year old autistic boy by the name of Christopher Boone. Christopher decides to both solve the crime and write about his investigation in a book for a school project.<br /><br />Solving the crime will be difficult for Christopher for several reasons related to his autism. He is unable to understand why people react the way they do. He can't decode metaphors such as I laughed my head off, since the person still has their head. He can't look at people and use their facial expressions as a clue to what they are saying. He becomes overwhelmed by strangers, crowds, loud noises, and being touched and throws himself on the floor, rocking and moaning when he feels overwhelmed. But solving the mystery is only part of the story as Christopher's investigation reveals something else that he could never have expected.<br /><br />The story itself is a framework that Haddon uses to show what autism might feel like from inside the mind of an autistic person. There is a logic to the mind of Christopher and by using the first person Haddon makes Christopher a believable and understandable and sympathetic character. This makes even the common place become engrossing as we struggle with Christopher to perform the simplest of tasks. For example, buying a ticket and getting on a train becomes a page-turner as Christopher struggles with crowds and noises and smells.<br /><br />Haddon has written a brilliant novel that has that rare quality of being worth re-reading. I don't know if this book actually reflects the mind of a person with autism but I do know that it is thoroughly fascinating, unique, and enjoyable. I can strongly recommend this book.t I do know that it is thoroughly fascinating, unique, and enjoyable. I can strongly recommend this book.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It wasn't until I recently watched the two-hour Confessions concert on t.v. (CBS) Thanksgiving Eve that my eyes opened wide to Madonna's talent and energy.  A few days later, I ordered the \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" CD.  I've been listening to her music since her first hit \\"Borderline\\" in the early 80's.  I always thought she was \\"good\\" but I was never a huge fan.  Not until I saw the concert last month on t.v. that is.  I was only going to tune in for \\"a few minutes\\" and ended up being mesmerized for the whole two hours by her fantastic music and unbelievable dancing and singing; I thought she also looked pretty, depending on her hairstyle and her costumes.  I think Madonna is better now than ever and I'm hooked!  Even a non-fan would love this CD.  (I believe she co-wrote every song, too.)  I find myself listening to it every day and my body just can't keep still--it has to move to the great beats.  Madonna helps bring back those disco days of the late 70's and early 80's--only better.  I'd call it \\"futuristic disco.\\"  You captured my attention, Madonna.  You just get better with age, and I sure do admire your many talents.
B000J103YI|5.0|I've seen Dreamgirls twice and I'm going a third time.  I love this soundtrack to the point that I can't stop playing it.  I can't get enough.  I still get goosebumps when I hear Jennifer belt out her songs.  What a wonderful singer.  Every did a wonderful job.  This is a must get CD.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|2 stars is \\"I don't like it\\", 3 stars is \\"It's OK\\". I can't say \\"I don't like it\\" to anything Beatles. So it has to be 3 stars, OK. I guess if you are the type who examines every nuance in their music you might give it a 4-5. This album is OK for something different, but I enjoy the Beatles music as I remember it 35+ years ago, 13 original albums, plus the singles. I guess we can be happy that they aren't taking every out-take and every mix that Michael Jackson did and popping out new albums.
0743289412|1.0|I tortured myself by reading to the bitter end.  I wanted to be sure that the memory of this stupid book stayed with me for a long time so that I am never again tempted to read another Steven King novel.  I used to be his \\"biggest fan\\".  I own two copies of The Stand and have read each one more than once.  The Dead Zone was a masterpiece.  Have my reading tastes changed?  I think not. Something has happenend to my once favorite author.  Was it the accident?  Could it be greed?  Whatever, I no longer will be tortured.
0553573403|5.0|I had heard from a friend about the Ice and Fire series. I was very hesitant to pick up a book where the author's name included \\"R.R\\" in it. Perhaps I felt that he or his publicist were trying to invoke the spirit of the grandmaster, J.R.R. Tolkein, in an attempt to cash in on publicity. No matter. The book stood alone for itself, though Martin has a long way to go to earn that \\"R.R.\\". The level of detail, characterization, plot, and \\"worn-world\\" feel to the lands described within the text astonishes. Truly, the world feels like it is 8,000 years old, and Martin \\"shows\\" rather than \\"tells\\" the reader of the world's history, unlike Robert Jordan's bloated \\"Wheel of Time\\" time series. Martin does it just right, and it pays off. What the reader is left with is a well-written book that opens up for a sequel. As a final word, it appears that either you love this book or you hate it. I've seen enough reveiws that either praise Martin or condemn him. I'll have to place myself in the camp of the former.
B000J103YI|5.0|This show is absolutely the best musical I have seen in years. The set, the music, was absolutely enthralling. Jennifer Hudson has come such a long way from American Idol. Who would have known she could blow audiences away with not only her voice, but acting ability. The music was moving and sweeps you along to the point you actually feel part of the happenings on the screen. This is a must see and a must buy for anyone who truly enjoys music. I don't feel she stole the show, I feel she OWNED the screen and the music. Beyonce was just along for the ride.
0307346609|4.0|The people who gripe about this book being leftist propaganda make me smile. It's funny, because a relative of mine who read the book said just the opposite.  That WWZ was nothing but a right wing fantasy where all the communist governments are destroyed and replaced with either theocracies or Capitalistic paradises.  That the UN is powerless in the face of the Zombie invasion and only the US can save the world.  So which book is it?,  Left Wing or Right Wing diatribe?  I read it and saw neither.  I guess if your worldview is stunted to only see the Left or Right wing point of view then yes, this book isn't for you.  But then again, most books probably wouldn't be for you.  Best if you stick to Ann Coulter/Michael Moore rants.
B000002H2H|5.0|In my opinion I think this is the greatest hard rock/thrash/heavy metal band there ever was. What seperates them from the other bands is they have good lyrics and do not growl like the cookie monster. Plus their songs are long and not like most bands who only play a song 2-3 mins. Theirs goes on for like 5-10 mins. They have excellent guitar riffs in MOP and RTL. Although I have to say RTL is my favorite because it has From whom the bell tolls and especially fade to black. But Master of Puppets comes a very close second. if you really like this album I suggest also buying MOP and AJFA.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Go and see this movie, and if you've seen it, simply recommend it. Here's why. This movie, despite reasons, stirs up a lot of passionate controversy. You may not feel that my comment is relevant to this movie, though I say that it is more relevant than any other comment posted, which is why it may not seem so.      First of all, the only thing that bothered me, is, why did it take so long to release it world wide? Why is Australia still waiting for the DVD? Maybe the makers had no authority over the marketers.     My perspective. Emotions make more sense that logic, yet so many people make little use of this. In school very few understand the nature of probability or the Law of Similars. These are symptoms of decadence. For instance, I have a plant in my room that was ugly and while I try to like all my plants equally, I wanted to remove this plant, even throw it outside so that it could die (I never would of course). A few weeks later, my mum told me that it was not growing properly and needs more sunlight. Makes sense now. Now it has more sun, and my nasty feelings towards it are passing. `Bad' feelings go hand in hand with `bad' situations. This is so true that so many don't realize much of the meaning of it. Emotions are our brains link to the rest of the world. If you want to have your brain so you can survive, and yet be blessed with more room to grow, realizing your emotions is a key.       The brain is not responsible for consciousness, it only remembers it.     Beyond global warming, there is change ahead. Here is how I see, status quo. You deny the impending destruction, for you do not want to mourn. You are a frustrated fighter for the world, for you have determined your loss. The life around you is wretched, for are battling yourself to see it. You don't know what to do, for you over-simplified the situation. You are angered by the fighters, for your shared loss makes you kin. You taste freedom for short moments, until again you fall behind.    I will not sacrifice myself for the system, for I strive to be the system at its best.
B00000K3CK|3.0|'Miracle on 34th Street' is still an enduring holiday movie.  There is a lot of novelty to draw upon.  A man from a nursing home takes over the Santa helm at Macy's Department store and has all the charm and warmth to replace his drunken predecessor in a pinch. He's liked well enough until he takes the role seriously enough to proclaim he is 'the' Santa Claus and even writes it on his job form.  Although endearing, he alarms his employer who objects when he insists to his daughter (Natalie Wood, who looks the same when she's grown up, only smaller) that Santa is the real and he's the real McCoy.  The cynical won't have it, and Macy's psychiatrist and a local politician behind the judge (William Frawley, later Fred of 'I Love Lucy' fame) analyse the situation until it becomes a ticklish affair among the press.  With some realistic acting by key players and a fun premise that is both fanciful and true-to-life, 'Miracle on 34th Street' is believable enough to keep us all going.
B0007XT87G|5.0|PT are a recent discovery to me, one that I wish had been made a few years ago - but the exciting part is being able to add awesome albums such as 'Deadwing' to my music collection. This was my second PT album, after 'In Absentia' and both are 5 star albums in their own right - I am not going to compare them.<br /><br />The thing I love about PT is the ambient sound in every song they write. The title song gives you a good taste of the variety PT has within their sound. The next two songs are almost polar opposites, beginning with the heavy guitars and breakdowns of 'Shallow' and moving from there to the beautiful piano melodies and soothing vocals of 'Lazarus'.<br /><br />On 'Deadwing' there are traces of Tool, Coldplay, Pink Floyd, Janes Addiction, and many other great rock bands - yet you cannot find these songs repeated on any other album. This is unique and beautiful musicianship that would greatly increase the quality of your music collection.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: If you are a fan of unique progressive rock music then you should definitely purchase some music by 'Pain of Salvation'. Read my review on their album 'Remedy Lane' - they are ridiculously talented.
B00000K19E|5.0|One of the most satisfying movie experiences of all time, `The Matrix' will most likely be remembered...forever.  Despite Keanu's dry acting (this guy is horrible) a memorable character was born in Neo and his journey is one we won't soon forget.  The film is so much more than an action movie, giving us a deep and involving plot that challenges the audience to think hard about what's really going on.   <br /> <br />Neo (Reeves), a software technician with a hacking fetish, finds out first hand what his life really amounts to when he's introduced to Morpheus (Fishburne in a role that, get this, was originally offered to Russell Crowe).  Morpheus gives Neo the opportunity to embrace his reality, showing him that the world he knows is not the world in which he really lives.  The world itself has been destroyed and has been replaced by the Matrix, a faux world created by the robot rulers who are growing humans like batteries to keep themselves sustained.  Neo then agrees to leave the comforts of this Matrix in order to aid Morpheus in the fight for freedom from these robots.   <br /> <br />The special affects are out of this world, and the concept is one we've never entertained so it's fresh and exciting.  The acting is a bit bland, but the actors are not really the stars here.  I will say though that this was a big break out for two stars, Carrie-Anne Moss who plays Neo's love interest Trinity, and Hugo Weaving who plays the evil Agent Smith, a villain for the ages.   <br /> <br />`The Matrix' is that movie that started a movement, that movie that is beloved and followed and worshiped and campaigned as of one the greatest achievements in cinema and is surely one of the more respected films of our generation.  The Washowski brothers have created a film that will never be matched (maybe that's why they should have stopped here instead of pressing their luck with a trilogy).
0618680004|4.0|Although this book for me is preaching to the choir it is nevertheless a very thought-provoking work.  There are a lot of interesting new ideas in here I had not thought about before.    The majority of the book goes along pretty smooth, making consistently great points, but then towards the end it veers off into really off-the-wall stuff, namely the final chapter where he's going on about the burka, Middle World, space between atoms and whatnot.  I can dig the idea of perceiving a narrow band of light and such, but introducing such heavy conceptual stuff seemed to make the book end with a fizzle rather than a bang.  I guess I can't blame him, the guy's a science nerd after all.  <br /> <br />This is the problem of the god\evolution\creation issue, it brings two groups of people with vastly different concerns together to argue about the same apparent issues.  Academic, bookwormy biologists and soccer moms who just want their kids to be nice Christian goody two shoes are both at each other's throats.  It's almost surreal.  It's like people who are into model airplanes vs. people who are into scrapbooking arguing over which brand of lawnmower is best. It's the oddest combination!  Okay, maybe not that weird, but weird nevertheless. <br /> <br />It's a good book, I enjoyed reading it but I have my doubts about it being a good tool of mainstream persuasion towards atheism.  I hope I am wrong.
B000BCE918|5.0|Let it be said that $20 for three DVD's is a pretty good deal, and while I generally try and write my reviews on the movie itself and not the packaging, this is all about the package.  This is a great deal, regardless if you LOVE all three films.  Personally the third installment isn't one I'll watch again anytime soon, but for $20 I'll take it.  The first film is a classic, the second is a worthy sequel and the third is generic mindless entertainment with a corny plot but great CGI so it makes up for it in the long run.  I'm sure just about everyone ahs seen these three films and has their own opinions on them, but just know that if you like these movies and have yet to own them, this is the way to go.  The package is cool and the price is even better.  This will make any DVD collection a little more complete!
B000J3EEBY|1.0|I've been a fan of Loreena McKennitt, but this one was a negative shock.  To begin with - ONCE I was forced to play \\"An Ancient Muse\\" on my portable CD player, I still found that while my back was turned, she hasn't done anything by way of building on what she'd started.  To make matters more obnoxious, every time I tried to play the darned CD on my computer, I only got directed to Ms. McKinnitt's self-agrandizing WEBSITE.  Not nice, and my system is pretty much set up to play what's thrown up there. <br /> <br />I wish I'd had a chance to preview the latest.  Had I been given the chance, I would have passed! So much for trust in consistency! I DO hold out hope for the DVD she's supposed to be putting out in March.  It begins w/ a piece that I've loved for years. Go figure. <br /> <br />If you haven't bought the \\"vintage\\" Loreena, I DO suggest you do so - if her website doesn't block you from previewing you from previewing her earlierm and much better stuff.  I recommend \\"The Mask and the Mirror\\" for starters.   <br /> <br />Barb Taylor <br /> <br />
B0000032LS|4.0|I first saw RHPS when I was six years old, back when the 15th anniversary VHS came out. The majority of the film went over my head, but the music always stuck with me. <br />Of course, it isn't the greatest music ever made. But, it's fun.
0385338694|5.0|Even my mother, who ordinarily requires non-stop action and intrigue, enjoyed this novel.  Although I love all the Becky Bloomwood (Shopaholic) books and found Emma Corrigan (Can You Keep a Secret?) very sweet.  I believe this to be Kinsella's best yet! <br /> <br />Kinsella's writing style is so entertaining, there really are no low points.  This book is like cotton candy--it's just so sweet and engrossing, fluffy and just ...good!  Don't look for much realism here but instead find a GREAT pick-me-up for any lingering post-holiday blues.
0060776757|5.0|I received this book as a Christmas gift, and I am very pleased with it. The book includes tons of photos and the story of U2 as told by the members of the band. At first I was worried that the text would be pretty dry and not reveal anything new. I was pleasantly suprised by the honesty of the band members as they look back over their tremendous careers.<br /><br />I was a huge U2 fan in the 80s and early 90s, but started to lose interest after Zooropa and Pop. The members of the band talk about why things did not go well, and their return to the top with All that You Can't Leave Behind and their most recent album. I also learned a lot more meaning about their songs. The story behind Miracle Drug is powerful.<br /><br />If you are a serious U2 fan then you should own this book. It makes for a great coffee table addition, and is actually worth the read. Walk On!
B000E5KJGQ|4.0|Before Full Metal Jacket was released on HD DVD, I refused to watch it because for some reason Stanley Kubrick's intentions were to distribute it in Full Screen rather than the way it was filmed in Widescreen on DVD. Now that the HD DVD version is released and in Widescreen I finally got a chance to see the film, and I'll tell you my thoughts. <br /> <br />This is one of the most realistic war movies I've ever seen. It's about 2 hours long in length but it feels like an hour. It shows how kids were broken down and built back up into killing machines. Some of the things they say can be disturbing when describing their rifle. The movie will often shock you, make you laugh, and depress you. Lee Ermey will blow you away with his role as Gunny Hartman the drill sargent. <br /> <br />Visually, this is a so-so picture. While most of the film has a decent clarity, there is also an undeniable amount of grain during parts of the film. This isn't because it's an HD DVD, it's also the same case with the Blu-Ray version.  HD DVD's have an incredible reputation with visual clarity, Blu-Ray on the other hand... well, I suppose this title fits in perfectly with other Blu-Ray movies when it comes to visual clarity. Warner Brothers could have done more than they did, perhaps in the distant future it'll be revisited. However, since the film is so good and absorbing and finally seeing it in Widescreen with some high definition at all makes it an incredible experience. <br /> <br />Overall, if you're just getting an HD DVD player all I can say is that there's many other titles that have a groundbreaking showcase of high definition BUT if you want a movie that's truly a classic and will blow you away with the lack of real visual clarity at times, this movie is it.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I have seen about 50 or more movies this year and I have to say I enjoyed The Prestige the most. It won't win any awards like The Departed, but it sure will entertain you. Christian Bale is an amazing actor as always, but Hugh Jackman really surprised me here, as well as, David Bowie himself. There are so many twists and turns I am sure you will be watching this one more than once. While I liked The Illusionist, The Prestige is the magic film of 2006!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I played this DVD-audio on my Bose Lifestyle system that can't take full advantage of the DVD-audio version, but does play in in the 5.1 surround sound.  I can't even imagine what it must sound like on a dvd audio player.  The sound is incredible even on my system.  It comes with a regular CD of the same songs.  Even in a room with not the greatest acoustics I can tell the difference.  Closing my eyes and listening to George Harrison sing \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" is like having him sitting right in my family room.<br /><br />I didn't think there would ever be anything new with the old Beatles songs but I was wrong.  'Everything old is new again!'  I hope George Martin does more of these with some of the other albums.
0618680004|2.0|Clearly Dawkins no longer feels the need to mask his own personal convictions wholly under the guise of \\"objective science.\\" In this book, Dawkins lays bare the engine that has driven and inspired his entire life work - his own personal ideologies and subjective beliefs.     We're talking here about belief in answers to life's deeper questions and issues - the nature of reality, the purpose of life, the existence of God. After reading this book it is now easier to accept that many of Dawkins' previous bold statements, such as \\"the survival of DNA is the ultimate rational for our existence\\" (River Out of Eden, 1996), are not scientific statements at all. Rather, they are Dawkins' own subjective views - held in Dawkins' mind with equal zeal as a religious fundamentalist.     Conclusions regarding the purpose or non-purpose of life, or relating to why the universe is here in the first place, are based on philosophical ideologies - answers reached beyond the scope of science. Dawkins has always cheekily stepped over this line by (con)fusing scientific enquiry with his own subjective beliefs. But in `the God Delusion', Dawkins hurls himself over the line completely, unashamedly declaring his views that there is no purpose to the cosmos, that God does not exist, and that nothing continues beyond the veil of death.    Dawkins' case against the existence of God in this book is actually an enormous straw man argument. He identifies God exclusively with the narrow religious `fundamentalist' point of view, undermines it, and concludes that anyone who believes in God is therefore intellectually bankrupt. Yet Dawkins seems unaware that his argument against this narrow interpretation of life and God leaves only fertile ground for a more spiritually mature religious point of view, which I'm sure will rise in the popular mind as the human race evolves.    In our finite, human state, I believe that we must learn to discern the difference between the cleverness of the head and the wisdom of the heart. Science is the tool by which we can explore and describe the physical world. But we must begin to tune into our inner-intuition and spiritual awareness in order to discern answers to life's deeper questions and mysteries.     Dawkins believes that all theists and religionists are slow-witted. However, as humanity evolves, human consciousness will surely continue to expand, and a new frame of reference and state of awareness will likely change our entire perspective on everything. Clearly, our religious mythologies are mankind's early attempts to describe cosmic events of which the human mind can barely conceive, but of which the soul is deeply aware. To interpret such tales and mythologies as literal scientific accounts, as Dawkins insists upon doing, is to miss the point completely. I believe that people throughout the ages have already attained a mature degree of spiritual awareness, and such states of consciousness will eventually grow and become embedded in the popular mind. Humanity will then be deluded no more.
B0002Z1EG2|1.0|If you want all the hits, then I wouldn't bother with this one.  Rather then a portfolio of all her hit singles, this compilation seems to be another disc full of personal picks from some record company executive.  It seems to have a few of her big ones like, \\"you're still the one\\", \\"that don't impress me\\", \\"up\\", \\"I'm gonna getcha good\\", and  horrible versions of \\"from this moment on\\", \\"man I feel like a woman\\", \\"you win my love\\" and a dull sounding version of \\"don't be stupid\\".  This compilation totally overlooks the singles \\"if you're not in it for love\\", and \\"you've got a way with me\\".  I was lucky enough to have had a listen to it at my local record store in Hurstville, otherwise this would have been a regretful purchase.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|An Ancient Muse is an excellent album.  I find myself listening to it often while working or driving around town.  If you're new to Loreena McKennitt, I suggest starting off with her earlier albums, such as The Mask and Mirror or The Book of Secrets (those contain some of her best vocals).  However if you're a fan of her music already then you'll most likely enjoy this album just as much as the others.  She obviously goes for a different style and theme for this album compared to her previous releases, and I can respect that.  It's not my favorite of her collections, but the quality of the music and her voice is still top notch. <br /> <br />I'm just glad I have something new to listen to from her.  After hearing The Book of Secrets back at its release I snatched up each and every one of her previous major albums and enjoy them all.  Selfishly I feel deprived over the last decade from the lack of a new release from her, and my hopes are high that she'll continue to produce excellent music in the years to come. <br /> <br />Her music is unique and I haven't found anything else that quite fills her niche as well as she does.
B000JVT1U0|4.0|`The Wicker Man' done originally in 1974 is a great English cult film, similar in many ways to the earlier English film version of William Golding's high school favorite novel, `Lord of the Flies'. And, just like `Lord of the Flies', we are now treated to a Hollywood remake of this classic with co-producer Nicholas Cage in the lead role created by Australian actor, Edward Woodward in the original flick.<br /><br />I am happy to say that the remake of `The Wicker Man' is better than the remake of `Lord of the Flies', where the filmmakers seemed to totally miss the point of Golding's story. The new `The Wicker Man' did change a fair amount of the story, but largely what was really essential to moving the scene from an island off Scotland to an American island in Washington State, in Puget Sound.<br /><br />The primary problem faced by the filmmakers is that in the original story, much was made of the traditional English class system with a traditional Manor House landlord, emphasis on the `lord' business in charge of the `private island' with an otherwise very peculiar social system. The modern storytellers got a lot of mileage out of their paradigm shift from English noble to cult matriarch at the head of a little society patterned after the society of bees, which happens to also be the island's main industry, replacing the orchard agriculture in the English original. These changes are to the good. The only problem with the switch from apples to bees is that while apples are not normally grown on the Scottish islands, bees are not at all out of place in Puget Sound. This looses a useful clue to the unusual nature of this island community.<br /><br /> Another fairly effective change is to make the lead character policeman (Cage) allergic to bee stings. Somewhat less effective is providing the California policeman with a back story which connects him to a resident of the Summersisle community (The modern movie adds an extra `s' to aid in pronouncing the name), making him the father of the missing little girl, the bait which the mother uses to draw cop Cage to the island.<br /><br />I think the problem with this backstory is that while Cage and Woodward are both playing policemen, Cage is out of his jurisdiction and his police authority is really a shadow with no real weight. Woodward, on the other hand, has official standing on his island and is fully authorized to make arrests and conduct investigations.<br /><br />Otherwise, the story plays out in almost exactly parallel scenes starting at the point at which Cage arrives at on the island.<br /><br />The original movie had a purely realistic story, where the only supernatural element was in the island inhabitants' beliefs. There were no supernatural threats and not even too many menacing flashbacks or dreams. The remake remained true to this point of view, and improved on it just a bit by drawing parallels between the Summersisle community and the Amish, where both exhibited anti-technological biases. I think I also saw a hint of parallel being drawn to the puritan witches of Salem, Massachusetts.<br /><br />Of course, nature was called in to help out by blanking out cell phone reception on the island. One problem both movies shared is that they were marketed as `horror' movies. While the sense of threat is constant throughout most of the movie, it is not really the kind of supernatural threat we get in most Stephen King stories. Like `Psycho' and `Ten Little Indians', the source of threat is entirely based on purely human, albeit quite pathological, behavior. The isolated venue does create similarities with stories such as `Alien' and `House on Haunted Hill' where the victim(s) are physically cut off from any outside help, but here, the primary thing keeping Cage / Woodward on the island is the obsession with the lost girl. I also note a strong similarity with the movie `Don't Look Now' where the plot is driven by fleeting glimpses of a little lost girl.<br /><br />In the end,the modern `The Wicker Man' makes the Summersisle inhabitants just a bit more loony and therefore just a bit less believable in their realistic setting. While one can easily imagine descendants of Druids celebrating May Day with animalistic costumes, neither the Amish nor a hippie holdover connection works quite as well. Too bad cinema finances prevented the filmmakers from keeping the venue back in the old country. While Cage is a superb actor, I think Woodward's matter of fact, `just the facts, Madam' tone of the English constable fits against the background of the tree worshipping islanders. The islanders don't have to be quite so bizarre to stand out behind Woodward's low-key tone. This also means that the original movie gives much less away early on. The unraveling of the threat and the climax comes more slowly and subtly. But when it does, it's a far bigger surprise.<br /><br />Last but not least, I think the current director, Neil LaBute, should have studied the camera work on the last scene of the original more carefully. The original director did a much better job of revealing the climax venue, even in black and white.<br /><br />So, while Cage is ultimately a more interesting actor than Woodward, I would still recommend the original over the remake if what you want is a really good rendition of the story. I will say that the modern `The Wicker Man' has my favorite DVD extra, a commentary soundtrack including the director, editor, and a few of the lesser actors (I think casting Ellen Burstyn was a waste of her talent. They did such a good job of casting the minor women on the island, but Burstyn just didn't seem to work as the queen bee.). This commentary easily doubles the value of the DVD. The `shocking Alternate Ending' is just a bit more graphic violence added to the telling of the final scene, which adds nothing to the meat of the story.r />In the end, the modern `The Wicker Man' makes the Summersisle inhabitants just a bit more loony and therefore just a bit less believable in their realistic setting.

B000K4WPCC|5.0|This supernatural thriller was a feast for the eyes, in more ways than one. The subject matter and mythology surrounding witchcraft is fascinating, and provides an intriguing background for this movie. The special effects are breathtaking and intense, and (I'm not going to lie) it doesn't hurt that the male leads are all pretty easy on the eyes.<br /><br />The details of the story are difficult to explain without giving too much away. Caleb and his friends are whats known as the Sons of Ipswich. They are the first born sons of the five founding families of their town in Massechusetts. In the past, during the notorious witch hunt in Massechusetts, their families were all accused of practicing witchcraft....and their accusers were right. Caleb and his friends each possess powers and supernatural abilities beyond anything you've ever seen. When they turn 18, their powers will reach their peak potential, and they will \\"ascend\\". But as in all things in nature, there is a delicate balance that must be maintained, and these powers come with a price.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film mostly for the ridiculously awesome special effects. From a cinematography standpoint, it's very well made, and if for nothing else, at least watch this movie once to see all the cool things they do with camera angles and special effects.<br /><br />One of the things I liked most about this film was it's use of witchcraft mythology. Instead of the usual witchraft movies, such as \\"The Craft\\", this one used males instead of females as it's main characters/witches (I think that makes them warlocks). I found the backstory of their covenant almost more interesting than the present day story they were trying to tell. I wanted to hear more! I truly hope they make a sequel so that we can hear more witchcraft mythology, because I find it very fascinating.<br /><br />Admittedly, the guys who play the lead characters *do* look like they walked right off the pages of an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog...but why is it such a bad thing that they're good looking? (also, I should confess that there is a pool scene in the film that was so obviously put there specifically to show off these guys in their bathing suits. I just thought I should have full disclosure on this issue). The lead's acting abilities also occassionally waiver (thats what happens when you use unknowns in movies) but it's not enough to warrent a big tirade. The story is still entertaining, and the characters do well with what they are given.<br /><br />Also...there is definitely an abundance of girls running around in their underwear, so men shouldn't be complaining so much.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie is definitely worth checking out for it's awesome special effects, wicked cool music score, great eye candy, and intricate mythologically based storyline...but why is it such a bad thing that they're good looking?

0618680004|3.0|This is the first Dawkins book I have \\"read\\".  Actually, I listened to it in the six-CD audiobook version.  I highly recommend encountering Dawkins in the audio format - his words themselves are funny, intelligent, informed, and confident, but having his own even, British, and amiable voice present them heightens all these dimensions.  Dawkins is witty, and can be laugh-out-loud funny when pointing out the absurdities of unempirical beliefs when juxtaposed to his deadpan-yet-human, evidenced-based reality.  This juxtaposition also works in regard to creating reactions of horror when Dawkins points our attention to the atrocities that religious beliefs have fostered.  However, Dawkins can also come across as condescending, snarky, and insulting.  At one point in the piece he speaks on the evils of the \\"in-group\\" and \\"out-group\\" mentality.  Yet in reading him, I got the sense that if I could not somehow wholly understand and accept his supposedly self-evident take on the origins and processes of life, I was in an ignorant \\"out-group\\" myself.<br /><br />Dawkins does not combat the notion of God which considers God as simply the implicit beauty, structure, and interrelatedness of all things.  This is my idea of God, so from the first few pages, I was \\"out of the boxing ring\\" so to speak.  The agitation Dawkins creates in this book is between those who believe in a personal, material, omniscient presence who takes an active hand in individual and societal human affairs (often leading to bloodshed, rape, and persecution) and the sober, even-minded, rationalist, humanist, ecological-minded followers of science and empirical reality.<br /><br />The title \\"The God Delusion\\" actually only applies to the first three chapters, in which Dawkins tries to show that Intelligent Design theory or chance alone cannot hold up to statistics, evidence, and science as an explanatory measure for the creation of life and dynamic maintenance of life.  In these initial chapters, he postulatesthat a statistically improbable event (only needing to occur once) created life, and that natural selection is the only acceptable way to comprehend how living things came to be (evolved) as they are at present.  For the former assertion, he offers us mathematical probabilities of unfathomable magnitude as an explanation; of a billion-billion planets, the conditions for life as we know it only needed to occur once for life to begin.  Even if the chances for these conditions being met were one-to-one-billion against, there would still be one billion planets on which life occurred.  For the latter, he goes on to state that evidence of evolution can be found throughout all our biological and geological records, and that no irreducibly complex biological organism or apparatus has ever been found, meaning that all documented life at present had prior, less complicated iterations that gradually led up to the present one.<br /><br />While Dawkins has effectively ruled out chance as an explanation, for me, he has not succeeded in ruling out Intelligent Design.  I do not believe in a personal God who created everything from `His' will.  I have nothing vested in whether or not a personal God created things, or if the cause was a combination of naturally occurring and symbiotic processes.  Rather, Dawkins simply just did not do enough to convince me that his own position was unassailably correct.  Instead, he spends the majority of his time here trying to demonstrate how and why his opponents (the Intelligent Design theorists) are wrong.  He asserts that Intelligent Design has failed on a scientific level, that it merely searches for gaps in current scientific understanding to call its domain, that it has tried to foist the burden of proof upon the skeptics rather than provide any evidence itself, that it is a closed door that calls for an arresting of answer-seeking, and that it tries to win out through defaultism where science itself has yet been unable to provide a properanswer.<br /><br />This deriding of Intelligent Design theory - Dawkins' whole argument - occurs within the parameters of science, its methods, and its mindset.  Dawkins is utterly incapable of accepting any mysticism or supernatural phenomenon on any level.  Everything must be able to be dissected by our instruments.  He hypothesizes that our ability to understand may be \\"limitless\\"; we must simply keep searching.  Dawkins claims himself free of dogma, yet he stands entrenched in the belief that everything can be revealed to our senses if we take the proper approach, give it enough time and thought, and have the proper instruments.<br /><br />This immutability of position is indeed dogmatic.  Dawkins does concede that he will change his position when evidence of an irreducibly complex biological mechanism is found.  Yet in making this concession, he has hypocritically made use of the same reverse burden-of-proof tactic he accuses the Intelligent Design theorists of using.  In effect, he has said:  \\"Everything is understandable.  I cannot prove this because we cannot understand everything, and we have not even discovered everything there is to understand or not understand, but the burden-of-proof lies on the skeptics to find something that can never be understood.\\"  This is not a real quote; it is a hypothetical, and is in the same vein as the hypothetical quotes Dawkins' uses in this book to make his opponents appear foolish.  However, it does accurately represent the spirit of Dawkins' own reversal of the burden-of-proof.  Shouldn't the burden be on science to prove that everything is understandable by understanding everything?  Of course this is silly; yet this is the type of argument Dawkins uses over and over to win us to his side.<br /><br />I personally feel that we passively receive certain experiences that are irreducibly complex, infinite and immeasurable, including love, intuition, purpose and inspiration (not to say that a personal God is behind them, but instead the God of interrelatedness).  Perhaps I am wrong; perhaps someday, the very final mystery will be solved, and the everything of everything will be known to us through assiduous scientific achievement.  Perhaps this is beside the point.  The point is that while Dawkins is capable of deriding the Intelligent Design viewpoint for failing almost every test of sober scientific rigor, he fails in thoroughly convincing me of accepting his own paradigm wholesale.  What he does certainly succeed in, however, is making me feel inadequate for being unable to do so.<br /><br />The final (majority) of the book is not dedicated to scientifically disproving the existence of a personal God, but rather, on musings of the negative effect of dogmatic belief (as seen in religiously-spurred rape, war, human sacrifice, murder, and us-vs.-them mentality), on proving that morality does not come from scripture and can indeed exist without religion, and otherwise further deriding those who are religious.  This section comes across as superfluous in relation to the unfinished job of the first chapters.  In failing to completely depose Intelligent Design (and therefore the morality and meaning-making constructs of a personal God) earlier, these later chapters cannot properly enthrone replacement paradigms for them.  Without fully disproving Intelligent Design, Dawkins cannot completely rend morality and meaning from God either.<br /><br />In this later section, I caught Dawkins more than once resorting to the same pseudo-scientific approach he so rails his opponents for; he hand-picks small samples to represent religious folks in a negative light, while implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, placing atheists outside of such evil, malicious ignorance; he often speculates, sometimes even admitting he did not do any statistical work beforehand, prefacing statements with phrases such as \\"I'll wager\\", and so on.  Once he has placed himself on a podium of logic, sobriety, realism and rationality in the first half of the book (on the bedrock of science), he is free to pontificate as he sees fit in the second half, wearing the badge of the expert, but with the bedrock inexplicably missing.<br /><br />This work must be taken more as a scientifically-informed opinion piece rather than a book of hard scientific fact.  It is highly entertaining, and it is a stunning work of how to present an argument meant to win others over to one's own side.  Dawkins is very educated, charismatic, intelligent, and well-meaning.  Yet it seems where he cannot win us with the facts (which is certainly how he would prefer to win us, and the means through which he does for the most part), he resorts to implicit psychological trickery (a skill at which all charismatic debaters are so adept) and statistical sleight-of-hand (relying on heuristics, hand-chosen examples and case studies, anecdotal evidence, etc.).  For all its faults, however, the book did get me thinking, and energized me to write this review.  In this manner it is very worthwhile - Dawkins, in all his aplomb and scathing wit, strikes me as the type of polarizing figure you either love or hate.  After another book or two of his, I will decide into which camp I fall.<br /><br />And then I will wage an ideological war on the other group.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|As great as the Pulse performance is, you wonder what a filming of the 1977 Animals tour could have yielded, when the original lineup was still in full creative force (By the time of The Wall, it was already crumbling).     Make no mistake, The Division Bell is an outstanding album, and Floyd does a phenomonal job of synching the musical performance with the accompanying film (can anyone explain to me how they do this?).  I can't help but wonder how much greater it could have all been had David Gilmour and Roger Waters put aside their egos and issues, and continued to make the greatest music of the latter quarter of the twentieth century.  What incredible stuff would they have created?  It boggles the soul.
B000HT386M|3.0|As is often the case these days, movies like CLICK are often promoted in ad spots by using some of their funniest bits.  If one watches the trailer for this movie one would assume that the plot would be rife with the usual predictable, though funny, stuff: stop-action with Adam Sandler making adjustments to achieve the usual mischief.  Unfortunately the best shtick is wasted in the promos.<br /><br />What actually emerges is a very interesting and serious movie about a man who, wanting to adjust his reality, discovers that things as they are aren't really that bad.  Christopher Walken plays an angel that shows the facts to Sandler's character.  What if things were different? What if you could fast forward through the bad and keep the good?  What if, what if, what if.  Sounds pretty good on the surface.<br /><br />But then something, in my opinion, goes decidedly wrong.  The writers and director decide to pack the film with a bunch of crude and disjointed jokes and themes that keep getting in the way.  Dogs humping legs and stuffed animals and each other may be funny once in a while but when the over-amorous canines go at it again and again and again...well...what the viewer gets is a boring, perverse \\"fake-fingernail-in-the-hamburger\\" experience that really gets in the way. And the canine crazies are the very least of the problems here.  There are plenty of tasteless human anatomical and sexual situations to give the dogs a solid run for the money.<br /><br />The story is wonderful and has a great message but it gets bogged down over and over by the unnecessary nonsense thrown in seemingly because we, the viewers, wouldn't want to see Sandler in a serious role.<br /><br />If you can find this one in some edited form, with all the crude and rude stuff appropriately excised do it.  Otherwise be prepared to wade through a lot of stuff that dilutes and diminishes the beauty of the story. Three stars (and that's being very generous) for the good that's there.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN/> <br />THE HORSEMAN
B00006RU5B|5.0|There is no greater singer than Chris Cornell, when his voice is right.  Tracks to take note of: Set it Off, Cochise, and the powerful Gasoline.  The combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine must have felt strange for fans of both bands, but within a couple of songs, you forget the past and realize that the chemistry works fine, and all things will be great as Chris belts out another winner.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|First off, the DVD is great, and that's probably the reason most people buy this set.  It's nice to have all the videos in one place.  As for the CD, it's a mish-mash and suffers as a result, but that's to be expected.  Most of the songs on here are just curiosities, especially the four reworked/acoustic versions of older songs.  You probably won't revisit them too often, with the possible exception of the acoustic \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\" which is very compelling.  Then there are EIGHT covers, which vary in quality.  The Deftones' interpretations of \\"Savory\\" and \\"The Chauffeur\\" are fantastic, and \\"Simple Man\\" and \\"No Ordinary Love\\" are also unique and good.  \\"Wax and Wane\\" is not a very good song in its own right, so I don't care for the cover.  Unfortunately, \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\" and \\"Please Please Please...\\" just aren't great covers.  Finally, there are two Deftones originals, \\"Crenshaw Punch\\" and \\"Black Moon.\\"  The first is a great addition to their catalogue, while the latter is purely a rap song which I don't like.  In terms of pacing, the disc is great until the four-song set of \\"Black Moon\\"-\\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\"-\\"Please Please Please...\\"-\\"Digital Bath (acoustic),\\" which almost kills it, though it's revived by \\"The Chauffeur.\\"  All in all, you're sure to enjoy several of these tracks (at least \\"Savory\\" and \\"The Chauffeur\\") as a Deftones fan, but you're also likely to find at least a couple of songs to be lacking.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is a great show for girls of all ages and the creative dialogue catches my hubby's attention. I wanted to say that the DVD box I got from Amazon was in perfect condition. I was concerned because I had trouble with the boxes I purchased from a warehouse store being damaged internally.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|The first couple of listens really didn't do it for me, but I've come to love this album.  It's not perfect, as the lyrics (though clearly sincere) are just a bit too cliche or corny at times, which results in one guilty pleasure, the immensely catchy \\"Dig,\\" as well as a complete throw-away, the surprisingly bad \\"Love Hurts.\\"  To open the alubm, \\"Quicksand\\" also has some dumb lyrics (\\"Some people fall in love and touch the sky, some people fall in love and find quicksand, I am somewhere in between\\"), but is atmospheric, Radiohead-ish even.  The triptych of the funky \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off,\\" aforementioned \\"Dig,\\" and supremely heavy and groovy \\"Anna Molly\\" is fantastic, then \\"Love Hurts\\" drags before \\"Light Grenades\\" rocks with reckless abandon which almost feels out of place at this point in the album.  A complete shift occurs with \\"Earth to Bella (Part I),\\" a touching ballad which morphs into an awesome jam (good lyrics here and great vocals too, as well as on Part II).  Then, two nice little pop songs in \\"Oil and Water\\" and \\"Diamonds and Coal\\" come in, and they both show evidence of musical maurity. \\"Rogues\\" blasts off next, and it's another winning rocker.  \\"Paper Shoes\\" is another ballad, but the tone explored in the music is further evidence of some musical growth and experimentation and fits the lyrics beautifully.  The album closes a little abruptly with \\"Pendulous Threads\\" and \\"Earth to Bella (Part II).\\"  The former is perhaps the most immediately catchy rocker on the album, even if it is just a little too similar at times lyrically to \\"Undone\\" by Weezer, while the latter is a continuation of the first part and is great, but as I wrote before, ends the album a bit abruptly. All in all, however, a mostly well-paced album, with really only one outright bad song (which is true of every Incubus album).  The leaps and bounds here aren't as significant as those taken on \\"A Crow Left of the Murder,\\" but they're just as rewarding.  The basic themes of this album arebrighter than the last one, and as a result, the musical shift is toward poppier material, which might alienate the fans who miss the rap-metal (I'm not one of them).  Still, this is a fantastic, interesting release from a band that's only getting better with time.
0694003611|5.0|My goddaughter got this book, and it not only gave her something to look forward to at bedtime, she learned how to say goodnight to all. So, naturally when my cousin had his baby, I thought this was the perfect book. They learned what the moon was, and the importance of reading. Even if it was before bed. I highly recommnend this book as a very easy read and a lot of fun.
6305508550|5.0|I loved this movie!  For me it summarized corporate life as I knew it!  Y2K, multiple bosses, mission statements, downsizing, marginal job security, consultants, cubicles, the tedium and frustration of commuting, etc.  I laugh everytime I watch this movie.  If you have ever worked in the technology field during Y2K and after, you have to see this movie!!!

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is on of my favorites by Madonna. This cd just keeps feeding on itself as the songs blend into one another- non-stop. You can catch a song starting at the end of the one before it. <br />Madonnas' TV special really caught my ear. Bought Confessions on a Dance Floor and am glad I did!!!
B000002I27|4.0|There are some cuts that hold up better than you'd expect and others that make one glad we've reached the digital age where we can hit a button and skip to the next track.  Still, all in all, this is a fine upgrade if you're still listening to vinyl.  Come on, Jim Morrison died for you, spend for the record companies that exploited him.
0066620996|5.0|This book will (probably) terrify you if you work. Clearly outlining critical characteristics of super-successful companies it show over and over again why most companies are not. Think about where you work, and how you invest, in the light of what the authors discuss. Highly recommended for anyone thinking about becoming a CEO or engaged in a CEO search.
0743298020|5.0|Steeped in the Brontes, DuMaurier, Wilkie Collins, and The Turn of the Screw, this book is at once a throwback to the 19th century and a thoroughly modern reinvention of the gothic story. Setterfield lovingly lifts generic tropes from these classic tales while weaving a story that is utterly hypnotizing and deeply human. <br /> <br />At heart, this is a book about a fictional famous author, and Setterfield evokes a sense of yearning for these nonexistent works. I found myself wishing I could go to the library and dive into Miss Winter's reportedly vast oeuvre, imagining that she'd be a British version of Shirley Jackson, or a slightly domesticated Patricia Highsmith. Setterfield sustains this tension without letting it overwhelm the book, and delivers a payoff that is surprising and satisfying. <br /> <br />Above all, this is a book suffused with the distinct pleasures of reading. I was won completely on page 32. I read this passage and thought, \\"Oh, she knows!\\" <br /> <br />    \\"Of course, one always hopes for something special when one reads an author one hasn't read before, and Miss Winter's books gave me the same thrill I had when I discovered the Landier diaries, for instance. But it was more than that. I have always been a reader; I have read at every stage of my life, and there has never been a time when reading was not my greatest joy. And yet I cannot pretend that the reading I have done in my adult years matches in its impact on my sould the reading I did as a child. I still believe in stories. I still forget myself when I am in the middle of a good book. Yet it is not the same. Books are, for me, it must be said, the most important thing; what I cannot forget is that there was a time when they were at once more banal and more essential than that. When I was a child, books were everything. And so there is in me, always, a nostalgic yearning for the lost pleasure of books. It is not a yearning that one ever expects to be fulfilled. And during this time, these days when I read all day and half the night, when I slept under a counterpane strewn with books, when my sleep was black and dreamless and passed in a flash and I woke to read again-the lost joys of reading returned to me. Miss Winter restored to me the virginal qualities of the novice reader, and then with her stories she ravished me.\\" <br /> <br />I know what she means. Nothing will ever be for me what it was to read Rebecca when I was a lonely middle-schooler, reading it over and over because I needed to know that being alone was something that could be borne. If Mrs. de Winter could survive Manderley, then I could survive seventh grade. <br /> <br />Another such book was Edith Hamilton's Mythology. I still have my copy that I read to death in elementary school, missing front and back cover and most of the spine, and when I pick it up I can't read it properly, because the words knit the stories into my head. The most haunting part for me was her transition from the Greeks and Romans to the Norse. With a few simple sentence she conjured for me the reality of mortality, something that I knew that I didn't want to know, but couldn't stay away. My affinity for this book took me to the point of hiding it from myself. I was so enraptured by the stories that I wondered in earnest if I was hurting Jesus's feelings by reading them, and so I put them away. <br /> <br />Tom Robbins once said that all smokers are Prometheus, and I say that all readers are Pandora. I think Setterfield would agree with me, and I'm pleased to let her know that she might not have given me Vida Winter's books, but she gave me what Margaret Lea found in them-a read that stopped time.
0307346609|1.0|Three hundred plus pages and not a single original idea. Slow, drifting writing with out much imagination. Truly a waste of time I'm very sorry to say, especially since it came highly recommeded from someone who usually leads me to great books.
B000003FPN|5.0|The Polka & Fugue from Weinberger's opera \\"Schwanda the Bagpiper\\" is one of my favorite examples of the CSO trumpet section utilizing their incredible dynamic range (this time on the ffff end of the spectrum)to provide one of the most exhilarating musical experiences imaginable.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Really a very fine collection of great Celtic croons!  If you enjoy the pure clarity of Celtic female vocalists, such as Enya or Loreena McKennit, you will definitely be pleased with this album.<br /><br />I have given this as a gift to many friends, and all have been most happy with the album!<br /><br />Downside?  Well, there could be more songs on the album...but there is a sequel or companion album available, now...so that is not a very valid complaint.<br /><br />I suggest breaking the album selections up with a few Juluka or Ladysmith Black Mambazo songs, just to give contrast and variety.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000IU3XTW|4.0|If you didn't get to check out the Foo Fighters on last summer's acoustic tour, you missed a truly special experience. I don't know why more bands don't do this, but with the extra musicians and different interpretations, the band really put a lot of work into making this a unique show. The CD reflects that, with some of the set's best songs included on this album. Some of it is a little overdone (glad Dave got to play Marigold, but the change in tempo and addition of all the extra instruments changed the feel of the song...and not for the better), but in all this is absolutely worth buying. My only complaint is that they should have left in at least some of his between-songs banter. One thing that sets the Foo Fighters apart is how affable a frontman Dave Grohl is. He tells hilarious stories, so why not leave in at least a couple? Blink-182 knew this was a key element of their live shows, and chose to include it on their live album. The Foo Fighters should have done the same, since Dave is just as entertaining between songs as he is during them. Still, this album is worth buying.

B000JJRIN4|2.0|The only reason I'm not giving this 1 star is because I like \\"Wind It Up\\" and because there are \\"singers\\" like Hilary Duff out there. <br />This is the first time I've disappointed by any album put out by Gwen/No Doubt. Normally I check out a CD before I buy it but Gwen has become one of the few artists where I'd just pick up the CD blindly. I am regretting it this time.  <br />From the first time I looked at this CD I got the feeling it had been quickly slapped together, right down to the photos which are all the same (what's with that wig?).  <br />\\"Breakin' Up\\" is actually a song that I'm embarrassed to hear. It's that bad. I don't think the lyrics are clever at all. In fact, the vocal rhythms are often imprecise in this CD, and at times it sounds like the drum track is behind, and needs to be tweaked a bit. <br />Well, I'm going to continue to give this a chance; I normally love Gwen through and through.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I found this movie to be one of the most hilarious movies I have watched in a while.  Yes, the comedy is somewhat dark. Yes, the family is dysfunctional. But, how many families do not have some level of dysfunction running amuk in their closets, as as this movie illustrates, in full exposure?  \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" puts the shadows of the psyche's of the members of this family on the table and revels in their idiosyncries and shortcomings.  Regardless of their problems, the family supports each other and bands together to journey on their quest to Olive's beauty pagent.  Throughout the trip, laden with numerous disappointments and stressful situations, events occur that propel them toward unraveling facets of their angst. I don't know if I can point out one specific scene as the best of the movie, but the dance scene is definately over the top!
B000J103YI|5.0|This electric soundtrack to the movie Dreamgirls crackles with energy and does not disappoint. I commend these fine performers for doing their own singing throughout the soundtrack to the motion picture. Moreover, although Amazon writes that Jennifer Hudson could not outdo Jennifer Holiday as Effie; I believe that at the very least Hudson matched Holiday when she sings the beautiful, passionate and heartbreaking ballad \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going.\\" I rarely see any actor or actress give their all to deliver a song so powerfully in the manner Jennifer Hudson does when she stops the show with \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going.\\"<br /><br />The CD barely starts there. The songs \\"Move\\" and \\"Fake Your Way To The Top\\" offer catchy melodies and superb lyrics. \\"Cadillac Car\\" is another masterpiece; and this is highlighted even more when another artist essentially steals the song and performs it in such a comparatively drab fashion. \\"Family\\" is a touching ballad about how the main characters in the plot will stick together and value Effie even as she is being demoted from lead singer to backup. Excellent!<br /><br />\\"I Am Changing\\" and \\"One Night Only\\" offer Jennifer Hudson another opportunity to show off her incredible vocal talents; the soul in these ballads stuns you. And Lord knows, brace yourself for the disco version of \\"One Night Only.\\" The three lady group performs this song with such high voltage energy you'll be sitting in your seat as your hair stands up straight behind you parallel to the floor--exactly like the infamous advertisement for Memorex tapes! Like all the songs on the CD, the disco version of \\"One Night Only\\" is performed to perfection.<br /><br />Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. The CD closes with The Dreams singing \\"Hard To Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Dreamgirls (Finale).\\" These passionate songs are delivered flawlessly. There is also a touching duet of \\"When I First Saw You;\\" and this concludes the album.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this album is a very recent release Amazon already gives it the status of \\"an Amazon.com Best Music of 2006 selection.\\" I don't doubt their judgment for a minute. The movie sparkles and crackles with electric performances by Beyonc&eacute; (who sing the beautiful ballad entitled \\"Listen); Jennifer Hudson (who, as Effie, performs the show stopping number \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\") as well as songs delivered straight from greats like Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx. I didn't know Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx could sing so well!<br /><br />The artwork is excellent and the quality of the sound does not disappoint.<br /><br />One thing, however: Please be aware that there is an alternate two CD version of the soundtrack that you can also purchase here on Amazon.com. That version comes with an additional 16 songs as well as a lyric and photo booklet.<br /><br />Overall, this album--and the movie--is an absolute must for any movie buff or any fan of great musicals. Fans of movie soundtracks and Beyonc&eacute; will never be disappointed. Moreover, if you want the finest introduction possible to the gifted Jennifer Hudson, you must buy this CD.<br /><br />Every once in a very long while, all the stars in the heavens align in exactly the right places to create a work of art as impressive as the soundtrack to the movie Dreamgirls Get this CD--but set aside plenty of time before you start to listen to it because one, two or even three straight listens could never be enough!

1582701709|5.0|To those who are not seeing beyond the obvious personal judgement of their naturally assumed limited experience of their own misconceptions of what makes up reality: It seems inappropriate for one person to presume that another wants to manifest what they themselves may want to see manifested within a world of arguable limitations. Miracles, which are manifestations of natural law that are not commonly understood, have and continue to occur. Newtonian physics do not necessarily apply in the quantum field or throughout dimensions. Form follows thought.<br /><br />Asking for concrete solutions to hypothetical situations is often an excercise in futility serving mainly to define ignore-ance of solutions in actual situations thereby proliferating the belief in impossibility. To some the world is simply flat, to others it is essentially round, yet to others it is both and more so. We are all manifesting our thoughts, feelings and beliefs mirrored in our experiences. Some will continue to dance with their own shadow believing it to be the only reality while refusing to recognize the cause, effect, or source. The primary immutable law of the universe is that thought, belief and emotion manifest form. Like it or not, by intention or default, we create our own reality. \\"If you don't like the news go out and make some of your own.\\"

B00005JNS0|1.0|We normally love Pixar films.  For instance, thought The Incredibles was, well Incredible.  Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc and Toy Story 1&2 were great, so were excited when the new Pixar film came out.  We didn't catch it in the theater, so when Christmas came around, we asked for, and got it.   <br /> <br />A couple nights ago, there was nothing interesting on TV, so we decided to put in Cars.  We got about halfway through, after laughing a couple of times--tractor tipping--, but then turned it off.  I'm not a big NASCAR fan, but I thought, \\"Hey, it's Pixar.  They can make anything fun.\\" <br /> <br />I guess we should have checked it out of the library first, before deciding if we wanted to add it to our collection.  Now I think the library can add it to theirs..... <br /> <br />Don't bother with this movie.
0517548232|1.0|Probably one of the more blatantly biased books I've ever read. Should be renamed \\"Libertarians are Cool.\\" Yes, libertarianism is the foundation of modern economics and seems sensible. But this book is basically a libertarian manifesto shouted really loudly, with no objective evaluation in sight. It is NOT adequate substitution for an economics course, as I hoped it would be. <br /> <br />The claim on the back of the book that it is written \\"objectively and impartially\\" is completely ridiculous; Hazlitt's approach is inflammatory and dogmatic. He compares taxes to \\"being robbed\\" (96), compares fixed prices to \\"coercions\\" (116), goes off on melodramatic tangents about evil government controls leading to \\"final abandonment of all the traditional liberties we have known\\" (123), and basically characterizes any government official as wicked and intending to steal from the masses and head towards \\"the seeds of fascism and communism\\" (176). Straight out of the cold war. <br /> <br />What is peculiar is the fact that he does indeed concede that certain services should be paid with taxes (police, roads, etc.). Why can't those be private too? These implications of Hazlitt's libertarian theories are not explored; they are merely mentioned in apologetic passing. If taxes really are just a power trip, why have them at all? This question remains unanswered. <br /> <br />Also, Hazlitt doesn't realize that his claims apply to things that he says, not just other people's purported \\"foolery.\\" He doesn't mind \\"Industry X\\" dying because it will \\"release the necessary capital and labor for the new industries\\" (102), but then gets all bent out of shape when another Industry X goes out of business due to minimum wage laws (136) by pointing out the resulting \\"unemployment.\\"  Why is unemployment bad here, but okay before?  He excuses unemployment in the first case as \\"necessary\\" and then calls out the second instance as \\"condemning the people who worked in that industry\\" (136).  Which one is it?  His decision to hide or showcase negative evidence rests solely on convenience, not truth. <br /> <br />Read something else.
B000092Q8C|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, this is not multichannel or multiformat.  What this means is that it will only play in a SACD player, and only the Left and Right channels are active in an SACD direct 6-channel connection.  No subwoofer, no surrounds, etc. It can be played from an SACD player through a standard analog/digital connection and allow the receiver to add sound processing (dolby, dts, etc) for all channel playback.  It won't play in a standard CD player or computer.   <br /> <br />However, the sound quality could only improve for me as my previous copy is on vinyl (yikes!).  Maybe a full SACD version will come someday . . .
B000C3H4MC|1.0|This album is amazing and fantastic, and the rating has no bearing on the Talking Heads or their musicianship. <br /> <br />The problem is with the format itself.  I own the \\"Brick\\" boxset, and the only one that doesn't work in that is Remain In Light, which is also my favorite Heads album. <br /> <br />Since I received Brick as a gift, I couldn't return it so I just bought another Remain In Light, since hey I can throw 20 bucks David Byrne's way.  But the one I bought was also defective, as was the replacement that Amazon sent (the very next day, superfast turn around from those guys). <br /> <br />So, in my experience, 3 out 3 of this particular disc is defective.  All of my DVD sides worked fine, but the audio sides did not.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|After listening to Hypnotize a whole bunch of times, I wanted to hear some more SOAD, so I got Mezermize and it is SO GOOD, but not perfect. Why? I'll explain; Daron get's more vocal time, now I don't have a problem with that, it's just that his voice is just too low compared to Serj's rich vocal's, but once you get used to Daron's voice, you will like the song's that he get's the most airtime on like 'Lost In Hollywood' where he sing's the whole song while Serj just moan's in the background.  <br /> The album start's out with the last song on Hypnotize 'Soldier Side' (on Hypnotize, it's a very haunting song even after having the album for eight month's and listening to it countless times and perhap's the most darkest song that SOAD has sone since their first self-titled debut album). BYOB (Bring Your Own Bombs) is a anti-bush and anti-war song with the lyrics's \\"Everyone's going to the party have a real good time.\\" where they are talking about Bush spending ten's of millions on his presidential party while thousand's were dead from the tsunami in Southeast Asia.  <br /> Another anti-war song is 'Sad Statue', while some some songs on this album that are anti-celebrity, and anti-coporation like 'Radio/Video' and 'Cigaro' where they poke fun at the music industry and coporation's, while some song's on this album are just pure SOAD; 'Violent Pornography', 'This  Cocaine Make's Me Feel Like I'm On This Song' and 'Revenga'.  <br /> So to answer your question, is this the best SOAD album? Well it's comes  pretty close to being perfect while it is not Toxicity or System of a Down (their first album), but enjoy this while it last because it is going to be at least a couple of year's before SOAD hit's the studio again because according to Daron they are going to take a much-needed break 'for a few year's'. Thanks for reading my review.

B000I0QKDS|5.0|When I was a younger guy, worshipping at the temple of Aerosmith and Joe Perry, hungrily devouring every little snippet of info about them, I would always come across Perry's idoltry of Jeff Beck and how influential Beck and the Yardbirds (among others obviously) were to his sound and devotion to music. Like any good history student, I did some research and came across a double lp of this album and the follow-up Beck-Ola. It didn't take long to figure out what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />This is a Beck tour de force from the simple elegance of Greensleeves to the galloping intensity of Beck's Bolero, the sheer sickness of You Shook Me, and the blues workouts on Blues De Luxe, Let Me Love You, Rock My Plimsoul, and I Ain't Superstitious, this is a lethal collection of Beck's genius and guitar mastery. The bonus edition was worth replacing my old cd with because of the rarity of Beck outtakes and the frank commentary provided by the man himself in the liner notes. I know some have slagged it off, but I really enjoy the cheesy Love is Blue most of all!<br /><br />The man is one of a handful of guitarists from the rock world to have influenced guitarists across the genres and his refusal to go quietly into that good night of laurel resting, blues retreading, or commercial banality, proves more and more that Jeff Beck remains as fresh and vital as he did in his groundbreaking days over four decades ago. If you really want to know why this guy is (or should be) mentioned in the same breath as Jimi Hendrix, give this a listen. Thanks for the tip, Joe Perry.
B00000F1D3|4.0|Cher has been around for quite a long time and garnered nearly every major award out there.  For someone of her age at the time of Believe's release it's hard to see how she could have been so successful since this CD is dance pop--then again, she's Cher.  The title track scored her another international No. 1 hit single and shot the album to the top of the charts, selling millions and millions of copies.  So is Believe worth all the hype?  Yes, and no.  \\"Believe\\" the song is brilliant disco-infused dance pop and any singer could have easily topped the charts with it had it not been given to Cher.  The rest of the album follows suit, delivering catchy dance pop that would easily fit into the Top 40 mold of 1998 when it was first released.  Unfortunately, it gets cheesy as you get further into the meat, and the fact Cher's well above the age of dance pop makes the album sound a bit immature.  Still, Cher's throaty voice sounds great here and song-for-song it is one of her best records.
0553582461|5.0|SPOILERS!!! <br />I mourn the end of this book, I just finished reading the last page. I layed down for a moment, the book upon my chest, holding onto the adventures and the love that was shared with me through Fitz's eyes. I got up and looked online at all the reviews, just hoping to extend that feeling. Wow, I have never been so moved by a book. I cried ALOT. The poem the Fool wrote his beloved made me cry so much I kept having to stop, because my eyes blurred so. I missed him tremendously, and I was almost angry with Fitz for being happy, and that is when it hit me. Unconditional love, not bound in any way. The Fool would never stand for my being angry with Fitz for his happiness. As much as I was sad/angry for Fitz, and heartbroken for the Fool,  he was happy for his Beloved, and who am I to judge them?
067101756X|4.0|Most people in America will not believe this book, not because it is not true but because it would change their paradigm or view of the world. The book is very plausible and contains many facts from someone who claims he was there.  It offers an realistic explaination of our advancements in technology in the last half of the 20th century.
B000FGGE68|5.0|This movie was destroyed by the company that shelled it out, Kurt Whimmer, the man the delivered the well made Equilibrium, had so much trouble with the studios and such with this film that he didnt even support the final product of this film. Reasonm because soooo much was cut and taken out, so what could have been an awesome film, we got this, a fun, and often confusing film. SO just wonder what could have been if Kurt's real vision of a film was released. I know , it would have been a a great sci-fi action film we would all love.
0743289412|2.0|Well, the least you can say is that this book is different from the other books that Stephen King has written so far.  <br /> <br />The story of Lisey Landon, wife of author Scott Landon, is a kind of a horror and love story in one. A strange combination, but that's just the way it is. I have no other words to describe it. Two years after her husband died, Lisey wants to get rid of Scott's possessions and that's what it's all about. A lot of flashbacks show that there marriage has been successfull, but also scary at times, and so on, and so on, ... <br /> <br />It takes way too long before something happens and when you finally get interested, the story is over. I'm a big fan of Stephen King, but this is clearly not what I want to read from him. Too long and too much of the same. Chance wasted !
0385338686|4.0|It's worth reading -- even minor characters are vivid and much of the book is hilarious -- but the ending is disappointing --  the word sexist comes to mind (or it would if a man had written this book). But up until the end the book is first rate  --  terrific satire -- her best so far. However, for books that are funny AND well written,  I'd  reccommend \\"Pug Hill\\", \\"The Nanny Diaries\\", and \\"Straight Man\\" before this book.
014028009X|5.0|I purchased this book after watching the movie in theatres. It was my first chick lit book, and I have been hooked every since.<br /><br />Helen Fielding gives women a character that all can relate too! Bridget Jones is a clever character doing what most women are doing - living on her own, working at a job she doesn't always enjoy, and looking for love.<br /><br />Kudos to Fielding for giving readers such a hysterical character! If you have not read the book but have seen the movie, remember to enjoy them as separate entities, just like Harry Potter.

006085880X|5.0|Jodi Picoult really handles the tough situation in this book with care. She brings us the story of love, but that love has consquences. The interesting point of this book is how people handle tragedy, not only in their own household but with their friends as well.<br /><br />The book touched me as a mother and as a teacher. After reading this book I thought about how much parents and teachers do not notice. If we did, the world would be a safe place for all to live. But the truth is that as parents and teachers we only see what we want (and need) to see and hope for the best.<br /><br />I think this book really brings home several different messages to parents and teens, all of which I will leave out so that I do not ruin any of the story for you.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I'm a fan of this band and it might show on this review. It took me quite a while to fully get into them -- even as I knew them since their very first album (WDADU) it wasn't until the arrival of SFAM that I actually got hooked and started looking for whole back-catalog of the band. They're yet to disappoint me!  <br />With SCORE, Dream Theater gives us a compelling document of a band reaching their 20th year of existence, all guns blazing, single-handledly demonstrating why they're the current powerhouse of progressive metal. <br />This is a solid tracklist of 22 tracks spanning their whole career, even including a tune previously unreleased on any studio album (Another Won). Specially tantalizing is the set performed together with The Octavarium Orchestra, six songs including Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence, Octavarium and Metropolis, which is worth alone the price of this DVD. <br />Disc Two features an interesting one-hour long documentary called \\"The Score So Far...\\" with images from the very beginning of the band to this day, traveling through the different stages of the band during their history, offering the viewer interesting insights and first-hand facts from all the band members along the way. <br />I'd say without a doubt that this is essential, not only for fans of the band, but for those wanting to get into Dream Theater and those interested in progressive rock/metal.
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Piccoult takes a controversial topic and is able to write beyond the topic itself. I purchased this book because I was intrigued by the book's backcover description.<br /><br />I found this book thought-provoking as a parent, teacher, and human. The presentation of material was well-handled, and I actually felt like I knew each character personally.<br /><br />This book is now on my top ten list of best books I have read. And that is saying a lot because I am a high school English teacher, so I can be a bit picky.<br /><br />BRAVO to Ms. Piccoult for taking on the role as writer, and BRAVO to you if you choose to take on the role as reader. You won't be disappointed!
B000FP2OPY|1.0|It saddens me what passes for quality TV these days and, even more so, just how many people don't seem to be able to sort the good from the bad.  <br /> <br />For the record, Supernatural is bad. <br /> <br />The premise is enticing (I loved X-Files and the horror genre is one of my favorites to read. Check out Jack Ketchum's Off Season!) and whoever selects the music gets two big thumbs up. Basically, this show is a great idea poorly executed. <br /> <br />Let's begin with Jenson Ackles, who must have passed the auditions on looks alone because he hasn't delivered a believable line yet. And when he tries to pawn himself off as something he's not (as he invariably does in every episode), somehow people believe his stiff, emotionless, completely implausible lies. Come on, it took until episode 4 for him to change clothes. People! Law enforcement officers, forest rangers, whatever, do not dress like him or drive a car like that. Any smart person would recognize him immediately for the fraud he is. Thankfully, the world of Supernatural isn't burdened with too many smart people. <br /> <br />And the writing. Oh my god! These stories all have potential, but only Hook Man lives up to it. The two brothers alternate between knowing everything and knowing nothing. And could someone please decide which brother is supposed to be the expert? In episodes 1 and 2 it seems to be Dean, but after that it's Sam. Then there's the problem of exposition, handled here with all the skill of a team of eight-year-olds. The brothers are constantly telling each other things they already know just so the audience can get the background information. Most of what they explain we already know or don't need to know. \\"Have you noticed anything strange?\\" Sam says in every episode, then adds, \\"anything out of the ordinary?\\" just to make sure we knew what he meant by strange.  <br /> <br />The plot inconsistencies make it difficult to sit through an episode without turning into Crow or Tom Servo fromMST3K and offering a few choice comments: spiders and earthworms are NOT bugs! And what are all those hissing cockroaches doing in that kid's back yard? Aren't they mostly found in Madagascar? And now that I think about it, wasn't it midnight when they ran into that house to avoid the death plague of bugs caused by the Native American curse? And then wasn't it morning three minutes later? What the hell is that about? <br /> <br />Do the creators of this show really think we are that stupid? On second thought, judging from the high ratings this show is receiving, maybe we are. <br /> <br />I got this set and Veronica Mars first season together for half price, and so I don't feel like I got completely screwed, I'm going to try to convince myself that I paid full price for VM (check it out if you want to see good writing and believable characters) and got Supernatural for free.  <br /> <br />Didn't work. I still feel screwed.

0061191752|4.0|I've been a massive Gordon Ramsay fan since the first time I glimpsed him on BBC America, then came Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares to feed my obsession.  I purchased two of his cookbooks for my friend for Christmas and as we were exchanging gifts it turned out that she had done the same.  Secretly I purchased Roasting in Hell's Kitchen all for myself and read it cover to cover the day after Christmas. <br /> <br />Having just finished watching the first run of the F-Word on BBC America (because everything comes over here a year late at least from the BBC) I was expecting lots of dish on his television ventures and his rise to culinary stardom.  This book completely surprised and enthralled me.  If there was a ghost writer for this book I'd be gobsmacked, as the writing style is completely in keeping with the way Gordon talks about things in his cook books and on his television shows, no holds are barred and no f-word gets left behind.  It is a rare auto-biography that is penned so true to it's author's voice and raw with authenticity. <br /> <br />I had no idea that this brash, confident, gorgeous man in the kitchen who is so engaging and fun has had so much to overcome and in such a short amount of time.  One might think that reading 300 pages of heartbreak, abuse and grueling work (nothing short of a Dickensian tale) would change the way I look at a person, and truthfully it has.  I'm even more impressed and amazed by Gordon Ramsay now than ever. <br /> <br />His story is one that took immense amounts of bravery and bullocks to tell, and he has done so in a way that is astoundingly heartfelt and never hopeless.  Gordon's incredibly recent bout with success is well deserved and I hope it lasts long enough to provide material for additional updates on his fascinating life.
B000059T5O|2.0|I bought this CD fully expecting to really enjoy this since I love Tom Waits's music and I enjoy John Hammond's guitar playing. However after numerous plays I have since grown tired of this CD and I have sold it. After a while all of the songs seemed to sound the same and they don't hold a candle to the Tom Waits originals.  So save your cash and buy the Tom Waits originals.
0340838035|5.0|As a 19 year old Engineering student, I find free-time incredibly hard to come by, and when I do manage to have some... I'll admit, I often spend it watching brain-numbing television to recuperate.<br /><br />I received this book as a birthday gift, and started reading it during a study-break, fully intending to get no more than possibly 30 pages through it, and THEN watch a little TV.  However, once I started reading it, I literally couldn't put it down.  I hear people say this about books all the time, but I've never truly experienced it.<br /><br />This book began near the end of the actual story being told, and through a series of flash-backs relays a story that is so tragically heart-wrenching that I soon found myself addicted.<br /><br />The reason that I couldn't stop reading was that because of the way the book was set up, I already knew how it ended; it was just a matter of finding out why and how.  I found myself empathizing with the parents, because just as they were trying to come to grips with the reality of the tragic incident, so was I.<br /><br />By the end of the book I still found myself wondering why that had to be the outcome.  This book was by no means as satiating as someone who is expecting the 'answer-to-life' wants it to be, but I think that's the very nature of suicide - is there ever a situation where it truly HAS to be the solution?<br /><br />I have recommended this book to all of my friends, and now I'm taking the time to recommend it here to anybody who enjoys angst, romance or just all-around well written stories.  Enjoy!!
B000JJS8TM|4.0|For those of us who love The Beatles but also appreciate good sound quality, this two disc re-mix is a treat. One of the discs is on DVD and this format is outstanding for music. The DVD offers 4 separate mixes. One in surround sound DVD Audio, and you must have the proper set up to play this. There are also two other surround sound mixes, DTS and DD 5.1, plus an excellent PCM Stereo mix. All of these are recorded in a higher bit rate than the original mixes and therefore have excellent sound. Technically, the DVD Audio 5.1 mix should be the best, but on my system the vocals are mixed too loud in the center channel and I actually prefer the DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound mixes. I also love the stereo mix on the DVD. If you have a surround sound speaker setup and receiver, but not a DVD Audio player, but this 2-disc set anyway and play the other mixes on the DVD, you'll love it. As one reviewer mentioned, if you have DVD Audio, when you insert this disc it defaults to DVD Audio and doesn't give you the menu so you can select one of the other mixes. Go into your DVD system set up menu and switch the DVD VIDEO to DVD VIDEO instead of DVD AUDIO and then try again, and you'll get the menu so you can select the other 3 mixes. I would've rated it 5 stars if not for this glitch. Now let's hope that they come out with the entire Beatles catalog on DVD Audio or Super Audio with both surround sound and stereo remixes in the better quality. One last note on SACD compared to DVD AUDIO. Super Audio CDs don't have anywhere near the capacity as DVDs. I have both types and although both sound great, DVD AUDIO is best because there's room for several mixes plus on-screen graphics. Simply put, DVD is an outstanding format for both music and video. Can't be beat. Most of the big names like Elton John, the Stones, Dylan, are on SACD however.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|What a fun movie this is. Besides having the great Steven Carell, we also get treated to the cutest little gal this side of sunshine! This is no sanitized, perfectly set movie. It's gritty, uses \\"real\\" sets and has a quiet wonderfulness about it. Alan Arkin is priceless as the grandfather; very touching and comic at the same time.   Follow this quirky family cross country as they take their gem to a beauty contest. What follows is a hilarious road trip that will keep you smiling. Promise. **PS language may be a bit much for the smaller kiddies.

B00005JPE7|5.0|ROCKY BALBOA IS A VERY, VERY ENTERTAINING AND EXCITING FILM. THE FIRST 20 OR SO MINUTES OF THE FILM, PAINTS THE SITUATION AND ESTABLISHES ALL THE CHARACTERS, THEN IT IS TIME TO ROCK'N ROLL. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SEE THIS AS JUST A BOXING PICTURE, BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT. ROCKY BALBOA IS ABOUT NOT LOSING HOPE. IT IS ABOUT NOT GIVING UP. AND AS ROCKY STATES IT IN THE MOVIE, IT'S ABOUT GETTING HIT BUT STILL KEEP GOING NO MATTER HOW TOUGH LIFE GETS. A LOT OF GREAT LESSONS IN A GREAT PICTURE THAT COMPLETES THE ROCKY TRILOGY IN AN UNFORGETTABLE WAY. BRAVO!!!

B000068IEU|3.0|Last House on the Left... wow. Pretty strange. First off, let me say, without reservation, that horror is my genre of choice. I pretty much dig everything from the supernatural, to thrillers, to straight splatter fests. I'm fan of other W. Craven films as well... the Elm St. series, the Hills Have Eyes, Scream, etc. So it was with high hopes that I read the bulk of the reviews of 'Last House,' which painted the picture of some sort of brutal shock-fest filled with disturbing scenes of violence.    Yeah, well, that didn't happen.     To begin with, there is very little actual violence depicted on screen- for the most part you just hear sounds, see blood after the fact, etc. True, the subject matter is disturbing, but no more so than what you are likely to see on the nightly news on any given day. I knew, intellectually, that I was supposed to be frightened and/or disturbed, but as I watched it, I actually found myself laughing out loud. I felt like Michael Keaton in Beetlejuice, when he tells Alec Baldwin, \\"I've see the Exorcist 167 times and it keeps getting funnier every single time!\\"    Now, the acting is fine and the film definitely looks good (very grainy, like an old home movie, with some evocative landscape shots of the rural North East), but it is hard to get past the over the top, \\"straight outta Brooklyn\\" killers. They really do come off like the Bizarro World doppelgangers of Vinnie Barbarino and his Sweathogs from 'Welcome Back Kotter.' They were, in fact, almost impossible to take seriously, especially in conjunction with the INSANE musical score.    Actually, the score deserves special mention. I don't know if Craven was trying to be ironic, or just plain weird, but the music is wildly incongruous, with regard to the action in the film. In scenes involving rape, mutilation, and fleeing for one's life while covered in blood, the score ranges from troubador-style, acoustic folk ballads to upbeat, vaguely psychedelic instrumental pieces that sound more like music you would hear at a carnival (the friendly, cotton candy sort, not the Something Wicked This Way Comes variety) than as the backdrop to a murder. As the killers are in the midst of their spree I kept turning to my fiancee, who had seen the movie before, with confused questions like \\"Is this music supposed to be making me laugh?\\"     (spoilers below)    Then there was the end of the film. The parents, through some fortuitous observations, surmise that their house guests killed their missing daughter something like ten minutes earlier and so set about taking their revenge. Within the space of minutes, the bereaved mother is, err... going downtown with one of the killers, if you catch my drift, whereupon she quite literally bites off more than she can chew. I guess that falls somewhere between \\"anger\\" and \\"bargaining\\" in the five stages of grief... Then the father is setting traps like MacGyver and taking a chainsaw to people as though he had been carving human cutlets all his life. The only logical response to this improbable insanity was laughter- as I said in the title to this review, 'twas mighty odd. Of course, it entertained me enough to watch through till the end, so I have to give it three stars, with the caveat that this is strictly dark comedy material, with elements of true horror being few and far between. If you are looking for an unsettling, gritty, and morally ambiguous descent into human depravity, you would be much better off watching The Devil's Rejects or Hostel. Last House on the Left is better suited to MST3000-style parody, which can be quite fun in it's own right, but won't exactly keep you up at night.
B000IMV4IW|5.0|Have you ever seen Oasis live recently? It's surprising just how great of a set list they play and yet how many songs you wanted to hear that weren't played.  I think Oasis is one of those bands that has a massive underrated catalogue. There is not a poor song on this compilation. Unless you're a big fan, they're are many you haven't heard(Half the world away, talk tonight.) The essentials are there(Wonderwall, slide away, Don't look back in anger, live forever). But so many great songs were ommitted. (D'you know what I mean?, Cast no shadow, Stop cryin yer heart out,Don't go away and a few more I could list) It's one of those albums where you enjoy it but know how good it could be. This album rocks but you can't help but reflect on what else you wanted on there. I want to see a vol. 2!

0375505091|2.0|The first thing about this book,  you should know, IMO, is that most of the photos in this book are too big for one page, so they are presented split down the middle by the spine of the book.  This is a TERRIBLE problem.  Why would someone produce an image where the prime focal area is split down the middle?  This alone ought to keep you from wasting your money on this hefty tome.<br /><br />The second thing you should know - partly because some of the other Amazon reviewers have pointed it out - is that the vast majority of the photos in this book are shapshots of Susan Sontag, the author's intimate partner.  But even if all this were potentially OK for me, I would still regret buying the book.  See below.<br /><br />The book evidently started as a personal memoir/elegy of Susan Sontag for distribution to friends at Sontag's funeral. I don't know what I was expecting.  Half the book is a collection mostly of personal pictures of one famous person: Susan Sontag.  Susan in the mountains, Susan at home, Susan on trips all over the place, Susan sleeping on the couch, etc. The remainder are devoted to celbrity photos and pictures of family, particularly Liebovitz's parents, many of which seem to have a snapshot quality of being unprepared.  Too many of them fail to rise above this.<br /><br />Liebovitz is well known as a photographer of celebrities.  Those photos of are indeed imposing.  There is a certain authority that Liebovitz brings to her journalistic photos.  But this book is mostly not these portraits.  It's about the author - which, by the way, is clearly stated as early as the title of the book. Many of these pictures are snapshots that, frankly, are mostly unremarkable.<br /><br />  A great artist can produce numerous pictures of the same subject.  Think Cezanne. Nevertheless, I really am sorry I spent money on this perhaps a bit too personal farewell to Susan Sontag, no matter how deeply felt.  I wish this book was better than it is.  I think Liebovitz worked very hard on it.  As you can see, this book retails at $75.  It is offered by various online venues at around $50.  What a deal, right? Wrong.can see, this book retails at $75.  It is offered by various online venues at around $50.  What a deal, right? Wrong.
B000JKA0B0|5.0|Then you can afford to drop a \\"C\\" note on an international region-free DVD player.  So if you've been hedging on buying this because you won't be able to watch the two DVD presentations that come with it, I've just solved your problem. <br /> <br />AN IMPORTANT WORD of CAUTION: <br /> <br />Research the region-free players carefully; many of them DO NOT come with a DTS output, and if you aren't watching Rammstein in full-blast DTS, you ain't watching Rammstein!!!  So make sure it has DTS output. <br /> <br />This vital record of musical history is so worth it...if you have \\"Live Aus Berlin\\" and \\"Lichtspielhaus\\" you have to have this, no question.  The concerts just keep getting wilder and bigger and louder...they'll always have to keep topping their last tour.  Seeing Rammstein in their element, playing to head-banging masses is breathtaking.  I saw them in Merrillville Indiana, and there were less than 1,000 people there.  Hey, that meant I was in the front row, so no problems there, but I couldn't imagine the power, the energy, the heat of being in the front row with 100,000 rockin' fans behind me.  \\"Voelkerball\\" brings you pretty dang close.  Especially with the DTS. <br /> <br />Will Rammstein ever tour the U.S. again???

B00005NTJK|5.0|Jethro Tull suffers an undeserved low esteem in the pop music scene nowadays (That is, here in the U.S.), in good part because of the vice of not pretending to be the least bit lowbrow.  Not to say that they are particularly highbrow, but they are intelligent, English, well-read, and skillful, all of which are generally undesirable in the pop music and media scene in general, at least in record and video stores.  They even use the word \\"whom\\" in one of these songs!    That faux-pas notwithstanding, this is to me their best offering.  It is certainly the one that really launched them on a successful career in the 20th C, and their songs range from heavy and fateful, to gentle and tender.  They were the kind of band that usually was listened to by the college set in the 70's and 80's, and not appreciated as much elsewhere.     There was a movement among a lot of rock musicians back then to prove to the world that they actually posessed skills that could rival traditional \\"classical\\" music, exemplified by Yes, Kansas, ELO, and maybe best by Rick Wakeman.  But Jethro Tull wasn't so allured to try to take on \\"classical\\" music because they could actually play it from the word go.      They would soon develop a penchant for older English folk music, and showed the world they were unashamed anglophiles, thus wrecking their popularity here in the U.S., who were still trying to get over the American revolution.  But this penchant hadn't yet begun to develop, and this early album was a genuine collection of sincere, simple rock music played with more skill and elegance than was found very often in this time period.

0671027344|1.0|I hate to say it but I really felt this book was a waste of a perfectly good title, format, and idea.  I was very eager to read The Perks of Being a Wallflower after four friends recommended it, even after noticing it was an MTV book and recognizing that these friends rarely picked up a book that was for outside reading.<br /><br />It starts out good.  Charlie is likable and his commentary is interesting and inadvertently humorous.  As the story progressed, however, it seemed to lose focus and I found myself turning each page thinking \\"Okay, maybe now it will get better\\" but each turn only proved how mistaken I was.<br /><br />Charlie's character goes from realistic kid to the typical angst-ridden teen stereotype that only an adult author, trying to cater to the notions of teenage behavior embedded in pre-teen minds, could write about.  The storyline has too many flaws to remember them all, but here are a few: Charlie's best friend who commited suicide is completely forgotten about with the exception of one line much later in the book.  He falls in with a huge group of seniors at the head of the party scene, tries every kind of beer and illegal substance on the market, and has multiple sexual interactions with two senior girls.  Sorry, but I find it an insult that this type of person would ever be classified as a \\"wallflower.\\"  His sister is a joke of a character whose actions make little sense, and the twist in the end isn't so much a twist as a means of just giving the story an ending without needing to really justify it.  I really doubt Chbosky could have done much research on that subject with the way he wrote it.<br /><br />I would only recommend this book as an example of a story that had an immense amount of potential but did not result in a work of good literature.  Very disappointing, because I thought Chbosky had a good writing style too.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I was watching Saturday Night Live when they had on this artist I never heard of before. The first song she sang was \\"Put your records on\\" and I thought was a nice song. The second time she came on she sang the lead cut from the album the oh so sweet \\"Like a Star\\". After her performance of that song I chose to get to know more about this artist. After I read some online reviews I decided to go buy this album, which I almost never do. I almost never buy an album by a new artist. I don't buy an album even for an established artist if they don't have a good single in video and or radio, but I decided to take a chance on this one and did it ever pay off. Her album was a delight. I'm not going to give you a track by track of what is HOT because this whole album should be experienced. Great album.
055358202X|3.0|A lot of filler and time wasting, but essential to the plot, I guess. You can't go skipping books in a series and expect to know what's going on. A little lighter on he explicit sex scenes (gracias a dios). What can you say? It's a subjective and personal work and you take it as is or leave it. It doesn't mean you have to like it 100%.
B000069HZP|4.0|When I read about this movie, it was worded so vaguely that i thought the movie must be really bad. It was recommended to me and after watching it, i realized why the description seemed so empty. It's hard to put into words how this movie operates, but it makes perfect sense as each scene happens. Michael Douglas is really good at playing rich business man types and here that is equally annoying as it is effective. He does it great, i just wish he wasn't so limited in the types of roles he plays. I've never liked Sean Penn, he over-acts in every movie he's in and he's kind of annoying in this movie. The good thing is he has a pretty small role so there's not too much of him to deal with. Overall, a really well done movie, great music too. Really eerie and complimentary to the unpredictable speed of the action. Definitely see it.
0385505833|3.0|I read this book on a recommendation from a fellow teacher who claimed the book was laugh-out-loud funny.  I finished it over a weekend. Hmmmmm. . .I did laugh, a few times, but it was not the hilarious comedy that I assumed it would be, however, the ending is probably the funniest.  I detested his wife and their marriage was in desperate need of some counseling, but somehow it seemed to work.  I was really rooting for them to go on their cruise:( and was a little frustrated with how things turned out. However, I did like the ending a lot. It was funny and had a lot of twists and turns and was particularly touching towards the very end (I think I might have shed a tear).  I always have loved a John Grisham novel, but I think I'll stick to his lawyer-themed ones.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|Before A Star is Born was released in 1976, Barbra Streisand was considered by many people to be main stream and `old school'. With the release of the film, Barbra was able to re-invent herself as a contemporary artist and her career, like the film itself, took off and she became a bigger star than ever. The film and the accompanying soundtrack were huge hits, hitting number one at the box office and topping the billboard charts. Career-wise Barbra never looked back. She successfully starred in and executive-produced a box office smash, something unheard of in the 1970s for a woman, and it was from the strength of this film that she went on to direct and star in the critically acclaimed films Yentl and the Prince of Tides.  <br /> <br />Instead of looking at the merits of the film, some reviews here suggest the clothes and hairstyles in A Star Is Born are dated. Shouldn't they be? After all, the film was released 30 years ago! If what's important to you are contemporary costumes and hair, I would suggest you pick up a new release. If you are looking to see one of the biggest hits of the 1970s, watch A Star Is Born. Barbra won an Oscar and two Grammy awards for composing/singing the (Love theme from A Star Is Born) Evergreen.  She also took home Golden Globes for acting, composing and producing.
B000K9L32U|4.0|There was so much buildup led to this.  Ultimate Collection release, A reunion tour, Gary's Autobiography, Single \\"Patience\\" release.  I was so excited to get this album.  I waited a while my excitement cooled down, so I can write more objective review. <br />\\"Today I've Lost You\\" in Ultimate Collection and lead single from the album, \\"Patience\\" gave a good sense of where they were going, though \\"Patience\\" was so much more grown up, and mature tune.  What was so exciting about \\"Patience\\" and throughout this album was that harmony and their voices sound more cohesive than their previous albums.  It was also great to hear even contribution and growth from Mark, Howard and Jason. <br />Other than \\"Patience,\\" \\"Shine\\" definitely stands out, and Mark's vocal style has grown, and it probably was a natural progress from his solo career. \\"Wooden Boat\\" was a pleasant surprise as Jason showcased what he is capable. <br />I found some of the tunes to be a little bit disappointing for sound so afar from Take That in the 90's, and it almost sounded they were forced to sound grown up.  But even in those tunes, it was very apparent that 10 years gave each of them a certain experience that contributed to this collection, and it is very obvious that the unit is closer than ever.  It took me a little bit to appreciate this, but I certainly enjoy listening to this album.
0061015725|1.0|This book is terrible! It's horribly written complete with dialogue that is as trite and flat as a bad 80s sitcom. It starts off with a passive unemployed stay-at-home father whose wife appears to be having an affair. It then develops into a highly boring and implausible tale about nanoparticles trying to take over the world, or trying to eat us all, or something. I don't think Crichton ever really got that far in his thinking.<br /><br />***possible spoilers below***<br /><br />This book is very important in pinpointing a few useful life-rules:<br /><br />1. Anyone who looks like they have lost weight/bulked up is dangerous! (Those nanoarticles are deadly, but boy, do they help ones' body image)<br /><br />2. There is nothing much out-of-the-ordinary about a mother slapping her baby when she gets home from work. In fact, if anything, you should always be the one to apologise...it doesn't matter for what.<br /><br />3. If you're trying to get a few crazy nanoparticles to rule the world, make sure the FIRST thing you do is call in the main guy who is able to destroy your whole big plan.<br /><br />4. Nanoparticles bear a striking resemblance to sandflies. They say they're thousands of times small than a hairs' breadth...but don't worry, when they buzz around you'll see them no problems. They also have the ability to bite.<br /><br />The whole things is so badly written from start to finish that it wasn't even a  guilty pleasure! The characters are all so one dimensional and the whole thing towards the end (Ricky and Julia being coated in nanoparticles?!?!) is just ridiculous.<br /><br />Plot holes are abound, for example, why on earth would this thing need to be transferred via saliva/kissing? They're nanoparticles! If they can buzz around and take differennt shapes etc, then surely they can fly into whatever or wherever they wish.<br /><br />The BIGGEST surprise for me was that in the end, our 'hero' manages to save the world from these critters with explosions, a trusty sidekick, and some kind of virus that the plant has been haroburing all along.<br /><br />If someone can give me back my 2 days that I spent reading this rubbish I'd be eternally grateful. I'd ask for my money back, but the book was given to me for free by a bookstore. Obviously they knew its true worth.ith explosions, a trusty sidekick, and some kind of virus that the plant has been haroburing all along. <br /> <br />If someone can give me back my 2 days that I spent reading this rubbish I'd be eternally grateful.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is one of the finest documentaries on global warming I've ever seen, and quite frankly, one of the best documentaries ever produced.<br /><br />This should be shown in every American classroom, to civic groups, even to religious groups.  There is vital information here and it's presented so well.  Gore is in his element here and it shows.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|I have always been very jaded when it comes to horror movies...I first saw this at a drive-in movie paired with the Exorcist almost thirty years ago. I laughed at the Exorcist...while this movie really freaked me out. The next week I moved away to college and a dorm that looked like an old TB sanitorium.  I lived on the top floor and it had a bathroom with a shower curtain just like the one in the movie. That movie haunted me all semester.I can hardly remember any of the movies I have seen over the past 15 years but I remember that one!!!  They don't make them like that any more.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|With so many reviews and so much said, I will say only this - I have listened to the Beatles since the mid-sixties and know all of their music backwards and forwards.  The real gems of this set are the new mixes which bring out the music in ways you can't hear on the now-murky-sounding late 80's releases.  PLEASE remix the originals and give them to us!  Among the recent efforts - Yellow Submarine Songtrack gives new life to every song on it, Let it Be - Naked not quite as much...and how about the first four CD's in stereo?  Keep the old ones around for the purists if you must.
0393327655|5.0|Harris's reasoning is impecable and none of the reviews I read confront it.  The Publishers Weekly review was particularly weak.  Harris states that spirituality, morals, ethics should be open to discourse and advancement.  Mysticism is a rational enterprize as is mythology if it is seen as a way to try to approach the mysteries of life.  He states that science alone cannot provide these answers.  If we have mystical experiences and try to understand them (not pronounce them as dogma); if we can look at the myths that carry spiritual and psychological wisdom (and not make a religion of them)--it is a rational enterprize.  The Publishers Weekly review is both without weight and without reason.  It picks one minor area where it seems to feel there might be a weakness (which there isn't) and ignores 90% of the message.  One might think this is due to some prejudice. <br />I think Harris's rational for torture is right-on.  I also think if one brings it to a personal level--someone about to shoot your daughter, grandchild, wife, mother, his violence by the \\"good guys\\" is not flawed reasoning.  Sometimes we just want to be too civilized to survive.   <br />To iterate or reiterate, Harris doesnot call for the end of myths.  If myths are seen as carriers of spiritual and psychological wisdom--not facts--if they are open to discussion as to what their meaning might be, I believe he sees them as having a place in our lives, but not as dogma that can't be questioned, not as a literal account of facts. <br />I think it is about time someone stood up and questioned the archaic religions that have so much unreasoned influence on our lives.  Right-on, Sam Harris.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Having finally gotten around to seeing Al Gore's global warming film, I came away thinking it is being overpraised.<br /><br />This being a film, the science had to be simplified due to time constraints. That's always true. But Gore simplifies by ignoring important points. To him, all recent warming of the Earth is human-caused. No time is spent on the important issue of how much of the measured warming can definitely be ascribed to human actions and how much is normal long-term change expected for a planet in an interglacial warm period.<br /><br />The visual effects are mostly effective, even if some (like the drowning of Manhattan) illustrate \\"worst case\\" scenarios that Gore presents as likely, if not certain. Gore blames Hurricane Katrina on human-caused warming, which is hardly established fact. (If he is going to use the bad hurricane year of 2005 as evidence of long-term change, one wonders what he has to say now about very weak 2006 season.)  In a litany of side effects of warming, he includes the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. (Huh?)<br /><br />While Gore mainly points the finger at the U.S., he does a good job of making it clear the situation is global by spending some time on the contribution to greenhouse gases made by China's rapid population and economic expansion.<br /><br />At one point, Gore throws out a very important statement that needs support. He says that if we \\"do the right thing\\" (changing energy technologies, ending greenhouse gas emissions) we will \\"create new wealth and jobs.\\" That may be true, but it requires explanation, especially when not a word is said about the technical and economic challenges involved in changing over from fossil to renewable energy. (I agree we have to make a major start on this, and quickly, but it will not be easy or cheap, and Gore should be upfront about that.)<br /><br /> As a movie, the film meanders. Detours on Gore's personal life and political experiences make the viewer suspect this is a bit of a campaign commercial as well as an environmental film. There are bits that don't make sense (the weird Simpson-ish animation near the beginning, for example) and could have been replaced with more scientific information.<br /><br />Overall, Gore set out to make a point here, and he generally does it well. He's become more relaxed and engaging than he was as a candidate, although my 10-year-old (who watched with me for a school assignment) still compared him to a \\"really boring teacher.\\" Still, there is too much oversimplification and overstatement involved in driving the point home. Gore leaves himself open to criticism, some of it accurate, that could have been avoided if the film spent more time on the science of the core subject and less on everything from Gore family farm to non-warming-related extinctions.<br /><br />So see the film, but don't take it as the whole story of a complex subject.as well as an environmental film.

0312321376|4.0|The problem with Tucker is that while he is trained as a pediatric psychiatrist, this makes him intelligent and good at making observations. However, nowhere in his book does he make it clear that he is skeptical researcher. Tucker does very convincingly write a work with an inescapable conclusion, however this in itself is not proof for souls, and a consciousness that survives the corporeal death of our bodies. Hopefully this work, and perhaps the reviews of this work will compell someone with the appropriate skeptical experience and scientific background to find problems with his method and/or data.<br /><br />So, while the books does appeal to my emotions, and I am psychologically convinced, I do remain skeptical and wait for serious problems. Perhaps the worst thing that could happen is that the remainder of the scientific community simply ignores the work, premises and conclusion.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|There are three Van Halen incarnations, the original line-up with David Lee Roth, the Sammy Hagar era, and the one shot with Gary Cherone, \\"Van Halen III\\", which was a disaster.<br /><br />  It's disheartening to see a band that broke so many rules in its DLR heyday flounder to the unemployed ranks they are today, but that's the price they paid when Roth was fired or quit, depending on whose story you believe.<br /><br />  But let's face it:  Van Halen had four great albums, the first four.  \\"Diver Down\\" and \\"1984\\" were watered down with too many covers - \\"Diver Down\\", and pop schmaltz - \\"1984\\", not to mention the most horrible production for a major league band ever.  No wonder Roth left.<br /><br />  \\"Women And Children First\\" could lay a fair claim to the first thrash metal album or bonecrusher ala Pantera, however you choose.  \\"And The Cradle Will Rock\\" starts the CD out in familiar enough territory, with Dave's smug but clever vocals and Eddie's tapping, but that's where any resemblance to the first two outings ends.  \\"Everybody Wants Some!\\" is the threshold heavy rock had to cross to go into uncharted waters, redefining the very genre of metal with Eddie's brutal attack chords and Armegeddon whammy dives.  The assault continues all the way through \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\", then cools down for the stoopid title track (which we could have done without) and the closer \\"In A Simple Rhyme\\" that probably would have been better placed on the first album with its harmonies, but that's okay.  We had to come up for air.<br /><br />  What made Van Halen's first albums special was Roth's bigger than life stage presence, lyrics that often bordered on stupid but were clever enough to give the band an edge that showed it was in on the joke, too.<br /><br />  There can be no comparison to the insultingly horrible Sammy Hagar-led line-up.  The music was atrocious, and Hagar tried to equate himself as funny and smart as Roth, and only came off as the bumbling stooge he is.  Roth got away with sexism through implication and humor.  Hagar, referring to women as cuts of beef on \\"5150\\" showed about as much intelligence and humor as a dead cactus.  Ditto the remarkably stupid album titles that followed, and a once cutting edge band became as banal as Hagar's love for Rush Limbaugh.<br /><br />  For a while, though, they were the best in hard rock, and maybe if Roth rejoins, as the rumors persist, we might just get a taste of what made them special in the first place.  Meanwhile, get the first four CD's and hound somebody to remaster them.th got away with sexism through implication and humor.

B00000JPH0|4.0|Any work of art must address the three aspects of our psyche: Intellect, Appetites, Spirit.  This movie, unlike many others, addresses the entire psyche, and does so by weaving these three aspects through the soundtrack, the dialogue and of course the visual representation.  After the first viewing, the actual historical account is told and the psyche is no longer overburdened with the obvious.  Later viewings allow for a much more meaningful experience.  In this, I believe that the production staff have succeeded in their task.<br /><br />Finland being the underdog, does successfully thwart the massive Russian attack.  Not being the aggressor and losing the advantage of first attack, Finland must respond to this attack of its country.  But it is not a superior technology, nor numbers that is responsible for this victory of sorts.  It is the spirit of man that allows for this page of World War II history to come alive, and if there is anything good from war, it is the ability for men and women to show the eternal and noble virtues within in each of us.<br /><br />I was not born in Finland, but my parents were, and did raise me with more of a European background than Canadian.  With some grade school level Finnish fluency, I found the subtitles to be mildly off target, but then again, there might be some disagreement in my interpretation too.  While I would agree with other reviewers that sometimes it is difficult to read all of the subtitles, I am reminded by the fact that this movie was produced a number of years ago.  I think that the movie can hardly be held to critical review for technical issues that were resolved after its production.<br /><br />There is a word in Finnish, SISU, which has no English counterpart or translation.  This movie while a wonderful rendering of this historic event, does in passing allow the non-Finnish speaking person a chance to understand what Finns mean by it.<br /><br />I would heartily suggest this movie for its edu-tainment purposes, but if a History teacher were looking for something to engage children, this movie could very well do so.

B0001KZM3O|1.0|Roger, oh Roger, why did you destroy the Pink Floyd name with this garbage? This is a concept of poor songwriting and craftsmanship. This album was nothing but a Roger Waters solo album and it had nothing to do with Pink Floyd but more of the selfishness of Roger Waters to bore us of war stories. He pretty much compromised a boring biography for good songwriting whcih is sad.    Here is the true concept of this CD:    The Post war dream - ROger's dream of destroying Pink Floyd album the masterpiece Animals. Unfortunately, the other Pink Floyd members won their war and the Wall came out.    Your Possible Pasts - Definitely sounds nothing like Pink Floyd's past cuz it sucks so bad.    One of the few - One of the few of the worst tracks on this album which is terrible    when the tigers broke free - The Tigers broke free because their ears couldn't handle the crappiness of this album.    the heros return - there must've been a david gilmour solo worth listening to on this track. the rest sucks.    gunners dream - his dream was to shoot waters for writing this garbage    paranoid eyes - I'd be paranoid too after hearing this track and somebody caught me listening to this.    get your hands... - yeah, get your hands on the eject button and burn this CD    fletcher memorial home - Thats where Fletcher is now since he killed himself after hearing this album.    southampton dock - Thats where David Gilmour tried to throw away the crappy demos of this album.    the final cut - the end of a great band is evident here. the final cut has been made.    not now john - not now john, this album is giving me a major headache!    two suns in the sunset - the end of a great band. the two suns have split in the sunset. one is the horrors of roger waters' bad solo albums and the other is polly samson writing all the lyrics for gilmour floyd.      this album is worse of an abomination than anything collins did with genesis without gabriel or was it?    Run, Run, Run  Run Like Hell cuz this album is bad!
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Ever since the release of \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\", Maiden has been a bit unpredictable. \\"No Prayer for Dying\\" and \\"Fear of the Dark\\" where clearly inferior in quality (and production) to Maiden's prior efforts. \\"The X Factor\\" took a totally different direction from the stripped down - back to the roots approach from it's two predecessors and was a very dark and mellow album that was rejected by many fans (though I personally think it was a solid album), and with \\"Virtual XII\\", Maiden attempted to go back to a more \\"Maiden\\" sound, though the album was brought down by bad production, bad vocals, and overall bad song-writing and is easily Maiden's worst album (even so, it still has a couple tracks that where very good). So, Blaze leaves, and Bruce Dickinson (along with Adrian Smith) are back in the fold, and Maiden releases \\"Brave New World\\", which was a very safe album with the same approach as Virtual XII, but with much better songwriting, production, and Bruce Dickinson on vocals. Then came \\"Dance of Death\\", which was more experimental, with songs like \\"Face in the Sand\\" and \\"Journeyman\\", which are a bit unorthodox by Maiden standards. The album was half killer/half filler (though the killer songs such as \\"Paschendale\\" and \\"Rainmaker\\" where very good). So the next step in the evolution is \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\"....    In \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\", most of the elements from recent Maiden albums are present, but it finally clicks. The slow, gloomy intro's and war-themed lyrics from \\"The X Factor\\" are present. The more up-beat, vintage Maiden approach from \\"Virtual XII\\" (though it failed in that album) and \\"Brave New World\\" are present, and the more experimental approach from \\"Dance of Death\\" is present as well.     \\"A Matter of Life and Death's\\" biggest strenth is the fact that it is a very solid album. There isn't a song that you can point at and classify as a clear filler (which unfortunately, there has been an abundance of those in the last 16 yearsfrom Maiden). Every song fits each other like a glove, and the album (for the most part) revolves around the themes of war and religion.    The album kicks off with the hard-rocking \\"Different World\\", which is a nice, fast rocker with good lyrics, and a great solo from Adrian Smith. \\"These Colours Don't Run\\" follows the recent trend of having a slow intro, though it works good  in this case, as the soft guitar harmony over the clean guitars sounds very good, which eventually lead up to a good guitar riff and an interesting verse, though the chorus sounds a bit out of place, in which Bruce sounds a bit strained. To me, \\"These Colours Don't Run\\" is the worst song on the album, yet, it's by no means a filler and it's still a good track. Then comes \\"Brither than a Thousand Suns\\", which is one of the highlights of the album. It's very heavy by Maiden standards. The song conitunes at a steady mid-tempo pace, then Adrian Smith ripps a very good guitar solo, one of his best since re-joining the band, which is followed by sweet vintage maiden guitar galloping in vein of The Trooper, which is followed by a great guitar solo by Janick Gers. \\"The Pilgrim\\" is a mid-tempo tune just over 5 minutes long with a nice eastern flavor to it. The song isn't anything special, but it serves it's purpose as a rather short, cathcy tune in an album full of epics. \\"The Longest Day\\" is another strong song. The gory imagery portrayed in the verse is very memorable, and the bridge and chorus are very catchy. \\"The Longest Day\\" also has very good guitar solos and harmonies that compliment the song nicely, making it one of the highlights from the album. Next in line is \\"Out of the Shadows\\", which would easily fit in into one of Bruce Dickinson's solo albums. The song has some clean rhythm guitars with great singing from Bruce Dickinson with scattered guitar leads throughout the song and some great lyrics. \\"Out of the Shadows\\" is one of my personal favorites from the album, and I wish Maiden would steer into the direction of this song a bit more for future albums. So, after a nice, soft mellow song, we get \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\", which after a mellow intro, is driven by a very heavy and catchy guitar riff. The vocal lines aren't anything special, though the breakdown and riffs, followed by a descent guitar solo from Dave Murray makes this song interesting. Then comes \\"For the Greater Good of God\\", the big epic, written solely by Steve Harris. The lyrics are very good and interesting, with a good chorus and good guitar solos by the trio. Though \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" is lacking a good guitar lick or a little something in the first few minutes of the song, the interesting lyrics and instrumental section definetaly elevates this song in quaility. The following track, \\"Lord of Light\\" starts out very slow and dark as Bruce almost whispers the opening lines. The song then turns into a fast and heavy tune highlighted by Bruce's wailing vocals and a fast, heavy, almost thrash metal-like guitar riff. \\"Lord of Light\\" eventually slows down again, and begins to build up, until Adrian Smith comes in and ripps another great solo, leading into the moment where the song shifts up a gear (again) in which Dave Murray delivers his best guitar solo in the album. \\"Lord of Light\\" is a great song, and is my second favorite on the album, second only to the album's closer, \\"The Legacy\\". Perhaps Janick Gers' best composition with Maiden, \\"The Legacy\\" is an exellent track. The acoustic guitars in the intro really adds to the song, which leads to a good guitar riff. However, the song really turns it up a notch at around the 5:35 mark, when a sweet guitar lick kicks in, leading to a great guitar solo from Janick Gers and some very good triple guitar harmonies.     So, the songs are good, how about the production? The previos album \\"Dance  of Death\\" sounded a bit muddy, however, producer Kevin Shirley did a great job with the production. Steve Harris' bass hasn't sounded as good as it sounds on \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" in a long time.     The musicianship is superb in this album. Adrian is great as always, as is Dave Murray, but (surprisingly to some fans) Janick Gers also has some very good contributions to both the song writing and guitar work. Nicko does gives a solid performance with the drums, adding a bit more groove than in prior albums, and Steve gives his best performance on bass since \\"The X Factor\\". The lyrics in this album are also very good and iteresting. The war theme is present as it is on many Maiden albums, such as in \\"The Longest Day\\" which is about the amphibious-landings on D-Day on the western front in World War II, \\"These Colour's Don't Run\\", which has lyrics about the chivalrious reasons and motivations that drive people to go to war, and \\"For the Greater Good of God\\", which questions the concept of a holy war and really has some great lyrics, especially the line     \\"Please tell me now what life is  Please tell me now what love is  Well tell me now what war is  Again tell me what life is\\"    as it really points out the contradiction of going to war on the basis of religios difference, since most religions claim to be about loving and value life, yet they stand against their teachings when they take people's lifes simply because they believe in something else.    Overall, \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" is a solid album, and it's easily the best album since 1988's \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" (which really isn't saying much considering the quality of some Maiden albums released post-1988). It definetaly is a grower, and might take some people a few listens for the album to sink in. The album isn't nearly on par with such classics such as \\"Piece of Mind\\" and \\"Somewhere in Time\\", but its good nontheless and a very solid release by Iron Maiden, one of ( and in my opinion) the best heavy metal band. I recommend this album.

I have a freind that completely transformed her financial life through using the principles of this book. It is easy to read and grasp. Equally importantly it is easy to put the book into ACTION!
B000002UJQ|1.0|I recently listened to OK Computer, then I listened to some of John Lydon's stuff with PIL (Johnny Rotten), and PIL's music is vastly superior to Radiohead's music.  PIL's music is the weirdest and most innovative music I have ever heard. The instrumental part of the music is far out, and so is the vocal part.  OK Computer sounds like bad pop music by comparison, it is just whiny 90's shlock pretending to be Avant Garde. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but listen to PIL and then Radiohead doing OK Computer and you will see what I mean.  I don't think the people who like OK Computer have good taste in music. <br />
0743289412|2.0|A beautiful story over-written, over-intimate and self indulgent. <br /> <br />1. The word \\"Smuck\\" in this novel has the same effect as Jar Jar in Episode I. By the 4th chapter I was so freaking tired of \\"smuck\\" and its alters (smucking, smucked, smucker...) that it distracted me from getting into the story and sort of made me hate Lisey because I hated the word so much. <br /> <br />2. The book consistently refers to the \\"language of the intimate marraige\\" - words and phrases Scott and Lisey use that no one else understands. True: All marriages have those phrases. Also True: No one outside the marraige gives a damn.  Tabitha King probably loves this book and her own secret language with the husband she nearly lost to a van and has spiritually lost to universities and \\"Incucks\\" - but frankly I'd like a more clear story and less intimate nonsense about a marraige that isn't mine. <br /> <br />3. Okay - so the main point of the book (other than \\"griefwork must be done\\") is that not only is professsional writing the greatest job that really sucks but being married to a writer also sucks.  Well, I'm married to a nurse - she gets puked on, yelled at, 12 hour shifts with no breaks, and for the priviledge of helping people with illness - she makes far less than a writer at King/Landon's level and I don't even get my shoes in her pictures because no one is taking them.  My friend is a soldier in Iraq who suffers threats everyday and doesn't get a professor to analyze the work he does - and yes - he gets paid a lot less that King/Landon - even if he lives through his darkness.  So stop with the self pity of the poor writer's trials and their lost privacy and stretched marraiges and give me a story, Mr. King. Its your damn job and its what you get paid for.
0440237688|1.0|that is recommended for students to read! It is ghastly! It starts out by sucking you into a mystery that you just can't figure out what is going on but with the ending you are left with a \\"WHAT?\\". My children were shocked to find out one of the main characters is a baby killer. What makes this book great? The others comment about the similiarities to the movie The Village but at least that movie has some good to it and has a message that doesn't leave you hanging!

I ALSO DO NOT WRITE ON-LINE REVIEWS (*NO OFFENSE TO ANYBODY, IT IS YOUR REVIEWS THAT HELP ME CHOOSE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS ON AMAZON, IT'S JUST THERE ARE THE REVIEWERS AND THE NON-REVIEWERS*!) ANYWAY, I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR A FOUR HOUR FLIGHT AND STARTED TO READ - IT WAS GOOD, PASSED THE TIME. I AM NOT A COMPLETER AND PUT IT AWAY ONCE I WAS HOME. THEN I GOT THE FLU AND GAVE IT A SECOND TRY . . . IT IS FANTASTIC! FAST MOVING, NOT BOGGED DOWN IN DESCRIPTIONS OF PEOPLE AND PLACES. YES . . . BY THE LAST 40 PAGES I KNEW WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD BE - BUT THE END \\"SHOCKER\\" WAS NOT THE POINT (NOT TO MENTION THAT ONLY MORONS ARE UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT THE ENDINGS TO 90% OF PROSE, MOVIES, ETC. I LOVED THIS BOOK AS MUCH AS LOVELY BONES (READ IT, IF YOU HAVE NOT!) I HAVE READ (MAYBE) 5 BOOKS IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS - BUT COUNTLESS BEGINNING CHAPTERS - DUE TO A VERY LOW (ADDISH ATTENTIONS SPAN.) THIS BOOK IS A GREAT READ AND IF YOU KNEW ME PERSONALLY YOU WOULD RUSH RIGHT OUT AND GET IT!
B000002KIT|5.0|Talking about music is like dancing about architecture, and taste is subjective, but for my money Thin Lizzy was the greatest live overseas band I ever saw, and I saw them many, many times. In a world that still foolishly hails the Stones as the Greatest Rock and Roll Band on Earth, and which still trembles at the supposed greatness of Led Zeppelin (who indeed were great in the studio but were, after their first two tours, simply and consistently GODAWFUL onstage)... revisiting this extraordinary album might bring some justice...    Twin lead guitarists that could match the talents of anyone of their day... Brian Downey, as sharp and driving and inventive a drummer as one can imagine (again, this John Bonham worship is nonsense, I'm sorry friends. Downey could have blown him off the stage.) And finally the much missed Phil Lynott, who besides having a fine voice and a powerful bass hand could write lyrics that could rip your heart out, not just of lost love but of war and legend and madness...)    This is a masterclass of guitar drenched rock reaching it's greatest potential. Rock and roll for adults. It's sad that Lizzy never made a dent in the States (they simply painted with too many colors and couldn't be categorized... hence deer in the headlight looks from critics...)    And if the tragedy of heroin has ever been more nakedly obvious it's in the passing of Mr. Lynott, as fine a poet and eloquent a soul as Ireland has ever produced.     Listen to the words. Then go Dancing in the Moonlight.
1582406723|5.0|In his introduction, Robert Kirkman says that the best zombie films are really about the characters and are a reflection on society.  <br />I agree. <br />He further states that his goal was to work in this tradition.  <br />He succeeds. Big time. <br />This book is a total winner. I cannot wait to devour volume 2.
B000002QWD|5.0|I found this CD at my local Food Lion for seven dollars - two dollars more than Amazon sells it for. But I'd be happy to pay twice or maybe even three times that much for this wonderful CD. <br /> <br />Sometimes, I feel like I am something of an anomaly of my generation, as I long for things from the days of old along with the current things that are popular. This CD fills my need for classic Christmas music, and makes me nostalgic for a time about 30-40 years before I was even born. <br /> <br />The CD is not perfectly remastered. There's hissing, crackles, and pops - not distracting or loud, but you can tell they're there. It sounds like a CD recorded from a record that's maybe been played once or twice. I like for my classic Christmas music to sound like this. Everything else, I like when it's slightly digitally remastered to take away hisses, crackles, pops, and noise so that you can hear the music, but not remastered to much that it sounds harsh. But for some reason, old Christmas music almost doesn't sound right if it's perfectly clean and clear and crisp. This CD doesn't. It sounds nostalgic. It sounds like old Christmas music should. <br /> <br />The music is extremely well done on this CD. The first half consists of mostly ballads, but very well done ballads, such as Silent Night, I'll Be Home For Christmas, and the classic title track. The second half has more pep, with guest appearances by The Andrews Sisters on three of the tracks - Jingle Bells, Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, (You may recognize these versions from the classic 1983 movie A Christmas Story, where you can hear them in the background of some scenes.) and the Hawaiian-inspired Mele Kalikimaka. Guest vocals are also used on Silver Bells by Carole Richards. <br /> <br />I wholeheartedly recommend this CD to anyone, young or old, who loves Christmas music the way it used to be. I love Christmas music old and new, but I definitely prefer older, more traditionally done Christmas music, and thisCD fits the bill. And it's a steal at the price Amazon is offering it for. You may also be able to find it at one of your local drug stores/grocery stores. It may be a few dollars more than it is here, but it's absolutely worth it.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This little independent film won my heart.  A warming tale about a disfunctional family and what happens when all of their own personal problems are crammed in with the rest of everyone elses' problems.  In this case the confined spaced of an early 70's model yellow VW Bus.<br /><br />  The young girl who is the main character bubbles over with energy and \\"owns\\" her role.  She is beyond cute.  The rest of the cast all being pros in their own right, as well.<br /><br />  Definitely a must see for lovers of warm, \\"true\\" feeling tales that help us to help ourselves.
0307237699|4.0|Let me begin by saying The Audacity of Hope is a fine book. It is optimistic, inspiring, and it is one I am glad I read. Senator Obama is beyond all doubt a charismatic figure, an intelligent man, a person of integrity and vision. However (yes, you knew there was going to be a \\"however\\") I was surprised that the more I read his book, the more I became unwillingly struck by the fact that this most interesting new figure in American politics almost seems to be trying to found a stance that reaches across to the left and right in a way that perhaps compromises an ability to define himself as anything other than so centrist and moderate he could one day be accused by both conservative and liberal alike of betraying his alleged loyalties to the values he professes. Yes, I found him honest, yes, I found him a welcome alternative to the stagnation in current American politics. His meteoric rise to national prominence is both fascinating and a great latter-day, boundary-shattering success story. I also think his very existence within his party represents a tremendous potential for Democrats to reclaim unfairly lost ground against mendacious Republican foes, but as I said earlier, I kept coming to the conclusion, much to my own consternation, that Senator Obama truly imperils himself in being almost TOO broad-based for real depth. Time will ultimately tell how much of a future this Senator and current popular culture superstar truly has. From his own words, I emerged liking him, but...somehow seeing him as not yet fully evolved or sure of his own views. I wish him luck. I think America needs more good people willing to step forward into public service.
