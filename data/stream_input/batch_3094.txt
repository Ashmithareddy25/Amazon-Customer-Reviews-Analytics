B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not an easy read, did not flow well, too many characters, however it grabbed me enough to complete it. Thought provoking-my book club was equally confused but a good discussion followed.
B007R11DKQ|2.0|Too much fantasy and crazy features.  I only watched a few minutes before I knew this video was not one I considered worthwhile.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|A really cute game that is easy to figure out and still challenging to play.  I think that even my kids might enjoy this one.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|I ordered this because it is the 25th Anniversary Holiday Barbie.  I have the complete collection and will display many of them during the Christmas Season.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The book was a very slow paced read...totally unlike the other books in the series. The ending is terrible. It feels almost like the author just  got tired of writing and quickly summed it up. I feel cheated. I waited so long for the final book to come out and have this big reveal after the Edith Prior video in the second book. Then, when you read the third book, there is barely any mention of her. I wish it would've had more suspense and intrigue like the other two books.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A great mystery.  I didn't see it coming. Couldn't put the book down once I started. Another Kate Morton success!
B00E3QJ7FG|5.0|This movie captures the isolation felt by m any computer geniuses back in the day it was &#34;uncool&#34; and projects their ambitions into a &#34;living&#34; epitome of love desired but unreachable. Despite another reviewer's reply about missing lines, I strongly recommend he watch this disk sober next time.<br /><br />Two unpopular high school students dream of being accepted and loved. As was an still is the case today, bullies ruin dreams. That is until Gary and Wyatt unwittingly create the &#34;girl of their dreams&#34; on Wyatt's computer who magically comes to life. &#34;Lisa&#34; is no mere girl though, more like a genie unleashed from cyber-fantasy into the real world.<br /><br />Lisa is far more than a living avatar. She is a teacher as much as servant. This movie shows there is courage in all, and that bullies are really cowards only picking on those they know they can beat. It is a wonderful romp into hilarity that transcends generations with a strong lesson about self-belief. I love this movie and have watched it a number of times. Now that it's on Blu-ray, I can proudly add it to my favorites' collection. It is and always will be timeless!
B00FHAB3HW|2.0|Meh, not my thing. I bought the album because I liked one of her singles. I find most of the rest of the songs to be worse than typical pop songs and her rapping is terrible.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|When you pick up your Kindle and you just don't have anything you want to read, this is real comfort food.<br /><br />I've read all these stories and they repeat well.  With the spin-offs currently on PBS and CBS, it's fun to see how the writers use the original material.
0812983459|5.0|I didn't think this book would be very interesting and there was a few negative reviews on Goodreads that almost put me off from reading this book at all. Much to my surprise I was delighted by this book and developed an affinity for Harold. The ending made me cry and I recommend it to everyone.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book always entraps me. The complexity of the characters and how they all fit together make it more than just the &#34;game&#34; that is never defined except by death. Very well written.
B004T4M5TM|5.0|I'm not a big fan of memoirs. They tend to be boring factual accounts and self-absorbed rambling of egomaniacs, in my opinion.<br />Upon the recommendation of friends, I got the Bossypants audiobook. It is such a fun, witty, book. I think the audiobook has to be twice as good as just reading the book because you get Tina's inflections and delivery. I laughed out loud in so many places, and the back-story for SNL and 30 Rock was fascinating. Her commentary on people who think they are deep \\"Let me be amazing at you\\" was so well said it keeps playing in my head when I come across one of them. Love you Tina!!!<br /><br />I was surprised to read the comments from the \\"downers\\" and I suspect if they had done the audiobook instead, most of them would have found this book awesome!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this and suggest you get the audiobook, over the written one if possible. Good fun.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|If you love puzzles, this is your game! Beautiful layouts and many different puzzles to enjoy! I recommend it for any age!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|this album is amazing screw all the haters who say this album sucks they most likely don't even listen to hip hop and just judge Eminem without listen anyway if your a hip hop or Eminem fan Im sure you will love this album my three favorite track are stronger than I was, bad guy, and so much better but every single song is awesome well worth the money WELCOME BACK MARSHALL!!!!!!!!!!!
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Well i like it . It mskes u seen how ppl act in there reall life . And it kinda show u the msrrued ppl's life as well .
B005HESLUA|5.0|Fantastic series! Capitan Janeway and her crew are in the Delta quadrant not knowing if they would ever get home and where it would lead them.  What an adventure, which developed over time into a great series. Sorry it ended. Great characters.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|its so annoying to have to wait after running out of lives. the game shouldn't stop. let us keep playing if that's what we want to do. and after each quest to wait 24 hours is a bit much. these changes would give it 5 stars
B0049J0DC8|5.0|This movie is a classic and I remember this as a child and now my daughter loves these movies! And now she can grow up with them as well!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Luv it all the way but after a while,once you have finished a world, its not as addicting...... I love it though so don't be hating!
B00D1X0576|5.0|must have to weed out bad Wi-Fi and Hot spots, is nice to show some places that their Routers are bad.  MY Son gets 50 Mgs I only show 3 down load speed. He was shocked at the difference.  He was complaining that His internet was bad. No He had not run his anti spy ware and clean up programs in months, He thought they did it all automatically right out of the box. Ran all the scans and repairs twice, then set all the auto scan's for him, Wow pages just flash on and up loading and down loads photos or video clips are in a blink of the eye. Wish I could get Comcast where I live. Yes Speed test is a very handy tool, you can put it on most all devises. and it's free and works.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book.  It was very suspenseful.  More so than the original.  I highly recommend this one. Stephen King fan or not it was an excellent story.
B009O2XY12|2.0|removed it, short play , then wants money to play. this is a trend in a lot of the ??? free games,  worse than Nevada slot's. and no pay outs. I will not put any of this Company's games or soft ware on any of my devices again.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|This is, I think, the worst movie I've ever seen.  Between idiotic lines, bad plot twists, bad acting, and what may be the most forced character development ever performed, this is actually worse than X-Men 3.  I liked several of the other recent X-Men movies, but any movie that could have been drastically improved by listening to the advice of a three year old in so many different places deserves a spot on the 100 worst movie's list.  I've thought about suing for psychological damages for having seen this movie.<br /><br />To put this another way, this movie actually would have been better if Joel Schumacher had directed it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|ok on PC and laptop but is really bad on phone and tablet,, keeps saying to update. there is no update???  takes for ever to up load photos to share with family. Fast and stalling free on PC and Lap top.  I have a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;  and Motorola HD smart phone.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|Don't be put off by the genre categorization which finds Gojira frequently yoked with the &#34;Death Metal &#34; label. Ultimately, such labels don't matter as much as the music speaking for itself. But the rseason I raise the issue is becuase I almost glossed over these guys thinking they were yet another cookie monster growling stock guitar riff confection. I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />Firstly, the music on this album (as well as on Sirius and L'Enfant) is absolutely breathtaking. I don't know how they play it, frankly. Gojira represent the best that modern thoughful metal has to offer. While complex, their music is not as cold and mechanical as Meshugga (who I respect but can't listen to). And while accessible, this is DEFINATELY heavy and explains their inclusion on tours with Lamb of God and Behemoth.<br /><br />But for me, the part that makes Gojira absolutely incredible, on par with Mastodon, are their lyrics. Happily, Joe Duplantier's singing is somewhere in between clean and growling--let's call it screaming--but whatever we call it, you can understand what he's saying. Which is a treat because Gojira break the metal mold by writing somgs about spiritual striving, nature, the redeeming possibility of suffering and pain, and the necessity of introspection. Where else do you find a metal band writing lyrics like these??? And believe me, it's not as if they're sophisticated lyrics FOR A METAL BAND...Duplantier is truly poetic...Take these lines from &#34;Vacuity&#34; for instance: &#34;Borrow this body for a lifetime, earthly material/My soul unraveled out of mental/The shell returns to dust, I focus on the present, concentrate on what I find/Accelerate the vision high beyond the curse of time/Bring light to my attention, the walls of, vacuum fall/This force increases and tells me where to go/Follow, I enter my dimension, awakened heart for life/Enforce my senses understanding/I find the will to live straight.&#34;<br /><br />What??? Here's Duplantier, amidst bonecrushing riffs, extolling the merits of meditation and discussing the revelations he finds about death fom living in the moment.<br /><br />DO NOT overlook this band. They are something special. This happens to be my favorite album of theirs but L'Enfant Sauvage and From Mars To Sirius are CLOSE.antier, amidst bonecrushing riffs, extolling the merits of meditation and discussing the revelations he finds about death fom living in the moment.<br /><br />DO NOT overlook this band.

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I like the social and ethical implications of technology that The Circle provokes one to think about. The plot and characters would have benefitted from greater development.
B00902AKK4|5.0|This is a fun game with simple mechanics, that is more challenging than it appears at first glance. Each level can be completed by merely reaching the end, but there are diamonds in each level that you must collect to get medals. Some of the diamonds are easy to get to. Some require serious out-of-the-box thinking. Fun for kids and kids-at-heart, alike. A must have as the Free App of the Day, and certainly worth the 99&cent; they're charging normally.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Was this book based on actual events? I would LOVE to know that...this book was sadly entertaining yet heart tugging at the very same time...two thumbs up to the writer!!
B001ECDVKE|4.0|I like the movie, but what i don't understand is why the Digital Version (the standard definition, not even the HD version) is $10, and you can buy this movie on a physical DVD for $5.50... Is Amazon promoting between the lines that it's ok to just buy the DVD and rip it into whatever format you want?<br /><br />More and more it seems that companies are making life increasingly difficult for people that want to follow the law (ie. don't pirate!) and still enjoy the digital stuff they've bought on their own devices.
0805053883|5.0|It's a very fun book for kids where they learn about animals and the sounds they make. The illustration is unique and creative. My son loves this book.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|i think it is okay because I do not like the beginning and the middle and it makes no sense.
1451666179|5.0|I love the blog.  Love it.  There was no chance I wasn't preordering this thing the instant it became available.  And then I bought a house, and the book was shipped out to my OLD address, and I wasn't even bothered.  I just bought another copy.  THAT IS HOW AWESOME HER BLOG IS.<br /><br />I was really happy to see that the book was also excellent.  It has my two most favorite entries - the one on cake, and the ones on depression.  (I've never seen someone so accurately describe depression.  IT IS EXACTLY LIKE THAT.)  The new entries are hilarious and reaffirm my decision that dogs are never going to be for me.  Ever.  The book itself is impressively thick - it's printed on really good quality glossy paper and has a nice heft to it, if you ever need to lob it at someone's head while you make your daring escape out the back window, giving you precious seconds to escape with your life.
1451666179|5.0|I waited a long time for this book and then had to wait even longer since both my kids glommed onto it. It's a book you shouldn't pick up if you have to be somewhere or do something in a few minutes because you won't be able to put it down until you've finished it.<br /><br />Laughed until I peed and only Christopher Moore has been able to make me do that.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|This is my all time favorite Halloween movie. I watch it every year and I'm sure I'll make my kids watch it too.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This game is fun for my sister because she plays it all day long! We totally like this game! Thank you for this game! View this please! (And Thank You!!! )
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in the series but because I wanted the Hollywood happy ending and we didn't get it I can't give it 5 stars. I also had trouble with the different point of views throughout the book. I found myself flipping back all the time to see who I was reading so there wasn't much difference in the way Tris and Four were written.
B00G32VYDG|2.0|MIB remade with dead people, almost to the point of ridiculous. Jeff Bridges did a decent job, but he was basically the same character type as Tommy Lee Jones. The similarities were too much.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was recommended this book and I can see why. Good book that kept my interest. I will be excited to see the movie. Didn't love the ending so I gave it 4 stars.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|I like the game, but sometimes when switching cockpit views the kindle fire will lock up and I have to do a hard reboot to fix it.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Easy to use and works as advertised, something that I have  not usually experienced in software. Excellent product that mets or exceeds my expectations.  Recommend it completly.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This is a great show with great writers, actors, and directors.  I haven't watched every episode yet, but I'm  impressed with the new ideas in each episode, as well as the way continuing story lines surface periodically.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|Bought em for an elderly. She now can enjoy going to church and hearing the sermon. Works great for what you pay.
B00EJOCAYW|4.0|Any kid that loves Legos and mine craft then this is the gift my kid loves it. Great buy for the money
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is a very relaxing game when I get home from work and need to unwind. It is a game that makes you think with every move, so it does my brain good also..
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|if you like candy crush, you'll love this. Not waiting time outs, no extras to buy. but beware when you get to hard level. I spent two hours trying to complete one, almost missed church that day. This is the second in series, try the first one too. MY FAVORITE of all the match games. Good hunting :)
B004YM6JI2|5.0|DVDs are great, and while season seven isn't great, it sets up to seasons 8 and 9, which are awesome. Love this series!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I just positively adore NCIS. The actors do no seem to be playing parts - they are all such good actors. Each season I watch just seems to get getter. The cast, the writers, the producers, all the crews are the best in the business I believe. Definitely worth watching.
B00G8P27PM|3.0|Sorry, did not seem to like this one as much as the first.  It was very colorful, but not too funny.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a fantastic read!  Not only for the smoking hot steamy sex scenes, but also for the depth the characters have.  Better than 50 Shades by far!  I can't wait to read the next book.  Sylvia Day has gained another fan!
006202406X|2.0|I was not expecting the story to go in the direction that it did.  After all the developments that were left pending from Insurgent, I was expecting closure from this book.  The ending doesn't make sense to me.  Why do that?  To shock us? I needed closure and this did not give me the closure nor the answers that I needed.  Characters that were developed in one way somehow completely changed at the very end.  Not happy with book 3
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I got this game on debut and have now logged a good 20 hours on it. Absolutely great, and it seems like the dev team have a bunch of great ideas on expanding it. Well worth the price.
0062119044|5.0|This is one of the few books I really found almost impossible to put down. It courageously deals with such a taboo subject, the mother who cannot bond with her son, and a child who is so completely disturbing and chilling that  it is hard to blame her for that failing. There is little doubt that Kevin is a born psychopath and the inevitability of tragedy to come as a result causes the tension to steadily mount as the book progresses.<br /><br />First rate and terribly believable.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I have this game on my pc and wanted to try it on my kindle and it is very addictive.  I am trying not to buy anymore so can only go so far for free but may have to buy the premium so I can finish the whole thing.  Takes some strategy to get the gold star but is possible.  Great time waster
B004IK8Q86|5.0|The Razor's Edge is a movie for adults without explicit sex, wanton violence, and four-letter words.  .  Interesting story set in the 1920s.  Good to see again Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, John Payne, Clifton Webb, and Herbert Marshall..
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I have had this game since my original Kindle HD and I still play it. I have dl'd and deleted hundreds of apps but this game (and Jetpack Joyride) is still in my library.<br />Simple to play but so addicting. Runs great on the Kindle Fire hd.  The developer continues to support the game with updates and new levels and items.<br />Quirky humor and smooth gameplay make this a keeper and a great time killer.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Work of art. Each song unique, borrowing some of the musical stylings of the Cure, Pulp, and the Beatles. Best album I have had the pleasure of listening to since 2007.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Having been stuck in a few books recently that I did not like, this book was a breath of fresh air. I liked it a lot.<br /><br />The pace is fair and Sanderson never fails to deliver good bantering dialog. The take on having superpowered people mainly as villains was a nice one in large part because I've become exhausted with the typical Marvel comics variety. While I did pick out a few of the twists in the story due to symmetry, I didn't quite pick out the climactic one, which I generally hold as a sign of good quality, especially when that final twist is basically logical and supported by the story.<br /><br />The thing Sanderson usually struggles with in my eyes is his attempts to physically rationalize his fantasy. He loves to throw around &#34;energy&#34; and &#34;pure energy&#34; and &#34;power&#34; and this clamors in my ears simply because he wants to jet off into pure fantasy, yet frequently tries to make motion and action seem physically plausible. Power and Energy are both physical concepts with real definitions. From a literary perspective, I can handle &#34;pulse of energy&#34; or &#34;blast of pure energy&#34; or &#34;glow of energy about the hands&#34; because it is simply a colloquial, qualitative use of the idea of &#34;energy.&#34; When he starts invoking &#34;photons&#34; --a direct physical idea with a precise definition-- and still uses &#34;energy&#34; in this qualitative fashion, I become a little less forgiving. Energy, from a physical point of view, is not something you can ever &#34;witness&#34; per se... Energy is basically a coupling ratio between physical phenomena and does not occur as an independent object. It's always an abstract descriptive number for telling how not always predefined sets of physical behavior can couple to one another. You can never have &#34;pure energy.&#34; When you want to talk about the phenomena, better to simply talk directly about the phenomena: &#34;pulse of energy&#34; might better be &#34;flash of light,&#34; &#34;blast of pure energy&#34; should perhaps be &#34;blast of heat&#34; and &#34;glowing energy in the hands&#34; would best be &#34;glowing hands.&#34; The human observer has no sensor for detecting &#34;energy.&#34;<br /><br />Hardly fair for me to blast Sanderson for this since popular culture and superhero comics are guilty of the same transgressions as a whole, but perhaps bringing it up in a public book review will have other would-be creators thinking about how reality influences fantasy.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Downton Abbey is a classic.  The Brits know how to produce intelligent, clean TV, vs American Holywood trash.  I have watched Downton Abbey five times and each time I discovered things I missed, like the period furniture, Robert Morris carpets, classical paintings, and their beautiful period fashions.  The Brits can make unknown actors into stars.  I will miss Dan Stephens in the next episodes.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This is a great read and I have to say I did not expect being as hooked as I am to all of the books by this author so far. I can't wait to keep goin and see what else is going to happen. Would love to see a movie made out of this whole series or maybe even a TV show. I think it would get a bunch of peoples interest.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|A great read! Suspenseful, and a great introduction to an interesting cast of characters. I read two more in this series after this.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This is a wonderful book. The characters are fully developed from &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;. The history lesson comes through an entertaining story. BAM
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The Walking Dead Season 4<br />What can I say, I'm hooked on this and I'm not a Zombie kind of guy.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|The iTunes part of this 'Digital Copy' did not work with 2 different sets of disks.  While this is a first for me with Amazon products, it didn't work for me and if you are buying this to use with your iTunes account, you may want to know that you'll be spending some time with someone to get it to work - if it really works.  Not worth the time for me.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|After Earth<br />I liked this movie! It wasn't what I was expecting. I imagined what I would have done if that was my son...
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved Megan and Todd's story.<br />Todd lost his wife and unborn child and didn't think he would find someone else.<br />Megan escaped and abusive marriage and moved to the town of Pride after her brothers unexpected death.<br />Together the two start to find more then friendship but Megan's past isn't far from her thoughts.<br />This story had me all the way through, I enjoyed Todd's siblings and can't wait to read there stories.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A Good story, lots of twists and turns! I enjoyed every page!  I can't wait to read the next in the series!
B000ZN802W|5.0|This movie changed my life. It is a great man movie and a touching real life story. This is by far one of the greatest movies of all time!
0891419063|5.0|excellant book this guy is featured in hbo's the pacific...its an diary of his experiences on the island hopping in ww2
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun for a while but then turned frustrating and annoying. Too stressful to enjoy. If I can't enjoy a game, then why should I continue to play?
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This one kept me wondering the whole way through it. I'm still not sure I liked all of the nuances, but it was a fun read. It provided the &#34;what's going to happen next&#34; that I like in a book.
B00A9ET4MC|1.0|I enjoyed Half of a Yellow Moon, The thing Around Your Neck, and Purple Hibiscus but this book seemed an unedited mess. Adichie wrote everything she had ever wanted to write and everything she thought was funny all in one book! I finished this book only because I'd promised a friend I'd read to the end. Very disappointing!
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Rented to watch with grand kids ages 10 - 15. All of them loved it. Good lessons to learn from it.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|It was really intense and super awesome! If you like zombie movies, you'll love it! Love brad pitt! Fast zombies!
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|Good songs and great songs on this album, no questions; Miley can sing, she has a powerful voice. No more Hannah Montana.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another well-paced andintriguing tale spun by John Grisham.  Had a tough time putting this one down.  Grisham does a great job of keeping the reader wanting to turn the page.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I absolute LOVE Alter Bridge and I was not disappointed! Fourth album and they are making new music and sound, and still manage to be Alter Bridge. Number eight.. Mmmmmmm no need to say more ;-)
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Awesome search engine - use it all the time! It always sorts according to what I'm looking for - unless, of course, I give it poor direction....
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|Fairly difficult game.It wound be much more fun on a tablet.The action is really fast but on a small screen,my control finger just got in the way.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Really great book, I especially appreciated the tact Blehm took to personalize the story. I wish I could share it with my Kindle equiped friends but I have the Ipad app.  More than just another story about Seals.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Five stars, no question. Spectacular on it's own, and even better if you've read The Shining and can connect to the story behind the story. This is another of Stephen King's best, jam packed with imagination and chills and right up there with It, The Stand, and Duma Key.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Love both the movie and book. The movie kept me entertained and was so fun to watch! I would recommend this movie to all of my friends.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Such an adorable movie! Pixar has done it once again, made a movie that any age can enjoy together or even alone!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Plugged it in, set it up, been playing Youtube and music on it ever since. Only issue is that it sometimes loses connection to my Wi-Fi network. It quickly resolves itself but still it can be frustrating.
B007NRAHU6|5.0|I love this movie, really great, it has lots of action and adventure, I hope they make another later on. You would wanna see this over and over again.
0385344228|5.0|and knew the areas mentioned. Was surprised with ending. I had a different ideaCouldn,t put the book down. It was very compelling. I also grew up in CAMBRIDGE
B00CQHZ2LW|5.0|For some crazy reason my 3 and 5 year olds love these little disney figures. They have not seen these yet as they are for christmas but I can tell you they will be a big hit!!  The characters are wonderfully detailed and always well made.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My daughter got me started playing candy crush saga,she said all her friends played and loved it. Well I do too and the compitition with other players is great. You got stuck on a level but I just can't stop playing.
B00DHKKN6Q|2.0|Just not that great. The game is colorful but doesn't really give you much direction. Too loose and not enough incentive to keep playing.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|How come Amazon always gets forgotten? This game has different updates on android and on I o s but still not on Amazon. There have been 2 major title updates but Amazon still hasn't gotten even one. Please Amazon get more updates on this game. This is a great game and all good graphics and great story but still needs some updating
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like everything about it except you don't get enough time and you have to keep submitting to get more chances.  When you run out you have to come back later.  The game itself is colorful and quick.
0756656230|5.0|Awesome book. My son loves it. Some cool stuff in there. It gave us some cool ideas for building and collecting
B00FX8EY60|5.0|She has a very cute perpect on what is the sound to multitude of generations.  Her songs are absolute brilliant and full of styles.  I found it a great album in my collection.
B008PU8OGE|1.0|Be forewarned - this edition is ONLY part 1 of Little Women. When Alcott originally published Little Women, it was only part 1. After its success, she followed it with Good Wives. These two volumes were published together as Little Women starting in 1880. This publisher has separated the two, and is selling them as separate titles. If you are expecting the complete text of Little Women, DO NOT buy this edition.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|O man! I thought this movie was going to be cheesy but I was in for a surprise. It has a neat story line building up to suspense the animation was very eye appealing. If you liked real steel you will like this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|its a fun game but, with the neverending levels,  why does it have to be so hard? Sometimes people are stuck on one level for months unless they spend money. Takes the fun out of it.
B00407PNWO|4.0|Probably my mistake but this edition only contains disc 1 of 2 - the disc itself even says disc 1, I have seen the other disc before and loved the additional material on it. The movie is still a classic and in my opinion the best Robin Hood movie Hollywood has ever done.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What I like about this app is the weather map that shows my area and where the clouds are or will be shortly.  Accurate and fast this is a good weather app and I've used several of them.  Also easy to program when you are traveling to show destination weather or travel weather
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|This app is very fun,and it's totally worth the 99&cent; ! This game  Is for any age and you need to defeat the bully monsters!! Go on a fun adventure with fatpebble and save clay jam!!!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great story, great special effects, good acting.  This movie is a must see for sci-fi fans!  Watch it in 3D, well worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I am very disappointed that this is free game but you can only play short time without waiting for more lives.  You try to get money at every area. It would be better to just pay up front.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|This is a fantastic read and well-worth your time! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bezos has built a brilliant company through a combination of stunning ambition, intelligence, hard work, and a focus on customer service. The author is clear about that on every single page. In fact, one of the overriding themes in this book is that Amazon was built entirely on providing excellent customer service. In my experience as a user, I completely agree.<br /><br />There are so incidents, however, that give pause to the reader. The author's telling of the takeover of Zappos.com (he contends that Amazon spent $30 million building a competing site just to drive Zappos to selling terms) and Diapers.com (he says that Amazon engaged in predatory pricing, selling diapers at a $100 million loss in order to drive Diapers.com to an agreement to sell) are troubling to say the least. I intend to do more research on these two takeovers to see what I can learn. I think on the whole you get a very interesting look at the company everyone knows, and some avenues to do your own research.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book and series is so much more than sex. It was awesome to read and figure out why fifty is the way he is. And how Ana and Christian fall in love.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Surprised at her great energy.  She still shines with great lyrics and a strong voice.  I am glad she is still recording!  Crazy tattoos  and all.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|One of the campiest movies you'll every see. Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep are life long frenemies, Bruce Willis is the man who comes between them. Isabella Rosselini is the sorceress who offers them both eternal youth and beauty. However, their petty rivalry, seffishness, and vanity get the better of them and they ruin the gift they are given. both actresses vamp it up for their roles and you can tell they're having a great time.
B00FOWX6NM|4.0|This is a very good case. It's nice, and it is clear so you can see your iPhone's color. It comes with a screen protector, which is nice, and the case allows you to put your own photos in the back! That's an awesome feature.<br /><br />Although, here's where the bad stuff comes in. The case itself is very protective, but it is mildly lose on the iPhone 5S. I'm assuming that this is the &#34;Air Cushion&#34; part of the case, but I thought that it was only on the edges... It's lose everywhere for me.<br /><br />But overall, this is an okay case. I might recommend it to you, because it's clear and protective, but if you have an iPhone 5S, you might have that feeling that your phone might just slip out of your case.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show! The zombie apocolypse has led to a breakdown in society and its become very savage out there.There are still very bad people out there who are about as ruthless as the undead. You'll find yourself waking up in the middle of the night trying to figure out how you can escape the walkers when they show up.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I love all his books. Always surprising. Always very insightful. It is wonderful being guided to think and understand in new ways. Thank you mr. Gladwell. Again.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I am a big fan of Alien and Aliens; this is sort of a prequel. The alien is a little different, but you can see where Ridlrey Scott is going with the story.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I love this book. I had serious readers remorse when it ended. A classic that everyone should read. Highly recommended
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|A great movie, well written and expertly performed.  A really intriguing story.
B0053O89WY|5.0|More Big Bang Theory awesomeness. I just love this show - every part of this show. It fits my kind of humor to a T!
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|I ordered this through the official waba fun website and played with it for almost 2 hours straight.  It is so hard to put down.  This is really overpriced here on amazon.  You can get 11 pounds of it on the official site for $45, although shipping isn't cheap.  But Just playing with 5.5 pounds (it comes in two bags) is almost too much for one person, so it's plenty.  I plan to give the other bag as a gift.<br /><br />It really is as mesmerizing as the video.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down and read it in a day. The surreal story of the characters really makes you think about the possible future of our society and world. I know I am thankful for my family and my freedom. This is not just a great read, but full of amazing life lessons.

B005LJK3AC|5.0|Such a funny movie I could watch it over and over. If you don't think it's funny then you aren't human
B003G4W49C|5.0|A clever story with a deeply moral message that causes you to think about what you as an individual are or are not contributing to society.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|You can't beat Michael Buble for providing a consistently enjoyable album every time. He knows how to sing the oldies best and always offers creative new songs for us to enjoy.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|A bit complicated . I  lost  out  on  who  the  characters  were  and  where  they apppeared  from .. It  is  readable  , but did  not  satisfy  me.  I did  not  finish  the  book  saying  &#34;that  was  great  read&#34; . I  finished  the  book  saying  ,  ' thank goodness  I  managed  to  finish  it&#34; .
1451695195|4.0|A very well-written book that one can't put down because you keep hoping it will provide definitive evidence of the presence of heaven. Sadly, he didn't convince me but I do face death with new hope that there will be a better place for me ...........
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Not to rant but not having Eric Nylon write all the halo books is a huge mistake. He is by far one of my favorite authors, the way he makes the books come alive. As far as this book goes, it is simply amazing. Great character building, great action, great everything. I honestly can not say enough about this book. It will always hold a special place in my heart.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book, the story was well written and the characters felt so real.  I was there with them in Germany!  I recommend this book, I found it interesting and touching.
B001RP1G0U|3.0|Untrainable...It is nothing like the real world of electriconic dating !!!!!<br />If it were...I would be back on it ...nice try though.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth continues to be a series that amazes me every time I watch it.  The camera angles and shots are simply breathtaking and leave you asking, \\"How did they get that shot?\\", and the small glimpse that the series provides into the lives of the animals and environments that we share our world with will leave you without words.  With a 5 year production time and a $25 million dollar budget, Planet Earth is one of the most ambitious endeavors ever embarked on to document the world around us, and that it does.  This product purchase is a no-brainer for the nature or science enthusiast, or simply those in love with cinematography.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|One of my favorite games to play I like it and if u like hunting u will like this game<br />Download it and enjoy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What a fun, easy and addictive game, right up my alley.  I have been waiting for this to be available on Kindle Fire.
B005WMADYE|5.0|Arrived quickly brand new as promised. Movie was very good, crazy action fun to watch. Has a sceen with nipps haha.
B00A2H9PLG|4.0|Lots of action and of course Channing Tatum is always a nice touch to any movie. Saw it on the big screen and new it would be in my personal collection. Don't get it if you take yourself or entertainment too seriously. This is pure entertainment only. No one was going for an academy award, just an afternoon at the movies to kill a couple of hours.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Low cost and effective way to brush up,on German and to learn French? It is fun to use, more like a game, competing against my aging memory!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wow, just works. It's awesome. Works well with HDMI Projectors! Windows 7 Pro x64 .<br />This is the way to go.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent writing and an epic tale that is so contemporary. Only in an interconnected world, from tribal society of Afghanistan to a secular US, it is a tale of change floating on the old of family, love, and death.
B000L43AN4|3.0|Let me first say that I'm not normally a Tom Waits fan.<br /><br />&#34;Orphans&#34; is a good name for this album.  It's a mish-mash of various songs.  As to be expected, it's hit-or-miss.  When it's good, it's good.  If you're looking for an album you can put in the CD player, hit Play and walk away, this isn't it.  BUT it's still worth a listen.  You'll find a few favorites here and there.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|I just like everything of her music, and I was waiting for this cd to come out to buy it
B00F1W1SS0|4.0|So Dream Theater's Luna Park concert film has finally arrived.<br /><br />Mostly, it's as good as we all hoped. The band sounds great, and James LaBrie is absolutely on fire. Overall, the show is tighter if not more scripted than before - the band play to a click track while vocal harmonies are piped in to a poorly miming John Petrucci. Some will find this offensive, but really, it's for the best. Whereas James often sounded weak and thin as the sole singer on choruses of previous releases, here none of the songs feel incomplete compared to their studio components.<br /><br />The main feature contains almost all of the songs from A Dramatic Turn of Events, while the rest of the ADTOE songs are included as bonus features. This makes Live at Luna Park a unique and worthy installment in a series of concert films from a band who already have so many, though I can't help but feeling like there was some missed opportunity, too. \\"The Root of All Evil\\", \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\", \\"War Inside My Head\\", and other songs on one or more previous DVDs are present, while other songs which have never gotten good DVD treatment are left unplayed.<br /><br />In what appears to be an anomaly, the Beunos Aires crowd is disappointing, and buried in the mix anyway. They can barely be heard, and they are not energetic, anyway.<br /><br />In another dumbfounding move, the \\"wealth of extras\\" promised with the first delay has also not panned-out. There's a barebones documentary here, as well as some behind the scenes stuff, but really there isn't much here you wouldn't find on a typical concert film.<br /><br />But overall, the main feature is what counts, and I'm happy to say that it's up there with Score and Budokan.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Jodie Foster was ripped off for the award that was given to Kim Bassinger in &#34;LA Confidential&#34; and her role was not 1/2 as great as JF! This is one of my all-time favs!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the best written shows currently on TV with a stellar cast. It's smart it's sexy and the cast is so much fun to watch.
B004ASNG04|4.0|This book is an intellectual tour de force. It sets out a highly compelling Grand Theory of History, that argues that the material and military superiority of the West against other civilizations is basically a product of geographic luck. He does so with an interdisciplinary approach, weaving together not just history but archeology, economics and more. The book is very well written and engaging.<br /><br />Is it true? Well, strictly speaking, it's impossible to know.<br /><br />But that's besides the point. The book is, as I said, primarily an intellectual tour-de-force. Asking whether its thesis is true is like asking if a cathedral is a good bunker. Just admire the arches, the frescoes and the stained glass windows.<br /><br />And this is where the main failing of the book comes in. In making his case for his Grand Theory of History, he argues strenuously against the opposite Grand Theory: the one that says that it is primarily ideas that shape history. In this version, it is because Western civilization had certain ideas--perhaps a greater faith in the individual, or a greater emphasis on reason, or a lower emphasis on tradition--that it ended up winning. Morris strenuously argues against it, repeating over and over that &#34;every age gets the thought it needs.&#34; In other words, the material historical circumstances led to certain ideas being produced and adopted, but they were the consequence of the evolution, not the cause. Morris argues this repeatedly by arguing that other civilizations had similar ideas, and that supposedly-groundbreaking Western ideas were not so groundbreaking. Regardless of whether his argument is right or not, it would have been a HECK of a lot more convincing if Morris did not make freshman-level mistakes in his *exposition* of said ideas. If you want to convince someone that British philosopher X had the same idea as Chinese writer Y, you had better describe British philosopher X's ideas correctly, otherwise your argument will fail. But most of the time, Morris doesn't clear that bar.<br /><br />In the end, while Morris presents a very compelling argument for his own Grand Theory, his argument against the main competing Grand Theory fails--not because it is wrong, but because it is not even wrong. This is the main way in which the book leaves to be desired.<br /><br />In the end, is Morris right? It's hard not to see the politics underlying his book: if the West didn't win because of any sort of cultural or intellectual advantage, then its culture has no particular value relative to others. His book prophecies the domination of Asia and warns darkly of the apocalyptical consequences of global warming. These ideas are all popular among today's cosmopolitan elite which is the book's intended audience. As Morris writes, every age gets the thought it needs...
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Outstanding in depth background on individuals and the lead up to their actions. Provides understanding of blurred lines of combat and war.
1451666179|5.0|Allie is a great story teller, this book is hilarious, you should buy it right now. I was reading it at my child's martial arts class and couldn't help laughing and crying in a rather disruptive fashion. That's no hyperbole this book is just that funny. I'm pretty sure the other parents think I'm insane now.<br /><br />To Allie, I would write you an email but I wouldn't want to burden you like that, but I figured you are obsessively reading every review written by every idiot out there, so I write to you here. You are hilarious, and very brave. I had my friend read one of your blog posts, and wanted to punch her in the face because they weren't hysterical with laughter. But I didn't, you know, because I have fake dignity to protect and have to keep up the facade of niceness and all.  I don't understand why anyone who has seen your work would not want to crown you queen of the internet. You have a lot of self-awareness for someone so young, be proud! As far as I can tell, the only limitation you have is that you are too aware of your own B.S. to ever be a politician. Maybe you should put a warning on this book, what if people unaware of their own inner BS read this and are made aware? Yes you improve the world, but won't they be mad at you?<br />I will say that it occurred to me that not many people would admit to the self awareness that you have, and I have contemplated that you are being held prisoner in a basement somewhere by an evil publisher being forced to write and draw for our entertainment. Having some issues with selfishness, I have been debating if I should mount a rescue or simply wait for more books and blog-posts. If you are indeed in need of rescue, place a random unicorn in your next blog-post. I have found a selfish reason for rescuing you, you can reward me by giving the Allie Brosh treatment to one of my humiliating childhood experiences.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy this app! It does have some problems loading at times, but it seems today straighten itself out. They're very generous in giving you free puzzles.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|yes this game is really really really really fun I enjoy being able to upgrade my robot and all that stuff.
1400032717|4.0|Started out really intrigued by this book and characters.  About 1/2 way through I felt it took a turn and I lost a lot of interest.  Appreciated the development of the special needs boy since I'm a spec Ed teacher.  For the most part I thought the author did him justice.  But the storyline just got too far-fetched and maudlin for me.  Won't read twice.
B0076I624W|5.0|Being older, this touched a spot. Hope I can be as dignified as Mr. Hopkin's character when Joe comes for me.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Great companion to the original perplexus.  My young grandsons and grown children all enjoyed it!  I'll by others like this!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I'm old and can fully relate to this movie. Great selection of stars to play the roles that they did. The setting was perfect and the comedy parts were hilarious.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I can't wait for season 3. We tour through the first two seasons wishing there were more than 6 total episodes. I love the villain in this too. The casting and acting are top notch.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Yes the story is a bit cheesy at times but the effects are cool. It's a family movie meant for the tweens and under but many were led to believe it was supposed to be more than that. Go in with low expectations and you'll be fine.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its a challenge to play but rather addictive.  Seems to be liked by men and women alike.  My sons play it all the time and they are 42 and 45 years old,  Their kids play it also, so it is geared for any age as I am 68 and the youngest grandson who plays it is 4.<br />Great game for making you think.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|My favorite of the series so far, look forward to the rest!!! The plot just keeps twisting and turning. tragically at times. I'm hooked
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game!  I am wasting many hours playing. You want to have lots of time. It is very addicting.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|It seemed like a long AA advertisement. This movie is not really about a plane flight but about a person's flight from crashing in drugs to recovery, and it does not really go in depth with the character, just a lot of bad scenes showing abuse. So, not much of a story, the 1 star for DW bringing something to the show. I would not bother watching this. I guess I felt it was a disappointment because I was expecting a movie about a plane, pilot, and court drama and it does not.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Special effects are awesome, story to put it politely is a collection of homages to other mediocre sci-fi features. Characters are stereotypical. Theme song is repetitive.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought Chromecast to be able to watch Netflix on my television.  I began the installation process. It said to use Chrome as a browser. I did. I installed. It said that a little icon would appear on the website I wanted to cast, for easy casting. I went to Netflix. There was the icon. I clicked on the program I wanted to watch. And a message appeared stating that Netflix was not supported by Chrome, and recommending I use Windows or Safari. Which is perhaps why the video was cast, but not the sound.  All the work and money that went into developing and marketing Chromecast, and they didn't expend the energy ahead of time to work out coordination with Netflix?  I returned it.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Wonderful!  If you followed show, it's a must have. Can't wait for season 2.  Am so ready for next dvd set!

1932100660|5.0|I wanted to wait until I was thoroughly a vegan myself (enjoying the food and the health benefits) before reading this extraordinary -and very readable book - to give me the science and the reasons why more people aren't vegan.  I suspected deliberate sabotage and, alas, my suspicions have been confirmed.  Go for it, convince yourself and then dare to be different.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I like putting my mind to work, I love a challenge even thou the way I learned to play Backgammon is a little different I still like it . I have always liked Backgammon years ago.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|10-minute set up.  I bought it to share youtube videos with my husband, who is computer illiterate and has no intention of changing that mindset.  It works well.  I'm hoping this latest toy will slowly lead to his curiosity and skill level to the point of actually using a computer.  He learned Roku with ease, this is the next step.  I just do not have the time to continually look things up on the web for him when he's capable of learning to do it himself.  Also, we cut the cable cord earlier this year and it gives us unlimited, on-demand choices.  Fast shipping with Prime, as usual.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend of my new son-in-law, so I took the plunge. It was the best book purchase I've made in a long while. I did have to sleep, and work, and eat - all of that stuff. But whenever I read, I believed it all...
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Gut wrenching mystery with amazing character development with flawed but compelling main characters. Beautful and eerie  surroundings, very  British. Couldn't stop watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Well I must admit this is possibly the best match 3 game I've played. The graphics and animation are adorable. It's challenging and, yes, addictive, which is why I appreciate the requirement to wait for lives since I actually must get things done..Oh and I haven't spent any money or connected to Facebook. Good sweet fun.
B0088W6LAK|5.0|Series really starts to take off here, expanding the universe beyond the known enemies and making allusions to future episodes. Still great, if somewhat cheesy, sci-fi action with a healthy dose of character development and drama.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Implausible? Sure. So what? I F'n loved it. Should've purchased instead of rented. Acting + storyline + visuals all on point. Most entertaining flick of the year, for me. See this.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Where do I begin?!?!?!?!<br />I am on page 103 and still deciding weather to finish or not.  This series is like eating a juicy red apple and gobbling it up to find a hoard of worms in the middle.  I want to remember the joys of reading the first 2 books and not sure I want to spoil that with the last book.  I do want to finish the story and I am going to try and read some more.  I am all about twists and turns and people dying so I am ok with whatever ending Roth throws at me.<br />What I am most disappointed in is the writing style.  This book reads as if someone totally different wrote it.  I am ok with the story point of view going from one character to the other.  BUT thereare a lot of:  \\"I say, _____\\" sentences instead of things like  \\"I blurted\\"  \\"I huffed\\"  \\"I said in anger\\"  \\"Sadly I said\\"  Reluctantly I said\\"  etc.  Where was the feeling?  A lot of short sentences.  I want to hear how Tris feels kissing Four.  Not:  \\"we kissed.  We pulled apart\\".  I want:  \\"I still had butterflies every time our lips meant....\\"  These emotions which made you fall in love with Tris and Four in the first two books make me fall in love with these characters.  I teared up reading their story in the other book, I wanted to fight for them.  Now I am just reading a blocky, black and white story.<br />TO ROTH:  I am sorry and feel as if I'm betraying you and your works writing this review.  Keep your emotions and feeling in your writing.  This books feels as if someone totally different wrote it so if someone told you to do this, don't do it again!  Go with your gut.  Good luck with your next writing and I will read it and hope it's better than this book.

0385537670|5.0|I think it is the sexyist book I have ever read.  Strictly adult matterial  .  HOT!  HOT!  HOT!  Couldn't put it down.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this is awesome you should try it I love this game oh yeah come on try it come on try it come on
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super addicting, I've been playing it for about a year now... The ONLY downfall... I wish I could log into my account from more than one device.... And sometimes your extra lives just vanish (just a bug they need to work out).  Still a five star game though!
B008FRFN7A|3.0|It found my printer easily and prints to it, though with one problem.  Web pages are rendered as landscape and I haven't found a way to correct this.  Otherwise it's kind of cool.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Loved it!  Couldn't stop watching it.  Intriguing plot and brilliant characters along with great acting made for an exciting series.
0812993357|1.0|Here a name, there a name, everywhere a name dropped. What a dull book about what must have been a life of some interest.<br /><br />This is the book for you if you like paragraphs that are something like this, \\"Jerald and I did a marvelous shoot in Paris. We waited until there was some morning fog and the model was Sarah Picknoseington, whom I adore. At the last minute I cried out, \\"No, wait! Use these Versace earrings and dug a pair out of my personal bag. The photos were great.\\"<br /><br />If you find the above mildly interesting, imagine page after page after page of  such \\"adventures.\\"<br /><br />This book is like a laundry list -- a memoir with everything but meaningless facts edited out.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Mary Poppins is a wonderful show! My daughter and I loved watching it together and singing along. it is a must-see.
B009CGGHL4|5.0|This is a classic Brit comedy and should be in everyone's library. Good fun, touching moments and terrifying gore. What's not to love?
0375842209|5.0|My sons are reading this in 7th grade. They love that the narrator is 'Death'. My whole family is intrigued by the WW2 era.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is the first King book that I have read in about 15 years (I got mad at him when he said he was retiring and then published more books than at any other time in his career) and boy did he do The Shining justice. This is a fantastic sequel and was so much fun to read. Starts right out of the gate with a terrifying chapter, but then the story just becomes this amazingly engrossing mystery and ends with an epic battle between good and evil. I loved it!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|It goes with the set of movies already owned. Great buy at the price and I will cherish this forever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It is so much fun. The best part of it is that it's free!And, if you update it, it's still FREE!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending, one you would not expect. I am really sad I've reached the end of this trilogy. :) :)
B000FC2OHA|5.0|This was an extremely difficult review to write and comes after nearly two years of constantly applying and re-reading The Success Principles.<br /><br />How do you review a book for an author who has changed the lives of over a half a billion (yes billion with a B) people worldwide, and counting?<br /><br />Jack Canfield is well-known for co-authoring the \\"Chicken Soup For The Soul\\" series, but in my opinion, this is his greatest masterpiece ever, and the most valuable book on my shelf.<br /><br />I have multiple copies, one personally autographed by Jack (which you can pry from my cold, dead hands), one that has been read several times over and has sustained abuse from highlighters, pens, and weather elements (For six months straight, I took the book to Venice Beach at 4:30AM and would read and take notes while the beach and Boardwalk were empty). I picked up another two copies so that my office copy can stay in the office, and another to circulate. My office employees have read it and I've recommended it to EVERYONE in my Network Marketing downline. I am constantly referring to The Success Principles to train others in my organization.<br /><br />The book is 450+ pages and covers 64 essential principles that well help you in every area of your life. Discover how taking accountability for yourself, Learning How To Ask, The Rule of Five, Getting into Action, and Proper Focus will put your business (and life) into overdrive. Those are my favorite five principles, but all 64 need to be applied.<br /><br />This is not just a book you read cover to cover and stick back on the shelf. It's a lifelong journey in which you keep the book closely guarded and turn to so that every time you face difficulty in relationships, business, or any area of your life, you can go back, re-read, and apply the appropriate principles to your situation. I have lost count of how many times I have resorted to this book to remind myself how to live my life (hey, stuff happens -- you get suckedinto negative situations or you get overwhelmed and think you can't do something, but The Success Principles serves as my greatest resource to overcoming these and a friendly reminder that you can't control events but you can control your response to them, changing the outcome).<br /><br />E+R=O (Event + Response = Outcome) is a formula I truly wish everyone had a strong grasp on, along with taking 100% Accountability for themselves. This alone has the potential to change the world for the better.<br /><br />Imagine, if the outcome of political elections made no difference in anyone's life and that person took 100% accountability for themselves and tailored their response to not be dependent on such events. Substitute politics with any other factor -- religion, or even small stuff such as the weather or traffic. You alone can make a difference in your own life with just this principle, but what would happen if the whole world woke up and applied it? It would be a game-changer.<br /><br />Personally, I am now on to practicing the Principles of Master Mind Groups and serving others with zero expectations on behalf of myself and the results are astonishing.<br /><br />You are going to need at least one notebook and journal to go along with this book for the copious amount of notes and action steps you will be writing. Go through the book several times. The principles are written in a generic fashion so that they can be applied to any area of your life.<br /><br />If you really want a jump-start, I would suggest ordering The Success Principles Quick Start Pack from Jack Canfield's website instead. You get the book, an audio course, workbook, and online bonuses that will give you a jump start in your first thirty days. Then go read the book in its entirety.<br /><br />On a personal note, I have been blessed to meet Jack Canfield twice, speak with him, and attend events at which he was a keynote speaker. In his presence you feel an awe-inspiring aura reach out. He trulywalks the talk and his humanitarian personality shines through in The Success Principles. The book and my personal encounters with him have not only made drastic improvements in my life and business, but have also taken me to the level of having a deep desire to serve humanity in a greater capacity.<br /><br />The book was published nearly ten years ago, but I didn't find out about it until two years ago. Surely there are millions of others who have not picked up a copy. If you are one of them, order it now, start reading, and more importantly, apply the principles as you learn.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This book shows the horrors of being a woman in Pakistan and other similar countries who are controlled by the Taliban.  Her bravery knows no  bounds - she is an incredible young women - a girl of 16 with the wisdom of 50.  Everyone should read this book.<br />Good luck to Malala and others like her.  Until ALL women rise up against the cruelty to women these countries will never move on and stay steeped in the 15thCentury.  PLEASE READ THIS BOOK.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Unless you've been in a cave with no communication to the outside world and just crawled out, there's a high likelihood you have heard of The Law of Attraction. Perhaps you've tried to make it work for you and it just didn't.<br /><br />Proponents will tell you that you didn't have faith and belief with a strong conviction, and your increasing doubt makes it only harder to create your own reality.<br /><br />This book overcomes that by giving you nine experiments to prove to yourself that it does work.<br /><br />I am a firm believer in the Law of Attraction, and I have to admit, that after reading about some of these experiments I was skeptical. But lo and behold, I manifested a check out of nowhere -- totally unexpected and from an institution I would have never suspected would send me money.<br /><br />I rarely see butterflies (or at least I never noticed them much) and certainly did not expect to see them on a cold day in October, but nonetheless I spotted several in experiment two (and a few sunset-beige cars).<br /><br />I cheated on experiment three and used dowsing rods, and managed to knock off three pounds in experiment seven while continuing to indulge in carb-laden sinful meals and treats. In fact, I liked experiment seven so much I didn't stop after three days.<br /><br />All nine experiments proved beyond a reasonable doubt that we do create my own reality and can manifest what we desire.<br /><br />The only \\"complaint\\" I have about the book is the length of time it takes to get through it. Most of the experiments take 2-3 days and one takes a week. Took me about a month to go through everything, but well worth it.<br /><br />Get yourself a copy, start reading and doing and in less than a month you too will have proven to yourself that it works. Once you do that, you'll have a stronger belief which will help to manifest your desires quicker.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|Stargate SG-1 has a great continuing plot line and themes.  It is awesome with the exception of occasional foul language and suggestive content.  If those things were absent, it would be phenomenal.  And Richard Dean Anderson is the man!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|F or a free game, I can't complain. Loads fine, you have to wait for more lives so you can't continually pay but again it's free.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful! I had heard my friends saying how good it was. So, while sitting in the ICU waiting room for days, I watched every episode and now can't wait for the new season!
B0048WQDIE|4.0|Heller has an undeniable flair for language, though it took me a little while to get into his book. Once the stage is set, Catch-22 really takes flight (pun aware).
0812550706|5.0|I bought this book when I found out they were making a movie of it. I thought, &#34;hey, I should read that before I see the movie.&#34; And I'm so glad I did! The book was shocking and great!
B00G8P27PM|5.0|Such a cute movie! Almost as good as the first one. It was cool to see where it all began, how enemies can become best friends.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I've been slowly collecting all the seasons. And this one is so good and cheap! I am in love with this show!!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell massages a few of his examples to fit his double theses in this book. But the ideas introduced are sound. (1) Underdogs, because of their underdog status, are often forced to fight the fight or play the game on their own terms, and because of that, they find new ways of approaching the contest that ends up giving them a huge advantage. (2) Conversely, giants who have perceived advantage may be at a huge disadvantage, specifically because of what we commonly would perceive to be advantageous.<br /><br />The anecdotes and stats that Gladwell uses to illustrate these points are always a fun ride.
0525478817|5.0|John Green is such an amazing author. This was so beautifully written. At times it took my breath away. It made me laugh and cry. I could read this over and over.
1408173352|5.0|though i never read the novel, found the play to be an insightful journey into the mind and emotions of the young central character on the spectrum and his interaction with those in his world and their prejudice of perception.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Just as good as the other seasons. I've been waiting forever to buy this and when it came out and I saw how cheap it was, I was ecstatic. I love Supernatural!
B005C0DHEY|5.0|A superior criticism which, although amateurish, is very timely, considering that more and more media outlets are beginning to realize that maybe all this natural gas is not quite a free gift. In fact, it's hurting a lot of people.
B005KELR3A|5.0|This fits the Paperwhite well and is not slippy. Also I like to take the book totally out of the cover to hold .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very time consuming... but still it is amusing. Fun game. Pop sample of all ages will enjoy. I like it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved every minute of the trilogy!!!!!  Can't wait for the next book by E L James. Would definitely recommend. Brilliant
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Beginning with the first episodes of Downton Abbey my favorite female companion has been hooked on this series.  Characters and the characterization of British Civility keep her watching.  I was very happy with her reaction to me after receiving this as a holiday gift.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to know how the story really ended.  Let me just say, it was a sweet sad story from beginning to the end. A story of courage and personal tragedy, dreams of love and loss.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The best book anybody could ever read!  Very helpful to everyone.  I would highly recommend it to anybody and everybody
B005544TRQ|2.0|ehhh, it's okay if you don't have anything else to watch.  The characters on it are pretty douchey though.....so......I'd recommend getting some exercise instead.
B0014EU5XI|3.0|I don't know, some of the remasters just don't sound right to me. Maybe because my whole life I've heard the sonic signature of ZZ Top and now they've changed it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Great story, well written and a good page turner. Worth the read but shame the ending was a bit off.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book. It is quirky in just the right way, and I definitely need to look into his other works. If you liked this book Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children might be for you too - it has the same feel and quirkyness.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There is no words to how hooked this book gets you. Its a must read for anyone who think our materialistic entretainment-driven society is heading in the wrong track. It gets you from page one with its intriguing character. A character to look up too. A story to discuss and oh yes keep reading till the end of the trilogy.
B00009RGBS|5.0|This was a used DVD was just as it said used and good condition. I love this movie and it was cheap so it satisfied my budget and added to my collection.

B00CT2P6VA|4.0|It is fantastic! I enjoy puzzles that allow reflection and don't always require speed. I love spacial mind benders and that multiple tries are okay.
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|Chloe Thurlow is a brilliant young writer. Her new book Girl Trade is an erotic thriller that unleashes many inhibitions. This is not a book where you will find yourself in the middle. You will either love or hate this book. I loved it. A young girl Emily who is living a boring, repetitive lifestyle goes on an innocent nude swim to a distant island. There she is taken prisoner and forced into a form of slavery. She is taken and travels across the coast of Africa, given a new name and identity. She meets a handsome sheik and falls madly in love. But is that love two way? Does he love her enough to save her from a life of misery and powerlessness? And in this great story is the human emotion. The strongest of them all sex. Chloe does not let up. She gives it to you in a very adult way. Her book had me taking a look at my own sexuality and myself. This is where the love it or hate it comes in. Emily’s life, secrets and desires say a lot about all of us. It puts us in a mood or it tests our emotions. I am an award winning independent filmmaker. As an independent filmmaker, her descriptions were so vivid; I could easily see this book being turned into a film. I could also see Chloe during the lead role. This young lady is very talented, as has a great career ahead of her in whatever direction she chooses. If you’re into erotica, get this book. If you’re into great adventures, get this book. If you’re into love, get this book. And if you are blessed enough to have a partner, lover, friend or spouse, get them to come over when you get this book! You’re going to need them. This book is HOT!
B000093FLA|1.0|Obvious piece of counterfeit trash. bootleg bootLEG BOOTleg BOOTLEG!!!<br /><br />Neither Windows Media Player nor CyberLink PowerDVD 11 could get this crap to play.Collection of VOB files are ridiculous...who wants to play little snatches (pun intended) of this movie?<br /><br />On my LG Home Theater it barely catches a snippet of the action now and then.<br /><br />It works just fine on my MacBook Pro.<br /><br />Who wants this kind of aggravation? My PC and my LG Home Theater worked just fine last night!
006202406X|1.0|I think this is the first review I have written because I'm not very good at it. I thought I would leaf the first two books to review the characters and actually re-read both entirely and again enjoyed both. Allegiant did not hold the attention until three quarters of the way through when it finally started to pick up, like the Roth didn'nt know how to end the series. To kill Trish after all she and Four had been thru was just to much. I hated the ending to this series and will think twice about any more of the Roths writings. I have read sad endings before but none as bad as this one!<br /><br />T.A.B.
B005L38QK2|4.0|It's perfect for slippery hands . 1 bad thing that the buttons on the sides sometimes are harder for me ( I am right handed )

B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I did not know what to expect from this movie.  It was a terrific movie and Denzel Washington was excellent as usual.  Just when you think he has his act together he falls apart.  In the end he does the right thing in so many ways...you wanted to pull for him and hoped he did the right thing.
B008QTVNUI|1.0|compelling storyline is destroyed by soft pornographic scenes in 2 of the first 3 episodes.  We turned it off as we do not want to see sexuality and femininity degraded.  Truly disappointing as the actors are superb and the main storyline is intriguing.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Excellent Christmas album!  I couldn't be happier!  The true meaning of Christmas is celebrated in the song selection helping you to take time to reflect on what is most important.  The quality of Susan's voice is superb as she guides you through a worshipful Christmas experience.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Well done flick with a alot of modern day special effects. Kind of like Vampire Hunters except they hunt for witches in this one.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 6 yo son loves it.  He figured it out by himself and doesn't get aggravated. Good purchase for my son.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What can I say? I have been reading king for over 30 years.  I have never read anything of his I didn't like. He is a natural story teller. One of the best. Thanks for a great read Mr. King!<br />Signed: your number one fan
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much!  I got caught up in the mystery right away. And I found the various characters to be believable and, at times, very amusing.  I enjoyed the witty self talk of some of the characters.  I read this book voraciously. And I'm so glad to have found a new author who I love!
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|I did not see this series while it was occuring because I could not get into it with all the other things going on.  It was quite the suspensful series overall and confusing.  It had me thinking about philosophy, religion and psychology.  It was an interesting ride.  We do create our heaven and hell.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|fix the recent update. it crashes the player. it idiots can't seem to leave it alone. fix this junk. NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
B003U53GK8|4.0|We create our purgatory, heaven and hell.  It has been an interesting ride throughout the series.  Love the way the characters were developed.  It is interesting how Jack took the leadership role and his father's role in fixing and mending people.  He finally gave himself time to be Jack, unfortunately he was dead.  Carpe Diem!
B006MHWXMS|1.0|will not sync or let me add my tootle account. no option to connect my account. worked fine before but now a complete wastrel of time and money. wish the computer/software engineers would leave stuff alone. I hats them with a passion now!!!!!!!!!!!!

B009XI7RF6|4.0|Very fun game. Gets quite challenging after a while. Some of the solutions are rather creative. If it doen't crash as often, i would have given a 5-star raiting.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|This is just amazing. This is the best thing I've heard from Wilson since 'In Absentia' and way better than that.
B00A2H9OZS|1.0|Don't buy this POS. Vin Diesel should be punched in the face for making this and kicked in the balls for allowing it to be released.  One of the most predictable and boring movies I've ever seen.  I want my 2 hrs back.  You have been warned.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Great characters and keeps you turning pages. Author keeps you guessing about what is really going on all the way to the final pages. Final resolution is satisfying. Well done!
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|For the second time we tried to rent an HD title to watch with our Playstation 3 from Amazon Instant video and it played terrible no matter what we tried, the picture was pix-elated and the play back kept pausing and there is NOWHERE on the site that you can go to complain or get your money back without calling and sitting through a 25 min phone call. That is the last time I rent a movie from my Prime Account to watch on TV. Terrible!

B00DVKOYBM|5.0|This is a great pool game I love the time count plus I love the effects of the game and how well it does on a kindle fire hd
B00AG297GK|5.0|Excellent movie full of humor! I don't see how anyone can give less than 4 stars!  Yes it is &#34;racist&#34; but if you don't get the whole point to the &#34;racism&#34; then you could never enjoy the movie for the satire it is. All funny movies that make fun of stuff like this are probably satires and anyone who takes them serious has NO sense of humor!
0525953728|5.0|For being a used book in &#34;good&#34; condition it is absolutely great. It seems as if it were new. The dust jacket is still in great condition. Definitely buying books from them again. 100% Satisfied.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Surprisingly great movie! My husband and I liked it as much as the first movie, which we did not expect.
B00G32OER4|1.0|It was very blurry I was very un happy my son thought it might be a low budget flick.  I had heard it was good too bad we didn't get a very clear picture

B000RZIGVS|5.0|I love this item im a syfy fan from way back and was very happy to get this in great condishen .
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Okay, I resisted as long as I could but now I am hooked.  I am a long standing &#34;match 3&#34; player dating back to before Nintendo DS times.  I was told this game is addictive and I see why.  It has basic &#34;match 3&#34; mentality but with a cute story line and some devilishly difficult obstacles and configurations.  I am actually glad that it has a limited number of lives (which you get more of with the passage of time)  if it was unlimited I probably would play for hours.  I would like the opportunity to get some of the extra helpers without paying for them but I am quite content not to spend any money on this game and play the same level 20 to 30 times.  If that is not your thing or you are impatient this game is going to cost you money.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the moving reminder of what brave young individuals give us working class people. The sacrifice, the uncertainty, the undying confidence these guys are prepared for thanks to our military machine is absolutely incredible. I really appreciate Marcus bringing us this account and furthering my understanding of the deep love Texans share. I feel certain I want to transplant there.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Most of the Pixar films are gems and the Toy Story sequels are no exception. Love the characters and the story.
B00902S0IS|5.0|I do enjoy old sci-fi movies. This is a keeper. The special effects do not match up to today's standards. But hey they had to start somewhere. The story line is a little different  and unbelievable. But it is fun.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The wife and I enjoy watching Elementary in our regular TV viewing schedule. We like the two main characters and while it is a nod to the original Sherlock Holmes stories, we've enjoyed the change ups and the story telling. We also appreciate the fact that the show doesn't rely on gratuitous sex, violence, or foul language.
B0011XBLUS|2.0|Really difficult for me to watch it all the way through. This was a really mediocre film. This movie was dragged out, taking too long to get to the point.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Most of the Pixar films are gems and Toy Story is the one that started it all. Love the characters and the story. A one of a kind movie that will be a classic for years to come.
1444737090|5.0|My uncle gave me this book as a birthday present this year, and while I didn't read it immediately, once I started, I could not stop until I'd finished.  Mr. Bowen, I know well what you mean about the healing powers of the animals that choose to spend their lives with us, as you describe in your book. I myself have had late-stage Lyme for the last five years (possibly more) and know I wouldn't be doing as (relatively) well as I am without my Cat Pack!  The food, shelter, love, and real money we spend on them is so little compared to what they give us in return.  Those of us who do have companion animals are truly blessed in that respect.  Keep up the good work; and hug Bob for me!
B00B52F278|5.0|Alongside [[ASIN:B0042RJWTC The Tudors: The Complete Series]], this is one of the most well done & ambitious series ever produced by  a premium movie channel.  Unlike Henry the VIII, however, there are far more missing details to the life of Spartacus.  We really don't have any idea of what went on within the Thracian's camp as we don't have any 1st hand accounts.  Everything we know, we only know from the Roman point-of-view.<br /><br />This is both good & bad.  While we don't know the names of the gladiators & other Roman slaves who fought with Spartacus, I can't help but think that this series is an excellent REPRESENTATION of the types of discussions that must have transpired inside of Spartacus' inner-circle.  The series brings these long-dead heroes to life, and that is precisely the point.<br /><br />Liberties are taken with the one Gauis Julius Caesar, but that is all well & good as he's one of the few historical figures in the series (aside from Spartacus himself) who is a household name.  Meanwhile, the depictions of Crassus & Pompey are historically accurate, at least in the broad historical sense.  Marcus Crassus DID resort to decimating his own men, and Crassus & Pompey did team-up to defeat the gladiator army.  {As a sidenote, the 3 men together would go on to form what would become known as the \\"First Triumverate\\" which was a sort of bridge between the Roman Republic & the age of the Caesars}<br /><br />The acting in the series is terrific, with two alumni from the movie \\"300\\" included.  Both genders are bound to be entranced as the series is filled to top with buffed up gladiators & gorgeous women.  Of the latter, Gwendoline Taylor debuts in this season as Sibyl.  I must say, I was absolutely mesmerized by this New Zealand beauty!!  I can't wait to see her in more projects.<br /><br />The SPARTACUS series invokes everything that the time period was famous (or infamous?) for:  gladiatorial games, Roman baths, orgies, torture / crucifixion and the Romans trying to impose their will on the rest of the world.  As such, the series does not pull any punches when it comes to violence, blood, gore & nudity (in fact, virtually every single actress in the series strips-down @ one time or other!).  People who want their history watered down into a \\"G Rated\\" version should look elsewhere.<br /><br />This is a spectacular series, one that belongs up there with other Roman epics such as [[ASIN:B001I808QY Ben Hur (1959)]], [[ASIN:B005DNO7MQ Gladiator]] and [[ASIN:B006JY3OHW I, Claudius (35th Anniversary Edition)]].  People who want to learn more about the Roman empire would be inclined to also pick up [[ASIN:B005INZX3I Rome Power & Glory: The Rise]].<br /><br />In the present age, the motto of the United States Army GREEN BERETS is \\"To free the oppressed.\\"  Spartacus would have smiled upon such a motto.  That we still have brave soldiers today who wish to eradicate slavery and human hardship is a testament to the human will to resist tyranny.  It is also a testament to Spartacus himself:  a man who went on to become much more legendary than the 2 Legates who ultimately defeated him.  In that sense, every time we humans are able to successfully right a wrong, SPARTACUS LIVES!!ns trying to impose their will on the rest of the world.

B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Great movie!  I really enjoyed comparing it to the novel.  Deicaprio does a great job of portraying Gatsby! Costumes and design brought the film to life.
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|This book simply put, has provided me with focus and clarity. In turn I share with my team, there are some great tools that I can share. I recommend this for my team.
B000TO0TCQ|2.0|My son did not like what he did with the main character!  He wrote a bad review and I am revising for him.
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|Nate is back for round 3 and it doesn't disappoint. This is a page turner that outdoes the first two books by Brandt Legg, Outin and Outview, and it continues the spiritual learning begun in those books in a highly entertaining way. Recommended for those on a spiritual path and those who like their sci-fi. 5 stars.
1449305172|4.0|At the start of a recent web app project, I picked up a copy of Running Lean and found ways to incorporate some of the material into the dev process. I was already familiar with big picture lean startup principles, but found a lot more clarity and practical application points from Running Lean that I could immediately implement into the app. Understanding the jobs-to-be done framework (p. 27), understanding design as a collection of user flows, not just features (p. 59), receiving the best initial learning from open ended questions (p. 72), measuring/validating what customers do rather than what they say they want (pp. 73-74), and recognizing that an excessive amount of features can dilute the UVP (p. 145) all helped me to deliver a better product.
B009178OQA|5.0|Enlightening and motivating is the story of Jiro.  I've never encountered a story quite like his.  This documentary goes far beyond the sushi.  His views on life in general are fascinating.  This is an enthralling, one-of-a-kind documentary that everyone is bound to enjoy.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book &#34;No Easy Day&#34; by: Mark Owen in my opinion was a very vivid and really intense first person view of the life of a Navy SEAL. I felt more and more engaged into the story as I flipped each page. You get to witness first hand several missions that this man was placed I and the imagery was so clear and great that I felt I was right next to him witnessing the whole thing. I also get to feel the bond between each of the member as you get to see how they interact with each other. The wit and humor used between them literally made me laugh out loud. I did feel however, that some parts of the book were unnecessary and quite boring. But other than that, It is a great book to read! I would recommend it to any friend or family member.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The thing about this book that makes me give it two stars isn't the ending that everyone is upset with. While I don't think the death at the end was well written or necessary, my issues are with the book overall. It truly did not feel to me that the same author penned this book that did Divergent and Insurgent. The first two books are AMAZING. The characters, the story, the world, come alive in the first two. This book felt simplistic. It felt rushed. The characters seemed to have a personality overhaul. I couldn't put the first two books down. I took over a week with this book. It wasn't exciting, character driven, or fulfilling. I really wanted it to be.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much! Its a great pastime and very enjoyable...its so much like the movies! Its fantabulous!!!!!
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Interesting perspective, although like everything else in life things are not always black or white, but rather grey. Nonetheless a good read.

B003UYUP58|5.0|Sad, yet informative look at how cancer has been viewed my the medical community over time and how re-defining it has impacted treatments and diagnoses.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|It is a really good game. I was so excited to get it on the Kindle.  Would love if they would make toys of it!  (From an 8 year-old boy)
B0013TPV0Q|2.0|I don't like reading that something tastes like a penis. Sorry, but, that's crossing the line of filth. I'm not saying he shouldn't be proud to display his gay lifestyle, but, he does it tastefully as anyone in a married relationship with a man or woman does.<br />As always, according to Steve Martin, comedy isn't always pretty.
B003G4W4CY|4.0|If you want an exciting, hopefully improbable and as usual well-told sic fi Clarke supplies it in this somewhat finally depressing tale of the end of the human race as we know it.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Real perspective of racism. Love the story because it shows the injustice that black people had to deal with and how small steps could changed a bit that reality.
1603429999|5.0|Wonderful, precise directions! The author explains exactly what you're doing, and is careful to tell you how to avoid the gottcha mistakes - for example, armholes set three stitches off. Great illustrations. Even if you're not knitting circularly, the book is extremely helpful.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have a more expensive apple TV, and I found it very limited if you do not use any pay services like Netflix and Hull plus. The Chrome cast works with all my devices (not just apple). I am disappointed that it can not cast chrome browser content from my galaxy phone or iPad yet, but it does work with individual supported apps like youtube. My apple TV only works with my ipad.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Incredible album. I am completely in love with the crazy lyrics and music. It feels like you're in a sexy circus, but in a good way.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I am blown away by how good this whole album is. I heard the singles NMHTP and Sympathy and thought they would be the 2 really good songs on the album and the rest would be ok. I was wrong, this album kicks some arse from start to finish. If you liked To Hell With The Devil and Soldiers Under Command you are gonna LOVE No More Hell To Pay.
B002PHVHFI|5.0|This is easily one of my top 10 favorite albums of all time. Beautifully written with fascinating lyrics, you will want to spin it over and over again.
B00992CF6W|1.0|it sucks and its 7$ for you to walk around place some square blocks and the graphic are so very bad
B000001E7T|5.0|Another slam dunk by PJ Harvey. If you like &#34;Rid of Me,&#34; you will also love &#34;To Bring You My Love.&#34; Give it a listen.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I don't always like buy entire CD's, and sometimes when I purchase individual songs from MP3 sites they can sound grainy, and dull, but the quality is great!!
B000YXMMAO|5.0|Classic, must own album by Radiohead. If you're a fan of the band, you must listen to this one. Buy it!
B00EO10M54|5.0|This is a fantastic album. Don't let the parental warning fool you. There are tons of inspiring songs to be found on this. Miley has finally broke away from Disney.
B000002H8F|5.0|Clearly a good album. If you love the Pixies, you probably already own and have listened to this several times. A great classic!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game. I can't stop playing it. Just wish I can make my energy go faster without spending. Will keep playing until I'm bored
B000003TSP|5.0|Classic Portishead album. So sexy and weird and perfect, like everything Portishead does. You must own this, and spin it when trying to get your partner in the mood for some fun.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was a big disappointment. I could not believe the way she chose to end this wonderful series. I will be very hesitant to read any other books by this author.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|If you haven't seen Mad Men, what have you been doing? Definitely start with the first season and go from there.
B00FOQRNPA|4.0|You'll find a lot of surprising elements in this book, and learn more about some things you already know. The only slight minus is the slightly sensationalistic writing style, but that is up to each person's preference. Read it!
B000002BE9|5.0|This is Fiona Apple's most famous album, and for good reason. It is beautiful and weird just like she is. Listen to this.
B0090SI582|3.0|Here is an honest review about this movie for those who are not concerned with whether or not it sticks with the movies or the comics. Overall it is a decent action movie, period. I know that with Marvel movies many of us are loving how connected the movies have become and how they lead into the others. This one does that as well, even though it is not part of Disney's property. Hugh Jackman owns this role as he has done so since the beginning and will do so again in the next Xmen movie (Days of Future Past) as well as having just signed on for another one two days ago. I am not a huge Xmen or Wolverine fan. Don't get me wrong, I like them okay, but I am not one to stand in line opening night. I was always more of a Batman fan with Thor as my all-time favorite comic book character. I can say though that I will be picking up the Extended Edition the week it comes out. I think once the next Xmen movies comes out and then the following Wolverine movie, it will make for one hell of a marathon run. I am even hoping that the next Xmen movie somehow makes X3 watchable if only to see how some of the dumb story choices play into the overall scheme.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Start with &#34;Live Through This,&#34; then continue to &#34;Celebrity Skin.&#34; If you haven't heard Hole before, you're really missing out!
B002HFJ77S|2.0|I'm truly struggling to finish this book. I enjoyed Remember Me, Can you keep a secret and I've got your number. But Twenties Girl is almost brutal to read. It's boring. It's way too long and drawn out. Sadie and Lara are both annoying. And I haven't laughed not once. It's almost like a chore to finish this book. I still have 150 pages to go and have absolutely no desire to finish it. Normally I read 400 page books in a day. I've forced myself for 3 days to keep going thinking it's going to get better. It doesn't. I feel as though I have wasted my time and my money. Extremely disappointed.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead continued to get better with age, and Hail to the Thief is no different. The quiet tracks and beautiful, and the heavier tracks are catchy and fun to listen to
B00FGJNS72|3.0|There are free version apps like this that are just as good but lack one thing, the ablitity to make bullet list. The one reason I got this app was for bullet lists. Well it can make a list but pressing tab doesn't indent the list. U have to go into settings and hit indent every time in the settings which is a pain if taking notes.<br />So one thing this company needs to do IS allow tab to indent the bullet list like in word for the computer.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Truly amazing.  An incredible story very well told by Adam Makos.  Highly recommend.  Read it in just a few days
B00DJZR46G|4.0|Reading a number of other folks' reviews, I can't say I'm the biggest Elton fan out there but I'd still rank myself right up there. Maybe it was the hype the album got before its release, and the tantalizing delay as some songs were switched out and the release held up for promotional opportunities, but I found &#34;The Diving Board&#34; a bit of a let-down. Taking nothing away from Elton's true musical genius but the album lacks that killer melody, like a &#34;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me&#34;, &#34;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&#34; or &#34;Candle in the Wind&#34;. And I've always thought that Elton's country or gospel-inspired songs are just a little lazy--pleasant enough, but not inspired or memorable, and that's the case here. Bernie Taupin has a way with words but sometimes there are just too darn many of them. Less is more, so often, and he proves that with the wonderful lyrics for &#34;The Ballad of Blind Tom&#34;. Partly, it's the economy of words that works so well--quick-sketching a vivid image of Tom's audience with, &#34;Faint hearts with their fans out, Starched collars and cigars&#34;, then juxtaposing this picture of genteel civility with the following lyrics, expressing the audience's racism and contempt, &#34;He weren't no use for slavin', I wouldn't want him in my yard&#34;. You can't argue with success, and certainly Taupin's achieved it over decades with his lyrics, but in the future I, for one, would love to see him keep a machete at hand to thin out the jungle of words and go more for the kind of elegant simplicity of a &#34;Ballad of Blind Tom&#34;. One more thought, musically--yes, as Bernie put it, its an album that befits their years, and no one expects or maybe wants, say, another &#34;Crocodile Rock&#34; but just because you're in your 60's doesn't mean everything has to be gentle, somber, or somehow related to death. It'd be great if the next Elton and Bernie collaboration can show a little more emotional range.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Another great read by a great author.  A classis King novel, takes awhile to develop but he brings all the parties slowly together.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Excellent characterization and plot developement. Outstanding variety of narratives. I would reccomend these stories to anyone who is interested in a more literary approach to writing ,rather than most popular treatments.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Our generation's &#34;1984&#34;.  I closed my Facebook account after reading this, should probably quit posting reviews on Amazon. Good bye.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book in anticipation of seeing the movie.  While I thoroughly enjoyed it (including the surprise twist), I did not like the implication of the ending...In any case, I would recommend this book because it really was a fascinating read!
B00CXQL828|5.0|As a drummer who is very familiar with Dream Theater material and can sometimes \\"tire\\" of all the chops n time signatures associated with that style, there's nothing as audibly gratifying as some tasty straight ahead ROCK. Winery Dogs is just that with enough \\"pepper\\" thrown in to spice up nicely some really great original material. I got this CD 10 days ago and have been listening daily,,,can't get these tunes outta my head! We Are One is my current fav. ZERO regrets grabbing this one.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a great book from start to finish, grabs you in at the beginning, and is hard to put down.  Many twists and turns, gut wrenching at times.  Loved the authors style of writing, was humourous and being a brit I loved the English humour.  It was an insightful book and had me mulling over the outcome, have to admit I shed a few tears to, any book that can move me gets 5 stars.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|sniff* sniff* For some reason whenever I try to read this book, I can't get through it without developing some sort of allergic reaction that activates my tear ducts. Never mind the fact that I have never attempted to read it to my 2 year old son due to these allergic reactions.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent period piece with wonderful actors and atmospheric setting. This is the British version of the Chinese classic, \\"A Dream of the Red Mansion\\".  Definitely see it starting from Season 1 to get the continuing story.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Totally satisfactory. Easy to use and full featured program. A must app for everyone. Adobe has a great reputation and this  last a program that lives up to their excellent reputation.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So real.  So honest. A difficult topic handled beautifully by 2 characters you will come to love. A MUST READ BOOK<br /> .
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a genius! I downloaded this to re-read it in anticipation of the movie release in a couple of weeks. I am as enthused and enamored with the story as I was the first time I read it. Can't wait for 11/22!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was really looking forward to the third installment of this book. Counting down the days and staying up late to read it every night.<br /><br />Unfortunately I was disappointed. The story is from the two main characters perspective (Tris & Four &#34;aka Tobias&#34;). I could never tell the two characters apart if it was their section in the book. It all read from the same character. I often got lost and confused about who was speaking and had to reread sections to see who was the &#34;me&#34; character.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away any spoilers - but the ending left me asking why and wanting more. The first two books were amazing, and the charisma was lost in this one.

B00ERIUO02|5.0|I was listening to this album while working with heavy woodworking machinery when a man came up to me and noticed my excellent taste in music. He then began to tout nonsense about how Busta Rhymes is more lyrically gifted than Nas so I punched him in the throat. The whole incident was caught on camera so I was sent to jail with a $600 bail, which my grandmommy paid. The man pressed charges because his injury stole his songbird voice which helped him in his endeavors of starting his own post-addiction men's choir. We both got lawyers, I bought off the judge for our trial with $310 which I got from selling one of my longboxes of late 60's comic books, and I counter-sued him for $6,000. I won and was given an annuity for the money. I contacted JG Wentworth because it was my money and I needed it then. But they began to snoop around in the trial and learned that I had bribed the judge so I was sent to Guantanamo Bay. I was anally raped by several religious extremists before concocting a scheme of escape which involved me tunneling a way out of my cell with toenail clippers and a dishcloth. It worked and I made my way to the ghosttown of Stone City, Nevada where I am the active mayor under a new alias &#34;Jinkem McCringleberry.&#34;

B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|Still recognizably the Strokes, all the frenetic beats are still there, but sometimes they're masked in sonics of various kinds, synths that sound like strings, etc. Starts out pumping away as usual, but slows down for the first time with the soft rolling arpeggios of the title track, an approach that continues with Slow Animals, Chances & Call it Fate, which is about as bizarre & spacey a track as the Strokes have ever produced. Makes you wonder if they are indeed headed in another direction now, become \\"mature\\" as some reviewers have said, lost their \\"reckless charm\\". Personally I'm very thankful for all the pure fun on the first 4 albums. This one takes a little getting used to, but I'm sure that time will prove its worth, same as the others.

0062107313|3.0|Amy Tan's derivative new novel covers the familiar themes she has recycled from her previous novels about mother-daughter relationships. Spanning 50 years in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the saga takes place largely in the courtesan houses of Shanghai, when vast changes were occurring during the early establishment of the Republic of China.<br /><br />Told in the first person by a daughter from each generation, (but mostly from one named Violet), the reader is taken on an epic journey of love, illusion, betrayal, abandonment, and redemption. Tan doesn't break any new ground here. Arthur Golden's 1997 MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, about Japan's geisha houses, was written more lyrically and subtly, and used a very similar framing device. Tan didn't create any original characters, nor did she introduce a fresh premise. However, her pacing is astute and her flourishes are vivid.<br /><br />Tan's beach read would more accurately be listed under historical romance, and its inelegant prose and broad characters failed to hit any visceral and emotional registers with me. Violet, precocious half Chinese/half American daughter of Lulu, a beautiful American woman who runs a prestigious courtesan house in Shanghai, is separated from her mother by trickery. As Lulu sails sadly away to America, Violet is forced to begin her life as a courtesan at the age of fourteen, but in a second-class establishment. Her only ally is her attendant, Magic Gourd, who serves as a mother figure and protector.<br /><br />Violet learns all the details of the life of a courtesan, such as storytelling, zither mastering, sartorial nuance, conversational alacrity, and, most importantly, the art of seduction. These women are referred to as \\"flowers,\\" and at fifteen are bought by the highest bidder in a \\"defloration\\" ceremony to lose their virginity. By their late 20's their bloom is fading, and they are too old to compete against their younger counterparts.<br /><br />The courtesans are warned against the illusion of love and the fantasy of marriage; at the most, they can hope to run their own courtesan house someday. Of course, the passionate Violet periodically succumbs to her desires, and suffers disappointment at every twist and turn, as well as episodes of bliss. It is terribly contrived but also colorful, and despite predictability, I found myself turning the pages to see what would happen next. Tan creates so many obstacles for her characters that I actually got involved in the storyteller's weave. Unfortunately, she left no room for authenticity, and the great passions felt expository, while the erotic scenes were awkward and lackluster. It sounded a lot like \\"And then she...\\" \\"And then she...\\" \\"And then she.\\" Scenes that were supposed to be horrifying fell flat in the telling, subverting Tan's intentions to grip the reader.<br /><br />The title of the book refers to a painting that appears throughout the narrative, symbolizing clarity and illusion, beauty and eternity.<br /><br />\\"It captures many moments, many emotions...hope, love, and purity. I see in it immortality, neither beginning nor end.

Of course, the passionate Violet periodically succumbs to her desires, and suffers disappointment at every twist and turn, as well as episodes of bliss. It is terribly contrived but also colorful, and despite predictability, I found myself turning the pages to see what would happen next. Tan creates so many obstacles for her characters that I actually got involved in the storyteller's weave. Unfortunately, she left no room for authenticity, and the great passions felt expository, while the erotic scenes were awkward and lackluster. It sounded a lot like \\"And then she...\\" \\"And then she...\\" \\"And then she.\\" Scenes that were supposed to be horrifying fell flat in the telling, subverting Tan's intentions to grip the reader.<br /><br />The title of the book refers to a painting that appears throughout the narrative, symbolizing clarity and illusion, beauty and eternity.<br /><br />\\"It captures many moments, many emotions...hope, love, and purity.

0385351399|5.0|After reading, this made me really think about what role social media has in my life. Though I doubt the entire world would be duped in the way The Circle depicts, it is easy to imagine some aspects of this story coming true in the relatively near future. Also an interesting critique of the large internet companies, and seemingly accurate depiction of life on their campuses, from what my friends who work at them say.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|awesome puzzles. wish there were some creepy dragons or ghosts. the music had me on the edge of my seat waiting for something to jump out at me
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This release is an INCREDIBLE piece of work!!!! Stryper really came through with this album! I am A long time Stryper Fan since 1985 or so, and the new album, (dare I say), is right at the top! There is no filler material and each song is as strong as the next. I wish I could give A review of 10 stars, because it really deserves it! If You're even slightly considering purchasing the album, do not hesitate! You will not be sorry! Stryper is leaps and bounds musically over most of the 1980's Hard Rock/ Metal Acts! One listen of this album and You'll hear it and understand as well. I can't think of ANY act currently that is putting out such quality material as this. Not only is the musicianship and songs brilliant, but Stryper continues to uplift and encourage. A positive message put to AMAZING tracks! Stryper also continues to give praise to The Lord! You can't get any better than this!!!! Stryper, You hit A grand slam!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I've read all Grisham's books and this comes in at the &#34;ok&#34; level.  We'll never capture the essence of what made Grisham great in The Firm and A Time to Kill because he keeps writing along a handful of themes.  99% of lawyers are garbage.  The bad guys will always uncover dirt and find a way to spring it during a trial.  Mississippi is littered with towns that have railroad tracks separating white & black people.  You get the point.<br /><br />This book is ok, definitely worth the time and money.  The ending wasn't unrealistic, though a bit predictable.  The &#34;shock&#34; part of the ending I didn't see coming, but didn't really surprise me since it is along Grisham's common themes.  Giving him a 3 is tough because it is against his best works one must compare him.  The first half is pretty slow then the &#34;action&#34; picks up.  Once I hit about 60% I couldn't put the kindle down.  But like I said, it was largely predictable from that point.  Still better than a lot of authors who devise something completely unrealistic so you can't guess the ending.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It is an excellent sequel to the Shining. I loved the characters and the story. Although I feel King sometimes takes too long to tell his story, this one is just right. A great read..
B001MTENOC|5.0|A truly awe inspiring glimpse into life once we leave our bodies behind. From previews of our next incarnations to the process of what happens once we die. Pleasantly chilling.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is fantastic, super easy to set up. My grand kids love it. It keeps them entertained for hours playing funny video clips on utube. Really hope in the future it will be able to play family videos.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mark my words... this is going to be a block buster movie one day. I loved every word.  This has been one of the best books I have read in a long time. Exciting and incredibly entertaining. One of those that deprive you of sleep because you just can't stop reading it!  This book joins the few that I wish would never end. A thousand pages would never be enough!!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|If you've never heard of Stryper, or have avoided the thought of &#34;cheesy glam rock Christian bumblebees&#34; like the plague, you just need to open your mind and check this album out. It's not just a good '80s metal revival album, or just a good Christian rock album - it's just fantastic music, period.<br /><br />If you're already a fan, you should know that this is the Stryper album that I think we've all been waiting for since their 80s material. Reborn was terribly &#34;meh,&#34; Murder by Pride was better, but was more of a Michael Sweet solo album than a band collaboration. The Covering and Second Coming were fun, but lacked originality by default. Now, this... THIS is more like it! NO sappy power ballads, and not a weak moment in a single song. Fantastic playing, great non-stupid lyrics, genuine band cohesiveness with all the original guys, and very good modern production make for an enjoyable thrill ride of an album. Lots of hooks are present, and the title track's chorus sticks in your head like an earworm. And hey, even the album cover and packaging aren't lousy like the previous half-dozen or so.<br /><br />Just buy the darn album already!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|There were two serious anachronistic mistakes in this otherwise beautifully researched, and lovingly told tale.<br />A steady and important reminder about the value in close observation -- a guarded heart -- a wary but sweet soul.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|The best rock album in years. Stryper has out done themselves with this album. Buy it and you won't be able to quit listening.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book. Great twists and turns. Couldn't put this book down. This book haunted me when I had to put it down. Wow
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|This was very good for my grandchildren, but I would never go to see it.  My grandchildren were addicted to the movie
B007EC27QM|4.0|This is a very nice basic calculator with large easy to use keys and a large clear screen. To make this a perfect calculator for me, I would like it to have a key click feature that could be turned on and off and the ability to use parentheses. Add those features and this would be a five star app.

B009LDD1X0|5.0|Love this!!!  Can watch this over and over and I have!! Guaranteed laughs! Bonus features are great and give you a look behind the scenes!  These people are truly talented and funny!
147676459X|5.0|Allie Brosh has an amazing and funny way to tell stories and share her emotions.  This book's stories vary from hysterical childhood stories to heartfelt struggles of life and dealing with emotions.  The author's silly illustrations add immensely to the imagery of her stories.  Basically, buy this book if you want to laugh, if you are struggling with being an adult, or if you are fighting depression or other emotional issues... or just buy this book because it is awesome.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Amazing performances and heart touching storyline. It was an amazing way to spend a weekend evening.<br />Wanted to watch this movie since I had since its first trailer. Finally got to watch it on Amazon videos
B00D1X0576|5.0|My Kindle Fire HD gobbled up this app and ran it like a champ.  It is not fancy, but it worked for me on my device.  Also, I hold a strong impression that the Kindle Fire does not digest programs like this as well as the HD is designed to do.  That may be the shortfall difference between devices; this app is seemingly designed for the KFHD.  On the downside, it pointed out the WiFi limits of my device -- compared to a laptop on a wireless network that is pumping out 44 MBps to my laptop, the KFHD is getting 10 MBps down, and 8 MBps up.  Very good (fast for a Kindle) but not screaming fast.  Still, I am happy with the app so far...

0786838655|5.0|this book was a great compliment after seeing the movie the book was even better though a great book to pass on and share
080419257X|5.0|One of the most insightful, thought provoking books I have had the pleasure to read (listen to) in years.  It explains history and Christian belief and resolves many of the ideas and feelings I have had for years.  An absolute pleasure from start to finish.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|This was fun watching but not as gripping as Top of the Lake or The Killing. Worth the watch but it felt a bit copycat of The Killing. I have no idea which came first - perhaps The Killing (based on a Danish TV series) came after Broadchurch.
0385537131|5.0|Wow! Grisham is back with another excellently written stunner.  A smart, fast moving story about the legality of a Holographic Will.  The sudden suicide of a family's Patriarch and his twenty-four hour old, handwritten Will, have his family up in arms when it is revealed that he has left millions to his black maid.  Jake Brigance and the, &#34;Time to Kill&#34;, original gang return with another southern, court room, roller coaster.<br /><br />Jake Brigance is a handsome, lawyer who has a reputation for his ability to woo a jury.  His mentor Lucien, a disbarred, alcoholic attorney and Harry Rex, a devious divorce attorney, all return for a second act in the ongoing saga of race equality during the early 80's in Mississippi.  Lawyers and family members start popping out of the woodwork when the dollar amount of Will is revealed and then it is off to the races.<br /><br />An original storyline that had the characters just jumping off the page.  This is a must read for those of you that enjoy legal thrillers. A first rate narrative by Michael Beck mixed with an intensely emotional, surprise ending made this one of my favorites of the year.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Not my favorite Harry Hole. Takes place in Australia. Nesbo has really grown as a writer since this early work. Certainly worth the read.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I got an upgrade that had to be shipped it came and I pressed equip it and it did nothing and the equip it sign is still there even after I pushed it and it wont let me press any other button so I cant play game anymore. Any suggestions?

B00EJX2YGM|1.0|I love the Twilight Saga and have seen each movie.  However the negative review is due to the false representation of this item on the Amazon page.  The product name &#34;Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga Box Set [DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet]&#34; would have you believe that there is a Digital Copy (one that would work with iTunes) AND an UltraViolet copy.  Unfortunately this only has the UltraViolet copy.  So please be very aware if you are considering to purchase this with hopes of using it on iTunes because it will not work.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Easy set up!!  Works great on my IPod, IPad,  and my IPhone.  Buying the speakers and another camera to go with it!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|liked the twists and turns in the plot--similar to how I felt after watching &#34;The Lathe of Heaven&#34;--you knew something was wrong, but had no real hint of how truly bad it was.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Game is great with amazing graphics. Got this app for my son and I play I  more than he does.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love this series . Cannot seem to get enough of it.The Florricks are the.bomb! The story line is so current.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I tried to like this movie...heard so many people rave about it. No can do.<br />HORRIBLE and bland acting...was there a director.?<br />I guess stupid and boring are the best descriptives.<br />I like sci-fi and space movies.....but not this one.<br />Never have I used the fast-forward so many times in my life.<br />Watched at night...in the morning...straight as an arrow...high as a kite...useless.<br />Is there an option for Zero Stars.?
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|I love this new album from Arcade Fire. I am so encouraged to hear a band come back with a fresh sound.
B009NXD6JM|5.0|Funny, sweet, and who can resist Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard??  Classic!  My 16 year old is now a fan as well!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters and how they developed. The book has enough romance to almost make you forget that it is a mystery. You feel the speed gather as you read and then there is a good plot twist towards the end. This book is not what I consider a barn burner but it is a really enjoyable book that you will recommend to your friends.
0446556726|5.0|I haven't read much of Connelly lately, but when I do it it definitely a treat and a page turner. Again in this story he has captured the reader from the first few pages until the exciting end. Another fitting challenge for the Harry Bosch character which Connelly weaves the story around as usual. It's a great mystery and the reader will quickly fall into reading right through to the end. If you enjoy a great mystery now and then this is one you need to pick up and read.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Very useful especially when you are at home whit your friends BUT only work whit youtube and Netflix because Google store don't have any app for this

B00B4804KS|3.0|There were a lot of scenes left out of this movie from the original version. I only bought it because I have a  3D TV  and thought it might be a good show to watch. Sadly even the 3D wasn't that good either. I give them a 3 stars for trying!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|The best all I got to say! Noy chuw than balynu conyars!

B008XBCJ34|5.0|I've watched this movie over and over again . Each time I watch it I find something else that I didn't really see before. It's like reading a good book. Usually you need to read it more than once to get get a new understanding of it. Outstanding 3D graphics!!!! recommend
B00E8S2JZ4|4.0|First, I would like to know when the extended version hit the shelves? Second, this is a gift for my brother who already has the Hobbit with behind the scenes footage. I'm curious to know if the extended version is different than that version and also if buying the extended version is worth the extra footage. Please help me. It will be very much appreciated.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Love this album! It's such a joy to listen to. I can't stop listening to it! It's so great! Yay!
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Worth watching but the story strayed away from previous movies with subplots. It was almost as if Ironman was not the center of the story.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|If you love real music and not all the digitally enhanced stuff you hear on the radio today then this documentary is for you.  The story of Sound City Studio and the Neve sound board are fascinating.  The story as told by Dave Grohl is the right mix of history, comedy and eventually sadness.  This story is told for music lovers by music lovers and I would and have recommended it to everyone I know!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I have read the other Halo books by Eric Nylund.<br />This book is almost as good as the others by him, but it still deserves five stars!
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|I purchased season 1 and within the next six days I had watched all six series. I highly recommend wrapping yourself around this series.
B00EVW013E|3.0|Great action movie! The actors did an ok job, and I like all of the actors in different roles! It was too unrealistic so I couldn't enjoy it! With that being said, the action was fast and furious, from beginning to end.

B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I loved Susan Tedeschi all by herself, but the combination of Tedeschi and Trucks is awesome.  There is not one song on this CD that I don't like.  Susan rocks!  I saw her in concert at the Fraze in Dayton years ago and would love to see Tedeschi Trucks Band too.  Soulful, bluesy, and just plain the best!!!!

B00E9P959O|5.0|This review is for the Vapor Trails Remix CD.<br /><br />Back when Vapor Trails was first released, I remember listening to it the first time, and thinking I had the volume up to high. It sounded all fuzzy like it was getting distorted. I thought my CD player was going bad. Then I tried it in my Car's cd player and same thing. I kept fiddling with the radio controls trying to get it to sound better but I couldn't. I slowly came to the realization that it must be the CD itself that was bad. I remember when I got my first ipod, I ripped the Vapor Trails CD hoping it would sound better on the ipod., Nope. Then I got hold of a sound editor, Audacity, and tried changing the gain on the tracks. Nope. Then I tried cutting the volume on the tracks. Nope. I tried everything and finally gave up. The CD sounded bad and there was nothing I could do about it.<br /><br />OMG, when I got this remix CD it blew me away! I was practically crying because of how good it sounded! I cranked up the volume and it sounded great!<br /><br />If my experience was anything like yours, get this CD now.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Brilliant series and writing!  Mat Smith had ginormous shoes to fill and he has gone on to make them even bigger for his successor!  I just LOVE this show and this season in particular. The story of Amy Pond is smart and witty and everything one would expect of a companion to the Doctor!
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Oh my, this is a bad film and it pains me to think there are two more to come. Jackson gives us Lord of The Rings Part Two, stretching out a relatively short book into a boring monster of a movie. He doesn't seem to have the confidence to shift away from the overblown scenes of LOTR and so we see the same over-extended mountain scenes once again, the same long treks across New Zealand, not to mention unwise additions and plot changes. What a missed opportunity this is.
B0037UUZQY|5.0|I gave this cute doll as a gift to my niece who is 3 years old, and she loves it!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Season 2 is just as much fun!  Can't wait for season 3 to be on so I can stay in love with this show!
B00CS65QGW|5.0|The best song of 2013 in my opinion. I never tire of listening to it and it is excellent to run/jog to.
B005544V6A|5.0|Love this show!  I never know what's going to happen next.  Funny and serious at the same time - very entertaining!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Challenging and fun. This game is extremely addicting. I would recommend this game to most of my friends. There's my review.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Fabulous!  We watched it twice, back to back, just to catch anything we might have missed the first time.  Whole family really loved it!
1468179993|3.0|I read this book with great expectations but was sadly, let down a little. Don't get me wrong there's certainly lots of good info in this book that can help with your presentations. I especially liked Chapter 8 on 'How to tell stories'. At the end of the day, I felt this was too 'thin' and it could be better by giving the reader an 'action check list' of 'to dos' to practice and test out what the author gleaned from Ted speakers. I finished this book in 30 minutes.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This was a much better zombie movie.  Much less blood and gore. An intelligent film with great character developement. Oh sure, you have to suspend some reality, but very dramatic and suspensful. Similar to War of the Worlds.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Was not disappointed at all, was full of action and romance and a bit of sadness.  I loved the whole series!
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|The additional footage in the Extended Edition seamlessly enriches the story.  And the statue is worth every penny.  High quality craftsmanship and it sure is hefty.  The packaging is also beautiful with paintings of Middle Earth on the outside and the Eagles in flight on the top. I own several Weta collectibles and this statue is the same high quality of craftsmanship.  I'm definitely hanging on to the box for this collectible!  Thank you Weta for doing such a magnificent job!
B000FC1192|1.0|the most common word used to describe this book is creepy. not a child`s book unless you don't mind some trouble sleeping in the dark.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Although the book starts of a bit slow, it really draws you in if you keep reading. I haven't read a book this well in a long time and looking forward to the rest of the series.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|Each chapter switches perspectives between the love interests, Payton and Kendell, and it's done well. They are lifelong friends, so they are aimilar, but they do have different voices & motivations, so that it easy to tell th apart.<br /><br />I like the idea that in a modern lesbian romance the only real obstacle to happiness is internal--it makes their story universal. Do we want to stay safe, to avoid potential judgment from others, or do we want to be happy?
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|VOLBEAT IS AWESOME. IF YOU HAVENT LISTENED TO THEM YET YOU SHOULD. THEY HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT STYLE AND SOUND. SAW THEM IN CONCERT AND THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD LIVE AS ON DISC.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I purchased this headset because Logitech to me represents quality. The headphones are exactly that. They are a little tight on my head; however, I image that will adjust after a few hours of playing. It's really nice to be able to get up from my computer and still be able to hear my game and speak to others. Also, the battery life seems to not interfere with my gaming. Only once did I forget to charge it, and I was able to charge it while using it. My only complaint is that it's too good at the noise cancelling. I have a hard time hearing myself speak, which results in me yelling into the mic while gaming. All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|this is an excellent new cd by 1 of the godfathers back when gangsta was cool. why all the low rates artists evolve and change at least its not all the way pop like most of the modern crap today.get this play it loud. stand for something real not off a computer.

B00FY9JJYA|4.0|Since I've purchased this album I haven't stopped playing it!! Pretty dope album. Love the songs with Jill Scott, Jasmine Sullivan and Bilal!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Fun game to play, reminds me of the old Mario and Luigi games.  So similar, but it's hard to play especially since it has touch screen buttons to allow action of the figure.  I can execute movements pressing button along holding the tablet.  Good game thou
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is a very nice way to pass the time while passing time. Such as waiting line at the grocery store or while sitting on the toilet.
B0063GORYU|5.0|truly amazing game, I love it more than solitaire.  I guess that it's more trivia and you have to strategize you next moves.  fun to play and you will want to play till you win guarantee.
B008EKMB82|1.0|Very lumpy writing. Overcooked and not at all seamless as fiction should be. A drag to plow through for my book group. A mistake to have selected it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok game to play, liked it, but became to easily board with it because games look so old and you grow tired of old looking games especially when they are slow.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I found it very hard to put the game down until I was forced to do so for 24 hours before unlocking the next quest; as if the wait time to get a full set of lives wasn't enough!! Like the previous poster, I simply REFUSE to pay to unlock the quests so I guess I'll just be on the Candy Crush time clock because I really do enjoy the game!! So you guys get minus 1 star for that ;-)
B00F875N98|5.0|Another awesome album by the Kings! Supersoaker is decent, but there are much better songs on the album. Can't wait to see them live in Boston.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book great characters and authentic stories. They say life is stranger then fiction and these characters and their stories emulate that statement. I couldn't put it down.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book is EXCELLENT! A must read for everyone who wants to achieve their goals and find their calling. Not just for artists.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I actually got the leak of this album like 9 days ago, and i still bought it. Because it was that good. I thought it might disappoint and not live up to the hype boy was i wrong, id recommend this to all eminem fans!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Helps you focus while enjoying a nice pastime. Its sort of frustrating to depend on Facebook friends to advance if you're not willing to spend money.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|This app was asking for too much access to my phone. Just didn't feel comfortable installing it. Looked at other AV apps to compare the snooping, most other didn't require so many permissions. Choose wisely don't give these developers full access to your data.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|A must see!!!  Great movie about courage to  face your circumstances no matter what... &  it's not about the outer shell of a person, but  what's inside. Definitely!!!!  I'm recommending you to watch or buy it!!!!  :-)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fabulous!  The character development shown in this season as well as the story lines are absolutely riveting.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this series.  It will be one of those series people talk about years from now.
B00E0P8VOS|5.0|This set is the most colossal masterpiece in all of music!! The sound quality of this disc is superior. JERRY LIVES!!!!
B005K17RU0|1.0|uninstalling today too busy too many people trying to make it better overkill try something else's for a while definitely not an improvement
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Sounds just like Stryper from back in the day. Michael Sweet's pipes are better than ever. Buy this album, you will not regret it!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Most addicting & time-killing game ever!  You will be hooked - starts off easy enough, but gets challenging - Enjoy!
B003Z49LYO|4.0|painful to watch but honest.  Her life was just so Tragic.  It pains me to see a woman suffer so terribly for something someone else did to her.  Glad to be a woman today and not then.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game a lot. It's easy and fun to play. The only problem I have is that it causes my phone to freeze up.
1594487154|5.0|To Sell is Human’ is a book based around the concept that everyone is in sales. If you were to trace your time back one week and look at all the tasks you have been performing, a majority of those tasks would involve some sort of selling or convincing. However the sales methods have dramatically changed. According to Pink, the ABC of sales no longer stands for ‘Always Be Closing,’ but instead, Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity. These three factors are crucial to your success as a sales person. Pink is able to provide scientific evidence of all of his points through countless studies and examples that can help you adopt these practices in the future. Aside from the new ABC’s of sales, Pink introduces readers to 3 other lessons that include 6 new ways of pitching as well as how to improvise and how to serve. Interesting book and well worth the read.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Had lots of problems with it. the main one being it would start slowing down in the middle of the tape like it was low on batteries or set to the wrong speed. (with new batteries and no speed setting) Ended up returning it. I would not recommend.
0316017930|5.0|In Outliers, Gladwell takes readers through a deeper look at success, which boils down to opportunities. In the example of Bill Gates, Gates himself discusses the fact that a handful of people, maybe 50, around the world were given the same opportunities as him. Gladwell is pointing out that behind these success stories are opportunities that gave the person an advantage over others, which they took advantage of. These advantages also come down to timing. Between the years of 1953 and 1956 some of the biggest tech titans in the world were born, lying before them, the birth to computers. These individuals were lucky enough to be presented such an incredible opportunity, but smart enough and hard working in order to take advantage of the opportunity.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|Like most sequels, this was okay, but in no way compares to the first movie. The first film concluded the series very well, so I really don't think this film was even necessary.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|What an amazing reading experience even though I firmly believe Lee wasn't the lone shooter.<br /><br />Thank you Stephen King for such a great book!
B00GBCMW9S|3.0|I just did a listen through and I'm not feeling it.  The beats he chose just don't go with his style of flow.  It sounds pieced together.  The beats on MOST of his previous albums fit the lyrics (speed and attitude of the track) much better than they do on this album.  That's my main complaint about this album.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|This book is a real downer.  While it examines a very hot moral issue of today, I'm uncertain that it fully addresses the ability of this quad patient to make an unbiased assessment of the life he had remaining.  To me, he came across as completely selfish.<br /><br />The novel is appropriately titled.
B008MM9630|5.0|Fun play.  great graphics.  Best of all you don't lose progress like a certain other free farming game.  Only thing I would suggest is to be a little more clear on how to get certain items.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Highly recommend this book. At times laughed out loud could not put it down. Have not stopped talking about it. Very cleverly written
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|It works great, it charges my Samsung S3 twice with one light bar still on..  So maybe 2.25 times if you suck it dry.. Will recommend it. It's the same size as the phone just a bit smaller..
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Both a fan of the comic and the other Dredd movie, I found this one to be top notch. Who's ever idea to make sure that Karl Urban never removes his helmet the whole movie was pure genius. I cannot wait for more Dredd movies in the future.
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|Beautifully written, warmly told tale with engaging characters and a story that draws you in. I honestly couldn't put it down.
B002JXK5VU|3.0|It isn't a bad show, after a few episodes the same plot line keeps being reused.  it is one of the few shows &#34;SyFy&#34; didn't cancel and isn't about sharks and tornadoes.
B009LDD54K|5.0|This is a gift, yet to be given.  The recipients do not have HBO and thus get to watch this series a year late.  I loved the third season so I knew what I was buying.  If you are a &#34;Boardwalk Empire&#34; fan, you'd have to love this.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Great story lines, great doctor. This is the season that brought me to British television! Sci-fiction at it's greatest! Love it!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This movie was just a silly little gift for a friend that had not seen it.  My friend was a college baseball player and is a devoted baseball fan.  I call him when I need to know something.  So he had not seen the movie.  I've seen it twice and although I would not rate it four stars, it is a solid three and well worth watching.  He enjoyed it.  So it's a winner.
B002W1UEW4|1.0|I have a movie 'star&#34; like  Channing Tatum that dislikes the military play a military personal is a stretch to say the least, but as a fan of the G.I.Joe Cartoons from the 80's, they can at lest make the movie closer to the story lines from the cartoons. If Transformers can do it, so can these people.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy watching Downton Abbey on weekends while I'm making cards in my craft room, and my husband is watching football.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The third and final book in the Divergent series had me all over the place emotional, especially the ending. My goodness, that ending had me ugly crying and I had to put the book down to breathe. I'm not giving that spin of an ending away though because well, that'd just be wrong.<br /><br />So, being the final book in the series there had to be some major things that happen and a lot of it is not due to the struggle between factions or the factionless. A group of people including Tobias and Tris leave to go outside of the fence to find out what is outside and that is where the fun begins. They find out some huge things about their lives and it is hard for them to handle it.<br /><br />Tris and Tobias go through a lot of issues in their relationship as well, due some of the things that they find out. The thing that I didn't really care for was that every time Tobias and Tris gets together it's a make out session for them. There doesn't seem to be a time where they aren't kissing and I don't know, it just didn't belong in it to me. I know that they are together and that's what couples do but I'm not sure, it could have been without about a half of the times and it would have been better.<br /><br />Caleb gets rescued by Tobias on account of Tris not wanting him to die and the turmoil that Tris and Caleb go through is kind of heartbreaking. In fact, some of it had me in tears because you don't really know what Caleb was thinking while he was doing all of the stuff he did before and you can tell that he regrets it. I'd love to see a novella done with Caleb and telling his side of things though. I can only imagine that he was brainwashed in a way.<br /><br />Now, let's go back to the ending. I have seen a lot of people have had a problem with it and I can totally see why they would. I mean, it kind of sucks but I can see how it would have happened and I respect Tris a whole lot more because of it. Was it a happily ever after ending? If you look at it a certain way, yes, it was.<br /><br />I loved the series every book of the way and I don't believe this was not a strong book or a strong ending for the series. I think it was just right and I loved it.it was.<br /><br />I loved the series every book of the way and I don't believe this was not a strong book or a strong ending for the series. I think it was just right and I loved it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|1 SPOILER<br /><br />This book was very good.  I think the poor readers that have been giving up and giving one star probably got to the second book, this was my only issue with the series, that second book was basically a walk down and back up again with a few minor things on the way down and one major on the way back up.<br /><br />That said, all the other parts were awesome, the last book worried me a bit that the story was headed in a strange direction but ended up being one of the best.<br />certainly a favorite of mine now.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the graphic novel, but it seems to keep getting pushed back :-(
B004X75RK4|5.0|I needed a good laugh and someone suggested this movie.  I must admit this movie had me laughing and crying.  Very well done!
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Genius writing is the backbone to this film. Great cast, great storyline, great overall. This is one of those few films that stays with you even after you've watched it plenty of times.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Very helpful guide, but a little more detail would have been great. I hope to see some improvement to it in the future.
B008Y5T5ZE|4.0|Decent movie, entertaining, Johnny Dep is always good. Not a movie I would want to pay $10 to see at a theater but worth every penny on Amazon Prime.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This cd is just simply awesome!!! I knew just from hearing the samples here on Amazon and the couple whole length songs/videos that this would most certainly be my favorite album of theirs! Even though they included one of their &#34;ballad songs&#34; on here (something they always do), &#34;The One,&#34; isn't like most of their others. It has a little more of a &#34;rock appeal&#34; to it which works for me. The lyrics are amazing and thought provoking, the musicianship is so good, I have to say that it can stand up to most anything out there! It's filled with guitar solos (praise God) and the production is excellent as well. I believe this is the 4th time I've heard this now (playing right now) and the only music I've been listening to since I received it. It's just not possible to be a Stryper fan and be almost at a loss for words when using any others besides awesome, amazing.....! Since I love the real heavy stuff, I have to go with &#34;Marching Into Battle&#34; as my favorite. So this leaves the one question..... would someone who loves hard rock/metal music not love this release? I personally don't know how this would be the case. For those who don't yet know the Lord and aren't in favor of going to a church and being in that type of environment, please listen to this cd! These guys are as real as they come and have been through a whole lot of stuff, as many other of us have. I believe the words will really &#34;speak&#34; to you and this is the heart of our brothers known as Stryper. Just to close...this release exceeds the expectations I had regarding it and not just a little....but a whole lot. God bless you and thanks for reading my review. Now get out and buy this...lol. peace
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|My kids and watched this together.  It is a great movie!!  My son has watched it 3 or 4 times more!!  May have to buy the blue ray version!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Having been an Air Force flyer for 25 years, I spent a great deal of time as a pilot in B-52 squadrons that were assigned nuclear missions.  Nonetheless, I was more than surprised at the amount of details in this book that suggested risks in these weapons that were never disclosed to those who handled them or operated the planes carrying them.  This is fascinating history, painstakingly researched, that illuminates incompetence, duplicity, and bold lies perpetuated by the labs that designed the weapons, the services that deployed them, and the Congressional committees that funded them.  Highly recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|keep playing!!!!<br />love this game! play all the time trying to beat my friends scores.my new fav! :-) :-) :-)
B000N5F6OW|3.0|Not his best movie but definitely entertaining and worth the watch.  It felt a little long at points but not bad overall.
B0051E9JNE|5.0|Love chris Lambert! Seen all the Highlander films and this was damn good. Sword fights, lightening, nasty killer on loose the<br />whole works! Highlander gets his man again.......and gets lit up. Loved it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I hated having to put the book down, but, at times, it is necessary.  I look forward to reading many more of his novels.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Great movie! Great Quality! Everything arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I am very pleased with this purchase, and would recommend this movie.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Needed a slim and portable 5V USB supply for two reasons:<br /><br />1. Charge Cell Phone + iPod Mini on the go (ie: bus, train, plane)<br />2. Power Raspberry Pi without a AC->DC adapter for multiple hours at a time<br /><br />Some quick numbers from full charge:<br /><br />1. Charged my Galaxy S3 two full times and to ~50% a third time (remember, there were 2 days of down time included in there when I was waiting for my phone to die)<br />2. Power my model B rev 2 Pi for 10:22 while running a simple curl loop over ethernet. Yes, you read that right, nearly 10.5 hours of uptime for a portable linux box with this battery pack. The following script was run from boot time:<br />  while [ 1 ]; do curl --data-urlencode \\"uptime=`uptime`\\" [...] sleep 10; done<br /><br />4 stars, not 5:<br /><br />1. The physical portion of the microUSB plug is too short. No, not the flexy rubber cable that connects it to the pack, the _actual_ plug itself. This is terribly annoying because it means you either have to carry around another cable (ie: the short one provided) or take off your phone case / Pi enclosure every time you want to use it. PLEASE Anker, make this thing a millimeter or two longer.<br /><br />2. No reason to have the LEDs on all the time. Yes, there are only 4 of them, yes they draw very little current; however, this thing should last for as long as humanly possible and causing unnecessary drain is a bad form. give me a simple push button if I want to know the current life remaining.
0765348276|5.0|One of the best fiction books I have read in years. The follow up books are good also but this one is the best.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing story, very captivating from beginning to end. Parts of the book were difficult to read for me, due to the<br />less than human references, and uncivilized treatment that certain parts of society faced for their religious believes.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Will Smith brings back one of my favorite characters of his in the final Men in Black film. Josh Brolin's performance as a younger Tommy Lee Jones was spot on! If you liked the first two, you will want to see how the Trilogy ends.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|So by mid book I kinda saw it coming, but not ALL of it. That being said, until you figure it out, your eyes will be glued to the book till the end.

B006699DDE|5.0|As always you can't beat the classics.  This was even better with the N C Wyeth illustrations.  It's been years since I read about Jim 'Arkins and its still one of my all time favorites.

B000M341RI|5.0|A great classic movie!  I love british films and humor.  This one is a must have for movie collectors or just any one who likes british comedies.
B00DSGT8TW|1.0|Long time fan of Manic Street , I am lost as to what to say. It is unlike any other offerings from them , in a bad way. Its just bad folk music. Its just not good or ground breaking. Imagine the worst coffee house folk music. Don't waste your money.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is very addictive and fun to play. I love to play it especially when I am under pressure.

B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I got this for my grandson and neice and they LOVE it!!!  I also like playing it and now my co-worker is playing it on hers.
B009NX409M|5.0|Enjoyed the movie very much. So true to today.  Would recommend for an evening of entertainment.  Might watch again if time allows.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved this book. In my opinion, the best of the &#34;zombie&#34; genre, and a must-read.  I did not see the movie, as I had read this when it first came out. From what I've heard, the movie has almost NOTHING to do with the book.
0061767581|5.0|Everything went completely well with this order. I am beyond satisfied, I recommend these guys one hundred percent sure. xoxo
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book!! I really couldn't put this book down. I loved it and can't wait to read more from this author.
B000002TYX|5.0|Everything went completely well with this order. I am beyond satisfied, I recommend these guys one hundred percent sure. xoxo
B0018O4YT0|1.0|Why hate this movie: by the numbers plot indifferent to reality, the story falls apart once you realize the people chasing the guy could very easily change the city to a desert and the chase is over (sucks if you're a screen writer trying to get two hours of material out of a high-concept with weak development), and the dialogue is as hackneyed as a fifties sci-fi drive-in matinee. In twenty years this will be on mystery science theater--which would be a huge upgrade.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Thanks G5 for the great games. I  tried one other virtual city decided to come to the playgroundand give it a try.like the ease of play. enjoy game play and levels. it is a playground.
B004742Y40|5.0|I can't believe I hadn't seen this film yet. It is hilarious! I loved how it is quite atypical of most supernatural teen movies/TV shows we see today. Most of the time, the main character is required to keep their &#34;gift&#34; or &#34;curse&#34; a secret. But here, people loved the wolf! Anyway, tons of entertainment; Michael J. Fox is great. I highly recommend it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book!! It's so amazing in so many different ways. Don't listen to those people who say that the book is about sex. It is about so much more than that. Sure there is a lot of sex in it but there is so much more to the book than that. It's one of those books where when you've finished the series you are dad because it is over. I really hope she makes more books in the series!! Definitely a five star book!
006202406X|1.0|Did the author scrap her original draft and rip off Game of Thrones? Seems like it. I was SO incredibly excited for this book. I loved the first two books. In my mind, the idea seemed more original and the questions which arose for the book seemed more intelligible - questioning human ethics and morality. In a way, this last book does it...but then it wasn't. This book was a HOT MESS. There was so much potential. What lay outside of Chicago could have been anything. ANYTHING. What did Roth do with it? She made a mess of a story that barely had a discernible ending except that Four is forced to carry on with life after losing the love of his life. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'm not happy about Tris's death but there's certainly plenty more to be unhappy with.<br /><br />I'm a science nerd. I was willing to let go of the shotty science in the first two book because the storyline was likeable. Then, Allegiant came out. I really want to sit this girl down and explain to her about genetics and heritability of traits. Also, one of the underlying themes in this book is about &#34;Nature versus Nurture&#34; aka how genetics AND environment dictates people's personalities/actions. She tried to take it there but instead presented a jumbled mess about &#34;damaged/pure genes&#34; and how people, possibly, were more than their genes.<br /><br />Then I'd like to discuss how abruptly changing POVs in the final installation followed by switching the story to Four completely was ridiculous. Seems like her ideas were all over the place and this was her screwed up way of pulling it all together. We can &#34;heal.&#34; We can move on... got it. Except you keep Four, arguably the most sympathetic characters in the series, and screw up his life even more. Hasn't he been through enough??? You are NOT George R.R. Martin, lady.<br /><br />This book? Just no. I regret even starting the series!!!
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love pinterest,  don't  get me wrong.  This app is so slow.  My friend has an iPhone and its on version 3. something.  It doesn't show the number of pins or bottom of pin.  That is why this is a two star review.  If they update it I will bump up my review.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It is so amazing and true to the series. However, it is also emotional and heartbreaking, but that's what makes a good end to a beautiful series.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Great package always wanted to know history for this band and the last concert disc is great..... Glen Frey is the boss....
B00FKAA3MA|1.0|There are at least a half-dozen verses in this album alone that stand amongst his best ever. ... Problem is, saying a whole lotta nothing for 70-plus minutes doesn’t exactly make for a compelling rap record.<br /><br />MMLP2 makes it more plain than ever that Eminem is among a growing number of rap superstars who are little more than vestigial pieces shoehorned onto radio by inertia alone. The main takeaway of MMLP2 is that Eminem fails to realize that the formulas that worked so well for him in 1999 are at best tired and tame today, and can't be saved by his lyrical dexterity.
0307276902|5.0|This story captures your imagination making you feel like your there. His use of descriptive words makes the whole moment feel real.

B00CDV6WDS|2.0|The selections are highlighted and that eliminates most of the challenge. There is no option for this feature.  Because of this, there is a delay forthenewchoices to light up...timed games are a joke.  If you compete against others, the scores do not reflect which set up you were using g. Tiles could. E larger.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I didn't want this one to end.  I switched sides with every chapter and have seen first hand similar cases.  Loved this book and all the quirky characters.
B0091XICM0|4.0|Too long and out dated.  The ending was the best and probably the most famous part. Worth waiting for it.
B00D7OXUIK|2.0|The violin was played over by the louder piano; the mixer was  making it sound as if the violin was merely an accompanying part instead of an equal.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Great horror film.  Extremely well acted.  Lots of surprises.  Very unique.  Makes viewers want to look into more foreign films.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|The problem with modern production techniques is they compress the dynamics, making everything loud; then they increase the volume past the technical limits of the CD. This is evident on the Clockwork Angels release, and there are many areas where it is impossible to hear the nuances of Neil Peart's drumming, to follow Geddy Lee's bass lines, or to tell just what exactly Alex Lifeson is doing on his guitar. The mix wasn't as bad as the original master of Vapor Trails, but it is clearly not as good as it should have been.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Excellent script, great acting, just so much better than American crap that gets dumped on us, and our actors have such a high opinion of themselves they attend award shows once a month!
B00BEIYMAG|1.0|The same old; seen many times before. You would think that demons or spirits or whatever that can be a challenge to God could do better than:<br />(1.) Open and close doors; make things fall down especially things that are susceptible like poorly hung pictures and frying pans on hooks.<br />(2.) Make the same thumping sounds that old houses have always made especially contraction as they cool down at night.<br />(3.) Drag a person by the hair or make them float (levitate, whatever).<br />(4.) Make a few small bruises just on an extremity every few nights - come on demon you can do better!<br />(5.) Take advantage of the human brain's built-in capacity to make a problematic scene into a recognizable image such as a face, etc.<br />(6.) Birds flying into buildings - they must eaten too many fermented berries. Or, birds are the one creature on Earth that demons/spirits really don't like.<br />(7.) The dog's heightened sense of smell and hearing makes them the first creature to annoy demons/spirits. Demons are wussies.<br />(8.) The possessed always have to look like an alien and death team up to torture and contort the victim - again what a waste of immense power; demons/spirits you need a better agent.<br />OK, the point is made and this film is another exploitation of human intelligence (or the lack ...).
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My daughter loves it! We got it for her at 3 months old, and she started using it right away. Now she's an expert bouncer, after just a couple weeks. She keeps entertained, and I'm free to do housework (with her bouncing away in sight of course).
B002I8PVQA|5.0|really a good movie... and with Brando!!<br /><br />nice plot, respectable acting... I think one of ed nortons best films, aside from Fight Club that is
B000SEFCD8|5.0|An entertaining and enlightening read.  While it's not a dog training manual, it does provide excellent insight into how dogs interpret our behavior and what theirs means.  The book has been very helpful as we've been getting to know our new shelter dog, and has helped us through some mutual misunderstandings.  While certainly not a substitute for a training book or the assistance of a professional dog trainer, it's a very good read for anyone curious about dogs' &#34;why they do&#34; of &#34;what they do.&#34;  It may not change your dog's behavior, but you may well find it changes yours!
B004GWQT5I|5.0|Love M. Night and his movies are alway's awesome.  This is an awesome movie and love seeing the karma.  I want to add this movie to my collection of his movies.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I loved this movie.  The 3D was amazing, I have loved all the Star Trek films, but this one is my favorite.  If you have a 3D TV and are considering purchasing this movie, you should go for the 3D version.
B004742Y68|5.0|Poltergeist!!!!!  This falls under my list of favorites for spooky movies.  Script well written, great actors, and really good special effects.
080726203X|1.0|I purchased the audio version of The Giver last year so one of my students whose comprehension is excellent but decoding skills are still emergent could read the book.  He enjoyed listening to it, so I decided to use it with my seventh grade class.  The man who reads the story has a pretentious way of talking that the students objected to.  That would have been tolerable, but there were two other glaring problems with the audio version of the book:<br /><br />1. There is music that plays randomly throughout the story.  This was distracting and detracted from the story.  I understand using music to signal the end of a CD (I am listening to an audiobook that does just that), but this music was in the middle of chapters.  It played behind a few very important scenes, scenes that were somber and serious.  Uplifting, new age music with somber and serious scenes?  Not for me.  More problematic was how distracting it was for the students, who were asking why there was music playing rather than listening to the story.<br /><br />2. The narrator seemed to think Jonas was a whiny, petulant, snivelly boy.  In my multiple readings of the book, I found Jonas thoughtful, patient, clever, and calm.  He was not a whiner; he was not a complainer; he was not petulant.  At the end of the book, The Giver reveals a secret to Jonas that upsets him greatly.  I had to turn off the audio version because the way in which the narrator read Jonas' part was absolutely ridiculous and not how the book even says.  Jonas is supposed to be sarcastic...the narrator made him whine.  Jonas is supposed to be passionately caring...the narrator made him whine.<br /><br />Again, this review is for the AUDIO version only.  The book itself is awesome.  I love it.  I am angry about the movie they're making because it's not going to represent the book.  I am similarly angry about this audiobook because it doesn't represent Jonas in a way I feel he -- and we, the readers -- deserve.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Hello everyone,<br /><br />The product was what I expected and I really liked it.<br />The product worked well and was shipped in a timely manner.<br />I would recommend it to other stoke fans!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a great book and very well written.  I will soon be lookng for more books by Elizabeth Haynes.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Love it. It is a snapshot in the same way as MMLP was, just over a decade later. It is definitely worthy of the namesake. I think his music development has aged very well, and he is still the best out there. I quickly lose interest in the rap scene when he isn't involved.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|If you love the Pendergast books, you will love this new episode.  The story takes twists and turns that are unexpected from the beginning to the end.  I can't wait for the next adventure.  Write faster!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Enjoy communications<br /> diversities of information and connections with past and present individuals  it is entertaining and keeps one well informed
0553801473|3.0|You know, once you get addicted..... I still love the panorama of the new worlds, but grieve the loss of so many great characters.  I am just hoping Book 6 will bring everything together in a way that makes it all worthwhile and uplifting.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Every episode has a philosophical meaning to take away from it so I at least feel like I'm not completely wasting my time like most cable shows
B001A9ZPZ0|5.0|It has a good story with a well worked-out character created just for this episode.  And it is a story with social significance about homeless people that makes its compassionate case well and is pertinent to our times.  Given the heartlessness of many of the people and politicians of our times, it is also frighteningly plausible, even though what it depicts, arguably depriving people of liberty without due process, possibly violates the U.S. Constitution.
B009PK9SB8|1.0|Don't know the exact reason why, but the touch screen is not consistently working. Sometimes it works fine but most of the time I had to click buttons on screen many times. Ended up with returning the product...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We love it for what it does so far. Easy to use in a hotel room or visiting a friend
B00CTGVKGQ|5.0|An Amazing collection of songs! I cannot hear it enough because it is so different from other songs on the radio.
039916409X|4.0|I have read quite a bit on EFT and I have searched the academic literature to see how effective it is.  Of the 3 books I have like (and Read), I find Ms. Lynch's to be the best. She clearly states what the scripts are, and she walks through some great exercises regarding blocks and such.  I am suggesting to my friends to try this book
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A whole lot of fun! Easy to play and addicting as well! A must play for the whole family! I definitely recommend this game.
B00EJX2YGM|3.0|I am a great fan of the series, but this set offered very little extra, if you had previously purchased the other DVD's with extras as they were available. To someone who has not previously owned or seen the DVD's with extras, this will be a goldmine. Disappointed in the actual \\"extras\\" that I had hoped made this set worth the price. Nice packaging. UV copies avalaible only through Flixster or Vudu, which is not ideal.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|While making all my eye doctor appts. this was always playing in the lobby.  I finally asked the name of it and where I could get it and I found it here at Amazon.  I love this DVD.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great game awsome just like real hunting i cant put it down hours and hours and hours and hours of fun
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love her books and this one was as good as it gets.  From the beginning in the water to getting in trouble with the judge
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Come on it's the &#34;Sound of Music&#34;!!!. Great movie. To bad they do not make movies like this any more
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Very well made! We were pleasantly suprised by this movie as the preview we saw months ago seemed like it would be a lame sequel without a good story line.  We were wrong.  It was great! Very funny and entertaining.  Teaches kids good morals too- like not to lie or cheat.
0385537131|5.0|Grisham is truly a great story teller. Character development, story background, pacing, all the rest, he does well. I kept thinking that at some point the theme would turn dark and moralistic, and the ending would be disappointing, but it never did and it wrapped up nicely. Great job as usual.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was interesting, well written and made me want to keep reading long after I should have gone to bed!
B008C20TDG|3.0|The first half of the book is very repetitive and written on a grade school level.A bit boring. It is not well formated for Kindle because you can not turn back and forth for reference to different chapters. The second half gets down to the basic principles of the healthy life style eating, still a bit repetitive. Toward the end they did address folks who are concerned with chronic health issues such as insulin dependent diabetics and those with digestive disorder such as IBS. This was more helpful to me. We can develop a healthy eating lifestyle without &#34;dieting&#34;. This plan worked well for my daughter and her husband who recommended the book to me. Personally I fit into the diabetics and digestive issues who will gradually work into the plan but may not fully embrace all of the principles. The end of the book also includes many recipes for healthy eating lifestyle.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Yes, this game is fantastic! Great for all ages. It gives the kids the ability to be creative, while giving a sense of responsibility for their &quot;reef&quot;. We do, however, wish there was an easier way to get pearls, but I guess here's where Disney is teaching PATIENCE!
B00E9P959O|5.0|When I first heard the original release back in 2002, the flaws were immediately apparent. It was harsh, noisy, and overcompressed. This was frustrating because the musicianship phenomenal as usual but I couldn't get past the unlistenability of it. As a result, I rarely listened to it. HOWEVER, THIS REMIX IS AWESOME. I can hear details unrecognizable in the original cuts. It is an absolute pleasure to listen to now. Most remixes are gimmicky retreads to make a few extra bucks. But Rush, in keeping with their sense of musical integrity, recognized a problem and fixed it to the delight of their loyal fans. Enjoy!
B002M9WW30|5.0|Loved this set.  I've introduced my 12 year old son to Rocky movies and he absolutely loves them too.  Now he doesn't cry everytime when Adrian tells Rocky to &#34;Win&#34; in II like his dad does, but still.  Everytime he's watching them I wisper in his ear to tell him to &#34;Never give up&#34; on something that you want.  Rocky never did.
B000001A9P|5.0|Buyers, if you don't get this album, you are missing out!<br /><br />This is indeed one of the best R & B Live releases to ever come out! Stevie wonder sounds exceptional as usual, the music  and the voice will touch your soul! It is always a real treat to hear a great artist interpret his hits in a live setting.<br /><br />If you love Live music, then add this to your collection! Stevie wonder is a legend! The 2 cds come with a very nice booklet with liner notes and pictures.<br /><br />A+ product!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I couldn't figure out why it kept selling out at Walmart in my town, now I know.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  I read the books when I was a lot younger and had forgotten what a good all-around story the book was.  I think Disney did a very good job with the script and the special effects.  I hope they make the whole series!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you love your dog and often wonder what's on his or her mind, you will love this book. It's a great story, heartwarming, hilariously funny, it grips at your heart and causes you to get lost in the story. I have not enjoyed reading a book as much as I enjoyed reading The Art of Racing in the Rain. I highly recommend.  Thank you Garth Stein!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I love the book series and I love this movie. I cannot understand why this movie did not do better in theaters. Maybe not enough people enjoy scifi adventure.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|I love it. I hope there is more like this one. I have been addicted since I down loaded it
B005721Y7Y|2.0|I had to watch this movie for a class. I found it to be strange and I am not sure if I can watch a movie that has Kevin Spacey in it again.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Not the most exciting game I've ever played, but I've enjoyed the time I've wasted playing this game. It's fun to try to work your wag through each level.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie simply because it was a movie out of the norm!! No shooting, no violence, no monsters or super heroes. Just a nice, enjoyable movie about the older generation having fun!!!
B003YWPN08|5.0|I've read the reviews that gave this film only 1 or 2 stars. People said it was dull, boring, too long, the actors were too scripted and unrealistic, there was no story to it like there was in the Jerry Bruckheimer film, and on and on. Obviously people are very different about things and everybody has a right to their opinion.<br /><br />But I think that these folks are missing the point. \\"Tora!, Tora!, Tora!\\" is to Bruckheimer's \\"Pearl Harbor\\" what \\"A Night to Remember\\" was to James Cameron's \\"Titanic.\\" Most people who saw \\"A Night To Remember\\" when it came out, and also saw Cameron's \\"Titanic,\\" will tell you that as sensational as Cameron's version was of the event, ANTR was more like the real thing. And that's because that was the film producer's intention in the first place; entertainment was secondary. In fact, in ANTR, 4th Officer Boxhall, who was on the real Titanic and survived the sinking, was on the set of ANTR and was one of the consultants in the making of the movie, so it would be done accurately.<br /><br />\\"Tora!, Tora!, Tora! was done much the same way. The producers used both American and Japanese military historians to try to portray both sides' point of view as accurately as possible. And once again -- the primary objective was to recreate on film an accurate portrayal of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. Entertainment was an important factor, but it was secondary to the primary objective. Furthermore, while the actors in this movie were not the most colorful or popular or charismatic in Hollywood, they were nonetheless very representative of the naval and army officers and top government officials of that time. They looked and sounded and acted the part very well. George Macready in particular was outstanding in his portrayal of Cordell Hull, Secretary of State.<br /><br />And I can't close my comments without including this: the Japanese flagship in the real event was the aircraft carrier, Akagi. In the movie, you see the Japanese planes taking off of the Akagi's flight deck and on to their mission. But the ship you are actually seeing is the USS Yorktown CVS-10 -- MY SHIP, AND I WAS ON IT WHILE THEY WERE MAKING THE MOVIE. When the sequence of the flight take-offs begins, at about the 6th plane taking off, if you look quickly down at the very end of the flight deck, you'll see the number \\"10\\" on it, my ship's number. Also, right around that same general time frame in the movie, there's a nice aerial shot for a few seconds looking down at the Yorktown (Akagi), showing the entire ship. Anyway, every time I watch \\"Tora!, Tora!, Tora!, it's kind of weird to be sitting in my recliner watching my ship and knowing that I am on it there in the movie!
B005LN5UOC|5.0|I was in the market for an inexpensive bluetooth headset to use with GTA Online. I would highly recommend this one for the following reasons:<br />-The in-ear design is effective and outputting audio<br />-The extended mic picks up the user's voice perfectly<br />-The rechargeable battery lasts longer than any other bluetooth headset I've used<br />-The LED light is bright and works well to communicate the state of the device<br />-The construction is light and solid<br />-It looks badass<br /><br />Nothing is perfect however:<br />-The charger is proprietary, not usb like others<br />-When the mic is muted (by pressing the main button once) it has a tone every 2 seconds notifying you that it is muted<br /><br />I would recommend this, you won't find a headset for a better price than this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This a fun game and frustrating when you are stuck on a level. I just wish I could play it on my kindle fire.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Another pleasant book by Mr. Gresham. He continues to keep interest high as different scenarios pop up to me keep the plot going.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Chocolate chip cookies and that is it. All have to say for this product!!!!!!! So there I love it and that's is bud.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|Did not like the ending of the show but loved the rest.  Very interesting  to learn how it was in the past.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Its an amazing toy for kids. I bought for my niece and she loved.<br />This was my first purchase at Amazon.
B008ROB9H4|5.0|I love love stories and this is one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's sad and real and will break your heart. The acting is amazing!!
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|It was sent in perfect condition and I love this music. It was really special how they were able to compose a song with one of Elvis Presley's songs. She chose some beautiful songs to bring about the Christmas spirit and I love listening to it!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This is the best show on TV. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are awesome together. The perfect Sherlock and Watson!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|It came to me in perfect shape...new as promised and I love this music. It is so relaxing and I can do things without being distracted by listening to music with words...it just sets a nice peaceful atmosphere in our home.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie. I have been singing these song for over 20 years. Who doesn't love John Travolta!!!!
B0012JEIGU|5.0|Before this disc came out, I was oblivious to what Tobias Sammet regarded as a Metal Opera. But since I am a big fan of Jorn Lande, who appears on a few of the tracks on this disc, I wanted to give it a try. And I'm really glad I did. Every track, except for \\"What Kind of Love\\", which isn't bad in it's own right, is a great track. I've listened to this disc dozens of times, and it continues to remain fresh. For anyone who likes great prog-power metal, I'd recommend this CD. (And although the other Avantasia discs don't quite measure up to this one, they're all worth getting, since they're each worth 4 our of 5 stars!)
B009EBLCK8|5.0|This is the most amazing show I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it. I love the plots, the characters, the settings, everything! Ben Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are the best actors.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|A great follow up for the Stargate series good cast and story it keeps you interest will not diappoint you
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|A good movie with good actors and plot.  I am looking forward to Red 2 coming in November.  Very good
B003YCI1O8|5.0|Somepeople, especially the ones that did not see any of them, probably think this was just some &#34;B&#34; Movie but the first 2 were actually good watching.  Didn't care for the others.
B0064W67IM|5.0|But they are also fun, and the first book in the Sandman series takes those two concepts and start a very entertaining story. Morpheus is a compelling character who you just want to keep reading about, and Neil Gaiman knows how to make the Avant Garde aspects of the story work.<br /><br />There were some parts I thought were a little clunky. I wasn't expecting some recognizable DC Comics superheroes to appear. But these are small quibbles. I look forward to continuing this series.
B00957T6X6|4.0|The whole series of these books are quite fantastic. The auyhor really knows how to engage the reader and keep you interested as he constantly jumps from on character to another. My only issue is that you recieve all five books in one ebook format that doesnt break down any individual chapters. I am reading these books on a paperwhite new edition and was really excited to use the time left feature however this ebook considers each individual book a chapter. so instead of being able go know i have 15  minutes left in a specific chapter, it tells me i have 43 hours left in the chapter when in actuality that i how long i have left to reach the end of book three which i am currently on.
0938045768|5.0|It's fair to say Convict Conditioning changed the way I look at exercise more than any other single resource. I write this review after a full year of bodyweight only training and I have to say this book is hands down the best manual you'll ever read on the subject.<br /><br />Some people have been critical of the book being too full of hype and overinflated storytelling. I have to say that part of the book (the first few chapters) were actually really eye opening for me. After all, we live in a culture where infomercials are bombarding our brains with \\"the next sensational machine for the abs\\" which uses the body's momentum to create a 5 minute workout.<br /><br />Ask most people what they are going to do to improve their fitness or develop strength and they'll happily say \\"join the gym\\", usually around January 1st, only to have ceased going after 3 weeks. Someone had to stand up and say \\"just move your goddamn body\\". Paul Wade teaches just how to move your bodyweight within a progressively difficult framework, which to me is the part that makes this book more valuable than other systems out there.<br /><br />He covers the \\"Big 6\\" exercises that will develop total body muscle and strength. Even if you train with weights you will learn a lot from the exercise progressions. He is perhaps a tad evangelical in his rubbishing of weight training but I think he is really working hard trying to overcome the pervasive cultural paradigm that you need weights and a gym membership to develop awesome strength. It's just not true.<br /><br />If I had to give one caveat, I would say that the book does repeat itself a bit in the earlier chapters, however, I enjoyed reading about how bodyweight training is a lost art that was preserved in penitentiaries.<br /><br />Read it, enjoy it and know that this reader at least has tried it and a year on I'm more enthusiastic about my training and results than ever.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|I have seen other versions of this Jane Austen movie and book but this version was more inclusive of the book's details.  The actor's were well cast and this version is my favorite.  Bobbi Knopf
B00F35BV64|3.0|Really? Kirk in bed with two women at once?  Spare me.  We will now watch Star Trek devolve into a film version of Playboy magazine, I guess.  Count me out.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great, great writing, characters and acting.  And they keep reinventing it.  The only thing is the title is so stupid and demeaning.  I get that Alicia was being a good wife, but she is a much deeper person that just a role.
B00EQF0JJC|4.0|I've seen Bill Shakespeare done live in every possible setting, from the wild West to 50's motorcycle gangs.  This is one of the best -- clever, hilarious, tense, redemptive.
B002SLNJWU|5.0|Great show, it had everything - don't know why they would cancel it.  Suspence, humor, love, mystery, the sci fi element and it was very well written and acted. And, there was violence and gore, but not soooooooo much as a lot of show.  I was fully engaged!  Still wish they would continue the story.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Oh, WHY couldn't I have been an accepting, open-minded teen like these kids?  Their rescue of each other is brave and touching.  Their oblivion to the norms of the day and their culture is worth emulating.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very simple and easy to use almost to easy to win.  I Definite Will  recommend it<br />To a friend.<br /><br />Michael T
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Keeps the viewer wondering all the way through what IS the relationship that would motivate this man to do what he does for this woman.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I like having the ability to check my Yahoo mail from my Kindle Fire, but I do not like that I cannot sign out of the app, leaving my email exposed to anyone, including the kids, whenever I let them borrow my Kindle. There is also a problem with being able to delete emails from the app. As of 11.6.13, these issues still existed.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It was just a good, fun, every entertaining movie.  Moved fast, lots of action, great effects. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Rap masterpiece.  I don't know what else to say because that pretty much sums it up.  Eminem does not disappoint.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This is a great book for those who are trying to make sence of the health problems we are facing today. He brings this into laymens terms yet backs up his theory with research that one can look further into. It is also a great guid to diet self help.
B00GFJ0NGQ|5.0|This is the best show I have watched in a long time. Not only does it keep you on edge it also has diversity. I think that even if you take out the zombies, this show still will be great. Other than that in this episode, 'Indifference', you get the hint that there will be a change. Like a quiet before the storm. However, I thought the previous episode was the storm because of the view of the zombies. That was definitely one of the scariest things I have seen. I hope they would not have to come to that point again. If you have seen the episode, you will know what I am talking about. I highly recommend it. As for some characters, I hope they resolve their issues because when you are thinking crazy, you would end up like Ricks ex best friend.
B009LQKHIO|1.0|Would not recommend this book because of its sex scenes. Did not appreciate the drawn out and detailed descriptions of the characters fornicating. Had these chapters/described actions been removed, the book would have been an ok read.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|It is a simple game that always allows for variation and surprise. It is a good way to pass the time and surprise friends with your poker face.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|A very good movie I watched it as a kid, my kids watched it also and I still watch it when I can. Not for children under 10 at all.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|Beautiful illustrations! It is a great addition to the already wonderful original game. It has helped engage people who have played the game before.
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|It was just dumb!!!!! Do not watch this movie unless you are bored and have nothing else to do you have been warned!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Didn't Like that ending. Great series over all tho. Read it. If you liked the hunger games  you'll love this.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|Loved this movie when i was little and love it even more now!!!!!!!!!!  You should get some popcorn and watch it today!
0316219266|4.0|I found it very interesting to learn more about of the history of Amazon - some of it not very flattering. I was surprised by the story later in the book about the bicycle shop owner. Gave me pause for thought. I'm glad the book is being sold on Amazon.<br /><br />This book helped me understand how Amazon became what it is.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So eloquent and devious. Great read with vivid delicious descriptions. A true love story with mystery, romance, and steamy scenes. READ IT!!!!! You will not regret the choice!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This can is so fun it can teach you songs. You can pick a song that you like and it teaches the song you chose

B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I recently finishing reading the book, \\"The ONE Thing\\" by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan. As part of my book group I hosted a live call with Jay Papasan and members of the group last week. This book was very insightful. I judge books in this genre based on asking myself, \\"How much, if at all, will this book change my daily behavior?\\" Based on that criteria I would have to rank this book very high as it will change my behavior.<br /><br />The premise of The ONE Thing is that at any given point in time, there is only one thing that you should focus on doing. Your one thing is the thing that moves you the closest or the fastest toward your goal.<br /><br />Around that theme the authors talk about the major lies that exist in the \\"productivity\\" community. These include the idea of multitasking, being disciplined, a balanced life, and others. The core of the book focuses around what the authors call the \\"Focusing Question,\\" which is, What is the One thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary? The books also talks about 3 commitments to productivity, 4 Thieves of productivity and other helpful insights around time management and time blocking.<br /><br />I loved this book. Its concept is obviously simple and yet very important. Its easy to apply immediately and it can product dramatic results fast. One of my favorite ideas from the book is the idea that we must time block our one thing. That means putting it on our schedule and protecting that time. If we lose some of that time (which is inevitable) from distractions or emergencies we must replace it.<br /><br />Another great insight I took from the book is the idea of aligning the \\"right now moment\\" with our long term goals and plans. If my goal is to help people become greater producers then I need to ask, \\"What is the ONE thing I can do in the next five years to help people become greater producers?\\" Then ask, what is the one thing I can do this year to achieve my five year goal to help people become greater producers?\\" Then ask, what is the one thing I can do this month.... and then this week, and then right now; to help me achieve that goal? The questions are stacked and this of course implies that we all have a lot of ONE things but at any given time or moment we really do only have one thing.<br /><br />I also love the chapter about will power. It reminded me of the sections about will power from \\"The Power of Habit\\" that I read last year and it was a good reminder about how critical it is to do the most important things when you have a full reserve of will power and to build habits out of the important things that currently require a lot of will power to accomplish.<br /><br />And in case you are wondering why writing this blog post right now is my ONE thing... the answer is this. My ONE thing is to bring out the inner producer in all of us, and right now the ONE thing I can do is to share this book with the greatest number of people within my circle of influence as possible. Enjoy the book.help people become greater producers?\\" Then ask, what is the one thing I can do this month.... and then this week, and then right now; to help me achieve that goal?

B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|In this newest album, Pearl Jam creates songs for every genre, appealing to both the old fan and the new.  Eddie's wisdom continues to grow as evidenced by the enlightened lyrics within each song.  I will be well sustained by this album for at least another 5 years.  Way to go Pearl Jam!
B005PK56TA|5.0|American Horror Story never disappoints! No matter what, I never miss an episode!! I plan to get the whole series soon.
B003ITIQ88|5.0|My kids and wife LOVE this movie we love Hachi!!!!! I recommend this movie to everyone you all will live it 5 stars
B007N8RULO|5.0|I've always found spider solitaire to be a very challenging game and still have a hard time winning - easy to use
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|The movie was just as bad as the first few - did not explain anything as to why the events were happening
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome I play it almost everyday it keeps mi occupy, when I get bored. Every one should try it in there spare time
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Because my 4 year old and 2 year old grandchildren think it is the bomb. It caught their attention and they sat and listened to every word (smile) a lot to ask for a 4year old and a 2 year old.
006202406X|1.0|I won't complain about the ending.  I wasn't emotionally vested in the characters and the author can end the story as she wishes.  However, as some have already pointed out, the third installment in this series was not ready for print.  Overall, the entire story line is shallow with very little work put into the background in which the story takes place.  Background is what makes a story rich and believable.  I believe the best authors put more work into the background than the actual story.  In this case, the background seems more like a basic outline or sketch and its weakness is revealed in this final installment.  The alternating POV between Tris and Tobias made the book seem disjointed and choppy.  I kept getting the feeling that this was the author's outline for the story and then she just fleshed it out with a lot of filler.  My suggestion:  if you've read the first two and are considering buying this book, find a plot summary online and read that.  You'll see how the story ends and not waste a lot of time getting there.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|1st things 1st: Installed on a Kindle Fire HD, from beginning to end, it never crashed, totally predictable, great graphics and sound, easy to control, fast to respond. I will say with confidence, this app sets the standard in free auto race games (with a dash of whimsy) and I'd say for a good amount of pay-to-play race games as well. I can't believe it's free, but I should keep my mouth shut on that one.<br /><br />Die-hard auto race fans won't like it 'cause it's more arcade action than real world workings but it's great fun. Real world dynamics are present, but crashes don't kill or damage. They do however, slow you down and speed is an important factor. You can also &#34;take out&#34; your competition and they'll squeeze you out as well. Ultimately, speed and skill are key. Don't try for cheats. You'll only cheat yourself. With this game, it's the journey, not the destination.<br /><br />Speaking of, there are 4 environments, beach, volcano, swamp and mountain snow. You get to each through many tunnels, so many in fact, it might be considered the 5th environment. Different cars have different driving characteristics - remember, speed and agility. Bigger is not always better. Drivers don't matter. I stayed with the small headed one's so I could see more raceway.<br /><br />Upgrades are necessary to advance but they're paid for with the coins you win. There's a novel idea! Enhancers are good for 1 race at a time. Except for the &#34;extra life&#34; (when you run out of time), they're generally not worth the investment. They don't stack up, so buy 1 per race and never &#34;restart&#34; a race if you bought some 'cause they don't carry over and you don't get your coins back.<br /><br />Strategy: Go for distance. The coins are important too, but they'll come as a result of staying in the race. I found the tricked out &#34;Rally car&#34; is the best compromise of speed, handling and durability. That doesn't mean the others aren't fun. The achievement goals look too lofty but trust me on this one, as you start trickin' out your cars, they get closer and easier. Driving the max &#34;Lambini&#34; is more like flying too low in a jet.<br /><br />I don't usually gush over a game app, but this one is tops. Now that I've won all the trophies, I'm sorry it's over.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|As usual with Dan Brown, the story is very captivating and informative.  I can't wait to read his next book!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|A movie with a pure classic Robert DeNiro!! If I were a movie actor, this would be my start up gig
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Somehow they were able to harness the spirit and energy of there younger selves. Michael's most definitely able to belt out the high notes. This album showcases his tremendous vocal talent. The harmonies amongst the band are wonderful classic Stryper. Tim and Robert lay down a great heavy foundation and Oz and Michael rip riffs all throughout the album that bring you back to a better time. I can't say enough except awesome job and thanks!
B008K5T5AI|4.0|I'm a fan of The Culture novels, and apart from a few that verged dangerously close to being too clever for their own good novels set in The Culture universe are very accessible 'science-plausible' books.<br /><br />The Hydrogen Sonata focusses on a field often mentioned in Culture novels but never truly dwelt on or fully explained - subliming.  An entire civilisation is about to effectively disappear and it would appear there are some fairly large chunks of business that need to be concluded.<br /><br />It's horribly sad that this is the last Culture novel that will ever be written, because it's good, really good but the world was never going to reach a point where there were too many Culture novels.<br /><br />Read this if you love the wonderfully expansive Universal Banks created, but only read it once you've read the rest of the series; save it as a melancholy treat.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such an addicive experience! Its great to compete against friends on this game. The simplicity of the game is what gets you and the difficulty in problem solving the puzzle is what challenges you to keep trying!
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|This was an awesome show. This season was so good I had to watch it again. The mystery of the island really does captivate.
B00B4MAZRQ|4.0|Of course Nick is great. But I work at Amoeba, and I can't believe they used a roasted, beat-to-s*** cover with our 'Clearance' dept. price sticker and ungodly ring-war for the cover, and a blurry one, too!!!!  Is this some trendy, hipster-targeted design concept? BIG thumbs-down, mates.
B007I6FAPY|5.0|An enjoyable first version of this movie with a good cast and an interesting ending and would be enjoyed by anyone who sees it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another book about Afganstan but not the same story. Also this story could have begun in any underdeveloped country in turmoil. That is why I liked this book. At times it seemed like I was reading several separate stories but in time the reader sees how they intertwine. I recommended this book for my book club.
B00EV6T6DQ|4.0|The story is good but not enough different things going on.  I'm not crazy about the cartoon format.  I'd rather read in traditional book format, but the graphics were very well done. The book was too short.  Left me wanting more.  To simplified.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This was a nice ending book for this series. I definitely don't know what to read next! If anyone he any ideas let me know.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|Not as funny as I thought it would be.  I lost interest through out the movie.  But was cute and different.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|It's okay, an Alien prequel that answers some questions but the &#34;evil entity that wants to bring it back to earth&#34; gets tired.
0140157352|5.0|Item as described, reasonable price, shipped in a timely fashion. A classic text, useful tips and examples. A little verbose in places but overall a solid book.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Well acted, good sound track, nice mix of drama & humor. Denzel is one of those actors, he's entertaining in everything he does.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I kept questioning where this simply written book would be found in a library and concluded that it would be the young adult section. Using old photographs as inspiration was clever, but the storyline is choppy and repetitive and lacks depth.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works and it is easy to set for multiple times.  Easy to snooze and turn off.  I would recommend it.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|By playing this game<br /> it has help me relax and free some of the stress that goes on during the day.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|Did not like at all. Worst of Miley yet. Have loved all of her other music, but this was different. Should have known when I saw the parental warning on cover.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book had the right amount of romance, comedy, and suspense! I Can't wait to read the House of Hades!!
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|My cousins and nephew loves to play with it.  Thank goodness I had some coins to redeem for it. :)
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|We absolutely love this show. It is something we can watch with our grandchildren and everyone enjoys it. We love the characters, the story lines and the humor! Absolutely Brilliant !
B00499NHLC|5.0|I've read the books and seen the Downey/Law movies. Love those too. I've also been watching Elementary, and that show isn't half as good as this one. This is the show you can't miss out on if you are a Holmes fan.<br /><br />On an unrelated note... The opening sequence to this show is remarkably similar to the beginning of Epitaphios. I tried to see if they were done by the same people, but I can't find that they were.
B005OP2928|5.0|Great family show that is hilarious and enjoyable to watch. I would reccommend this show to anyone, young or old!
B006T5FDLG|4.0|These songs are solid, though I wouldn't have guessed they were from the Death Magnetic sessions since they have more of the Metallica 90's hard rock vibe despite the bloated song lengths and plenty of riffs it's not too heavy at times.  I do like these songs and for the $5 you simply can't do much better.  Metallica are still better then 90% of the stuff they play on supposed \\"Rock\\" radio stations.  At 29-minutes this is almost as long as some death/grind/punk bands CD's.  The only weak track is Just A Bullet Away, it almost kept me from scoring this a 4 star record.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|What a great show!  It was recommended by a friend and now I know why. Good quality program...why can't Hollywood give us this quality?
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Plenty of choices and styles to choose from.  Races and classes are all unique n their own way.  A great game.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|My son and I loved the movie and are glad to add it to our library.  If you haven't seen the movie it is a great one.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm definitely a fan of fiction books and haven't made the time to read in awhile. This definitely got me back in the game
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Even though it was about a child; he was ever so precocious & a teen still the same.  It kept my attention very well.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Out of all of John Grisham' s books, \\"A Time to Kill\\" has always been my favorite.  It still is.  This story was equally as riveting, but 2 things kept it from overtaking A Time to Kill.  The ending, while stunning, was not quite as astonishing and the beginning made me quite cranky!  Let me explain.  While I loved the book, the movie made from the book, A Time to Kill is my favorite.  I watch it every time it comes on, regardless of how many times.  The dog, Max, did NOT die in the fire when the KKK burned down Jake's house!  And it wasn't a small part in the movie.  It's what makes Jake continue with the trial of Carl Lee Hailey!  Max being alive after everything else was destroyed makes him go on!  Very disappointing.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I found the plot believable since I personally know a pilot who lost his license because he tested positive for drugs.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin certainly does her research!  Even tho we know the end of the story, this book gives a better understanding of the whys and hows.  Politics as usual.
B00AH34AUQ|2.0|&#34;Brutal Love&#34; is the real honorary Foxboro Hot Tubs track. It's dripping with Lieber & Stoller and latter day Elvis. The slutty Vegas by N'Orleans horns give it even more weight and gravitas. I love it.<br /><br />From there the album decides it's time to be epic and fill the stadiums. &#34;Missing You&#34; is a classic downstroke rocker. and followed by 8th Avenue Serenade, a song that reminds me a lot of what Armstrong was trying to do on Warning, push forward, stay true to the band's roots (it hints at Insomniac) but moves along with assuredness, echoing some of the songs on American Idiot. It would have fit on either of those albums.<br /><br />It's &#34;Drama Queen&#34; that is this album's trainwreck. &#34;Everyone's drama queen is old enough to bleed now&#34;. It's sort of nauseating. And amateurish.<br /><br />Fortunately, we get back to early era stylings with the 1-2 punch of &#34;X-Kid&#34; and &#34;Sex, Drugs & Violence&#34;, catchy, angry, hooky and deserving.<br /><br />Surely the weirdest track on the album is &#34;Dirty Rotten Bastards&#34;. Stealing from The Marines Hymn, as well as other familiar pieces, it's reworked into the &#34;Jesus of Suburbia&#34; template. A mini-opera. I like it. But it's weird, man.<br /><br />I'd've been happy if the album found a way to end after &#34;99 Revolutions&#34;, but I guess somewhere, someone wants a Green Day Ballad. I think that's always been satisfied by the heartbreaking ode to his father &#34;Wake me When September Ends&#34;. &#34;The Forgotten&#34; is just that. Forgettable.<br /><br />Tre is the album they didn't need to put out. It's a collection of leftovers. In fact I think there's a dynamite 15-17 track record in this three album set. Stick to that.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is what I needed on my tablet and it wasn't large and distracting like some apps . It gives me the information I want without a lot of ads.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|This movie is a classic! I loved it as a child and it's great to revisit my childhood from time to time, that's why I purchased this movie. I made sure I let my son experience some of my childhood joys, he loves it too!
0143113100|3.0|I liked this content and stories in this book.  I only gave it three stars because it was a little long and a little repetitive in some places.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Oh my gosh! My son loves this movie and so do I. It's one of his favorites! He's 12 and he can watch it over and over. It's  a movie that has great values and we can learn a thing or two from it.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|My 8 year old and 4 year old sons loved this movie.  Warning: I let my kids watch stuff than other parents often tell me is too scary for their kids.  So maybe a recommendation would be for boys 10 and over.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|this is fun and like stuff and dtuu and stuff and things and stuff dog dogndog fool boo boo nod and self
B0030MTQNW|4.0|Great cast and production, but why subject this cast to playing out the dud that was Operation Market Garden?  Sure would have been nice to see this cast and the vintage American armour in a D-Day or Battle of the Bulge plot.  All the same, can't complain - this was a classic.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such a tremendous story...<br />I haven't and won't see the movie...  this story will forever remain untouched in my mind
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Eminem killed it. Best songs are rap god, love game, and the monster. He is a lyrical genius. Album of the year!!!!
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Kakuro is an interesting alternative to Sudoku but does actually involve math (specifically addition) as well as number placement. This app has a wide variety of skill levels and puzzle configurations as well as a help feature that provides hints over time if desired.
B004R1Q2EG|5.0|This is a longish book but it is well worth reading from cover to cover, and indeed careful study and rereading or particular chapters is worth the effort and time. What is striking is that Kahneman is reporting on a lifetime of original research (much of it carried out in conjunction with his deceased colleague Amos Tversky). The impact of K's scholarship cannot be overestimated.<br /><br />Every thinking person should read this book. The non-thinking people should too - it just won't do them any good!
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Just fell into Greys this year. I am hooked!  I feel like they are part of my group. I'm so glad I can just watch the next episode instead of waiting a week.  That's one benefit of no tv.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I love these reusable sticker pages! My kids will play with these for hours. The backgrounds are printed on a thick coated card stock, and the stickers a some kind of thin plastic. Each scene comes with several stickers to use. I originally purchased these for a long car trip, but they were a little difficult for my kids to use in the car because they are so big. The stickers also come on a page that is separate from the background page, so they do take up a lot of space. I found it easier to u them if you detach all of the pages from the book, and then clip or pin the background page and the sticker page together. These have lasted for a long time, and when I get them out my kids will play with them for hours! They're great for any time you need to keep the kids quiet for any long periods of time, they also clean up well using a baby wipe. I will be buying more of these in the future.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|EAsy to use.  It synchs all my books from device to device so I can switch them up and still continue where I left off in a book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The best way to communicate is through language. If a couple is not speaking the same language a new relationship will have a very difficult time. This book lays out how we can see each others  and maybe even learn our own love language. It is never to late to start over and heal a marriage ...this is a helpful tool to begin that journey of peace. I have been through the wreckage of divorce and I can tell you now ...saving a marriage is a better option.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|A classic album with some forgotten favorites. Can not believe I had forgotten so much of this album yet it all came rushing back.
B00G32OER4|5.0|One of the scariest paranormal movies I have seen in a long time.  Any movie starring Patrick Wilson has been worth viewing, I suggest this film for sure.
B004LPLU4K|4.0|What a lovely movie!  I wasn't sure my 4 yread old would be into it, since it's not a cartoon/animated movie.  But she loved it.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I've heard others say that the over the top CGI makes the movie seem unrealistic and hard to watch, but I think it emphasizes the theme of dreaming and Gatsby's dream of his perfect life with Daisy. Luhrmann does a quality job of embodying the spirit of Fitzgerald's novel without seeming like he copied the text word for word -- when there are direct quotes, it is a special perk for those viewers who know and love the original material.<br /><br />Luhrmann's choice of music and score is unconventional but impressive. Even with multiple diverse genres on the soundtrack, the album is centered around the themes of Gatsby and so the collection of songs somehow works and flows together. The only drawback of the stellar soundtrack is that, having listened many times to the songs, the lyrics became a distraction while they were played in the background of the movie itself.<br /><br />Leo and Carey Mulligan (and the rest of the cast, for that matter) brought their A-game for this movie. All of them succeeded at making me hate every character plus have a strange sadness towards Gatsby - key emotions that Fitzgerald seemed to desire for his readers to have after finishing the book.<br /><br />All in all, a fun and exciting rendition that gives life and and breath to its namesake.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|If you are a person of this digital world, this book will hit frighteningly but refreshingly close to home. A poignant moment in modern fiction.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|One of the best romance series I've every read.  Can't wait until the 4th book comes out.  It's contempory romance that I really enjoyed and have told my friends to read also.
B008Y7J91M|5.0|wonderful storytelling!  The clothes, scenery and language may change over time, but personalities and human foibles remain the same.  Loads of fun to watch and enjoy
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|What a great CD!  Jack Johnson just keeps getting better. I listened to it non stop over and over for the first week I had it.
B006RXQ800|5.0|great movie, great acting. historically accurate with amazing costumes, music and effects. got me interested in learning more about the Irish Immigration and the Irish diaspora.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|brilliant how they made this game. Having to make split second decisions makes it feel... very real? like the &#34;which way&#34; books when i was younger... great job.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|EDIT (ORIGINAL REVIEW BENEATH)<br /><br />I posted up pictures along with the updated review. I bought one controller and I was highly disappointed that I can't use it wirelessly. It only works when it is plugged in which defeats its own purpose. Because of my original bad review, Kiddie World contacted me and offered to send another controller at no cost and required no returns at their own expense. In turn I offered to change my review and post up pictures if the controller they sent was functional.<br /><br />The courtesy controller did not function wirelessly. The two controllers are useless without being plugged in. Thank you Kiddie World for the courtesy controller but I cannot change my review if the product advertised does not live up to its purpose.<br /><br />_______________________________________________________<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br /><br />I love the layout of the xbox's controller my last one broke so I went in a quest to find a new one.  I saw this controller and I was in love already. The day it came I was just disappointed all while playing with it.  I charged it for hours,  it wouldn't function wirelessly which defeats its own purpose.  The toggles were very glitch they either move on their own or they are very late with the physical input. So the reciever is probably acting up too<br /><br />I really liked this controller at first glance until I used it. If mine wasn't as defective I think I would've given a five out of five rating
B00EN6RSXO|4.0|I enjoyed the progression of incidents.  I looked forward to finding out what would happen next.  I would recommend this book.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|A page turner, a wild ride, and a look into the hearts and minds of these two families. Good read
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|It was very exciting to find a book about a female scientist.  The author has such an interesting way of expressing both feelings and the practical day to day life of the main character.  It is a book I will not soon forget.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Easy game..loving to play it .would recommend to anyone that loves playing bingo,without having all the hassel and is easy to understand...
B004OR199G|3.0|Quite informative, but the diet itself have a lot if limitations and should not be taken for granted. No such things mentioned in the book
1401201911|3.0|A very interesting look at what could have happened had Superman landed in Soviet Russia. I do wish the authors had tried to make it seem less &#34;gloom and doom communism is literally the worst thing ever&#34;, because in doing so they ignore the humanity of those who lived there, the versatility, and those alive today who lived it and appreciated it and want it back. It's very easy to take a one-dimensional approach instead of trying for a multi-faceted angle. So, from that angle, this was a failure of late capitalism. But overall the story was intriguing.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I only rated a 3-star due to the fact that I can receive email on my Kindle Fire HD, but I cannot send out mail for some strange reason. And because of this I rated a lower rate. Please fix this issue.
1576875776|5.0|When I heard this story I was very interested. I like V.M's work because I like people pictures. She was great at capturing what Henri Cartier-Bresson called &#34;The Decisive Moment&#34;. She was likely directly influenced by his work.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It would be nice if it works works with VLC player or other outlets.  Otherwise it's very easy to use
039916409X|5.0|Margaret has now rounded out her incredible package of gifts with this wonderful volume. But, in addition, you MUST hear her, see her, experience her genius via her audio/video programs, events, ET AL.  She has amazing healing gifts and shares them freely  In short, she is one of the most intelligent, insightful, spiritually-connected and generous people I have encountered in this crazy world.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|First rate series !!!! Excellent acting  and directing. I hope there will be another season . I hope there will me more seasons.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy match games, especially when they challenge you in different levels.<br />I play this on my tablet.  Would like to see it available as a download to a<br />regular computer as well.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I've become hooked on these games and I think this one is pretty good.  It's got a story to follow and you have to interact with characters to get items.  The HO's change from find a word item to find a pictured item which was different from other games.  So if you're looking for a new spin, try this one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book! I look forward to seeing the film in theaters. It's a very well written story.
B00EMJD6TC|4.0|The only film so far to open up the genre to reflect a world-wide crisis...it's a BIG movie that moves quickly. While not in any way like the book of the same name, it does deliver.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|Damn it's a classic, get it.  It's a mystery of sorts but the charecters really make the movie.  The dialogue is memorable.  Slight, brief nudity, lots and lots of F-bombs. Up there with Big Trouble in Little China.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I don't typically refer to a book as beautiful but I cannot think of a better description. Me Before You is a book that makes you late for work because you can't put it down. It makes you question your own morals and what you would do in these characters circumstance.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|Because once I got past the style of the book, a compendium of letters I did get swept  away in this doomed couple's life.<br />I found it hard to believe that a man who loves his wife could be so absolutely blind to what was going on under his own roof, however I do know it is possible and that is what made it so horrifying.
1933308087|5.0|A great reference book. Many useful ideas and the most comprehensive pattern book I have seen.<br /> Excellent condition and service.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Do you like Dr. Who? If you answered &#34;Yes&#34; you will like this season.  Matt Smith brings a flexible body and a sense of humor to the character.  Karen Gillan (companion Amy Pond) gives her character a free-spirited but vulnerable sensibility. The companion this season has an interesting back story: she meets the Doctor as a young girl (Caitlin Blackwood, Gillan's real-life cousin), a orphan who needs both company and help with a paranormal crack in her bedroom wall.  The Doctor is still regenerating and is having trouble with the new Tardis so he pops away for a period of a few minutes for the time lord but twelve years for poor Amy.  All this time she's waited for the &#34;raggedy doctor&#34; to return, but her life has moved on; she has a job and a fiance, Rory. She's set to be married the next morning when the Doctor pops back into her life.  Will she leave Rory to travel in time and space? You know the answer, partially. Of course she sets out, but Rory plays an increasingly important role in this season and the next.  It's a lot of good Dr. Who fun filled with surprises, aliens, and . . .  Dr. Song!  Not to be missed --
B00902AKK4|5.0|I wanted to leave a review for this game to alleviate some of the negative reviews. I picked this up as the FAOTD and would have been happy to pay $2 for it. I have played this game on my Samsung Galaxy S3 and my Kindle Fire HD. I have only come across one bug on either device: the ladybug you're playing as! This is a very original game, the graphics are nice, it's easy to learn but hard to put down! This developer needs to come out with more games!! Give it a try...It's free!!!
B0058WFO06|5.0|In \\"Grace for Drowning,\\" Steve Wilson makes a full and final departure from anything related to Porcupine Tree that may have spilled over into \\"Insurgentes,\\" his initial foray into solo project work. Whereas Insurgentes leaned heavily on the 1990s shoegaze movement for about half the record, Wilson did begin to break the fetters of Porcupine Tree's confining self-definition of \\"prog\\" (in my opinion, PT became more of a \\"progressive pop-rock\\" band) with the introduction of curious rhythms, peculiar soundstages, and atypical instruments (even what sounds like a jack-in-the-box at one point). Still, there was plenty of Porcupine Tree within \\"Insurgentes,\\" even to the extent of calling upon Gavin Harrison to provide much of the album's percussion. With GfD, we see Wilson bid adieu to the formula that gave him worldwide success and finally step over to the world where he writes, produces, and executes flawlessly: the world of classic, 1970s-era progressive rock.<br /><br />That's not to say that GfD is some sort of 70s prog clone. It definitely draws upon those influences, but never imitates them. You'll hear mellotrons, flutes, pianos, saxophones, synthesizers, etc. yet never abandoning a rock-driven approach with guitar/drum songwriting as the platform. Portions of the album remind me of King Crimson in places, Yes in others, and something altogether new as well.<br /><br />The mood swings on GfD are welcome and not gratuitous. The eponymous opening track (featuring Dream Theater's Jordan Rudess on piano) is a soft, mellow introductory piece, but I wouldn't say it \\"sets the stage\\" for the rest of the album. The instrumental \\"Sectarian,\\" the second track, is really where the album begins to shine and let the listener know what is coming up next. Sectarian has it all - fast tempos, slower tempos, mellotron meandering, some flute work, sharp spikes in volume and energy, and instrumental virtuosity. SW's choice in lineup shines throughout the entire album, and Sectarian shows this. From there, Steven felt obliged to give us what is probably the pinnacle of GfD (a double-LP) in the form of \\"Deform to Form a Star.\\" Debates about personal opinion are typically fruitless, but if I had any input, I would rank this track among Wilson's best. The melody is unforgettable, the harmony is tight, and its message is one of melancholy. From there, we hear \\"No Part of Me,\\" which represents some great lyrical effort on Wilson's part. The next track, \\"Postcard,\\" is the only track on this album which feels out of place to me. It is a pretty song, perhaps intended as a tribute of sorts to Wilson's recently deceased father, but doesn't quite jive with an album otherwise consumed with melancholy, madness, obsession, or the macabre. \\"Remainder the Black Dog\\" is one of SW's more haunting melodies, and this song stretches itself out quite well, using once again classic prog changes and transitions to entice the listener.<br /><br />The second disc of GfD begins much like the first disc: a brief instrumental track called \\"Belle de Jour.\\" From there we get an insight into Wilson's obsession with record collecting in the song \\"Index.\\" At first, Index sounded too mechanical for me (relying heavily on the keyboards), but with time, and especially with seeing the live version from the \\"Get All You Deserve\\" DVD, I have come to enjoy this track more than I ever thought I would (I'm also a collector of various things). \\"Track One\\" is another filler song that has its place in the album, but isn't up to snuff with the rest. This brings us to my personal favorite on GfD: \\"Raider II.\\" This tune has it all, and is one of Wilson's most ambitious. The song, I believe, is centered on a serial killer, a theme he explored briefly with Porcupine Tree's \\"In Absentia.\\" With Raider II, we get a moribund chord progression which evolves into a screaming fast instrumental jazzfest, and then back down into a dreamy escape. The track is 23 minutes; something Wilson has no compunctiondoing (once he attempted to break the world record for the longest single in the form of \\"Voyage 34,\\" which clocks in around the half hour mark). I'm not saying long tracks are great because they're long, but I have learned through the years that when Wilson takes his time to develop a longer song, it almost always pays off. Raider II isn't something you can turn on while driving the car or as background music for a garden party; it's one of those songs where the listener needs to follow along and pay attention. I get similar feelings when listening to mid-career Pink Floyd or early King Crimson albums. And this is natural given that Wilson has admitted repeatedly throughout his career that these early progressive rockers are a huge influence for his own contributions. The album ends with a pretty tune, \\"Like Dust I Have Cleared from My Eye,\\" which stands out well as a final track given that it requires about two minutes to fade out completely.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm always judging the albums I buy not only for the artist's intent, but also those who helped produce the record. Wilson surrounded himself with gifted musicians for this project, and he is not afraid at all to let them step forward and shine when the time is right. The balance is there. Also, from the post-production standpoint, it doesn't get any finer than Grace for Drowning. Since the early 1990s, CDs have been mastered with increasing loudness levels to the point of corrupting and distorting the signal when it is played back. We expected some hiss and distortion from our old cassette tapes, and over time, vinyl records tended to lose their luster as the groove wore out or the vinyl became scratched, but the CD is digital and the sound quality they CAN produce rivals these other formats. The problem is called \\"the loudness war,\\" and very few artists within this genre are aware of it. Wilson is a refreshing exception. He even dedicated a portion of his motion picture, also called \\"Insurgentes,\\" to discussing it (along with digital formats in general). Grace for Drowning was hardly mastered at all, and it sounds exquisite. The louder portions of the album stand out (as they should), and the quieter portions of the album are not amplified, requiring the listener to pay attention. There is no digital distortion on the album as a whole due to loudness, and it is open and dynamic. I would even confess that the sound of this CD is crisper than its successor, \\"The Raven that Refused to Sing\\" (although the latter is likewise a post-production cornucopia of dynamic range). Grace for Drowning sets the standard for how post-production mastering should sound, both in its stereo and 5.1 surround formats.<br /><br />All in all, Grace for Drowning should be in regular rotation for any progressive rock enthusiast.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is an interesting game that leads you on goals to advance levels.  Like most games like this we want to advance quickly.  Be patient and enjoy the free game.  It's colorful and well made.  I did try to buy sand dollars and never received them.  No response from the game support (disney).  I should have checked other reviews that mentioned this occurrence.  I assumed they would be delivered like teamlava games.  Be cautious but enjoy the game. I am not that far along but this game  has great potential.
0425252868|4.0|Very well written and researched. A very easy read because you are pulled through it. So rare to find a story like this that really humanizes war.
B0034G4OWM|4.0|We like this movie alot even though we are not a fan of all of Brendand Fraser's movies.  Since we enjoy wanted to have the dvd.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|Awesome movie!<br />Even though there are a few curse words, it's a story about integrity in the face of adversity, forgiveness in the face of unfaithfulness, and strength and courage when it seems like there is no hope. I have watched it again and again.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Simply put, this album ROCKS!  No messing around this go around.  Michael Sweet, Oz Fox, Robert Sweet, and Tim Gaines bring you back to 1986 all over again, but this is To Hell With The Devil, on Red Bull. (wings reference)  From beginning to end, you get song after song of solid Rock n Roll.  Saved by Love...oh man!  I liked the Jesus is Just alright cover, but it could have been left off, as it seemed to be a little out of place.  Sticks and Stones is so catchy.  Sympathy is music genius.  Nothing bad to say here.  Great music, great message, just blown away all over again with Stryper.  12 songs too.  What an eye-catching cover.  As I said, Best STRYPER ever!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This spider I love. Even when I lose its no big deal. Its a good game to play if you are looking for a game to play
B00FR0M5G0|5.0|Amazing! If you are a music lover and enjoy hearing what's going on in the studio, you will get a kick out of the bonus discs. You get to hear Van the Man build a lot of these tracks from drums and guitar up to their final versions. And the &#34;I've Been Working Early Versions&#34; are great jam sessions.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|bingo game very additive. I didn't like the feeling of the game. If you like to gamble then go for it. It made me feel like I lost control of my life.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|excellent writing, directing and story pacing. Watching these people deal with what is an impossible situation is riveting. The metamorphosis of characters throughout the 4 seasons is great, for instance, Carol this season. She is so far from who she was in season 1, the frightened battered wife to present. How could this situation not drastically change a person?
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great show. I watched all the past 4 seasons. I like the romance!!!! Started watching the new season and it is good.
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|Very basic note app.  I don't  know if this app has all the features some people  might need, but if you just need something to take quick simple notes , it's perfect.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|I will start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Max Brooks' two \\"Zombie\\" books... \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" and the far better companion-piece, \\"World War Z.\\"  Brooks created an entire world, an entire \\"mechanism,\\" and entire natural history...<br /><br />... and this movie has almost nothing whatsoever to do with Brooks' books.  Let's just be up-front about that.  I CANNOT UNDERSTAND why someone would choose to \\"adapt a book\\" and then produce a product with only one name (and two quotes from that character) re-used (and in different context), totally change the nature of the threat, totally change the nature of the narrative... WHY?<br /><br />It's beyond me.  It really is.<br /><br />That said...  as a \\"zombie movie\\" this film isn't bad.  It's not GREAT, either, but it's not BAD.  The biggest problems I have with this movie are with how utterly ludicrous certain elements of it really are.<br /><br />Brooks created a disease... including the cause of that disease, a virus called \\"Solanum\\" which has been present on Earth since the beginnings of the human race, but which (until the advent of modern high-speed transportation) has always resulted in small, localized outbreaks, never in a world-wide collapse.  Key to this is that the reanimated dead are, at most, SIMPLY HUMAN.  They are not, in any way, SUPERHUMAN.  If the human body cannot do something when alive, it cannot do it when dead and reanimated, either.  And in many cases, especially as the body breaks down, these abilities become less... and NEVER become more.<br /><br />While Brooks' zombies never tire, exactly, they also never heal...  which means that muscle strength decreases, often dramatically, over time.<br /><br />They decompose slowly, because the virus (Solanum) is deadly to ALL LIVING THINGS, including bacteria and insects, and thus most living things instinctively flee from an infection, or are killed immediately if they don't flee and come into contact with it (the partial exception being humans, which are \\"killed and then reanimated\\" rather than merely killed.)<br /><br />But the zombies in this film are \\"SUPER-ZOMBIES!!!!\\"  (Duh-duh-DAAAAAH!!!)  They can do things no human body could do, even at its prime.  They can burst through plate glass which would be physically impossible for a living human to break.  They can climb up walls which no number of living humans could climb up.  A charging group of them can \\"churn\\" over a bus, flipping it in the process.  They can run and leap far, far faster than any mortal human can.<br /><br />Heck, I'm surprised that none of them were able to FLY in this film!<br /><br />Further, Brooks' zombies die in a process which is pretty well-established, and which makes a certain degree of sense.  From initial contact to death is usually around 24 hours, with reanimation usually happening at some point before three more hours pass in most cases.  You can imagine Solanum reproducing within the body at that sort of rate... it requires no MAGIC to happen.  But there is no microorganism ever seen, or even IMAGINED, which can reproduce at the rate seen in this film.  From twenty-four-plus hours, we now see \\"twelve seconds\\" to a fully transformed zombie.<br /><br />So... if you hope to be able to \\"willfully suspend your disbelief\\" while watching this film...  and if you have the slightest grasp of biology at any level...  you'll be unable to do so, PERIOD.<br /><br />Further, they came up with a \\"Deux Ex Machina\\" solution which was made necessary by the \\"SUPERZOMBIE\\" nature of the reanimated in this film...  which is just ludicrous and, again, totally inconsistent with real biology at any possible level.<br /><br />SO...  there you go.<br /><br />But on the POSITIVE SIDE... you have good characterizations, a reasonable amount of fairly interesting storytelling, and some real chills and thrills along the way.<br /><br />Yes, it's predictable.  Yes, it's trite at times.  And yes, it relies far, far too much on CGI-created visual spectacle and not enough on solid storytelling principles.  And it's one of the most scientifically laughable movies ever made in the \\"zombie\\" genre (and that's saying something, isn't it!)<br /><br />But... if you can put those aside, it's still a movie which you'll probably enjoy, just because you really do come to care about who these people are and what happens to them (unlike most zombie flicks ever made).<br /><br />I do not encourage anyone to take this seriously...  but if you want some brainless, light entertainment, it's not a bad choice.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're the type who enjoys deep, multi-layered storytelling (not about \\"I woke up and was chased by zombies all day\\" but rather \\"what happens to human society when pushed beyond the breaking point?\\") you should pick up Brooks' book(s).  Or even better, get the unabridged audio book version (the abridged versions are nice, too, but to get the full story, and see how it all relates, you really want the unabridged versions).<br /><br />The audiobooks are really remarkable, in fact, for having a full cast presentation.  Realize, the book is written from the standpoint of a journalist recording interviews with survivors of the zombie war... aka \\"World War Z.\\"  It's done in that tone... very much like you'd hear if the news did interviews with 9/11 survivors today.  The stories are arranged to tell the story of the whole war, both in chronological terms and also in \\"conceptual terms\\" (with sections describing their purpose, like one entitled \\"Warning Signs\\" and another entitled \\"Blame\\").  Each story is told in \\"first person\\" to the interviewer...  but the characters, and the full cast of big-name actors playing them, is widely varied, and no two stories are similar, really.<br /><br />You can enjoy this film, for what it is... but just realize, it's unrelated to the book, and the book is FAR, FAR more worthy of your time.
1449305172|5.0|I recommend it to all my friends who have a startup idea. It gives them actionable steps for each phase of validating their idea. It takes a lot of the guess work out of what is the next step, which the uncertainty is often one of the biggest road blocks in moving forward.

006202406X|2.0|Roth's third book in the Divurgent trilogy is not worth reading.  The first two books -- Divurgent and Insurgent -- are great YA reads, but Allegiant lacks the inspiration of the first two.  It is uncompelling and seems to be hastily thought out and put together.  Don't waste your time.
B000067J1Q|3.0|great classic movie,i love it, however the dvd was scratched, wtf!<br /><br />about 2/3rds thru the movie, it freezes, you have to fast forward thru a particular scene or it will freeze.

B007SSEZNA|5.0|Great actors! Beautifully done. Love the original with Gweneth Paltrow.  This one is worth watching. I hope to see the rest of the series!
0670024856|3.0|Disappointing despite great subject and beginning.  Very much enjoyed first half or so of book, fascinating subject.  But why do authors think that readers like to wallow in sexual dysfunctions of protagonists? Last half of book dealt far too much with the characters' rather boring and dysfunctional sex lives or lack thereof.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I have to admit - I heard all the hype of Dr. Who and upon watchign the first episode couldn't really understand it. But, once the show got rolling and a few episodes were under my belt, I started to feel the appeal and become captivated. I am now partially through the second season and enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is so great to use, I prefer this one over the one on my computer, it is so addicting!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Season 4 has a little better pace to it than the previous one. There are a lot of great storylines moving and the death and destruction from various angles - some unexpected - make this another solid go-around.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Great film!  I love the musical score and it is a story of hope and dream.  We see happiness in our children or younger siblings.  Set in a time of early 1900's.

B0017SWPXY|4.0|Inspirational when you need that little bit of hope to get you through the trouble spots in your life.  I liked how the book was written from the dog's point of view and how so many metaphors could be pulled from car racing and linked to life in general.  Great easy vacation read!

B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I LIKE everything that Paul McCartney sings/performs, but I LOVE this CD because it is more like his older songs --- the ones that John Lennon called &#34;grandma music&#34;. I don't know anything about music, except I know what I like.  This &#34;New&#34; CD is more gentle and less rock-n-roll, it is easy on the ears.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Fun read as Grisham always is but is a bit like reading a laundry list.... None the less still fun.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|This actually turned out better than I expected, but with only five stars to choose from, I had to go with four. It is actually closer to 3.75 as a rating goes, mostly because of the pacing. The story doesn't move particularly fast, but the performances are pretty good. Like the original Wizard of Oz, the story starts out on the small screen and monochrome. Then, once Oz landed in the land of Oz, it expanded out and became very colorful.<br /><br />However, that's a tired mechanism and really didn't add to the enjoyment factor. There wasn't any kind of wow factor to the film, so it barely (rounded up) made it to four stars.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This was really nice at first then wouldn't allow me to open it.  Installed and re installed app and it still does it.  After checking other reviews and emailing It looks like this app support ignores problems and doesn't fix them.  To bad I lost a few dollars because at first I thought it was happening because I would accidentally touch the adds in the app so I spent a little and upgraded to the Gold.  Didn't help.  So I wouldn't recommend this at all.

B00CH26TL8|4.0|I started playing when it first came out and I was not good at it so I deleted the app. About a month ago, I was intrigued by the fact that they now had Halloween inspired bubbles so I gave this game another try. I'm much better at it now so I play it more than Candy Crush Saga.
0316201545|5.0|My 9 year old son absolutely loved this book (and he loved the first book too).  He plowed through it in 3 days.  And he's already imagining where book #3 might go, so I hope there are more follow-ons planned!

B000005HFH|4.0|I love Chet Baker! I'm not even a fan of jazz, but Chet is/was the man. Silver Lining is my fave song on the disc. This CD is perfect for anytime of the day. My ONLY knock on this compilation is that it doesn't have &#34;The Route,&#34; one of Chet's best songs. So for that I have to knock it down one star, and also recommend Chet Baker's &#34;Too Cool&#34; compilation as a superior collection since THAT disc includes &#34;The Route.&#34;

B000T433CO|5.0|Love it!  I can't believe I missed this one when it was in theaters.  Jude Law is incredibly good looking and Jack Black actually works really well in his role.  I wasn't sure I'd like him in a romantic comedy but he pulled it off.  Kate Winslet is amazing. Enough said.
B00A2H9PLG|3.0|The writers of this movie had a hardon for the white house. Predictable. At best, it's bad-good. If you like clever movies, this ain't it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The information about the language of flowers  is fascinating. The story is somewhat confusing the way it switches back and forth between the past and present. The traumas that the main character endured at the hands of the foster program was disturbing and is a good demonstration of why foster children have major trust issues for their entire lives.  I thought the ending was rather abrupt and too neatly tied up.  I don't think it would happen that way in real life without lots of therapy.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Despite the fact that the idea for this book smacks of that wondrous movie based on real life 'The Intouchables', I enjoyed it thoroughly. Though it ended neatly resolved with a hugely perfect bow, I found great satisfaction and pleasure from its predictability. Sweet.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|While this is a very fun way to experience Sudoku, the app itself is a problem.  Into the game it tends to start moving slowly and then it freezes up and basically shuts the system down.  I have removed it from my Fire HD for this very reason.  It needs some work.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I still haven't figured this thing out. It's about to get deleted from my Kindle and from my Cloud. Of course it was free so I have no real complaints, but it would be nice if there was something that told me how exactly this is the Key to anything.
1476729085|5.0|Professor Don Tillman is a geneticist who decides he wants to marry but has no marriage prospect available to him. His social ineptitude is extreme and even on a causal date, he is horrendously awkward. So as the great scientist he is, he decides to create a way to find a woman just like himself and live happily ever after. He creates a questionnaire which he regards to be scientifically accurate and will lead to good results. Of course like any good science there is a hypothesis but the answer isn't quite clear until the experiment is finished. In comes a woman named Rosie who displays many of the traits that Tillman finds off-putting and unattractive in people, yet this woman is not unattractive to him. Dating seems out of the question but she has a problem she believes a geneticist could solve, she wants to find her biological father. He decides to help her and finds himself falling in love with a woman who lacks of the traits he desires in a woman or thought he desired.  A really nice love story and very funny too.
0385743564|5.0|Yes, it is written for a young adult audience. But this took me back to the days when I read for adventure, to imagine a world different and more exciting than our own. Sanderson is a strong writer and built a world I hope he lets us play in for a while. It only took me two days to read the book.

B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Little apprehensive over story line at first. Why well just how many movies can one make from a Star Trek TV episode comes to mind. This continuation/remake is actually well done and does not bog you down as so many rehashed story lines do. Highly recommend this movie whether you are a long term trekkie  that has seen all multiple times or a new fan just getting started.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|Love this show! Well written and great character development. Hope the writers keep it up through seasons 6 & 7.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love anything zombie. This apocoliptic experience seems true to what could happen if ever one occurred. The zombies are very true to character and makeup is incredibly detailed. I only wish I could be a zombie in the show.
B00338QENI|5.0|I had to read this book for school. I was concerned that since it was principally about ethics that it would be dry. However, that was not the case. This book put a human touch on research. Being in the medical field currently, it was disturbing to see how barbaric things were even such a short time ago. And the afterward was particularly salient since most everyone has had some type of surgery where tissue has been removed.<br />All in all, this book was quite enjoyable despite some very sad portions, and some of the \\"eww\\" moments.

B00006D295|5.0|I loved loved loved the movie. I probably watched it a dozen times already. I was happy how quickly the delivery came too. I look forward to checking out the extras!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very interesting and very different then the movie. The book has more detail and has humour!! I love Katniss and Peers and I also love Katniss and Gale but I have to say I'm team Peeta!!!!!!! LOVE THIS BOOK CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE !!!!
B00G32TD98|4.0|If you're looking for one of the scariest movies of all time, this would be in the top 5.  Hateful ghosts and exorcism combined, now that's a total scare.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I really enjoy this app, and so what there is in APP purchasing...the free packs have lots of puzzles!!! Overall, five star app!!!
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|Even though I already have all the movies, this is a great way to have them all together.  And I like that they came with a digital copy code so they are always available on my computer.  The extras are great, I'm not even half through them yet. Don't care about the red carpet interviews, we have all seen them before but still others are a bonus.  Would recommend if you are truly a fan.
B0055D3EOG|5.0|This movie is sooo scary, me and my friends where screaming our heads off during this movie! U will love it.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I don't typically review music, but I felt I needed to for this album. I was listening to Eminem's first three albums when they came out. I loved the music for its tenacity, lyricism, edginess, and theatrics. Like most fans from that era, I was disappointed with his fourth album. In fact, all the recent albums leading up to this one have been forgettable to me. He still had a few good tracks in that time frame, but they were few and far between. Seeing people on the net say how he \\"was back\\" always seemed unwarranted. This album makes me think he is relevant, still. I love the nostalgia of returning characters and story arcs, but don't take this to mean you need to be some fanboy/girl to enjoy the songs. He is lyrically engaging, the beats are mostly excellent, and the subject matter runs from humorous to serious.<br /><br />The song \\"Headlights\\" about his mom really struck me as a particularly powerful song, considering the music she previously inspired. The opening track \\"Bad Guy\\" is amazing on so many levels, particularly for fans. \\"Rap God\\" is a no holds bar lyrical masterpiece, where Eminem demonstrates every single thing that made him great. \\"Love Game\\" is another awesome song where both Eminem and Kendrick Lamar kill it. \\"Stronger Than I Was\\" is another emotional compelling song, that shows how Eminem has matured. \\"So Far...\\" is essentially an homage to Detroit. There are other great songs, but I am just pulling titles from memory right now.<br /><br />For skeptics, like myself, let me assure this an enjoyable album, with a wide range of enjoyable songs. For people looking for him to engage them like he use to, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I have to add that Dr. Dre does not make any appearance in lyrics or beats, which is pretty lame. Despite that, I see this album as his best work in a long time.
B00471TLZS|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to a lot of people. Lets just say it was kind of cheesy there are things that could of made it better
B00902AKK4|4.0|This app is overall very original and has a nice storyline.  There are a few issues but overall it deserves at least 3½ stars.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Nice Storyline<br />+ Original<br />+ No IAPs<br />+ Few Permissions<br />+ Many Levels<br />+ HD<br />+ Free (Today)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Frustrating<br />- Occasionally Glitches<br />- Screen Sometimes Freezes<br /><br />Bottom Line: A nice little app.  A great puzzler with a nice storyline.  There are a few issues, but definitely worth a try since it is a FAOTD.
B00DVPN0W6|5.0|Amos is a very refreshing singer, songwriter, musician, who sounds as good solo or with his band. A rarity in the days of instant exposure via internet for a lot of not so talented people hanging around the music scene taking up space.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Great! Simple, fun, and my five year old loves it. I highly recommend it. Just follow the lessons and you will be speaking spanish before you know it.
B009MF56GC|5.0|great cast-great movies--I love the movies with the combo of so many action stars-it allows for great humor and little asides that would not be possible among a lesser known cast--I hope they'll be back--sorry Arnold
0440246318|2.0|The novel starts with hitchiker Reacher stumbling into a kidnapping.  The book then becomes overly convoluted and ends with some foreign terrorists and terrorist bankers who pretend to have nuclear waste but don't really.  Sounds kind of stupid-because it is.  The first third of the book had great potential; then the story just up and died.
B003QTNFHW|5.0|My children wanted to see this but I was skeptical. I'm not an Alice in Wonderland fan (no stones please). I never cared for the original book or the first movie at all. I watched this with my children though and I have to say, I actually enjoyed it much more than the original. This version just made so much more &#34;sense&#34; to me (as much sense as a nonsensical story can make). I can see why some who loved the original wouldn't like this version - it would be like taking a favorite song from your teen years and having someone re-make it. It's not the song you have so many fond memories attached to.  But since I had no prior attachments, I love this version!  I love Johnny Depp's portrayal - even if it was a bit creepy, it was more human and sensitive, even a bit romantic. I love all the characters more in this version!  I have a feeling we'll be watching this one again and again.
044024367X|1.0|If this had been the first Reacher novel I had read, I would not have read a second one.  Super soldier Reacher, who only left the military because he was downsized as part of the &#34;peace dividend&#34; following the fall of the Soviet Union(after all, said Bill Clinton, &#34;we won't need a big military anymore&#34;) is sure anti-military in this novel.<br />He finds a small town with a secret.  OK, this has potential.  Then, we find out the secrets.  The first is that the town is smuggling large numbers of deserting soldiers to Canada.  Was there even one incident of this happening during the Iraq War?<br />Then the second secret is that a recycling plant is recycling destroyed tanks from Iraq because America was losing the war over there(The war was not a problem, the problem was the idea that we were going to be their friends after invading their country and let them do what they wanted.  Then we were surprised when some elements started attacking us.  We didn't let the Germans do whatever they wanted after losing WW II.  They were under a dictator until we invaded.  We told the conquered people our terms then gradually moved to self-rule.  We didn't lose the war; we lost the peace.).<br />Now, the third secret is even dumber.  The town is run by a Christian fundamentalist and everyone in the town are Christian fundamentalists and they are going to try to start a war to bring about Armageddon.  How come Christians always have to get the bad name?  The only ones I've heard that talk this way are the Islamic fundamentalists in Iran who think bringing about a final conflict will result in the return of the 12th Iman and herald the victory of Islam over the rest of the world.<br />This book is just politically correct nonsense clothed in a weak novel.  Don't waste your time.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey's layout and predictability engine is the best. You'll be hard-pressed in finding anything comparable. It's improved my spelling and grammar too.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Writing a review for this is almost a waste of time.  If you know what Game of Thrones is, you'll enjoy the CDs.  If you don't know what Game of Thrones is, you probably live under a rock and have never seen a television.
B000FC2ROU|5.0|I love this book! The narrative is great!<br />The imagination made me laugh and the unexpected turns in the story were very ingeniuos!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book is a little confusing but you soon realize that the narrator is dead!  Great War story, love story, friendship and adventure story!  I can't wait to see the movie even knowing that it won't be half as good as the book!
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Good Si-Fi flick.  Uplifting ending to this movie which moves a bit slower thanI thought.  Good way to spend a rainy night.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Within ten minutes this movie was on the go.  I felt like there was never a dull moment.  Its the usual stuff but with their own little addition of the zombie thing. I liked it and enjoyed every minute watching the movie.
B004IM14RY|1.0|Too slow.  I tried but I never really got into this one so I admit I never finished watching this movie
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|best game ever other than a slow load while starting up other than that its best hunting game ever. thought that it would be stupid after I played deer hunter reloaded
B003K16P3M|3.0|For a first book, it's a valiant effort. There are a few plot twists I didn't expect, and the plot came together fairly nicely.<br /><br />The problem is that while decently written, it's just not that memorable. It's interesting enough for me to not throw it away, but bland enough that I probably won't read it a second time unless I'm really bored or taking a long car trip or something. It just doesn't have the fire to really make me excited about it.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me; it included details that were not very well explained. The Council, for example; they seem to be an interesting idea, but they're never looked at in any depth, which makes them feel hollow.<br /><br />Overall, it's decent for a first book, but not enough to make me want to read the next ones. However, the first Dresden Files book felt much the same way to me, and ultimately that series became amazing, so if it really does improve in the following books, someone please let me know.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|John Scaslzi is a great author who gets the geek culture and runs with it.<br />loved this book a lot.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|If I knew the outcome of this series I don't think I would have ever started them. The first two books were so good, the last one had me in tears...and not in a good way.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Lots of money spent on something not really worth watching.  He blows up what makes him him.  Then there is this mysterious way people are being turned into super human spontaneously exploding people.  and it is there &#34;will&#34; which keeps them stable.  Very dumb.  I will give it that it was better than Iron Man 2.  Worth pirating for a laugh maybe?  I didn't say that.
B004YCKK6Y|3.0|Four Rooms (Tarantino et al., 1995)<br />[originally posted 16May2000]<br /><br />Here's an idea. Get four young, talented directors to do an anthology flick together. It's gotta be a hit! Right?<br /><br />They've been trying since at least the fifties, and it hasn't worked yet. It doesn't work here, either, though there are pieces of this film that shine with the kind of brilliance that makes these four directors as wonderful as they are, when you take them separately.<br /><br />First, there is Allison Anders, and the only thing that needs said about her considerable directorial powers is Gas Food Lodging. And while I have a hard time criticizing any film that bares major portions of Ione Skye's body, once again, we have hard evidence that any film project touched by the hand of Madonna turns to [censored for Amazon consumption], no matter how good it is otherwise.<br /><br />Second is Alexandre Rockwell, whose contribution to this film is by far the strongest. Odd that Rockwell is by far the most unknown of these directors, as well.<br /><br />Next: Robert Rodriguez, fresh off the smash hit Desperado and about to hit it even bigger with From Dusk Till Dawn. And if you liked the twisted humor in those, you'll like the twisted humor in this.<br /><br />Tarantino closes the deal with a joke that could have been set up in a fourth--maybe a fifth--of the time it actually took. The gift for realistic dialogue that made Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction such joys is completely absent here, and only beautifully minimally-acted roles by veteran character actor Paul Calderon and \\"where is she now?\\" actress Jennifer Beals make this segment worth the trouble.<br /><br />Holding this all together is Ted, the Bellhop at the hotel where all four of these stories take place. Ted is played by Tim Roth, who does what he does best--creeps the viewer out by playing a complete slimeball. In this case, however, Roth's sliminess is kept below the surface, and you're always left wondering why he seems like the engineer of these odd situations, even though in every case the directors go to pains to point out that he is, in fact, the innocent bystander of the bunch. Because of this, the \\"segment\\" that actually ends up being the best is the frame that holds the whole mess together, as Ted attempts to quit, phones his boss (Kathy Griffin) and ends up explaining the whole night to the stoned and monosyllabic Margaret (an unrecognizable and wonderful Marisa Tomei) before getting his boss on the phone and threatening to quit--the segue between the Rodriguez and Tarantino episodes.<br /><br />So is it worth renting? Yeah. Not something I'll end up getting a copy of on ebay, but certainly not the worst of the films that made it home this weekend. ** ½g why he seems like the engineer of these odd situations, even though in every case the directors go to pains to point out that he is, in fact, the innocent bystander of the bunch.

B00E8S2KV2|5.0|I have been waiting almost a year to order this item.  The extended edition is brilliant, with so much more!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|First off, This book is not fiction, and is written by a Navy SEAL. So when people are saying things about the writing quality they're just dumb. It's easy to understand, and the language is conversational and actually very entertaining (his tone). The book being entertaining is a whole other story. This book is is an amazing story, it's all true, and if you are the type of person who loves their country (as long as it's America) and supports or is affiliated with the military you will absolutely LOVE this book.  I originally just borrowed this book from a friend to read, then decided it was such an inspiring book that I went out and bought the hard copy as well. Just to have it in my collection. If your thinking about buying this book then your obviously interested in this type of stuff or at least curious about it. Do it. Buy the book. Read the story. You won't regret it. If you do have any regret it'll be the sort of regret you have after you obsess about a tv show on netflix and watch all the episodes in a week and then when it's all over you hate life cause there's no more to watch. That's the only regret you might have after reading this book.<br />The story takes you through an incredible amount of Luttrell's life and his account of what happened. This really is one of the most inspiring books I've ever read, it 100% gave me the chills during some parts and even made me want to tear up (and I'm definitely not a cryer). GREAT book. Probably my favorite story of all time. I read this book about 3 years ago and am still taking the time out of my day to write this review cause that's how great it is. The book (my copy that I let people borrow) has now made its way through my brother, mom, dad, cousin, 3 friends, and now my roommate is reading it literally as I type this. He keeps coming to me with comments like &#34;Holy (blah blah blah) this is crazy did you read the part where...&#34; It's definitely not one of those books you can forget.<br />The only thing Iwill say in caution: it IS graphic. And don't read this book and start disagreeing with his politics. He makes certain remarks about ROE's and other stuff and while I and many people agree, a lot of people don't. This is not a book about politics so don't get hung up by other people talking about what he says about it in his book ITS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. Would you read Harry Potter if Rowling was a democrat and you were a republican? Yes of courses you would. Why? CAUSE ITS NOT A BOOK ABOUT POLITICS. So nobody gives a flying fugalapagus.<br />In the end. Read it. And get the hard copy too not the eBook. Because I guarantee you'll want to read it then tell your friend how awesome it is and make (yes physically force) them to read it too

B007IXWL2C|5.0|For all the obvious reasons....I loved these books. I'm not 14 so I enjoyed the racy nature and the storyline although obviously pretty unrealistic but still entertaining.
B004JMY312|5.0|Just as awesome as when I watched it as a kid! Great singing and costumes. Must see Halloween movie for the family.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book fits into a category like no other. The scenes and the wording are so detailed. There are so many surprises. The only thing that I don't like is that Katniss got sent to the hospital way too many times. If Ms. Collins can do us all a nice favor and make one more book.
B003WUYR6I|1.0|I read this book before and the only difference was this had video that my kindle didn't support. Amazon did not tell me that fact and I ended up paying twice for the same bookk.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen! No boring moments in the entire movie. I would watch it again and again
B000MZHW1S|4.0|It helps that this a very fine movie. At the time, I had a PS3 and an Xbox 360. I claimed I didn't care who won but I secretly wanted HD DVD to win. But, it didn't and now I have a wall full of bluray titles. LOL!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved that fact the author used the grim reaper as this third person in this story teller. Such a terrible time in our history. Hope the movie does the book justice.

B00881VLCE|5.0|Great way to relax.  Love it. It passes the time.  It is also nice that you can select how many pieces you want to start with.
B00G32OER4|4.0|The movie was filmed in a way that old horror moves were, where they take time to build suspense and classic scares. I would recommend it to any horror movie lover.

B00BWQW73E|5.0|Let's face it - most business books suck.  This one is an very pleasant exception.  I'll admit to being a bit of a raving fan of Amazon and I've been buying books (and now everything else) from them since the early days.  This book provides a fascinating insight into how the business started and how Bezos grew it into a giant.  At the beginning the author refers to the narrative fallacy - the tendency to write the story with narrative arc, ignoring the messy reality, mistakes, serendipity and just plain screw ups that happened along the way.  I think the author has managed to avoid this successfully.  And yet, he's written a page-turner.<br /><br />What Bezos has done is no less astonishingly great than what Steve Jobs did at Apple.  We just think the iPhone is sexier.<br /><br />If you're interested in looking into the mind of a great businessman, a great business and the early days of the internet you won't got wrong by reading this book.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I've bought this item quite a while ago and using it almost constantly. My car has nice built-in stereo (Kenwood), which quite surprisingly for year 2007 does only support CD and FM. That is it. No AUX input, no USB, no iPOD. It leaves you nothing but using audio CDs. I have been trying so many cheaper units before and was completely unsatisfied with overall sound and build quality. Until I got this one and tiny USB flash drive that just sticks out of the port.<br />First and foremost sound quality. Of course it is not HiFI or anything you would imagine flawing out of your home theater speakers, but it does the job. I am quite demanding when it comes to headphones and sound system speaker and I can say with confidence that I am completely satisfied with what I can hear in my car. Finding unused FM frequency, tuning your Soudndly into it and I could barely distinguish between normal FM broadcast and this unit. Yes it makes a difference when you compare it to CD audio quality, but at the end of the day I'm not sitting in my car to enjoy classical concerts, that's what opera is for.<br />Display. It is definitely handy to have some. It is even better to have display that actually shows song information and not just frequency as it does on most of the other units. However I would not use it during driving. Of course this is much due to it's location at the very bottom of the dashboard, but still, it it rather small and a bit difficult to read with this colour combination and backlight.<br />Controls. Buttons are stiff and are not prone to false activation. In fact I use these quite a lot on the way even without lookin onto the unit. Once you get used to combinations to change album/folder it is very easy to operate.Remote control is not so useful for me, but sometimes passengers at the back seat do appreciate the feature.<br />Inputs. Having USB, SD Card and AUX inputs this is all that I was missing in my car. Although 95% of the time I listen to music from USB flash drive I occasionally connect my or anyone else's phone via AUX input. I could not spot any significant quality difference between using USB or AUX.<br />In short I would recommend this unit for those who need to upgrade their car audio without actually doing anything to it. No wiring, no third party kits. Also it is quite convenient fit for travel and use in rental cars, allowing you to bring your own music.
1470839776|4.0|Though mostly foreign to me, special forces training, missions and nomenclature have always fascinated me. The long (life-long, even) lead-up and  preparation for this particular mission are a compelling story. Gripping narrative. Good climax.

B00902AKK4|4.0|Watch the video if you haven't already. You can't tell from the screen shots how neat this game's concept is. I haven't played a game quite like this one before, and I'm liking it a lot.<br /><br />I won't go into detail about the gameplay, but I will say that the mechanics are impressive, and the game has an ease of use and polish that you don't see very often these days. The visuals are pleasing and the narration is great.<br /><br />ADDONS: Someone mentioned that this app has OpenFeint, but I didn't find that to be the case. The only concerning addon is Flurry Analytics, which in my opinion isn't as much of a threat as people make it out to be.<br /><br />Permissions are minimal. I have deemed this app to be safe. Enjoy it.

B001LOPYHI|5.0|Great movie from 70s. Really looks at the human condition. Shows the reason we should not clone. Great cast of actors.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|I've been a Queensryche fan since 1988.  This is the best album they've had since Promised Land in 1994.  It has a older (Mindcrime or earlier) metal sound, just bigger and deeper sounding.  Eddie Jackson's bass tone is fantastic on this album.<br /><br />It's sad to think that Geoff Tate is no longer in the band, but his replacement (Todd La Torre) does an excellent job... maybe even better that Tate himself.  I find that hard to say because I've always loved Geoff's singing.  One thing that bothers me is that the new singer really doesn't put his own &#34;stamp&#34; on the music.  He sounds almost like a clone of Tate, which of course fits Queensryche perfectly.<br /><br />Very good album, get it!

006202406X|5.0|When I first purchased this book on my kindle I saw that it had 2-3 star reviews. Despite this I have been waiting for the conclusion of this story and decided not to read any reviews and spoilers and have my own opinion. I really enjoyed this book. I wish that there was more on the love that Tris and Four had for one another but despite this I really felt connected to all of he characters... When I reached the ending it was hard for me to accept that but I made my peace with it. As we all know in life there are not always happy endings, but I really really felt closure and that the series ended well ... Do I wish Tris and Four would have lived happily ever after, of coarse. But I felt such strength and admiration for Four in losing the love of his life and being able to put back the pieces of his broken heart.... I found it to be inspiring and a very good conclusion to the series
B00AALX5SI|4.0|Really good movie... my daughter begged me to take her to see it and I ended up enjoying it right along with her. There were a couple of parts in the song &#34;Peacock&#34; and &#34;I Kissed a<br />Girl&#34; that I felt were a little questionable for younger Katy Perry fans but overall the movie was very entertaining. My daughter and I really enjoyed it.

B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I haven't read a Jack Reacher that I didn't like, and this is no exception.  There is copious detail, which I enjoy, and which allows for clear mental images.  I must admit that I skip over the most vivid of descriptions of violence -- I'd rather not picture that!  But the character, JR, is a loner with a heightened sense of duty, honest, justice.  When he senses that evil will not be punished by societal means (arrest, imprisonment, court system), he dispenses his own punishment, without guilt or remorse.  He &#34;fixes&#34; things, which is what many of us would like to have the freedom to do.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|I was scared more than once. Thankfully it's still possible to make a good scary movie as I haven't seen one in decades.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|My friends and i enjoy it very much everytime we on the phone, some of them they will go and get it as well.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A page turner! Excellent. I would highly suggest reading this book to any fan of WW2 novels.  A must read!
1742204120|4.0|I've worked with a lot of software programmers from India, and have learned bits and pieces about the culture over time.  This book provides me with a wealth of information in some ways more so than if I read detailed history books on the subject.  Not to mention all the other fun facts.  The book is a little light on photographs for being over 1200 pages, I like some of these guides that give many inviting pictures of the territory they discuss.  The maps provided lack a lot of detail as well, but then that stuff can be fixed when you get there, or by using an updated GPS.  One interesting facet of these Lonely Planet series books in the Itinerary sections.  This book has six month, three month, one month and many variants of plotted tours around the country.  I would invite other reviewers who have used this book to tell us how accurate they are in predicting the time needed.  They do however, provide at least a reasonable guide for the traveler to plan with. Some of my past trips have to places in the US or Canada, have been off by quite a bit.  This is mostly due to the delay in making the decisions on where to go.  Even a small place like Vancouver, BC, I spent 3 years there off an on going to school, and having some significant free time during breaks and on weekends, yet I doubt I covered five percent of what was there to see!<br /><br />There are a lot of small discussions of past Indian history in this book.  For instance, most of us know this was once a British colony, for some years it was very stable.  There was a bloody uprising in the 1800's that I'd seen in a movie once.  In the movie, I may have missed it but I never caught the real reason for the uprising. While there were some economic factors that played into this, the main reason was that someone with an ax to grind on the Brits, started rumors that their ammo was greased with cow fat or pig fat.  This stirred up both Hindi and Muslim people who make up the majority of the Indian population. Nothing starts a conflict like a religious war!  The book has advisories over scams and dangers.  It recommends that you really don't want to travel alone as a foreign person there.  The book marks special places to go, and details special experiences to see and do.<br /><br />The book is broken down into the various regions of the country and tries to explain the differences found there.  If also emphasized that this is a crowded country.  More than twice that of China and a dozen times that of the United states.  If you travel to India and look around much you will see some very poor portions of the country. This is not the kind of trip for the average lets hit the beach at Miami crowd, but if you want real adventure, to see different cultures, experience different food, and see some amazing cites.  India is a good country to see, or so I've been told, it would pay dividends and enhance the experience to know where to go an what to do, and this book contains a wealth of that information.  Recommended for both the traveler and someone who just wants to learn about the country.  If I had my way to improve this, I'd add more photos of the country, and perhaps a DVD with some accurate maps, those in a file format that could be transfered to a stick or directly to a tablet or smartphone.  Perhaps a lot of that is in the Kindle edition of this, but I'd like to see it for all formats and come with the paper book for only a few dollars more, I would not want to pay full price for both, but I love the portability of a file over a book, especially one this thick.  If I went to India, I'd keep the book at the hotel, and take the electronic version with me.
B001RONJYC|5.0|I enjoyed learning about the great entertainers of that era.  Loved Etta James!!  Beyonce played her very well.  Excellent movie!!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This is an AMAZING album! Stryper is back and rocking their best since the days of \\"To Hell with the Devil\\" The cover of \\"Jesus is Just Alright\\" is mind blowing! This album rocks from the first track to the last. Welcome back to the mix Stryper!!!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The main struggle just POOF disappears with a look and a hug. And the ending, COME ON! So disappointed in this book
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have only begun to read this book.  I have finished the Introduction by Card and the first three chapters.  It's written intelligently but not riddled with erudition.  The author knows how to write and keeps you turning the pages with his masterful presentation of the world in the future, honing characters with which we can all relate.  Buy it for the singular writing skills of Card and the engaging story, along with great character development and human understanding.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Excellent show!! well done good story line with plenty of drama and twists. I'm hooked keep it coming best show on Sunday night
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game :) its so addicting... Just make sure you have lots of friends who also play :)
071815780X|5.0|This book has really made me enjoy cooking again because all the meals in there look and taste so yummy. They are easy to cook, balanced and healthy meals. I look forward to trying a new recipe every weekend together with my husband. It usually takes the 2 of us about half an hour to make a meal but that's perfectly acceptable to me, considering the type of meal and variety of dishes you get at the end. Also, since the recipes are designed for 4 adults, we don't need to cook the next day. I love the variety of ingredients used and the new taste experiences that each recipe offers in typical Jamie style. It's not that easy to make tasty yet healthy meals but Jamie has nailed it! I've already given a copy to both my sisters and would recommend this book to to anyone.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Extremely useful for any entrepreneur. Coming out of a conventional business program in undergrad, I found this book particularly useful, as it concentrates on lean, rather than traditional business practices. It focuses on the nitty-gritty logistics of starting a company, rather than the flashy successes.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun to do and plenty of options,easy to use anywhere, anytime and a nice<br />choice of challenge levels I like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad they finally got this game for the Kindle Fire. I am excited and ready to play.
B004XWLN20|2.0|This was an awesome buy, however some of the discs come scratched, not sure how that happens since it is clearly in new packaging. but for the price I can deal with a scratch here and there, but if I had it to do over again I would just buy the individual series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is super fun and addictive. It is the perfect time filler for any waiting room or for during television commercials.
B00FOWX6NM|2.0|It is not crystal transparent in the back. Fuzzy and easy scratch back cover. It is not worse to buy if you want to show off your new iPhone, such as 5S in golden color!
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This is one of the most unique stories available today. Tatiana Maslany is so believable as the many different characters<br />she plays that sometimes it's hard to realize it's the same girl. Did I mention she's hotter than the exhaust on a Saturn 5<br />rocket? Get this DVD, it will knock your socks off.....
B00006CXSS|5.0|My favorite World War II movie.  I've watched it at least a dozen times.  This one is destined to be a classic.  Very well done.
B003VANOFY|4.0|After having this headset for a few weeks, I have to say that while many people say this is the best headset ever, it definitely has it's problems. The headsets sound is superb, everything sounds fantastic, and the surround sound is also amazing. The buttons on the side are very useful as well. The microphone doesn't sound that good, but there is no background noise, which is pretty cool. I've had a few problem with the headset suddenly SCREECHING at me and then shutting off, and the only way to stop it is to reset the computer. I looked the problem up online, and there is no fix, but many people are having it. Often times my ears start to hurt when wearing this headset, but I think that might just be my big head, and I guess I might have big ears? haha. The headset is not as big as the pictures and reviews make it look, so it is actually smaller than pictured, which is a good thing. The bar that rests on your head, and the ear pieces have this memory foam-like material on them, which is super nice as well.<br /><br />Overall, I give this headset a 4/5, and would recommend buying it, as $100 for a wireless headset like this one is a fantastic price.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|A little difficult to get comfortable, but well worth the effort. I use it daily on my Kindle Fire and no longer carry my laptop or larger tablets.<br />OfficeSuite Pro7 made my 7&quot; Kindle Fire push the larger and heavier pcs into early retirement. My only annoyance is in not using my fire outdoors. I would gladly sacrifice the crisp HD screen for the muted e reader screen. My fire is a productivity workhorses and not a video player.
0385333846|1.0|Synopsis: Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time.  He randomly travels through time into different periods of his life from the bombing in Dresden to his time with the aliens on Planet Tralfamdore.  He is constantly running into random characters on his adventures, some of which appear in other Vonnegut books, even Vonnegut himself.  Because he can time travel he has already seen all the events in his life before they actually happen, the bombing of Dresden, his children, the death of his wife, even his own death.  So it goes.  All of these events converge together randomly throughout paragraphs of writing to form a story...    My review: I am having the hardest time putting the synopsis of this book into words.  Maybe I just don't get it but I am at a loss.  I did not find a point to this book at all.  Yes it's kind of cool about the time travel but more than anything I had a hard time following it cohesively.  One paragraph Billy is at war in 1945 and the next he is at his daughter's wedding, being abducted by aliens.  I can appreciate a \\"weird\\" book as much as the next guy but I don't see what all the hype is about with this book.  I wanted to, I really wanted to like it, but I didn't.  I have heard nothing but good things about this book for years.  I am glad that I have read it so I know for myself what it's all about but I will not be recommending this book to anyone in the future, either here on on Tralfamdore.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is the first non-supernatural horror novel I've ever read. Who needs anti-christs, vampires, demons, and such when the real world has Jong Ills of North Korea? I knew North Korea was bad, but not as horrific as this novel describes. There are more shivers here than one would have in a dozen of Stephen King's recent novels. If this was a novel that clobbered the reader with one North Korea horror after another, who could stand it? Fortunately, there is also Pulitzer-worthy narrative, character, and scene. It is also a page-turner. Unlike many books that I enjoy, this is a book I will never forget.
0525478817|5.0|Synopsis:  Two terminally ill cancer patients fall in love.  Both young and intelligent and both fighting to find balance in a world that is anything but balanced.  Hazel knows she is going to die and does not want to put the pain of her death on her new friend, Augustus.  Augustus has already had one girlfriend die of cancer and she does not want to be the second.  As they work through these issues, they find a connection that will help them both through the impossibly tough times ahead.    My review:  This book was fantastic.  I love how John Green writes, each of the characters in the book are so different, its almost like I hear each person's words differently in my head.  He does a great job of giving each character his/her own personality and emotions.  Happy, sad, funny, he writes each of these emotions perfectly.  Even though this book is written for Young Adults, there is meaning here for all of us.  I just finished reading this today but I think I will like the book even more as time goes on, as I have more time to think about how this story ended, as I am able to talk about it with others.  This feels like one of the stories that gets even better with time.  One line that has stuck with me and will continue with me forever is \\"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.\\"  I mean that is just perfect writing.

B00F031X62|5.0|Being familiar with the previous releases from the same period by the folks at Experience Hendrix and Dagger Records, I wasn't expecting to be as pleased as I am with this concert. This is the best officially released document from the spring 1968 tour available. The performance is better than the previously released Ottawa and Clark University shows and the sound -- while not perfect due to the usual equipment failures -- is exceptionally prepared and presented by Eddie Kramer.<br /><br />The story goes that this Miami Pop performance was supposed to be filmed and used for a live album release, but although it was recorded and partially filmed, the project never came to fruition. Now all these years later we finally get to hear these well preserved tapes. Highly recommended for both die-hard and even curious fans.
159514188X|5.0|Synopsis:  Clay Jensen arrives home one day to find a box at his front door.  Inside the box are several tapes that were recorded by Hannah Baker, a girl and previous crush interest from his class who committed suicide a few weeks earlier.  He learns that he is somehow connected to why Hannah killed herself.  In order to find out how he must listen to all the tapes.  Along with the tapes is a map he found in his school locker.  As he listens to the tapes and follows the map he begins his quest of understanding how something terrible like this could happen and how he could possibly be involved.  Each tape is the story of someone who directly or indirectly was involved with Hannah's decision to kill herself.  Thirteen tapes and thirteen reason why...    My review:  I read this book in honor of banned books week.  Personally I do not think that any book should be banned, ever.  But is some cases I understand why the book was banned, at least to a select audience.  According to Amazon the age range of this book is 12 and up.  I do not agree with this.  While this book is considered to be YA, young adult, I feel 12 is a bit young for someone to read this book.  First of all it's about suicide and the events that lead to a suicide.  In this book there are several situations that have pushed this book into the banned books list for 2013, peeping toms, bullying, rape and of course suicide.  With all that said I think everyone should read this book, eventually.  I loved the way the book was written with Hannah speaking over the tapes and Clay's thoughts and actions mixed right in.  I really felt both Clay's and Hannah's emotions reading this book.  I also loved how the ending of the book brought the story all together.  Book clubs, reading groups, High School Juniors and Seniors, and all ages above should read this book.  There are lessons here about how a simple act of teasing or joking may be just enough to push someone over the edge and actually consider doing something like taking his or her own life.  I think we can all learn something from this book, I know I did.    My rating:  9  Pages:  336  Author website:  [...]
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Flight scenes were terrific, even on an iPad screen. Denzel gives a good performance<br />but the overall story was troubling. It took a long time to reach a valid point and then ended.<br />An ok effort but could have been better developed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is a perfect example of utilizing existing devices and technology to make something totally new with minimum addition.<br />If you have a decent internet connection speed, Chromecast will work seamlessly for you!
B00124PXW8|5.0|The best modern day horror film !  It portrays evil and demonic possession vividly. The exorcism scenes are powerful reminders that God, Christ or whatever deity you believe in can save you through faith. Great cast & production. Will watch again !
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|has worked every time for me including on my college secured networks. works especially well on regular wifi connections! great!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Very excited to have it on the kindle! I think this app works great no different from the app on face book
B0083Z614S|5.0|5 stars.  I haven't read this book in 63 years. Rediscovery was a joyous event. One might say the book was quaint, compelling and very dear. Two warped little souls first scrapped like mean hissing cats. Slowly with the aid of a garden in need of awakening and with a guide in the form of a magical Yorkshire youth, the two needy beings stopped their hissing and scrapping and began a journey towards a spiritual recovery that affected all who came in contact with them.<br /><br />Enjoy meeting Colin and friends!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|When I first saw the film Insidious by James Wan I was definitely impressed with the jump scares, but that's exactly what they were: Jump Scares. There was an emptiness to the family that can usually be turned into something dark and morose and contribute to the overall tone of the film. But the emptiness came from the lack of chemistry between the actors, the computer effects that robbed the atmosphere any real strength, and also some sub-par acting.<br /><br />Insidious felt like a test run for something great, and then The Conjuring was unleashed in theaters and finally the elements that seemed half-baked in the first Insidious film clicked. The clever camera work, the exceptional acting (and CASTING!) truly shined when the chemistry between the characters bloomed into what many horror films have lacked: Characters worth caring about. Suddenly the jump scares transformed into constant dread as you wished and hoped for their safety. Begin based off of the practiced Demonologists The Warrens, the events in the film also have an extra level of weight that I found welcome.<br /><br />The Warrens and The Perron Family<br /><br />These two families are the cornerstone and the heart of this film, not the supernatural events, not the scares, nor the mythos. The central focus should be the characters for these films, at least in my opinion. Spending time with either family seemed like a treat, but when they come together to fight a menace neither have ever encountered it made the battle for their souls all the more poignant. The dynamic each person had with the supernatural and then their interactions with each other in response was the strongest I've seen since The Exorcist. Who was ignored by the spirits? Who was simply being tortured, and who were the spirits trying to hurt by proxy? And the big question in the film that was thankfully fully explored: How do they overcome this evil.<br /><br />That's what I think I enjoyed most about this film. It's ability to create dread and genuine fear without sacrificing clarity. Your hand was not being held and thankfully exposition was kept to a minimum, but you were always aware of the danger and the state of its intensity. The perfect balance achieved in this film is its greatest triumph. I give this film a perfect score.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addictive game.  It is a lot of fun to play along with and to challege family and friends.
B00GD9F59S|4.0|First of all, I have to say this book moved along at a much nicer rate than \\"Apollyon.\\" Where book #4 seemed repetitive and dragging for the first 50%, \\"Sentinel,\\" seemed to fly (perhaps that's just the fact it's the last book in the series and I knew it). So, the pacing was an improvement until...you get to the end. The ending felt rushed and sort of...anticlimactic I guess. (Again, possibly because it's the last in the series.)<br /><br />I still enjoyed \\"Sentinel,\\" and I recommend the series to anyone interesting the YA/NA paranormal/fantasy genre.<br /><br />Ok, things that really bothered me about me this book and kept me from giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />*******************************Spoilers*******************<br /><br />***********************Fair warning, Spoilers ahead***************<br /><br />So the breed order is suppose to be changed right? But the question is never addressed about how that's going to create more apollyons. I mean wasn't that a huge plot line (or did I make that up in my own head?), that an apollyon could only be created when a pure and a half had a child? So how the heck is the whole breed order thing just completely looked over in the last book? This really annoyed me, I kept reading the last chapter thinking she was going to address this, but it's never mentioned that I remember.<br /><br />The ending just wrapped too many other little things in a neat nifty package with a bow on top without really explaining anything in my mind. I still had so many questions when the book was finished. So I'm thinking A) she's going to continue the story line with other characters? or B) she didn't know how to fix the problems she'd erected for herself so she just ignored them.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with the way things ended for Alex and Aiden (if not necessarily happy with the questions I still have).
B0000DZTIL|5.0|this movie is great about these kids find a space energy source and then use it for there science project.  but when it absorbs energy things get weird.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love love love! Definitely a new favorite author!<br />Captivating, heartwarming and heartwarming all in the same breath! A must read!
B00C7607BC|5.0|Loved the little mermaid. I bought it for my granddaughter.  She watches this movie all the time.  Love it. Thanks
0375869026|5.0|Such a great story and such a great message. My 10 year old daughter absolutely LOVED this book! A must read for anyone this age and above
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King at his finest, always wondered what happened to the boy and his mom, can't wait for the movie.
B005H29GSI|1.0|My 3 year old loves angry birds and he does actually enjoy this game, however the catapult is useless-does not fire more than an inch or two and the pieces are not sturdy enough for him to set up himself. So basically this game is 3 year old watches mom try to build tower on card...mom fails miserably for several minutes...finally tower is built, mom is exhausted....three year old hurls bird at tower, laughs maniacally, and then we both search for pieces all over the room. Rinse. Repeat.<br /><br />Save your money.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I've played it on the . IPad for a year and now on the kindle. It's a great game for either system.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't see what all the fuss is about. It comes off as smut for the most part. The characters are magically developed and infallible.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It was an interesting concept and combined both historical facts with fiction.  I also found the references to dealing with life 53 years in the past amusing.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Very funny. Finished it in one day. She has a great way of endearing us to her with all the self deprecating humor.
B00G32OMF8|3.0|Too wordy. Glad I had watched the  first 2 or I couldn't have hung in for thus one. Nice try.
0741470314|5.0|Defending a King ~ His Life & Legacy is really an amazing book! I'm from Italy and hope soon available in italian too! Thank you Karen
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed it because it showed a lot of growth on the part of the male lead character, it's full of lusty scenes of course but it also has some intriguing near death chase scenes which makes it exciting
B005HSL626|3.0|This is entertaining for a little while then it gets boring,I mean all you do is slice fruits and buy things to help you slice them
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book has EXCITING, IMAGINATIVE, and compelling story telling that is well worth the read. Best sci-fi novel I have read yet
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game<br />So so so so so much<br />It's fun and hard it gives you a real challenge.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|The book was impossible fun. ... A train wreck just  too fun not to watch.<br /><br />I liked the Forrest Gump-like life journey in which Allan Karlsson inadvertently manages to get into the middle of so many turning point moments in 20th Century history, and I liked watching how his simple no nonsense approach to life impacted these &#34;historical&#34; events.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has a good sense of humor and can suspend reality for the sake of a good laugh.
B008JFUR10|4.0|The story line is not the best, but this was expected. The CGI on robots and monsters is amazing. Good fun but don't expect any plot twists. It is what it is, giant Mechs vs &#34;Godzilla&#34;
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|It was not that entertaining.  Just tried to be funny.  Glad when it was over and glad there will be no sequel.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|You have to keep in mind it is a Zombie movie. For those of us not into the silly aspect of Zombies, well, it is just a great show of special effects and that's about it. The plot has been redone many times, the Zombies are not special in any way, and the ability of the hero to survive EVERYTHING sooner or later will put a smile on your face, a la &#34;come on!!&#34;... Hey, it is Brad! His character knows everything, can do anything, and apparently, can't be killed. I had fun but I was glad I didn't spend the money at the theater.
B00E8S2JZ4|1.0|This could have been release the first time around. Instead of beating fans by releasing several over priced editions. $30 for 13 more mins and 9 hours of production? For amazon special content $70.<br />The entertainment business is surely ripping hard working individuals off. I will wait eventually this item will be a clearance item. The material could be sold separate instead of re-purchasing the entire movie.
B0015DROBO|5.0|There is so much going on in this book. You want to know what's happening next.  And the constant intrigue just keeps you hooked.  Excellent character development and interesting plots. Not to be missed.

B001OQCV6A|2.0|It really would have been a great movie except for fact that they called it Sherlock Holmes.  This is more of a parody of Holmes then an actual Sherlock Holmes film.  Downey's character bears no resemblance to the Holmes in the books.  The characters  can make references to the canon all day long but it won't make this a SH film.  Check out the DVDs with Jeremy Brett from the 1980s. if you want to meet the real Sherlock Holmes and Watson.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Anything less than 5 stars is a crime for this book. Sure, it's long, but it is all worth reading, because when stuff starts to really go down, it is all worth it. It is so amazing. I do not want to give anything away so I will only say I was absolutely in love with Khal Drogo and Dany's relationship. I was very effected by what happened in that situation! I will be reading this entire series as well as buying all the seasons of the amazing and well done HBO series.
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|This horrible film takes the Sherlock Holmes story another step in the ridiculous direction that it's predecessor began.  If you know and love Sherlock Holmes from the original stories look elsewhere.  You won't find him here.  As another reviewer so aptly put it,  This is Tony Stark pretending to be Sherlock Holmes.  If you want to meet the real Holmes on the screen, check out Jeremy Brett as Holmes in Granada's wonderful TV series form the 1980s.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This has to be about the most juvenile book I've held in my hands in years - including a couple I didn't notice came from the young adult section when I chose them.  I couldn't even finish - it's that awful.  How could this get a rave review?  Or a movie?  Yikes!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't know what it is about this game, but I'm addicted to it. I have it installed on two devices, so I can play on one while I'm locked out of the other one.
B00902AKK4|4.0|Beyond Ynth HD is a fun little puzzle game that's surprisingly challenging, in a good way. You, as the bug-like kingdom's bug-like hero, must go on a quest at the Queen's request to recover all the precious diamonds that were stolen.  The game mechanics is really impressive. Take a look at the video and you'll quickly see what I mean. The tutorial is well thought out and very helpful. The graphics and sound/music are pretty well done. The title song alone made me chuckle a bit! The app itself seems to be polished and stable. I know some of the other reviewers encountered crashes and force closes. Personally, I have yet to encounter any issues with stability (HTC One Android 4.2.2 and Rezound Android 4.0.3).<br /><br />The permissions seem reasonable. The internet connections are most likely for the links that take you to the YouTube solutions should you get stuck. The bluetooth permissions are most likely for connecting with external wireless controllers (found under options). There doesn't appear to be any in-app purchases. It does include Flurry Analytics, which for the uninitiated is a tool used by developers to track how users use their apps. You can opt out of it at Flurry's website, although you do have to give them your device ID. I would prefer not to have this at all if given a choice, but that's becoming increasingly rare nowadays. You'll have to make the call, but I want you to at least be aware.<br /><br />Pro:<br />-impressive game mechanics = fun and challenging gameplay<br />-nice graphics, sound and music<br />-no in-app purchasing<br /><br />Con:<br />-Flurry Analytics<br /><br />Summary:<br />It's a fun game that I think is worth checking out. The only major downside for me is the inclusion of Flurry.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|This game is so fun. Runs great. Hope they will add more of the expansions. We have the board game versions as well as multiple expansions and love them. I have waisted so much time playing this app!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I just love it. super easy User experience. engaging game like mechanics. by far the best app I have seen so far
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game! Super easy and addictive to play. Great price (free!) and you can still progress throughout the game without having to buy anything with real money.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I've been looking for a game that really forces you to think. Something that can challenge me after spending my entire day pushing my toddlers education. I can't express how excited I am to have come across this game!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|this book was a great read, it's not your grandma's harlequin book. Although I think I read it before, but still enjoyable.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|I enjoyed the first the most but the other two were also very well written and engaging. Bravo Carlos Ruiz Zafon!!
B003WUYR6I|5.0|Loved it!  Mick and Harry together; two of my favorite guys in same story line results in further development of each character.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not as good as the first two but enjoyable. You have to finish the story. There were some really good battle scenes and some very unexpected events.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this version of Candy Crush.  These are really addicting.  If you like Candy Crush, you need to get this one also.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|This is Strypers best album to date, and blows away secular bands with their vocals and guitar work, would love to see a DVD selection as well for their newly released music videos.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book! Kept me on the edge of my seat. I can not wait for the movie. Was scare I wouldn't like it while readimg the first but stuck with it and i'm very happy I did.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's neat enough. Doesn't put my tablet's browser on the television. Works fine with a laptop. I already had a smart TV so netflix and youtube were a waste of money.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|I just like Lee Childs writing, he constructs the plot well and is always addictive, I have bought a lot of his books in print media.
B000OLV97I|5.0|Had great effects and one of my favorite movies. I just wish it was like the book. I defenenetly Sugest to by this book.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I loved this book.  Quirky romances can easily go awry, but this one achieved the perfect balance of endearing and entertaining.  I found myself rooting for the characters and would recommend it to anyone.  Never mind the less than flattering reviews from readers who felt the portrayal of Don's Asperger's was inaccurate.  Who cares whether or not his habits and quirks fit the autism spectrum?  He's a great character.  Enough said.
1402568851|5.0|This brilliant novel I bought years ago, is just the kind of books I can read/hear over and over again and each time learn something with a new perspective.<br /><br />The elegant way Mark Haddon the author, choose to illustrate the challenges 15 years old Christopher encounter in his life, sure stress out a variety of aspects concerning “Aspergers Syndrome”. Personally it helped me understand several cases of this and similar syndromes among family friends.<br />Hence I highly recommend this book not only as a “must read novel” but also for people who would like to have a glimpse of understanding of the “Aspergers Syndrome”.<br /><br />I find the challenging contrast between specific abilities just like Christopher has in Math and Science, and that unabridged gap to understand other human beings, as mind boggling.<br /><br />This book paves a way not only to understand, but rather feel how complex it may be for a person having this syndrome to function in life.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Imagine finding an envelope with the words, “For my wife, Cecilia Fitzpatrick. To be opened in the event of my death.” Cecilia finds such an envelope deeply hidden away in the attic of the home she shares with her husband, John-Paul, but John-Paul is still very much amongst the living, just away on a business trip. When she confronts him, he tells her he wrote the letter after the birth of their first daughter while feeling very sentimental and sappy.  Cecilia chooses to believe him and puts the letter away unopened.<br /><br />Until John-Paul returns home early from his business trip and begins a crazed search for the letter, leading Cecilia to believe there is much more to the letter than sentimental drivel. Cecilia cannot rest until she reads the letter.  She rips opens the letter and her life explodes wide open along with the lives of two acquaintances with whom she has more in common than she ever imagined.<br /><br />As Cecelia absorbs what she has learned, her role as perfect mother, perfect friend and perfect wife turns to a shambles taking the lives of  Tess, whose husband has his own secrets and Rachel, a bitter older woman with her.<br /><br />This book is all about the secrets we have, the secrets we keep and the secrets we will never know.  It is about the moments missed, the small nuances of our lives that change the path we are on without us even noticing.<br /><br />I wanted to read this book because I so enjoyed WHAT ALICE FORGOT, this book surpassed my expectations.  I could not put it down, did not want it to end and when it did end, I was speechless and had to read the epilogue again and again.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It will be on my Christmas book giving list.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|The film was not just trying to scare people with gruesome details though those were there. I think there was much more critical information that came from the film, especially with how the food industry and corporations mistreat both animals and people.
B00F91H666|3.0|As a zombie flick, its OK. As a movie adaptation of the book, its an atrocity. I was so looking forward to seeing how they played out the character in Max Brook's book. What a shame.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|One of the stupidest movies I have ever tried to watch.  Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The best  movie of all time. I really like the additional information and features, especially showing the kids grown up
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The most amazing book I have read in a very long time. You do not want to miss the experience of reading The Book Thief.
B004IV32HU|5.0|Good movie and great acting. Actors played their roles perfectly. Not quite as funny as I anticipated but was made up for in good story telling.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Cool flick. Modern day, way upgraded take on Godzilla and/or aliens. Lots of action. Felt the relationships and dialogue of the movie were rushed through just to get to the action bits. Lost something there with that. I'd watch it again but definitely won't be running out to buy it.
B00G32OER4|4.0|It was a pretty good movie, but it is only scary if you believe in demon possessions. My teen son was terrified.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Love it.  I swear she is one if the most real women on tv!  I could watch The Good Wife forever.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Best new series, by far. Be prepared for addiction to the show, characters, and actors who play them. You may even find yourself reading the less exciting true story the show is based in just to get your fix until Season 2 releases.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Stryper has put out their best album to date.  All of the guys are at the top of their game.  Don't think twice...just buy it!
B005K17RU0|1.0|talk about change. this app went from useful to ducks and overly complicated in the clock of a button!  its really just junk now. I wish I never updated!!<br />AW should rethink forcing this much change on their customers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Most addictiving game ever!  So happy it's finally on Kindle....  I know I'm suppose to be reading books but now Candy Crush on  Kindle.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I love this show so much.  I get the season box sets every time they come out so I can watch it whenever I want.  The storylines are great and there Dean and Sam are adorable and funny while being awesome at the serious stuff.
B003F44QRQ|2.0|I fell to understand why this is a cult movie.<br />It felt like I was watching yet Another annoying vampire story.<br />Also the ending is way too simple.<br />Vampires sure seem easy to kill!!!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun for all.<br />My daughter and my boyfriend both love this game. We take turns playing the levels. Love it!
B003XU3MWM|4.0|entertaining movie.<br />I think Michael Fassbender is an interesting actor<br />It could have benefited from a better story line though
006202406X|2.0|The first two books were very well written page turners. This book was a major disappointment. It did feel rushed, as others have said.  I think Roth tried to shove way too much into one book. Too many stories and plot threads: The Factionless, the Allegiant, the GD Rebels, etc. Another issue I have is how incompetent the Bureau is. How have these guys managed to stay in power so long?<br /><br />Allegiant wasn't boring exactly, but neither was it as compelling and interesting as the first two books. It was a little confusing, and even kind of frustrating. How did it match up to Divergent and Insurgent? I really don't think it did.  The downer ending is just one part of my frustration with this book.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|It is a story of a great artificial intelligence revolution told through very human characters. Page and Brin come across as very endearing pioneers. The author evidently is not very fond of Schmidt.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter season 4 has it's share of twists, humor & trauma. Dexter tries to balance his home life with his  need for killing with some strange results. This season was a very good one.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Ground breaking concept. The launch of a thousand bright stars. Biting humor meets all kinds of good music. Simply amazing.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|An Excellent dvd. Michael C. Hall makes for an interesting serial killer. Also the other characters in the show are just as intriguing. The plot isn't as good as the first two seasons but it's still very enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a page turner that kept you wanting more and more.I couldn't believe when I got to the last page. I kept looking like more would magically show up.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Standard romantic comedy.  Fun film.  Likable cast.  Decent acting. Some might not like the loose moral code of some of the characters.  But they tried to cater to them by making sure none of the characters were married.  Not any worse then most real life love stories.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great novel, definitely heavily fantasy-based genre but it's done in a way that makes sense and has a Harry Potter kind of feel. Well written, and the plot keeps you on your toes even into the following books in the series.
B000HZGNHW|5.0|My husband and son love it and could watch it over and over. The action in the movie is captivating.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent story. I enjoyed it immensely. Well written. A terrific tribute to the Human spirit . I highly recommend it.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Downloaded this game randomly, never heard of it before. It is one of my favorite games I have downloaded for my phone. I have since convinced half my family to download it. The theme is silly and fun with the puzzles getting steadily more challenging. You must put out fires using minimal water. Some of the fires are hard to get to and you find yourself in a puzzle situation trying to find a way to get the water to the fire. Work fast though because the longer you wait the bigger the fires get to burning down the little huts. Super fun game, 5 stars!
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|This is a true classic film. Not exactly all the truth, but very close according to records and documentaries. Still a must see
B000005RTR|5.0|I was one of those lucky enough to see Whitesnake (twice) with it's original line-up, at the 1983 Monsters of Rock Festival in Heidelburg, Germany, and another time at the Offenbach Stadhalle in Frankfurt, Germany.  Whitesnake was the headline band for Monsters of Rock.  In fact, Whitesnake was a headline act in Europe for several years before the U.S. version of the band hit American shores.  By then, it was Whitesnake only in name, with none of the original line-up except for lead singer David Coverdale.  I'm not saying that the music Whitesnake put out in the late 80's was bad, but it was an entirely different sound, completely divorced from it's Deep Purple roots.  And for me, at least, there was nothing in the music they produced in the late 80's that made them stand out from any of the other hair metal bands of that era..<br /><br />&#34;Live In The Heart Of The City&#34; captures the feel and sound of the Whitesnake that I knew and loved.  It has an earthy, bluesy sound that I can relate to.  The combination of David Coverdale, Jon Lord, Cozy Powell, Ian Paice and Bernie Marsden (and Micky Moody) is pure magic, the likes of which we will never hear again, so you owe it to yourself to buy this album, and you'll see what I mean.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SHOW.  TOTALLY NOT MY STYLE BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AND WRITING THAT KEEPS ME INTERESTED.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love this series. Been following for awhile. Wirth every penny I spend. Would suggest to anyone who hasn't seen before
B0024FAR5W|5.0|MY HUSBAND HAS WATCHED THIS FROM THE BEGINNING BUT I GOT INTERESTED LATER.  HAD TO BUY IT FROM THE BEGINNING TO CATCH UP WITH ALL OF THE STORY LINES.  AWESOME SHOW.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|What other rating can anyone give to the last of the series, although I think that the ending stopped too soon.  The new generation should have gone all the way to Hogwarts so that we could see it rebuilt with Maggie Smith as the headmistress.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Reflektor is to Neon Bible as Funeral is to The Suburbs. Upon purchasing and listening to Arcade Fire's fantastic new double LP, Reflektor, I realized that its name and themes might just have more meaning than you think. The album completes the band's discography, giving it symmetry (or Supersymmetry, if you will). It acts as a mirror, dividing Arcade Fire's incredible collection of records in half, pairing Funeral with The Suburbs, and Neon Bible with itself. Thematically, this pairing and division is obvious. Both Funeral and The Suburbs focus on life growing up in the neighborhood. They possess an aura that simply sweeps your mind away to your childhood, whether or not you grew up in a neighborhood like the one described in these albums. Reflektor, on the other hand, is what we finally see when looking into the Black Mirror -- Neon Bible's long awaited reflection. (Maybe Black Mirror does know reflection after all!) Although Reflektor cuts back on the level of socio-political themes that were riddled throughout Neon Bible, you can still see the continuation of other themes: Afterlife seems to pick up right where Ocean of Noise left off, and Win Butler was right - \\"Time won't work it out for you.\\"<br />Reflektor takes what Neon Bible created, and spins it on a more personal level. Themes range from social exclusion, to hope, to honesty, to compassion. At first listen, the record seems to be a jumble of styles, influences, and stray ideas, but after multiple listens, Reflektor straightens itself out, defining it's boundaries within itself, as well as within the band's discography. The first disc is where you see Arcade Fire's more experimental side: they flirt with disco, 80s pop-rock, reggae, glam rock, and much more -- all rolled up into their signature style. The second disc, however is more calm and collected, as Arcade Fire stays within their comfort zone musically, while still proving to the listener that they can be innovative. The themes on the second discare centered around the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. This sad, heartfelt tale echoes the line from the title track, \\"If this is heaven, I don't know what it's for / If I can't find you there, I don't care.\\" This disc takes on a more solemn mood than the previous disc, or any of their previous work for that matter. Fret not, for it still measures up in quality to the rest of the band's work, if not tops it altogether.<br />Reflektor is by far the biggest thing Arcade Fire has attempted, and they execute it beautifully. The name itself is spot-on. Not only does it create a reflection of the band's past work, it reflects within itself, juxtaposing the two discs physically, musically, and thematically. This is truly a piece of art, and will undoubtedly reveal something new about itself with every listen.<br />\\"They say a watched pot won't ever boil,\\" but we've been watching Arcade Fire for years, and finally, they have begun to boil.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I saw it at the theater and liked it so much that I bought the DVD so that I can watch it whenver I want.
B00942Y35S|4.0|Cheesy story, not much meat though. We were watching it in bed one night, while my husband fell asleep I thought it cute.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I love historical, period films, and this one was done really well.  The cast, costumes and setting were all excellent, and the plot line was very intriguing.  It's too bad that the critics treated it as if the movie was anonymous because  a lot of movie goers missed a great film.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|A little too much seal training in book.  Otherwise, very good read.  Incredible story.  Glad we have heroes like this in military.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have to say I was very engrossed in my reading of the three books..... I am  mad at myself for not reading these books sooner.... I can not wait for the movie....
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Simple and fun but they try to get you to spend some money just be play. It slow and the points will come
B003B02O0A|5.0|John Grisham, my favorite author. Had never read this book, only watched the movie, glad I did before reading &#34;Sycamore Row&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Couldn't get to work from desktop due to audio from Bluetooth speaker. Doesn't work to my 50'' TV due to lack of software update for it. Can only use from phone to smaller TV and disappointed.
B00COQTZLS|3.0|I think it should be easier to sync information with Google.  I use it on my smartphone and Tablet.  It appears that PI3 wants you to use their PI Cloud service and not make it as easy to sync with Google and and Google drive.  Although it is very attractive in appearance, there is no major lift from the alternate Google calendars.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Great for all ages. Shaun and his cohorts are constantly dodging the consequences of their own mischief, and my kids relate! It's one of the few shows that we all enjoy as a family. I can't rate it highly enough!
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|Glad I did not go to the theater to see this flop!  If you want a thrill do not view this one.  It is good for a FEW laughs.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|funny movie.  the kids all love it. they have watched it over and over.  then the other grandkids got their turn.  it always pays to get the blu ray, dvd pkg.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books.  I love these books.  I LOVE THEM!  I am totally, completely, entirely rapped up in the Hunger Games trilogy.  I need more.  Susan Collins needs to make another book about the future of Panem, because that was not enough!<br /><br />The books are well written, have great flow, and are ADDICTIVE. The twists and turns, ups and downs, and amazing emotional moments are undeniably unique. The only other books I have been so entwined in are the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />Anyone and everyone should read these books.<br /><br />Ambrosia
0316055433|5.0|Loved Secret History, put down Little Friend early on, pre-ordered The Goldfinch from Amazon. 760-something pages and I read it in 2 1/2 days. Could not put it down. It's shades of Great Expectations, Catcher in the Rye, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It's an epic. The writing is pitch perfect. The characters are fully drawn & you deeply care for them, in all their flawed glory. You will laugh, you will cry, you will not find a better read this year. Buy this book. Maybe on Kindle, because it's as big as your head.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son and I had  great time building this. I would recommend this product to everyone based my experience with it
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think everyone should play this game because it is awesome!!! and it really is exactly like the Tv show on the hub
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|reprises the somewhat confused fatalism of matrix and v, although it's deathless characters are permitted a measure of free will.  at 3 hours, and perhaps one two many writers (?), i'm thinking ca has overreached itself;  attempting too many characters, all allocated to repeating lives, and never holding focus on any for long.  fountain at least progressed through them, and still failed.  trademark wachowski humanism, very fine actors and fx, but it tends to drift thin at points.  you will have to forgive those defects in order to sustain affection for the rest.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|So I updated Facebook because of the warning that was at the top of the page... so I did and now I can't even open Facebook on my kindle anymore!!! It tries to open then says Facebook has stopped!... this is ridicules
B005L38QHA|5.0|Made the game much more enjoyable once I got used to all the keys. I spend a lot more time enjoying playing my character than looking at the hotbar and clicking the icons of regularly used spells and abilities.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is amazing it tells u if ur device is Charing n when the last time it charged. Also tells u the percentage. When it become unplugged n u plunge it back in the app battery pops back up. I love it
