B0000027RL|5.0|Only once in a blue moon does the world get treated to a masterpiece of musical talent. There was Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix and few others. Here is one. With influences from all of the above artists, Pearl Jam took their time to release this one of a kind masterpiece for our generation, Generation X. If X marks the spot, then Ten definately blew the spot up. From Once to Release, which is only on the CD release of the album, this album rocks with hearty guitar riffs and solos, socially concious lyrics delivered in perfect pitch and a thriving drum beat that keeps this album jamming 14 years after its original release date. Smoother than Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, yet harder than Blindmelon, all of whom hit the scene at about the same time, Pearl Jam took on mass appeal that has thrived and survived the test of time.
B00069YE0W|1.0|I don't quite understand the glowing reviews from others, but I think it doesn't take a cynic to suspect those reviews are a heavily subjective. This album, like the five that proceeded it, is critically lacking in artistic gracefulness, direction, cohesiveness and purpose. Frusciante has never proved himself capable of consistantly good output, and yet he pursues album after album with no sign he's aware of that fact. He resents critics who give him negative reviews, seemingly brushing them off as not understanding his point. But the problem is, unless we take Frusciante's word on blind faith, there doesn't seem much point to this series of albums (of which, this is the last, thankfully) that can be construed from the music alone to convince me this is nothing more than an exercise in entitlement and self-indulgence.  <br /> <br />Frusciante's songwriting at best has only evolved marginally over the years since rejoining the Chili Peppers, and in someways, it's far less creative and inspired than what you can find on his first four solo albums. Despite his claims of studious music listening and explorations into everything from  production techniques to backing vocals, it would seem he's treading water at best. Sometimes there's a glimpse of what he's talking about - but it's not anywhere as fruitful as you'd expect from all his talk. And for all his heavy-handed earnesty, you'd think you'd get something a bit more impressive and stylistically refined than this. His guitar playing comes across as lacking effort and sincerity (on this series of albums, it seems overall he's largely bored with guitar), his piano skills are marginal, and his voice - especially on this album - sounds overly self-conscious and stiff. The lyrics seem to make considerable effort to say next to nothing and aren't really as coherent as they try to sound. What's worse is they're too awkward and too distracting to simply let them \\"flow\\" by as you listen. Like the other albums in this series,I had to struggle to sit through the entire album in one sitting, and like much of those other albums, there was nothing terribly rememberable or engaging, nor was it any less unappealing upon a second listening (and I did give it a second chance).  <br /> <br />While the supporting musicans seem to try to meld with this mess, Frusciante never sounds either very at ease or very competant with what he's doing. I can only wonder what Frusciante himself is hearing when he listens back to his own recordings. As a musican myself, I understand there's a difference between a \\"raw\\" performance and an incompetant one. And quite frankly, this album, like the five others in this series, seems to beg the question as to whether Frusciante himself knows the difference.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Okay, I'll admit that the only reason I went to see this was Jennifer Garner. Isn't she great? Anyway, I'm glad to report that, unlike what most critics say, it's not a cartoony version but a dark story driven movie ala the Crow. The way Daredevil's radar sense is protrayed is quite genius and Colin Farrell is superb as Bullseye (Even though, I don't care much for Colin.). He uses a mixture of insanity and pride to bring him to life. And the use of John Favrou and Foggy Nelson brings just the right amount of humor to it. The Director's Cut improves over the theatrical version in so many ways that I recommend it to those who have never seen this movie. Now, I'm sure someone will ask \\"Is the Director's Cut that good?\\", and the answer is that it's like a completely different movie. The theatrical cut is 103 minutes. The director's cut is 133 minutes. That half hour of extra footage makes a huge difference. Just rent it -- trust me, it's good. The relationship with Elektra isn't as big and there's much more focus on Daredevil, the Kingpin, and the world they exist in. The Director's Cut was 20 times better than the theatrical version. It added a whole subplot that really wove together the entire story. Plus, there is a cool scene in the first of the movie with the bar fight scene where Daredevil walks across these burning pool tables and crouches down to look at the bad guy. \\"It's time to give the devil his due.\\" Awesome!! Had this been released in the theatres, it would have blown everything away. Too bad the producers punked out.

B00005JNVS|5.0|'Kung Fu Hustle' personifies why Asian cinema is some much more exciting, original, and flat-out better than just about anything that American film studios release in this day and age of bland remakes, Vin Diesel action crapfests, and Ashton Kutcher comedies.<br /><br />Being a big Asian cinema fan, I had the Chinese release DVD of 'Kung Fu Hustle' about six months ago, but that didn't stop me from going and seeing it on the big screen.  I won't recap the film's plot because its already been spat out dozens of times in many other reviews here but to put it quickly:  think 'Looney Toons' meets 'The Matrix'.  The action scenes are wildly inventive, the comedy guffaw-worthy, some very funny violence(mostly cartoony and nothing you couldn't really show the kids)and the entire thing is filled with some of the most memorable characters you have ever seen.  Not to mention probably the finest CGI I've ever seen in a film.<br /><br />I'm a huge Stephen Chow fan and I will recommend all of his films, many of which you can pick up right here on Amazon or on some great Asian film sites(AZNfilms.com or HKFlix.com).  This film is just as good, if not a smidge better than 'Shaolin Soccer'.<br /><br />On a sidenote:  Check out Chow's 'King Of Comedy', which he made right before 'Shaolin Soccer'.  It doesn't have the hyper-kinetic pacing or amazing CGI of either '...Soccer' or '...Hustle', but if you liked them you'll also like this one.  I personally think its his funniest film.<br /><br />Anyways, from the first frame to the last, 'Kung Fu Hustle' is endlessly inventive, entertaining, mindblowing, hilarious, and wonderful.  Its films like this that make going to the theatre exciting again.
B00006L9ZT|3.0|It's a sign of our modern temperament that a production that hovers, more or less, around what Wagner dramaturgically envisioned is the subject of so much harsh criticism, precisely for being \\"traditional.\\"  Whatever.  Anyway, because this production is visually so not-distracting, the music is more - oh, I don't know - *available*.  But by making the music more available, the focus of this production becomes the musicians, and here, that proves to be a mixed blessing at best.<br /><br />The worst part of this DVD set is the casting.  There is some fine music-making here, don't get me wrong.  But by bringing the music to the forefront here, both the virtues and the faults of the musicians are more glaring.  Behrens's Brynhilde and Jerusalem's Siegfried (although not his Loge) are the biggest problems and that makes for a pretty serious problem considering the importance of their respective roles - which shaved two big stars off a presumed five from this reviewer.<br /><br />So, what's good about it? James Morris's Wotan justifies the almost universal critical approval that came his way, and makes even the god's boring bits near erotic with musical precision and the natural creaminess of his voice (compare Morris's weak Hans Sachs in the Met's Meistersinger now available on DVD).  Matti Salminen is darker than dark as, respectively, Fafner in Rhinegold and Hagen in Gotterdammerung.  In fact, Salminen  completely dominates every scene he's in, most effectively in Hagen's Watch, the summoning of the regiment prior to Gunther's return with Brynilde in tow, and the Vengeance Trio in Gotterdammerung.  One can't praise him enough.  Christa Ludwig is noteworthy as Fricka in Rhinegold and Walkyre, and Waltraute in Gotterdammerung, although her voice had thinned out by the time this was recorded.  Siegfried Jerusalem's Loge is quite satisfying, which makes his failure as Siegfried more pathetic.  Jessye Norman and Gary Lakes as the doomed Sieglinde & Siegmund make lovely music but are hard to watch.  Still, I count this casting as one of the stronger points of this set, if only for the voluptuous force-of-nature which is Norman's inimitable voice;  Lakes is also very pleasant to listen to.  The problems, of course are their physical enormity - both singers are massive - and the unfortunate fact that it takes a mighty big suspension of disbelief to imagine these two as Nordic twins.<br /><br />And speaking of forces of nature the Met orchestra and James Levine's use of it to shape the musical foundation of this production is, by far, the best reason to buy these DVD's.  Wagner's orchestra is a major player in all of his operas, but most demandingly here. It functions as a kind of Greek chorus, continuously commenting on the drama as it unfolds, giving us insight into the drama by it's use of big musical motif's. Such insight is doubly important here in light of this performance's awkward casting and relative dearth of dramatic ideas.<br /><br />Now, all that said, we now turn to Behrens and Jerusalem.  (Anthony Raffell and Hanna Lisowska's Gunther and Gutrune are terrible - perhaps appropriately terrible for their smarmy brother/sister act - but that's nothing compared to the stunning failures of this Brynhilde and Siegfried.) Behrens used to have a remarkably beautiful voice, but she's not a natural Brynhilde.  The music is too big for her and she's worn out long before her almost excruciating Immolation Scene. Similarly, Siegfried Jerusalem, so fine as Loge in Das Rhinegold, is way, way, way overtaxed as Seigfried. Moreover, these two singers never found the theatrical motivations of their characters - Behrens is vague and almost embarassed, it seems, especially during the first scene she's in in Act 2 of Walkyre where she has to cavort around the stage with James Morris's dramatically stiff Wotan; Jerusalem is already barking out his lines in the first act of Siegfried and he never finds the hero's center of gravity; hence his constant, breathy overstatment of the music.  By the immolation scene, Siegfried has been (gratefully) dispatched and Behrens' Brynhilde has lost so much authority (what authority it had to begin with) that the musical hugeness of her character, never having gotten off the ground in the first place here, is painfully exhausted.<br /><br />In the end, the blessings of this set are mixed, as are virtually all productions of virtually everything. Great work muscially from the orchestra, Morris, Salminen and to a lesser extent Norman and Lakes (who, despite his awkward girth, would have made for a better Siegfried than Jerusalm had he the stamina - which is a big if that I don't know the answer to).  Add to this the excellent music making of the Rhinemaidens, Norns, Erda and the incomperable Met chorus, and you have a Ring that's hard to dismiss, even for its glaring faults.hence his constant, breathy overstatment of the music.

B00000720W|2.0|This album is a joke. And I have \\"De Mysteriis\\" and \\"Chimera\\" and all of that other stuff, but the only good thing about this album is Maniac's vokills.  Yes, Euronymous was terrible at guitar and so was Necrobutcher.  Manheim was a very \\"special\\" drummer.  In short, the vocals saved the thing.  They saved it from being a total disaster.  I don't reccommend it at all, not worth the money, not worth the time, don't get it, download \\"Deathcrush\\" from [...] to get the whole idea.

B00005JNQ8|5.0|By some way of luck, this film opened, in my region, in Dubai, UAE this weekend, on Tuesday night, 3 days before the wide release in the US.  <br />I saw the film. It was undoubtedly one of the best movies of it's genre. The issue at stake here is world democracy, peace, and the film handles then very well. Nicole Kidman, gave an excellent performance, and so did Sean Penn. The film is not what you may expect. It is not about a woman who tells the truth and no one beleives her, yada yada yada. This film suceeded in doing what other films of the same genre failed- in unveling the story in layers and coming to a conclusion in the end. The film didn't have any plotholes, stupid twist at the end, but was a masterful work of art.  <br />Sydney Pollack was excellent here, and of course James Newton Howard provided a powerful and haunting score.  <br />I loved the film, and this film is the best film of the year so far, so I hope this film suceeds at the box office and is liked by everyone
B00005JNBQ|4.0|The first time I saw this movie I hated it because it lacks well an over-arching plot. It seemed like it was just a bunch of slack jawed vacant eyed losers standing around for an hour and a half. However something within me said to go back and watch it again, simply because everyone had said it was so brilliant. I rarely listen to anybody on matters of taste but I decided to re-watch it because the movie was already sinking it's tentacles into me. <br /> <br />It became better and better with every watching. I don't know how it does it...but that's the effect it has. All I know is I swore I'd never watch it again and now I own it.  <br /> <br />What this movie really is is an atlas of the lost types of people that exist in dullsville towns like Preston Idaho. It captures the ennui of these places and takes you into the mind of a weird dude who is a non conformist in a cornfed place where this is in new way a good thing. All of the people in this movie are lost, even with those who are supposed to be cool had a somewhat desperate and pathetic feeling to them. You know that as bad as they can be they'll wind up stuck in this village for life living off their faded glory like Uncle Rico. But then it was easy for me to feel that way living out West. Summer Wheatly may rule Preston high but she would be just another person at the school dance here in California. See the cartoon 'Totally Spies' for any further information on the types of uber preps we have in this place. <br /> <br />It's also a great freakshow. Napoleon with his tot obessions and bo staff skills, Kip and his internet stalking, Pedro and the holy chip scene that never got put in but should have and above all...REX KWON DO. <br /> <br />A great 'loser' movie. Like if Beavis and Butthead were brought to life and then somehow made into even bigger outcasts than before. But I can't give it 5 stars because it like it's setting seems lethargic. You will root for Napoleon and Pedro but the popular crowd (aside from that bullying skinhead thug Randy) seems more dumb than evil. Oh well, it's a still got alot of mocking value and I will re-watch it. <br /> <br />\\"Are you ready to get your groove on?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Yes.\\" <br /> <br />Ah yes he is the nerdy Micheal Jackson. You will know it, you will obey it and you will fear it. <br />
B00003CXIY|2.0|\\"Road Trip\\" was almost as bad of a movie as \\"Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind\\"!!! There is absolutely NOTHING funny about this tripe. This movie was crap. It is just so stupid. There's too much wasted nudity, and it tries much too hard to be funny, that it isn't.
B0007OCG56|1.0|God, I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to seeing this movie after seeing Paz Vega in \\"Sex and Lucia\\" and then recently seeing Tea Leoni in \\"Flirting With Disaster\\"---both women are just stunning, drop-dead gorgeous as well as being skilled actresses...but both of those movies are far better than this one!<br /><br />Further surprising is the fact that \\"Spanglish\\" is directed by none other than James L. Brooks who's had some real gems in the past, such as \\"Broadcast News.\\"<br /><br />\\"Spanglish\\" however is a true unmitigated disaster.  In fact, it is so bad as to be utterly UNWATCHABLE...I lasted all of 20 minutes, much of it spent sprawled out on the floor in various yoga postures because I wanted to distract myself from the horror that was taking place on the screen and hoping for some sort of miracle to salvage this thing.<br /><br />The best way to describe this movie?  Like DRINKING a pint of maple syrup!  Ugh...it is so in-your-face, bending-over-backwards cutesy and sweet and sugary and saccharine as to induce rapid fire vomiting if seen after a heavy meal.<br /><br />Almost every single character in this film is a one-dimensional by-the-numbers caricature, cliche, or stereotype: Tea Leoni, as the anal retentive hysterical suburbian wife, Paz Vega as the lovely Noble Savage and Hard-Working Immigrant come to soothe and liberate all these suburbian wretches,  Adam Sandler as the usual repressed miserable and put-upon husband (similar role he had in the infinitely better film \\"Punch Drunk Love\\"), a couple of suitably innocent and adorable little kids...bleh!<br /><br />You see the plot devices coming about 200 miles away, this film is so relentlessly cloying and melodramatic, veering between French-like hyper-drama and very American Disney-kitsch, with a good dose of Steven Spielbergian cornball UPLIFTING MESSAGES thrown in just in case you wanted even more sugar.  It relies almost exclusively on language barriers and cross-cultural and socioeconomic differences to move along the obviously focus-grouped-to-death plotline.<br /><br />Worse film I've seen since Spielberg's \\"The Terminal.\\"  Well, at least this one has two attractive female leads...for that I'll give it 1.5 stars!socioeconomic differences to move along the obviously focus-grouped-to-death plotline.   <br /> <br />Worse film I've seen since Spielberg's \\"The Terminal.\\"  Well, at least this one has two attractive female leads...for that I'll give it 1.5 stars!
B0007O38F8|3.0|I'm not just going to recklessly hate on 50 because of personal beefs, so I'll say that this is the nature of the business of Hip-POP today. There are millions of dollars involved today so rappers try to give people what they want, and if they want shoot-em-up, icey, rollin' on dub nonsence let 'em have it. You don' have to listen to it so don't. With that being said, now we know why 50 needed to start more drama with Fat Joe & Jadakiss before this release. At least with GET RICH... he could rap about being shot the hell up. His subject matter is quite suspect on MASSACRE but these are some of the sickest beats I've heard in a Hip-Pop release since GET RICH... That's all I'll say. If you want ignorant (...), look no further.
0316172324|2.0|This book is a typical case of an author who finds a good idea but doesn't figure out how to deliver it. I have been working in Strategic Marketing for over 15 years and was very excited to receive and read Blink. I thought his last book was brilliant but don't waste your money on this one. Go buy yourself a drink instead. In a blink, without thinking. What a dissapointment this read is. Mr. Gladwell chooses all kinds of well known incidents, examples and dissasters to prove his ''Blink concept''. From the New Coke flop(come on Malcolm)to a Pentagon war games excercice. The general idea of the book is: Keep a balance between the emotional and rational parts of your brain when you make a decision. But that doesn't warrant a 276 page book and absolutely not being in the top 10 on the Amazon best seller list. I want to have breakfast now....Blink...Blink... Should I or should I not? My stomach says yes. C'ya.
B000002MT0|3.0|Anyone who listens to this album can hear for themselves that this is not his worst.  I have been listening to his music from the beginning, and believe me he's had a handful of disappointing albums.  This is not one of them.  It is one of his funkiest/sexiest albums ever.  I do not care very much for the personal lives or problems of an artist.  The song is what you care about.  This album contains several songs that will have you grooving to the beat.  Songs like Space, Come, and Letitgo contain some of the craziest grooves he has ever concocted.  You would have to be a biased, brain-dead \\"fan\\" in order not to feel the funk.
B000001IQH|5.0|But although it's only 2nd I suggest getting this as your First Rancid album. It's their breakthrough album for a reason. However, although the overall sound is great and the musicianship is great, this album can be really repetitive. The second half of the album is very easy to get lost in and although some songs stick out (Daly City Train, Disorder and Dissarray) you'll find that most of it sounds very similar. <br />I still suggest getting this though, it's a masterpiece and be sure to pick up Rancid [2000] also (the one with the skull on it), I believe that is Rancid's best album to date.
B00006M183|1.0|I have all of the Pearl Jam studio albums, but I would not consider myself a huge PJ fan. Basically, this album sucks. It's for hard core fans only. The main problem being the songwriting is just plain weak. There is maybe one melody line on the whole album. Eddie just mumbles along in a monotone. There is no excitement, nothing interesting, they are out of ideas.  The lyrics are too self-important. I will never complain about No Code again.
1592400876|4.0|This will be the funniest book you read about the English language for a long time. <br /> <br />I'm a sucker for the dry wit of a British writer, and all the more so when the writer -- like Lynne Truss -- has an axe to grind. Ms. Truss has the kind of sardonic wit that produces lines like this: \\"Sticklers unite, you have nothing to lose but your sense of proportion, and arguably you didn't have a lot of that to begin with.\\"  <br /> <br />But even putting aside the humor, this is a fun and informative read.  Who would have thought you could write an entertaining book on English puctuation? (The book's 5 main chapters cover the apostrophe, the comma, the colon/semicolon, the exclamation point/question mark, and hyphens.)  But however improbable, Ms. Truss does exactly that by artfully weaving together history; amusing stories; examples spanning the good, the bad, and the ugly; literary quotes; and even reader mail to bring her cherished punctuation marks to life. <br /> <br />Read this book, and you'll learn about a battle in 1896 that got started because of a misplaced period (the British call this a \\"full stop\\"), the puctuation mark that caused Milan Kundera to fire one of his early publishers, the typesetter who invented italics, the 8 uses for an apostrophe, and the single comma in a Bible verse that separates Catholic and Protestant doctrine about the afterlife. <br /> <br />I happen to agree with many of the author's positions on when and how to use punctuation. And while I also believe that language should grow and adapt over time, I also believe that careful writers should be mindful of the delicate shades of meaning they can paint with well-punctuated sentences. <br /> <br />If I hadn't agreed with her core thesis, I might have been a little annoyed with her \\"stickler-ism\\". But she realizes the book is not for everyone; her opening sentence reads: \\"either this will ring bells for you, or it won't.\\"
0446677450|3.0|Most of the advice in this book is just merely a guide, a concept of understanding of money and the society that we live in. For example, limit your liabilities and increase your asset is good advice. No, I would not take his advice word for word but his concept is sound and solid. I give him 3 stars for at least trying to bring awareness about how money works.  <br /> <br />As an observer and participant of Silicon Valley tech industry, I noticed that many successful participants of the tech industry started out working for someone, learned the trade, took some risk, built his/her start ups, IPOed or sold out, gain some fame and move on to become an investor or venture capitalist-- from employee to owner to investor---followed similar path to Robert Kiyosaki's thesis.  <br /> <br />What is not shown in many advice books is the holy grail of capitalism; how to make the first million, as in everything the first big break is the hardest to achieve. Perhaps because this vital first is the hardest to teach since people have different approaches to reaching their \\"first\\" based on talents, opportunities and circumstances. My personal advice is still, \\"invest\\" in what you are passionate and good at since all of us have different interest and talents.
B0007TKH66|4.0|I have read alot of the reviews for ENT.  Like one reviewer stated it is either the best or worst show people have seen.  I give it 4 stars because it is a show I enjoyed and I never give anything a perfect review.  Everything has flaws, but ENT was a very good show.  I like others was a little dismayed that at first the show didn't really act as a prequel.  I thought this was the best idea for a Star Trek in a long time.  As in the Star Wars prequels we can see how Anakin becomes Darth Vader and how the Empire came about, lets see how the federation and Starfleet come about.  But the show didn't really follow that until season 4.  This is a good season, and I do understand that with a franchise you must come up with different ideas.  If you like Sci-fi and star trek buy this set.  If you want to wait then definitely buy season 3 and 4 when they are released. <br /> <br />Season 4 is the best all around season of any Star Trek series since season 4 of DS9 and it just might be the best season of any star trek series ever!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I had never been interested in this Goddess's music, but when listening to We Belong Together I fall in love completely with their music style, has a voice that it loves anyone, their first it single It's Like That it is very good, this time mariah overcomes to jennifer lopez because its last album was a total and firm failure, the whole album it is really good I advise to that buy it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love science fiction, but so many of the SF TV series seem contrived and artificial with wooden acting. Firefly gives you a very livable and lived-in feeling -- from the characters to planets to the ship. The characters are very real, very flawed, and totally believable. Each has so many layers that reveal themselves as the series continues. Also, while the overall formula may not be new, the western spin is very fresh and makes sense in the context of the structure of their civilization. Further, so many TV series plots are so transparent that they hold few if any surprises -- not so with Firefly! I have found many total shocks and even belly laughs that remain dumbfounding and/or funny even on repeat viewing. I hope you enjoy this series as much as I have.
0385720920|5.0|This was my first experience in the world of Chuck Palahniuk, and although some argue this is one of his weakest novels; I found it to be truly amazing. <br /> <br />The story did not seem interesting from the description, but on the reccomendation of a good friend I picked up \\"CHOKE\\".  The book was just \\"good\\" until the last 100 pages.  That is where the true brilliance of the author comes through.  Every plot twist is unexpected, but fitting.  Every so often you worry that the book has crossed a line, but as we're told by the author throughout the novel, maybe there is no line too dangerous to cross.  Maybe, we need to explore reality and question the unknown.  Palahniuk pulls this off with amazing prose; I would reccomend this to anyone.  Except of course for those under the age of 18.  This is the story of a recovering sex addict and Palahniuk makes that quite clear several times. <br /> <br />
0385336810|3.0|I've read all of Kinsella's Shopaholic books and was beginning to tire of the main character in those books. It's nice to have a new character to read about.  This book has a similiar feel to that series where the character does herself in. In this case with her inability to stop herself from talking too much. Overall it was an entertaining read even if you could predict what was going to happen in the end it was what you were rooting for.
0375704027|5.0|In the 80s I was a young bookworm when the entire Japan was reading Norwegian Wood. I saw advertisement banners in trains, buses, everywhere in town, and of course in bookstores, but I was a twisted kid then that I refused to read it just because everybody was reading it, thinking people were just after a trend that would go away after a while.<br /><br />Many years have passed without reading Murakami, and I now live in America, being told by Argentineans and Americans, that they like Murakami. After 12 years of not visiting Japan, I did visit Japan in 2004 and could no longer ignore Murakami's book because Norwegian Wood was still in every bookstore and even in train stations! People in Latin America and Europe are also reading Murakami, and I would only look stupid if they can talk about Murakami and I, a Japanese person, have no idea what it is. Casual talks at parties with intellects became a proof of my ignorance. So finally I read the famous \\"Norwegian Wood\\" in the original Japanese language while visiting Japan.<br /><br />I felt as if a huge hammer, as huge as a truck, hit my head at once. For years and years I was clinging to my own assumption of the silly pop writer, but now I cannot possibly deny the good quality of the writing when I finally read it. \\"Work of Art\\" was what I had to conclude.<br /><br />I don't like the cover design of the English version. I like the original cover design when the book was published in 1987 in Japan.
0060723513|1.0|The book is a fabrication, as the author has admitted -- Google for \\"Apology to Australian Elders\\" to see the details.    If you are American, try imagining how you would react to a similar book which purported to be about a lost tribe of Native Americans -- you probably wouldn't believe it.  It's only because Australia is far away from this book's target market, and Aboriginal culture is almost completely unknown to its readers, that the author managed to get away with her fraud.    And if you knew this book was a fantasy novel, you would be less likely to respond with the awe and emotion that more gullible readers have reported.  There are genuine communities of people on this Earth who lead lives which are exemplary in some respects; so there is really no excuse for inventing a new breed of \\"noble savage\\".
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I haven't always been a huge fan of Shania Twain...I collected every other album or so, and listened to them occasionally. However, when my parents gave this CD to me for my birthday, I suddenly found myself with my headphones glued to my ears, listening to Shania nonstop. 19 out of the 21 hits are pure gold, and they are so varied in style that there is a song for every country music fan. One of the biggest plus-es of the album is that the songs are spread around. For instance, the album starts out with a tender ballad, then goes on to a dance-able anthem. On one of Ms. Twain's last albums, \\"Up!\\", she put all of the upbeat songs on one CD, and the slower songs on the second. The community of fans was split in half; some were pleased with the upbeat/downbeat division, and other fans wished that they had been mixed up amongst each other. I was more of the latter, so this CD was a great step up for Shania. Now, I'll give my reviews of each song: <br /> <br />1. Forever and For Always 8.5/10---This song has a beautiful melody, vocals, and message, but the lyrics get a bit recycled. <br /> <br />2. I'm Gonna Getcha Good! 15/10---One of my favorite Shania songs. It's upbeat, dance-able, and very fun to listen to and sing along with. The lyrics are simple, and yet very powerful (\\"I've already planned it/ Here's how it's gonna be/ I'm gonna love you and you're gonna fall in love with me\\") <br /> <br />3. Up! 7/10---The melody and vocals are good, but the lyrics are less than impressive: \\"Even my skin is acting weird/ I wish that I could grow a beard\\"  o_O <br /> <br />4. Come on Over 9/10---Fun, carefree, and lighthearted, Shania is obviously having a good time as she sings this. <br /> <br />5. Man! I Feel Like A Woman! 15/10---Need I say more? This excellent song has proven to be an anthem for women everywhere and a great karaoke number. Just TRY to listen this through without singing, or even humming, along. <br /> <br />6. That Don't Impress Me Much 10/10---This is thedance version. This beat is great and the lyrics are well-written, and Shania has fun with it. <br /> <br />7. From This Moment 10/10---This song, which is super-popular for weddings, is beautiful, sweet, and very touching. The instrumentals are stirring, and Shania's voice soars. <br /> <br />8. Honey, I'm Home 5/10---This is definately not one of Ms. Twain's better songs. The lyrics are downright awful, and the beat is not very fitting. For instance, it goes from the foot-stomping aura of Queen's \\"We Will Rock You,\\" then the chorus has a honkey-tonk vibe. <br /> <br />9. You're Still the One 10/10---A very beautiful and haunting ballad about eternal love (awww).  <br /> <br />10. Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You) 6/10---The melody is very catchy, but the lyrics are kind of repetative. Also, the one verse \\"Don't freak out until you know the facts/ Relax...Max!\\" throws me off every time I hear it. <br /> <br />11. Love Gets Me Every Time 8/10---Catchy, carefree, and fun. However, the lyric \\"I gol' darn gone and done it\\" is kind of weird...Oh well. <br /> <br />12. No One Needs To Know 10/10---I really like this song about a secret crush. Very country-ish, it is well-written and catchy. <br /> <br />13. You Win My Love 9/10---This song has a great tune. I can't find much wrong with it. <br /> <br />14. (If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here! 8/10---This sultry song about men who carelessly pick up women has a great beat and lyrics, but it sounds like Shania's trying to make her voice sexy, and it doesn't really give the sound she was obviously going for (It sounds like she's drunk, actually). <br /> <br />15. The Woman In Me (Needs The Man In You) 9/10---Slow and beautiful, but again, Shania is trying to make her voice sound sexy...*YOU SOUND FINE NATURALLY, SHANIA!* However, the song is one of my favorites. <br /> <br />16. Any Man of Mine 15/10---The song that jump-started Ms. Twain's career. She shines, and was apparently having fun when she recorded this. It'll have you singing along in no time. <br /> <br />17. Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under? 10/10---Catchy song about an adulterous lover. Shania's showing her country roots here, and she sounds great. <br /> <br />18. Party For Two 10/10---This version with Mark McGrath is super dance-able, and the music and the two singers are great, but I like the one with BillY Currington better. <br /> <br />19. Don't! 8/10---This slow ballad is very sweet and moving. The chorus is very haunting, and the backup singers do their job nicely. <br /> <br />20. Party For Two 15/10---Who care's if Billy Currington sounds a little flat on his first few notes? He and Shania are exploding with chemistry, and that makes the song great. You'll want to jump up and dance with this song. <br /> <br />21. I Ain't No Quitter 0/10---Oh my God. Shania, what were you thinking when you recorded this? Just ten seconds into the song, I was wanting to you to \\"Quit\\" singing and shut up.  <br /> <br />Bad songs aside, if you're a Shania fan, or just a country music fan, you do not want to miss this album. Buy it today! <br /> <br />
0060922583|5.0|This is a great introduction to the core concepts of quantum mechanics, string theory, and occult truth.  I recommend this book to everyone, and it excels in the capacity of a gift, 'cause it really blows \\"normals\\" minds!  Difficult concepts are presented clearly.  This book is a breeze to read, and can be easily understood even by those with no scientific background.  What is real?  No-one knows for sure -- physicists, astronomers, and microbiologists surely don't!  The more we \\"learn\\" about the universe, the more puzzling things become.  Why does the new data fail to make sense?  Perhaps science has been wrong all along?  It would seem that we reside in a multidimensional world, of which we are only partially aware -- walking around \\"blind\\", if you will.  So much is constantly going on around us that the human eye cannot percieve -- and many things that it can percieve the brain fails to comprehend.  The world is an illusion!  Stop trying to over-analyze everything and just relax . . . it's all-good.
0743487478|5.0|This book is thus far the one that has made the biggest impact on my parenting -- hands down. I've only had the book 24 hours and it has already made a HUGE difference in my relationship with my daughter (almost 2). Absolutely nothing about how I feel about her has changed -- the feelings of love and concern for her haven't changed a bit -- but I'm certain her perception of how I feel about her has changed dramatically. That she can sense and appreciates the changes is completely palpable. <br />        I'm astounded and so very grateful.
0156027321|5.0|You probably will love this  book. It starts out a little herky-jerky. But captures its stride and you end up being enveloped in the wondrous journey of the boy and his tiger. This is such rich, complex imagery, the tale meanders and swallows you whole...suspending yiour disbelief. Delicious...like a yummy ice cream sundae.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Does anyone know the name of the song or artist who sings the song in the opening credits of Closer?
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf is a very well done holiday comedy. I thought the story of a human being raised by elves and then returning to his rightful father was clever and there are many very funny scenes. I know a lot of people like or dislike this movie depending on whether they like or dislike Will Ferrell. I had no opinion going in as this was the first of his movies I had seen and I don't watch Saturday Night Live. I thought he was very funny and was just about perfectly cast in this role. Some people say his character was too stupid. Well, he wasn't a bright light, but I think his actions were driven more by naivete than stupidity and that's how the movie leads you to the Christmas spirit that's at its core.
B000003BF1|5.0|I am going through a period where I am very obsessed with everything The World's Greatest RockNRoll Band did, I checked out their albums like \\"Exile on the Main street\\" Which is thier best. But \\"Let it bleed\\" is not far behind. The album has Two of the greatest rock songs ever recorded, \\"Gimmie Shelter\\" and \\"You Can't always Get what want\\" are Unreal; two of rock's all-time greatest tunes. But those are only Two songs; \\"let it Bleed\\" has Seven more Equally great songs. The title track is one of my favorite Rolling stones songs and \\"You Got The Silver\\" is one of their best Love songs. Overall \\"Let it Bleed\\" is one the Stones Top Three Albums and one of Rock's all Time great albums.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Deadwing is really a milestone in recording. This was my first exposure to the band and hopefully not my last. The song selection and positions on this release are perfect. There is no filler on Deadwing. The music excites and crackles with energy and purpose. My favorite cuts are Deadwing, Lazarus, Halo, and the epic Arriving Somewhere But Not Here, but you can play this CD start to finish without the thought of hitting the skip fuction.
0151008116|5.0|Well, some parts weren't so pleasant (that whole being stuck on a boat with a tiger thing)!  I've never read anything like it before, so it was very refreshing as fiction goes.  Afraid it didn't make me believe in God, though, despite the hopes of the Indian gentleman mentioned in the first few chapters... :)  I read the book within a leisurely couple of days, and it was enjoyable from start to finish.  The pace of the book certainly changes once the ship goes down.  I don't want to include any spoilers, so suffice it to say that this is a smooth, easy read with lots of adventure.  Definitely recommended.
067101756X|1.0|This book is just waste pulp, poor writting as you can get in UFO disinformation, other high rank military  official ,opening the X files up and breaking all his non disclosure agreement with Uncle Sam,please folks, be more creative! So many contradictions, like the one credit Roswell for the invention of the transistor early 50', any undergraduate engineering student will know just by following the track of inventions,from the vacuom valve to the semiconductor nazi technology of late 30' and research at the time  than this was not acomplished from any ETs help,so.Plus you got to see the video Mr Corzo sound so unconvincing is one more of many nice try for us to believe at the \\"official\\" version of ETs, my personal opinion  ETs phenomena is very real as same as all experimental and  exotic aircraft, but Big Uncle had no control or knowledge to much more than us in that matter , THEY want you to believe they are running the show, jee, please, lies and more lies.I gave him one star'cause he probably manage to sell a few thousand copies to all those die hard ufologist.

6305903182|4.0|With the Scream series coming to an end, we find Sydeny hidden away in the hills of California where she is sure she can't be found, so that the ghost masked killer couldn't find her and destory what's left of her life and friends.  But somehow, the killer does find her.  And brings her out of hiding with several murders around Hollywood and the set of the new sequel to the \\"stab\\" movies, which are based in what happened in the previous films.  As the body count mounts our heros must find out who is the killer or killers before they become the next victim of the \\"movie\\".  The plot twist at the end is a generic but good ending to the entire series.
B0002UXBD6|1.0|For starters, to at least get one or two people to consider reading this review, I don't completely hate Green Day.  I'm not some entirely anti-punk, unopinionated person sitting here with nothing better to do than hate on Green Day.  But let me say this much:  this album is a disappointment, a disappointment that, for whatever reason, everyone seems to own.  This album falls short of Green Day's one true achievement musically, \\"Nimrod\\", their post-\\"Dookie\\"  musical enterprise.  I will say this much:  I did like Nimrod well enough (3 star review), and, for a pop-punk album, 3 stars is pretty good.  But American Idiot has completely earned its 1 star from me, because, just, wow, this album is really pretty crappy.  This is the epitome of pop punk, three chords, black eye liner, and anti-Bush campaigning (though I am a devout independent, all the pop-punk groups doing anti-bush stuff , its too much).  To put it track by track, american idiot falls short on so many occasions that its \\"highlights\\" are completely obscured by mediocrity.  American Idiot (the song) is an absolutely awful intro, I hope Green Day really did release that song as a joke, I really do hope they did, because that song is so profoundly lacking in any sort of musical depth it is amazing.  To be perfectly honest, it sounds like a three minute Black Flag song, which is a terrible thing.  Track 2, oh, crap, 9 minute Green Day song.  Enough said.  Track 3, sadly, the album's highlight, \\"Holiday\\" isn't terrible by any means, and it was the first song I heard from the album via a classmate.  I was hoping that the album would keep up that pace, but, after the first two songs, I was about ready to turn the cd off.  Fourth song, melancholy Dashboard Confessional-esque sad song, i hate you emo kids, \\"boulevard of broken dreams\\" is so bad, so intolerably grating, i can barely sit through its 4+ minutes of stereotypical emo music.  Next song, one of the albums absolute low points, so bad, so very, very bad, and, to be completely honest, the album doesnt pick up at all from there on out, its just crap followed by more crap, punctuated by an occasional emo anthem.   <br /> <br />Bottom Line: <br />Green Day:  never, ever produce another album like this, better yet, call it quits after this tour, because, inevitably things will go on a downhill from here on out.  I miss the days of \\"Nimrod\\".  Oh, and anyone that actually read this whole thing and still likes the album, go buy a Radiohead cd, any Radiohead cd (you'd probably love \\"Pablo Honey\\").  I guarantee you, it is a million times better, a million times deeper.  <br /> <br />The Karma Police are out to get you American Idiots.
B00005NRO3|4.0|The follow up to the surprise hit of '96.  It follows Sydeny to an Ohio college where she is still haunted by what happened to her in the first film.  As time goes by she finds that their is another killer who is out on the lose trying to kill the survivors of the orignal film.   <br /> <br />      This film play a pardy on horror sequel movies.  With some well timed humor, Trivia answers and plot twists.  This film is quite the entertaining film that brought the first film to its hieghts.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Having seen this great film i am really disappointed at the negative reviews given by the media and public alike! <br /> <br />Thankfully the original cast was replaced by a more youthful group of rising stars. Nothing against them mind you, If Michael Crawford had taken his usual role as the Phantom i doubt whether the younger generation would have taken a second glance at it. With Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum in the lead roles there was more of an appeal to new fans. <br /> <br />The songs are still vibrant and emotive. The sets, scenery and costumes are mindblowing! There is no need to upset the old and new fans of this great film because it's not your sort of thing! <br /> <br />If you are already a fan of anything Phantom get this DVD!!
B000002U82|5.0|Let's not beat around the bush!  This album is on the top of many lists.  The equation basically is, if A is you like Rock'N'Roll and B is you like to space out from time to time then the result is C you probably already own Dark Side of The Moon.  People who really dig music know which albums are good from the first to last song....Pearl Jams TEN, Led Zeppelin IV, AND most definitely Pink Floyds' Dark Side of the Moon are albums which you rarely jump to the next track on.  In fact, Dark Side is so good, the CD should have an encryption that disables the jump forward button.  5 out of 5 if you ROCK, 3 out of 5 if you RAP, and 0 out of 5 if your other 9 discs are Britney albums.
B0007GAERG|4.0|This cd is like Mariah old stuff with a little hip-hop to it. The love songs are so great and it is diffrent and similar to her other albums. I like this a lot can't stop playing it.
B000002UB3|5.0|IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE BEATLES, DON'T READ ANOTHER WORD!!\\"  The album ABBEY ROAD is the swan song to a brilliant career for a band who easily place first in the \\"Let's Make It Better Next Time\\" category.  Huge and moderate fans of The Beatles will agree and disagree til' the next millenium as to what is the best album or best songs of The Beatles.  In a nutshell, much of the earlier Beatles stuff were big hit singles that were catchy as hell.  The stand out albums were Revolver, Sgt Peppers and Abbey Road (basically because on these albums The Beatles reinvented themselves again and again) ABBEY ROAD has one of the best songs made from this bands huge catalog of slow songs in \\"Something\\".  Even Sinatra, who couldn't have cared a damn about rock bands indicated he loved this song.  Also, the second half of the disc from the \\"Sun King\\" on, could practically be a series of songs in a Broadway show as they meld into each other.  If you are saying to yourself, \\"I hate Broadway songs\\" (like me)...you may then ask yourself, \\"But if The Beatles sang these Broadway songs....?\\" ABBEY ROAD is a path you will find you were happy to go down.

1400031087|5.0|Are you tired of self-pitying sob-stories of people in their 20's? Well, so is James Frey. A Million Little Pieces tells of Frey's hardcore way of life, and his long road to recovery.  This book teaches of choices and learning that you have to take responsibility for the consequences for those actions sooner or later. <br /> <br />James Frey is a 23 year old who was closer to death than a 90 year old with terminal cancer.  \\"My front four teeth are gone, I have a hole in my cheek, my nose is broken, and my eyes are nearly swollen shut.  My clothes are covered with spit, snot, urine, and blood.\\"  This is the way you find James at the beginning of the book.  He's on an airplane with no idea of where he's going or where he's coming from.  You find that Frey is headed to a clinic for recovery from drug abuse; the clinic has the highest success rate in the nation with 13% of its patients never relapsing. <br /> <br />It is during this time that we find that James has more skeletons in his closet than he seems to lead on.  You travel with James through the journey of sobriety in vivid detail of everything that takes place.  He then meets and befriends many people, such as a mobster, a judge, a hooker, and an ex-championship boxer, who all teach him to become a better man. <br /> <br />Sometimes the only way to get through situations that seem impossible is to believe in yourself.  James Frey shows this statement to be true in its best form in his book A Million Little Pieces.  You can also find in Frey's book that even though it may seem as though your actions are only hurting yourself, but you are actually hurting the people who love you the most even more than yourself. <br /> <br />This book is great for any high school student who thinks that dropping out and doing drugs is their best option.  Or, it is also a good book for any adult to read.  This book teaches that you can achieve anything just as long as you just keep holding on and believing in yourself.  This is agreat book for anyone's collection. I recommend it highly. <br />
B000001GPX|5.0|the 5th: <br />Wow, what a recording! I was a little hesitant b/c I've not had good experiences w/older recordings, but this one blows any Beethoven performance I've ever heard out of the water. I've played it before (I'm a flautist) and invariably winced when the French horns come in and either flub up, or seem tentative on their solos. But in this recording I swear I felt the heavens open up whenever they played. And the double piccolo runs in the fourth movement, usually late (in other recordings) were technically flawless. (I could go on picking apart more shortcomings of other recordings, but you get the idea.) Here, all movements are executed precisely, but with incredible emotion as well. An elusive combination. I sounds like the orchestra & conductor are one, and that all are having a magical time peforming together.  <br /> <br />The 7th: <br />a very very good performance as well, but it's definitely overshadowed by the majesty of the 5th.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00005R8FI|5.0|And it's GREAT. Read the other 5-start reviews, they're all correct, this is unique stuff. Sometimes very laid-back meandering, sometimes very uptempo.  <br />By the way, if you like this one, you might enjoy Steve Winwood's \\"About Time\\" even if his other work doesn't thrill you
B000002B5L|5.0|I don't know why I am just now hearing this album, it is almost ten years old. I cannot believe I passed this one up. The entire album is great, but Lauryn is spectacular as a singer and lyricist.  My favorite song is \\"The Zelots.\\" She rips it on that track. Where is the next Fugees album. Damn, I really slept on this one.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I think this is an absolutely beautiful film, the cast are all fantastic, down to the smallest parts, the set is breathtaking, and the whole story is just brilliant. There are definitely a few alterations I would make, but I'll come to that later. <br /> <br />Storyline's quite simple, big ship, everyone boards it, poor people, middling people, sparkling rich, socialite people. Rich girl Rose falls for poor boy Jack, and vice versa even more so, BUT.... problem - Rose is engaged to mean and slimey Caledon Hockley. Everything is just getting steamy and romantic when, BIGO problemo, there are ice warnings.  <br /> <br />This is, in my opinion, the beginning of the most exciting part. The acting of Jack and Rose is very good, but it is cheesy and not particularly believable. It's the REAL heroes who really make it, all the crew, captain, Mr Andrews etc. I mean, they were the proper heroes, weren't they? I was TOTALLY AND UTTERLY moved by 1st officer and 5th officers, their beautiful performances have me sobbing every single time. You actually feel like you are ON the boat in this movie. <br /> <br />There is nudity in this, Rose is drawn by Jack naked and they have sex in her fiancee's Renault. The emotional intensity of it is what makes it unsuitable for young children though. I first watched it when it first came out  here in England in late '97 when I was 6 and a half, and the people falling and the boat snapping and the officer shooting himself in the head were too much for me, and to be honest I think you really have to be at least 12 or 13 to appreciate this film fully.  <br /> <br />Alterations - as I have said yeah I would include more of the crew, and perhaps make it even MORE emotional (if that's possible!), but then I'm a perfectionist sort of girl. <br /> <br />Once again, this is a beautiful movie. EVERYONE has to see it, it's just one of those films, like Mary Poppins or Ben Hur, that we ALL have to see, and if you're over 12 or so it is just the perfectfilm if you want a giggle, a good old howl, or a terrorised grip at the sofa. Top class stuff, full marks. x x x
B000002AVF|5.0|Listening to this album recently was pure \\"ear-gasmic bliss\\".  Mariah was definitely on point vocally & this is one of the most balanced, well-produced albums that I've had the pleasure of listening to.  When an artist has the kind of career & catalog that Mariah has, it's fun to go back in time & listen to previous releases to get a sense of how much he/she has grown.  My song by song review:<br /><br />Fantasy - works on all levels: great use of a sample, fun lyrics, got me excited about what more was to come from this album.  10/10<br /><br />Underneath the Stars - this is one of my favorite Mariah ballads. I love how her vocals were layered so that it sounds like a whole choir is backing her.  100/10<br /><br />One Sweet Day - another \\"perfect storm\\" collaboration.  MC with Boyz II Men created one of the most beautifully touching songs about losing a loved one (ranks up there with GC Cameron's \\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\\").  100/10<br /><br />Open Arms - not my fav Mariah remake but it's still a beautiful song. 7/10<br /><br />Always Be My Baby - great feel good song, nice melody and I was very surprised that Jermaine Dupree worked on the lyrics & melody with MC (my prejudice about his hip/hop rap roots). 9.5/10<br /><br />I Am Free - beautifully inspirational song.  9.5/10<br /><br />When I Saw You -beautiful ballad esp the sing-song chorus. 9.5/10<br /><br />Long Ago - very funky beat, great mid-tempo track that still makes me want to get up & dance.  10/10<br /><br />Melt Away - this is the only 'meh' track to me on the disc but even given my indifference, Mariah's voice saves it.  8.5/10<br /><br />Forever - pretty ballad with a kind of '50's doowop song vibe to it. 9.5/10<br /><br />Daydream interlude - really pretty interlude, great beat (loved it almost as much as the \\"Butterfly reprise\\") 10/10<br /><br />Looking In - heartfelt biographical ballad.  9/10
1401206905|5.0|This is one of the best pieces on Batman I have ever read. It really has some awesome action and great character development of Bruce Wayne and Lt. Gordon. This is right up there with \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and I personally think its better. Thank you Frank Miller. You are awesome.
B000024D5J|5.0|Fast buzzsaw guitars backed by a bouncy rhythm section and lead singer Feargal Sharkey's quavering vocals make for a powerful pop punch. The way true pop music should be with the longest song clicking in at a blistering 2:45--fast, fun and fantabulaous tunes. I dare you to listen to Teenage Kicks or Male Model and not be up pogoing across the room. Infectious!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I too loved the song playing when Mark walked out -- totally haunting.  I'm pretty sure it's the Dido song Here With Me, which is on the soundtrack.
B000059Z8M|5.0|In this review I actually have 3 subjects to brag about! First I am going to brag about Amazon.com. I really don't think they get enough praise for the work they do for us! <br />I went to the new 'Overstock' and they had one of five things I was looking for. The price was a couple of dollars lower but Amazon.com had ALL of the items and because my order was over $20 I got FREE SHIPPING! I have dealt with this company in the past and any time there has been a mistake it has been fixed immediately and the mistakes have been VERY MINIMUM! THANKS AMAZON! <br />Now for Toy Story. I never got to go the the movies to see it but being a Toy fanatic and having a broken leg at the time I ordered it from Amazon.com (who else?) and had it delivered straight to my door. It was fantastic and I do believe it could be Disney at his best! <br />So then part two came out and I had to go to the theatres to see it plus put it on pre-order from Amazon.com. So I went and saw it and it was so much better then the first. I'm not a Star Wars fan at all but I did get the little jokes in the movie and I can't help but be impressed but the 'life-like' impersinations of the human world. It was abosoultely marvelous.  <br />Old and new characters and a similar but different story-line make this movie one of the very best from Disney.

0679777547|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I had to read it for a literature class and was pleasantly surprised to find it such an intriguing read. Definitely recommend it to anyone that liked the Da Vinci Code. This fast paced suspense/mystery is a must read!
B00004ZD69|5.0|while i do prefer f#a# to this album, i can say this is a complete triumph.  starting with the epic intro of 'storm' comlete with horns, the album moves with many shifts from ambience to progressive rockish stuff to near avant-garde.  so it is basically what you will expect from a post rock band.  my favorite track is the third 'sleep' with its massive climaxes that are intoxicatingly dense.  there are a lot of great moments on here, some soft, some loud, some slow, some faster, it has it all.  get this is you want some good experimental stuff.  i still do not know a great deal about this whole post-rock genre, but i am certainly inclined to listen more.
B0002X314C|3.0|When I first heard the song \\"ordinary people\\", i was very excited to go and pick up the cd.  I thought someone was actually talking about love and trying to make a relationship work.  When i got it thought, i saw that a lot of the tracks were talking about cheating and infidelity.  The song i disliked the most was \\"Alright\\".  When i heard it, i kind of felt like it was an attempt to show his \\"pimp\\" side while still showing his vocals.  The whole song just didnt feel right to me.   <br />      On a good note, i really liked the songs like Stay With You, I Can Change, and It Dont Have To Change.  They were all about something real that pretty much everyone can relate too.  I feel like John Legend has a lot of potential, but should decide what kind of artist he wants to be and what kind of message he wants to send out. <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|this had to be the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. i was bored through the opening credits when they kept bringing plates of food out with the names of actors and producers and such written in ketchup and various condiments. this movie had about 3 funny moments to it. my g/f wanted me to turn the movie off 10 minutes into it. i thought i would tough it out to the end since i had heard so many great raves about this movie. i wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. i think you have to be high on drugs or some other substance to appreciate this movie. it definitely sucked bad. pedro and napoleon gave half awake performances and the uncle character was only briefly amusing.  <br />steer clear of this movie if you're looking for something to provoke thought or any other reaction. i want to sue the production company to see if i can have the 95 minutes of my life back that they stole from me. blah! <br />

0790731452|3.0|In such a massive star-studded film, you'd think it'd be super awesome. Well it's mildly awesome with some funny parts, lame parts and chuckle parts, just like any comedy. Always the quirky filmmaker, Tim Burton made a film that looks unique even when the influences are so obvious. <br /> <br />Out of the caverns of Mars comes hundreds of alien spacecraft and they're parked right outside Earth. Rather than being hush hush like typical Americans, they tell the whole world and show the pictures on newspapers. Only thing is the Americans are foolishly optimistic in thinking this is the greatest thing ever. So they meet the Martians and due to a hippy's dove, the martians wage war on earthlings. <br /> <br />This movie can accurately be described as campy kind of funny. Many of these scenes are funny simply because they're so silly and off the cuff, like when martians knock over tribal statues with a massive ball and cry \\"strike!\\" in their own language.  Or even when they start dancing to Tom Jones. <br /> <br />There is however some hilarious moments and quite frankly they all come from one actor: Sylvia Sidney, who passed in 1999. She has many funny moments in the film including her infamous line \\"they blew up Congress!\\" and laughs. <br /> <br />The effects in some parts look kinda bad. There's one explosion near the end when spacecraft meets building that just looks bad. Some of the alien effects look good however and the disintegration effects look nice in certain scenes. <br /> <br />If it's good ol' mindless action you want with some comedy mixed in, can't go wrong here.
0792843584|4.0|Michael Cimino's \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is certainly not without its problems, but it's hard to believe, now that the historical context in which the film was released is long past, that it received such a rough drubbing when it came out 25 years ago. It's quite an interesting film and even a very well made one. It bears many similarities to Cimino's earlier success, \\"The Deer Hunter\\": a focus on male solidarity and conflict, man returning to a more primitive state, a narrative structure that has the protagonist moving from civilization to a barbaric world and then back to a civilization that will be changed forever by preceding events. Like \\"The Deer Hunter,\\" this films deals in images more than words. Unlike \\"The Deer Hunter,\\" however, and this film's biggest failing, is the lack of a cast of the same strength that graced Cimino's earlier film. \\"The Deer Hunter\\" had Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken. \\"Heaven's Gate\\" gets Christopher Walken, but in a role for which he is ill suited, and instead of De Niro and Streep we get Kris Kristofferson and Isabelle Huppert. I don't know <br />what possessed Cimino to think Kristofferson could carry a film of this magnitude, but it's a dire miscalculation on his part. Kristofferson isn't necessarily a horrible actor, but he's certainly not strong enough to retain an audience's interest over the course of a 219 minute film. Isabelle Huppert is bland as well. The result is long scenes with little or no dialogue, in which feelings are supposedly being expressed in the faces of the actors; but since the actors aren't very strong, nothing is getting expressed. That's what makes \\"Heaven's Gate\\" much longer than it needs to be. There's really only a wisp of a tory, so if we're not fully engaged in the characters, what exactly are we supposed to be engaged in? However, the weak cast and writing aside, \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is still a remarkable achievement in its own way, and a much better film than a new generation of movie lovers has been led to believe. Cimino may stumble with actors, but he's got a iron-clad grasp of visuals, and puts some stunning and memorable images on the screen. The film feels much more like a product of the 70's than it does the 80's. At various times, it reminded me of \\"Little Big Man,\\" \\"McCabe and Mrs. Miller,\\" and \\"The Wild Bunch.\\" If that esteemed company doesn't serve as an endorsement of this film, I don't know what does. <br /> <br />Grade: B
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Marc Blucas is amazing.  His performance was right on as the love interest.  Blucas is nothing short of a male fantasy of perfection.  I could watch the movie over and over just to hear his voice or see him give Katie his sweatshirt.  I look forward to the next Blucas movie.  I cannot think of another leading man I'd rather watch.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Emmy Rossum stars as Christine Daae, a young dancer with the Opera Populaire in Paris. She has been having her voice trained by the mysterious 'Angel of Music' so when the Diva, Carlotta (brilliantly portrayed by Minnie Driver) storms out, Christine is propelled into the lead role of the opera house's latest production.<br /><br />What Christine doesn't realise is that her angel of music is also the infamous Phantom and that he is obsessed with her. As Christine falls in love with her childhood sweetheart, Raoul de Chagny (Patrick Wilson), the phantom becomes increasingly unbalanced and determined to possess the young singer no matter what.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher's glossy production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's best loved musical stars, for the most part, a relatively unknown cast, but that doesn't detract in any way from the quality of the film. Rossum was only 17 when this was filmed but she brings a remarkable maturity to her role and she has an incredibly good voice. Gerard Butler, who plays the phantom, doesn't have such a strong voice, but, thanks in the main to his sympathetic and sensitive portrayal of the tortured creature, he pulls it off. A real surprise was Jennifer Ellison (better known to British viewers as the young soap star from 'Brookside') who plays Meg, Christine's best friend. In this role, Ellison shows she can not only act but can sing very well too. Minnie Driver, cast as the spoiled, conceited Carlotta, injects humour and exuberance into her role. She is the only cast member who doesn't perform her own songs but you cannot tell this when watching the film.<br /><br />As would be expected from such a production, the cinematography is outstanding, the costumes are sumptuous and the sets are marvellous. This DVD is presented over 2 discs. Disc 1 is the movie while disc 2 has a wealth of extras such as 'Behind the Mask; the story of Phantom of the Opera', various featurettes and several music videos taken from stage versions of the musical. For those willing to search, there are also some hidden extras; I have found 4 so far.

0385510438|2.0|What has happenned to the author of such thrillers as The Firm, and Runaway Jury ?  With The Last Juror Grisham seems to be continuing his journey to who knows where ( but obviously the trip includes the bank ). <br /> <br />I really wanted to like this book, but didn't.  Whoever wrote the NY Times  reivew on the cover, \\" One of his best: a thouughtful and atmospheric thirller\\"  clearly did not  read the book.  It might be atmospheric, but a thriller it isn't.  Also, it seems real preachy, ie hard working loveable black mother raises a bunch of PhD's and charms the young newspaper editor with food and stories about how hard it was back in the dark old days in Mississippi.  Been there and got the t-shirt many times. <br />   <br />This book is in the category of Grisham's The Testament for which he should have been prosecuted for writing. <br /> <br />Save your money.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne's lack of talent cannot be denied.  It is a fact, not an opinion that this dirty looking lowlife is untalented.  First of all, Avril Lavigne is not a singer.  She doesn't sing.  She \\"yells\\" her songs.  It doesn't take talent to screech into a microphone like a cat with its balls caught in a vice!  All Avril Lavigne does is scream into the microphone and turn up her distorted guitar until everyone in the room is deaf.  Yep, some talent that takes!  Thank you Avril, for saving the music industry!  Your deafening volume, angry yelling, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is are SUCH improvements over Britney Spears and Christina Agulira!   <br /> <br />Do you Avril Lavigne fans really think that angry yelling takes talent to do?  Do you really think it takes talent to strum the strings of a guitar?  It takes no talent at all!  Oh well, I guess you'll just have to learn the hard way.  In a few years you'll look back and realize that you used to worship a dirty looking lowlife who can't even sing in a single octave without sounding like a tortured cat.  You've got to grow up some time, and when you do, you'll be sorry you were ever a fan of Avril Lavigne.  But in the meantime, go ahead and keep riding your \\"Sk8bOaRdZ\\" and wearing your shabby tomboy clothes.  That way you'll look just like your idol, Avril! <br /> <br />\\"ROCK ON!\\"  \\"Duh!\\"
B0007WF1WI|5.0|When Britney released this album in 2003, everything changed for her with her music. Instead of bubbly-pop music lilke her previous albums, she got into techno-pop, RnB, ballads, pop, and everything in between.  <br /> <br />Her first single off that album \\"Me against the Music\\" proved that Britney still has staying power in the everchanging world of pop music. The song dueted with Madonna won best dance single of the year of the Billboard awards. This song defiently deserved that award! <br /> <br />Her second single and probably her second most known song (behind her first smash hit, Baby one more time) Toxic proved once again that Britney can rule the Billboard charts 100, her peak point was #9! The Video for this song is on the DualDisk and its awesome! Directed by Joseph Kahn, the video depicts Britney in a women out for revenge! Also a airplain waitress, motorcycle vixon, and a diamond beauty! This song is still playing everywhere and several remixes and covers of this song surfaced after this song came out! So I suppose Britney is quite popular (or this song) with the rock bands such as Local H! <br /> <br />Her third single, a powerful ballad, Everytime came as a suprise to everyone! The Video showed Britney vulernable to Love! The orignal Plot of the video was Britney taking pills and getting an overdose due to the pills. But MTV and everyone else said it would be to dangerous since her fans' age, so the video is showed Britney's head bleeding due to a unknown thing and Britney drowing but during the video, she is reborn into a baby! But then at the end Britney comes up from the water smiling. The video is quite amazing and one of Brit's best! <br /> <br />Her Fourth single \\"Outrageous\\" had a terrible fate. During the shooting of this video, Britney's knee broke and she had to get surgey, causing her to cancel this video shoot and the rest of her Onyx Hotel Tour! But this song got radio play despite no video and was on the White Chicks soundtrack! <br /> <br />Also included in the DualDisk, is Britney's meagamix video! 6 glorious years of Britney warped into a four minute video! Very awesome video indeed!!!! <br /> <br />Despite her Ups and Downs now and days, Everybody knows that Britney will come back stonger than ever and take the world by storm once again. Only time can tell for the Princess of Pop! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000063DHK|5.0|<br />I first listen to this album in its LP version, my cousin owned when it first came out (I was 4 at the time) and I was hooked on Aces high, i could never erase the intro from my mind. A few years later i bought the cd, and its been in my cd collection for almost 13 years now, its completely destroyed (the booklet specially) and still remains as one of my favorite all time albums, for many reasons: <br /> <br />-  The best maiden line up ever <br />-  The great song list which includes some now classic songs and rare gems you dont hear live versions anymore (rime fo the ancient mariner - powerslave - die with your boots on, etc.) <br />-  The inspiring churchills speech which makes you want to fight till you die and sing the songs till you drop <br />-  The enhanced version comes with the 4/5 songs which were included in the Lp and not in the original CD release (the one I own) <br />-  The extra videos (not available in DVD yet) <br />-  Bruce singing his heart out (well, that happens all the time) <br />-  The infamous \\"motherf****\\" Nicko yell at the end of Revelations <br />-  Fun and games with Iron Maiden searching for funny writings on the tombstones <br />-  Great pictures <br />-  Great sound <br />-  Best metal band in the world. <br /> <br />What else could you ask for?! <br />Buy it now. The album that inspired and influenced all the people who listened to it at least 1 time. The best Maiden album. <br /> <br />Up the Irons! <br />
1558216847|5.0|This is a great story of human endurance in the face of <br />the greatest evil in human history: communism.  Mr. Rawicz <br />was a victim of communism but rather than give into it as many <br />would or just die, he fought back and proved the power of <br />human freedom over communism.  <br /> <br />Many will doubt.  Some because it seems impossible for a man <br />to have done what he did.  Others because quite frankly they <br />love communism or sympathize with it.  Mr. Rawciz was for years <br />a victim of communist propoganda campaigns.   Liberals will <br />hate it because it goes against their core philosophy in that <br />it shows that an individual doesn't need a government do great <br />things. <br /> <br />Any real supporter of freedom will like this book and know <br />in their gut that it is pure truth from cover to cover. <br />The fact that a movie has not been made out of this story <br />proves how deep the control of liberals goes in the <br />entertainment industry. <br />

B00004RF9I|4.0|Network is one of the most intelligently written films I've ever seen; the characters in Chayevsky's script fight viciously, tear each other down, rant against the \\"isms\\" of society, and fall in and out of love - always sounding authentically like the educated executives that they are.   <br /> <br />This isn't a talking-heads film, however.  The plot, and the broadcasting world put on frank display, is (to use a cliched phrase) eerily prescient of today's TV climate of corporate merges and (ridiculous) reality programming.  When Faye Dunaway's ambitious and wispily beautiful programming exec, Diana Christensen, pitches an actual-footage lead-in to a drama about guerilla bank robbers to her colleagues, they balk - but we aren't shocked.  Audiences in 1976 most likely scoffed at this idea just as these characters do, but in our creatively sucked-dry world of non-scripted Fear Factors and Survivors, it sounds like a ratings magnet.  And Diana is right - it scores.  The film does ride the line between the ridiculous (or satiric) when urban terrorists become producers of this show, and make demands of the TV suits with wild rants and violence, and when mad-as-hell news anchor Howard Beale (played by a thinner, edgier Peter Finch) turns his authentic one-time rant against all that is wrong with life into a production where he \\"faints\\" at the apex of his Dennis Miller-meets-TV evangelist soliloquies. <br /> <br />Watch Network to be wowed by the language of the characters.  (Strangely, the sparse voice-overs contradict the crackling intelligence of these TV-land players with dry, monotone authority.)  Watch it to appreciate the acting of a generation since replaced by less impressive stars.  You'll wonder if Chayevsky employed a psychic when he wrote this amazing script.  The tagline \\"Television will never be the same!\\" is a prediction, two decades early, of the onslaught of dreck that has in fact transformed television into a wasteland of envelope-shoving, outlandish programming.
0440219078|5.0|If you have ever been hurt before, then you have probably thought of what it would be like to have no feelings or emotion.  It's a nice thought, never to be hurt again. You also then have to ask yourself what it would be like to never experience love or happiness, because if you have no feelings, then that would eliminate the goods ones as well.  This is what it is like for the community of people in \\"The Giver.\\"  They see no color and feel nothing, not even love.  This can be very disturbing to read.  I know it was for me and I am an adult.  A world like that is hardly imaginable, but is no doubt well detailed and explained by Lois Lowry.   <br />     It is a complete contradtion to the world and society as we know it in the United States.  Here, diversity is welcomed and smiled upon especially in our schools.  In this book, everyone is the same and there is no room for differences.  This is very sad and would be very boring if it was real life.  Also, the people in this community are just assigned a job at age 12.  No one gets to choose what they would like to do.  Jonas is both blessed and cursed with receiving his assignment which is to be the receiver.   <br />     The ending of this book is a cliffhanger.  The reader is left without knowing what truly happens.  I like that it is open to the reader's interpretation.  My interpretation is that Jonas and Gabe die and go to heaven.  I could be wrong.  It is only my opinion.  Even though this book is sad, it is still an excellent book.  When I began reading it I could not put it down and that is saying a lot because there is not much that can hold my interest for any given time.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|In Mike Nichols' dreary film adapted from Patrick Marber's play, we start far away from the four main characters and never move any closer toward understanding them. <br /> <br />The boy-meets-girl/girl-meets-boy (and blank each other over) plot is simple, but missing details and lack of character development complicate the film.  We know it isn't a feel-good tale right off the bat: Daniel (Jude Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman) are engaged in a casual game of \\"you're-hot-wow-I-must-look-again\\" coquettishness on a busy London sidewalk when she is hit by a taxi.  \\"Meeting cute\\" this isn't.  Thus begins a torturous relationship that takes place largely off-screen; we only witness a few minutes of pleasant calm, and maybe only seconds of what would appear to be happiness.  What we do witness is hostility, turmoil and betrayal channeled through stilted, stage-crafted dialogue. <br /> <br />The same applies for the other half of the film's cast.  Julia Roberts is Anna, an accomplished photographer who fraternizes with her subjects - with Daniel, anyway; their random lip-locking is the catalyst of the plot.  It throws his relationship with Alice to the sex-club dogs (her previous line of work), and messes with Anna's head.  She will soon meet hard-edged Larry (Clive Owen), and must decide which one she loves after sleeping with them both. <br /> <br />The couples split and reform in different iterations, and split and reform again in their original states near the end of the film.  Much rough sex is had (all off-screen), and many tears are shed, but the four souls remain wrapped in mystery.  The final scene punctuates this distance. <br /> <br />Portman and Owen's performances are commendable.  Law and Roberts, however, deliver distant and (intentionally?) detached portrayals of their characters.  If eye-candy is your interest, you may be surprised - Portman glows intermittently, but there's nothing very beautiful in this film.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is a fabulous album. I haven't enjoyed an album from beginning to end in such a long time that this album took me by surprise. <br /> <br />The songs are soothing and memorable.

0767821629|3.0|I watched this movie yesterday,and I just cant help but be a little bit dissapointed. I think the premise is great; is this world real? Or is the world they make up in the computer world real, or is anything real anymore as characters take up to three lives each as they go in and out of these cyber worlds? It gets fuzzy in places, and makes one wonder that after an hour and 20 minutes, this whole story is getting more and more complicated.   Actors in this movie do a great job, but it doesn't have enough characters to make it suspencful enough, it doesnt make it hard to figure out who is killing whom, even though the explanation @ the end is a bit far fetched.   My boyfriend really liked this moive, but I dont think I would ever want to watch it again. And you know a movie is a gem, when in the middle of it, you daydream of whens the next time you get to watch it again.    Not with this one, curiosity satisfied, and no need to go back to it.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|No one will mistake A Valid Path for a classic Alan Parsons album, but this is not a bad thing.  Stereotomy had suggested a coming artistic malaise, while the apparent \\"come back\\" Try Anything Once was a distinct disappointment.  Subsequent tracks from On Air and Time Machine showed the magic was not gone, but there was a sense of some question going unanswered - what's next? <br /> <br />The 2004 concerts made a statement: first, that Alan Parsons was able to present his impressive classic catalog effectively to wildly enthusiastic fans; and, that there were some new tricks coming, too.  P.J. Olson's vocals (among others) were on the one hand channeling the old material brilliantly, and on the other presenting his own More Lost Without You beautifully within the Alan Parsons context. <br /> <br />And that is probably the best way to describe A Valid Path: some new directions presented in the master's context.  There are hints here and there of the analog synths and certain turns of musical phrase in familiar chord progressions you might expect from Alan Parsons, but the content itself is brightly fresh and invigorating for the most part. <br /> <br />There's a spark here that might not be readily identifiable to all older fans, but upon listening you can't help but be reminded of the albums we grew up with, even if the percussion tracks are 30 years beyond 1975. <br /> <br />Updated presentations of Mammagamma and The Raven won't please those looking for simple retreads of their initial recordings, but they will give satisfaction to the rest of us that have opened up to new sounds and enjoy a little nostalgia. <br /> <br />If Alan Parsons were recording today, what would sound like?  Just like this. <br />

0385504209|4.0|First I thought the novel was well-executed and this is helped by the short viginette chapters. The wall paper of Europe and religious history is a nice decoration but the focus is on the myth. And that is all this is. Ther claim of truth at the beginning is misinterpreted in my view. The paintings are real as are the locations. The entities are real but in the case of the Priory of Sion is a debunked sham. Making it real for the novel is allowed though.<br /><br />The problem is that this was already written in two other novels and all of the themes are indentical in the two books. Enough was changed to make the claim of originality in the form of character names and the title of the main thesis: Jesus married Mary Magdalene and they have descendants protecting her bones and legacy. From the looks of things and the attention this is the only declaration that separates the books in question. This one and \\"Daughter of God.\\"<br /><br />Is that enough? Who knows?

B00005NTJK|5.0|I do not like this album as much as Stand Up. That said, it's still great. Ian's song writing takes a darker, more serious turn. He also starts writing \\"heavier\\" songs in that they are louder, and more rock based. Riff based, if you will. In some ways, it's almost like a dry run for Aqualung. However, they experimented with a lot of effects on this one. Listen to With You There To Help Me and A Time for Everything for evidence. If you like Tull, and especially their early period this is a must have.

B000007MVX|5.0|Ian's second album length composition. It's not as fine as Thick as A Brick, but what is? MUCH MUCH more difficult to get into; there aren't the catchy themes that pop up all the time. The music is also in minor keys constantly. The lyrics aren't humorous; they're serious, oh lord. And there's lots of sax all over the place. Oh yeah and The Hare who lost his spectacles... <br />I won't discuss the meaning of the album; it has one. there is a website devoted to figuring it out. Go there. This album is a must for Tull fans. Be prepared to work though; it's a difficult listen. Their most experimental and difficult album ever. They retreated a bit after this into more normal song craft. Which was probably just as well.

B00006JKOL|5.0|this album, out of 6 songs (i don't count grace, it's 50 seconds long!) has 4 perfect songs. Ministrel In The Galley, Cold Wind To Valhalla, One White Duck/0=Nothing at all, and Baker Street Muse are all among the finest Tull songs ever created. Also among the most complex; in some ways this is Tull's most prog album, after Thick As A Brick and A Passion Play. However, Requiem is no good. It's very bland; Ian's normally vibrant and intense or beautiful acoustic guitar is turned into bland strumming, as Palmer's normally wonderful orchestra just vanilla's the melody. Blah, if it took more than 50 seconds to write that song i'm Ian Anderson. <br />And Black Satin Dancer isn't bad: it's just not as good as the others. Parts of it seem like excuses to jam. It's interesting jamming, but jamming denotes a lack of ideas. Oh well. Still worth it buy this album NOW.

B00070DK1E|4.0|After going electronic, Ian returns to his roots. Or does he? There are lots of drum machines on this album, out of neccesity. Plus, this hardly sounds like the Tull of old. <br />Cut down to a trio of Ian, Martin, and Mr. Pegg, the band had to scale back a bit. So they came up with this album. <br />There are very few really catchy songs on this album. That's not really what they're doing here. It's all atmosphere. I mean, it's not just atmospheric wisp; there are real melodies and good playing and themes. Other people have said it, and with good reason; it sounds similar to Dire Straits.  <br />Me, I love catchy songs. But these songs all set a mood, and the album is one of Tull's most interesting late period albums. Plus, Budapest is quite a great song. Steel Monkey is a bit lame, but the rest is pretty amazing, atmospheric, and just plain interesting.

B00005NTJM|4.0|Great songs, great playing, great arrangments and melodies. Also, the only Tull album without Martin Barre, so it's interesting for that. And also because of the blues feeling of the songs. It's not indicative of what they were later to do and accomplish, but any band should be proud of this disc. Especially Beggars Farm. Ian's first mind bogglingly great song.

B00000AOUD|5.0|ian pulls it all together. His hard rock side, his folk side, his jazz side, his funky side (!), his serious poetic side, his humorous side, and especially his classical side. This album is arranged like a classical piece; themes pop up and disappear. I honestly don't understand this album was created. It is one of my favorite albums ever. It's infinitely listenable; I used to listen to it a few times a DAY. I can't really describe it; you must experience it. If you like prog, or even if you don't, this album is a MUST A MUST. Tull never got any better; they stayed amazing, but never got past this peak.

B00008G9JO|5.0|Darker, heavier. More earthy; not quite bluesy, but closer. This album dwells more on the darker side of life. It's not quite Stormwatch, but it's getting there. One of Tull's most amazing collections of songs. It stands out from the later period albums by being both folky, and heavy and dark and light hearted all at once. It has everything for a Tull fan. The arragnements aren't as complex as songs from the wood, but still quite amazing. Buy it and buy it often.
0812550757|2.0|Ender's Game was a much better novel in my opinion.  Speaker For The Dead reminded me much of a drunk man trying to walk a straight line stumbling ever so often and taking breaks to explain why.  I found myself glancing over entire sections of a few chapters simply because they lended no contribution to the storyline or were repeated for an empty dramatic effect. All in all, it was a rather plain and boring novel.
B00006JKOM|5.0|This album, i don't understand the negativity towards it. is it because of the self ironically cheeky concept? The fact that it doesn't have a song over 8 mintues, or even 6? Forget that; this is one of Ian's best collections of songs. <br />What sets it apart from other Tull albums you say? The fact that is has one of Ian's most perfect collections of melodies and themes ever assembled. No, it's hardly as complex as Ministrel. Yes, it's occasionally a bit show tuneish (the title track) but hey, just listen to these songs. You can sing them to yourself later. You have them all memorized you Tull fans you. Listen to this album again.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I am one of them.  An older NIN fan - if you are too - check out this album.  Don't be turned off by \\"the hand that feeds\\" although I guarantee it will grow on you in the context of the album.  Its a grown up NIN - a departure from earlier albums but with shades of the past of course. <br /> <br />Don't believe the critics, there were critics of downward spiral, after all.  Its a GREAT album.  I already love it and will by the Dual Disc and regular versions. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00000GAIW|5.0|I only say this to describe the way the average person thinks. All three earlier albums were classics. However, this is where Jethro Tull really made their mark on the world. It's also where their trade mark sound fully and completely solidifies. As amazing as Stand Up was, it wasn't really representative of what Ian wanted to do, in the long run. Much more represenative of that is this album. <br />Ian freely and fluently and constantly mixes hard rock jazz folk and classical music. He doesn't care at this point; he's interested in doing something new. He is tossing out beautiful melodies and arrangements at the flick of a wrist. The classic rock staples \\"Aqualung, Crosseyed Mary and Locomotive Breath\\" are all on here. There are also songs like \\"My God\\" and \\"Wind Up\\" that showcase Ian's ability to mix styles and genre's almost annoyingly effortlesly. Throw in several beautiful, but short, accoustic pieces, and you have one of the finest Tull albums of all time. <br />
B0000062GK|1.0|Ok, people, I sincerely can't believe that I'm the only one to think that this is a terrible album. It is inane crap of the lowest order. I am a worse person for having listened to it. A friend of mine put it on the stereo in my car, and I've been regretting taking him out ever since.<br />It is not like there is some great variety in his guitar playing. He does the same thing on each of the songs. And it is intensely frustrating to listen to. The only thing worse than the songs themselves are the meaningless titles they are given. &quot;Secret Prayer&quot; is not so much a SECRET prayer, so much as one that your kids complain about when they hear that drivel coming through the walls. &quot;Love Thing&quot;? Dear Lord, help us all.<br />And just to boost my cred, it's not that I'm not &quot;rock&quot; enough for this or something. From industrial to garage, I listen to it all. And it's not that instrumentals bore me. Hell, A Love Supreme is one of my favorite albums. It is just that this is a terrible album. When I put it on, it was so unoriginal and boring that it threatened to fade right into the background like elevator music.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Many people make a case for this as Tull's best. You know, I can understand why too. Mixing the folk higher than the rock and Ian gets kind of goofy; light hearted, I mean. However, the song has some of the best arrangments of any Tull album. Thanks Mr. Palmer for his keyboards, and orchestral arranging abilities. Thanks the fact that Ian was at the top of his game. Thank your mother for buying you this album. Buy it. Buy it many times.
B000002P72|4.0|I've read some incredible reviews for this album and don't get me wrong this album is fantastic. But there's a little to much singing and not enough classic b.b. guitar work, espically on the second half of the album. The first half of the album cranks out some great classics and the second half has some moments but the first five songs are the best. If you love more jazzy blues (like some of b.b.'s stuff) this album is your nirvana. Although I do like b.b.'s style like that, with a little touch of jazz, I expected some more incredible blues pouring from lucille. This album still remains fantastic and has some incredible music. Best songs: \\"Everyday I Have the Blues\\", \\"Sweet Little Angel\\", \\"It's My Own Fault\\" and \\"How Blue Can You Get?\\"
B00006JKON|5.0|Not the best tull album but filled with special treats for the Tull fan. It's much more mainstream than the last two. It couldn't help but be. However, these are great songs, filled with amazing arrangments and catchy melodies and strange lyrics. Call it Tull's pop album; just don't call it bad. I'll smack ya.
B00008QSA5|5.0|This is an incredible album, put it on your music list  NOW! Super Session features some of the best work ever from blues guitarist Michael Bloomfield. He plays on tracks 1-5 with Al Kooper and company. \\"Albert's Shuffle\\" is probably his best recording on the album which has fiery blues licks and the usual Bloomfield sting. \\"Stop\\" has an incredible beat and yet again Bloomfield's guitar shines through the song. \\"Man's Temptation\\" is a cover of the Curtis Mayfield song, it has an amazing bass line from legendary bass player Harvey Brooks (who also played with Bloomfield in The Electric Flag). \\"Man's Temptaion\\" includes great vocal work from Kooper and Bloomfield. \\"His Modal Majesty\\" is a great long jam and \\"Really\\" is another solid blues number. Tracks 6-9 feature Steven Stills on guitar instead of Bloomfield. \\"It takes Alot to Laugh, It takes a Train to Cry\\" is an excellent sped up cover the Bob Dylan song with a great bass line and solid guitar from Stills. The 11 minute long \\"Season of the Witch\\" rocks and contains excellent wah-wah pedal work from Stills. \\"You Don't Love Me\\" and \\"Harvey's Tune\\" are decent but nothing great. The best version of \\"You Don't Love Me\\" is a 19 minute version done by the Allman Brothers on the album Live at Filmore East. This album is incredible! Great blues from Bloomfield, great organ from Kooper, incredible bass from Harvey Brooks and good guitar from Stills.(Barry Goldberg plays electric piano on tracks 1 and 2.) <br />Track Listing- <br />1. Albert's Shuffle- 10/10 <br />2. Stop- 10/10 <br />3. Man's Temptation- 10/10 <br />4. His Modal Majesty- 10/10 <br />5. Really- 10/10 <br />6. It Takes Alot to Laugh....- 10/10 <br />7. Season of the Witch- 10/10 <br />8. You Don't Love Me- 7/10 <br />9. Harvey's Tune- 7.5/10 <br />**BONUS TRACKS*** <br />(I AM NOT INCLUDING THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF ALBERT'S SHUFFLE AND SEASON OF THE WITCH WITHOUT HORNS) <br />10. Blues for Nothing- 10/10 <br />11.

0143034901|5.0|This is one amazing read. The plot (and sub-plots) reel you in and never let you go. The characterizations are flawless, and you are held captivated by the mystery created by the so-called last copy in existence of a novel by Julian Carax. You will definitely want to literally devour this outstanding novel in one sitting.
B00006878K|4.0|This a good blues/funk album from guitar legend Albert King and the Stax backing band (also a seperate band too) Booker T. and the MG's. This album was monumental when it was released but is not as monumental today. This is still a good album that is a nescessary landmark in somebody's blues collection. The fact that the songs are too short and many of them fade out at the end (which pisses me off beyond reason) is a negative factor. The best songs on the album are \\"Crosscut Saw\\",\\"Personal Manager\\", \\"Laundromat Blues\\" and \\"Born Under a Bad Sign.\\"
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Let's face it. She has no talent, she can not sing (How else could you explain when she says 'Me' it sounds 'Mai'?), she can dance a bit but that's because of how many dance lessons she takes, unless she's stupid that she can't get it straight. Musically she's terrible (Song titled 'Not a girl, not yet a woman'? Geez!) altho she doesn't write her own tunes or atleast most of them, which would of been worst,  so how come she sells that much? Simple: Read my topic title! <br /> <br />Why do you think there's artists (if you can call them that) try to wear less clothe and more make up on each video? Let alone talk about sex or insinuate it by her body movement? That's all she can do and that is why she will still sell out shows aswell with merchandise. Do you really think she gets aired because shes talented? Kids love her music, just like they digged Barney's couple of years ago but still not to actually consider her a diva.  <br /> <br />Another thing that really grabbed my attention was that after releasing 4 albums she decided to make a greatest hits. Most bands release their greatest work after 5 or more albums, succesfull or not, or if they retire soon they will release a 'best of'. Spears releasing this clearly shows how she wants to keep selling, and people are dumb enough to buy it. Has she ran out of ideas? Is she too pregnant? My answer is, her record company makes her decisions. After all she's just another puppet, making big bucks. <br /> <br />I will say one thing which is sure, Brintey Spears got beauty. She will be better off modeling, not acting (God forbid, no more) but really, leave the music industry. It's not doin any good, maybe for now since she's selling but in 10 years of time she will go down the drain and prolly be the prank of the joke, like most teeny poppers did after their short but millionare musical career. <br />
630512762X|3.0|Action movies, by their very natures, are inherently silly beings.  Lots of bullets fly around, explosions abound and crazy stunts are common occurrences.  Add in a bit of an SF plot (the surgical replacement of faces), and you have Face-Off.  This John Travolta/Nicholas Cage vehicle ups the silly factor by a large degree, and while it is fun, it goes just a little bit too far over the top.  Travolta hams it up once he becomes Nicholas Cage's character while Cage goes the opposite direction, carrying intensity to such a degree that I sometimes wondered if he was constipated.<br /><br />Sean Archer (Travolta) has been tracking Castor Troy (Cage) for years, blaming Troy for the death of his son.  This obsession has come to affect his marriage as well as the rest of his personal life.  Archer finally gets the drop on Troy, but Troy falls into a coma before he can reveal the location of the biological weapon that threatens Los Angeles.  Using a revolutionary medical technique that allows Archer to wear Troy's face, Archer is to go undercover in a maximum security prison and talk to Troy's captured brother to get the location.  Unfortunately, the real Troy wakes up from his coma, manages to kill every FBI agent who knows about the plan along with the doctor who did the procedure (though not before getting the doctor to put Archer's face on him).  Thus, Archer is trapped with Troy's face in a prison where nobody knows who he is, while Troy wears Archer's face and assumes his life.  Chaos ensues.<br /><br />One thing you can say about Face-Off is that it is quite stylish.  Directed by acclaimed action director John Woo, it certainly looks pretty.  One of the final confrontations has his trademark doves flying around in cool slow-motion shots as the bullets fly.  All of the action scenes are well choreographed (though one of them strains credulity more than most action scenes - details below) with a flair that not many directors manage.  If you like your explosions, this movie will certainly satisfy you.  It starts out with a bang, gets talky for a little while, and then starts up again, never stopping until it reaches a fiery conclusion.<br /><br />The movie has a couple of plot elements that just bugged me, however.  The first is more minor, and was perhaps explained but I missed it.  The plan for Archer's infiltration of the prison just rubbed me the wrong way.  They're going to put an agent into the prison without warning at least the prison warden?  How was Archer supposed to alert anybody that he had the information that they needed?  Throw something over the wall?  I know that it was an outlandish plan that would have been turned down if they went to the higher-ups, but I think a second run-through of the plan was required before implementation.<br /><br />Secondly, and illogical, the assault on the apartment where pseudo-Troy was staying was just wrong.  There's no way pseudo-Archer could convince law enforcement officers to carry out an attack that way.  They go in guns blazing after shooting tear gas through the windows to incapacitate everybody, with no intelligence on what they might find inside (like an innocent young boy, for instance?).  No, none of that.  Instead, they get enough firepower to win a major military engagement and just start blasting away.  Did it look pretty?  Yes.  Was it more preposterous than even most action movies?  Definitely. There were also a couple other plot holes that I can't really go into for spoiler reasons.<br /><br />That being said, the plot was intriguing.  While I found the prison sequence hilariously illogical, I was affected by how Archer must be feeling, isolated behind a face that isn't his, with nobody in the world other than your nemesis knowing that you are who you claim you are.  It gets even worse when you watch your nemesis assume your life on the TV screen.  Cage does a good job showing the frustration that Archer must feel in this situation, with nobody to turn to.  Joan Allen, as Archer's wife, does a good job being torn between believing what the man with face of her husband's arch-enemy is trying to tell her, and screaming.  The final sequence is riveting for just this reason, as everything comes to an explosive climax.<br /><br />The acting front is another place where Face-Off fails a little bit.  The performances are generally good, but I thought Travolta went way over the top.  He takes the Troy persona that Cage gives him and multiplies it by twenty.  The problem is that Cage was already playing him over the top, which makes Travolta fall to the other side.  He was clearly having a lot of fun with the role. Sometimes it works (the first scene with Archer's daughter, where he bums a cigarette off of her), sometimes it doesn't (the licking of her face when he's holding her hostage).  I did love his \\"Christ on the cross\\" pose during one of their confrontations.<br /><br />Cage, on the other hand, gets way too intense sometimes, but then he usually does.  It worked when he was in the prison, but in some of his quieter scenes (as with Gina Gershon), he just looks like he could really use a bathroom visit.  Allen does a good job as Archer's wife, given the limited nature of the role.  She's around mainly to give Travolta somebody to play off against and to demonstrate the change between the two Archers.  The same applies to Gershon as Troy's girlfriend.  Archer and Troy are the two main characters, and nobody else is going to get much characterization.<br /><br />There is a bit of social comment within the movie, though it is pretty blatant.  We see contrasting scenes of the \\"stick up his rear\\" Archer (the real one) and the \\"happy-go-lucky\\" Archer played by Troy that are obviously showing us that obsessing about something to the extent Archer has all these years is not healthy for either himself or his relationships.  Oddly, we don't see whether the real Archer actually learned this lesson, but the movie does imply that all will be well with the Archer family, so that's good.  Obviously, we're not seeing this movie for that kind of content, so back to the explosions we go!<br /><br />All in all, Face-Off is a fun movie.  It is very close to 4 stars for me, but I just can't give them to it.  The acting of the leads is just a little bit too much for me to give it that kind of quality rating.  It would certainly be a 3.5 star movie, however.  It's a fun popcorn flick, worth a rent or worth stopping if happen upon it on the movie channels (like I did).<br /><br />David Roy.

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I purchased this CD just after the movie \\"Ray\\" hit the theaters, and I was not disappointed.  For the music lover, this satisfies.  Ray Charles was influential to so many artists, in so many genres.  Again, I am not disappointed.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I remember when I first saw the video for capricorn, and thought it was good, but didn't hear anything about the group afterwards and essentially forgot about them.  Then by chance I saw the album when it was released and decided on a whim to pick it up.  Back then I was greatly impressed and it became one of my favorite albums.  As time went by, my musical preferences changed.  While I still liked some of the music I enjoyed from that time, I didn't listen to most of it.  However, at a party last night, I was talking with someone about music and prog-rock came up, and I sugested this band remembering how good they were.  I then decided to give the album another listen, and even after all this time, I am still Impressed (and believe me, that is not easy at all).   <br />   The production value alone is great, but with as many corporatly created and packaged bands circulating around currently, that is not in itself astonishing.  What is though, is the bands sound.  While you can see some consistancy from song to song, they do alter things quite a bit to maintain the listeners interest.  This consistancy, something that with most bands can become monotonous is a feature that makes TSTM even more interesting.  It allows for a flow from song to song, this helps create an ambient universe for the listeners mind to wander through.  Another concept of the music which greatly intriuges me is the layering of the music (an obviouse must for any true prog-rock band).  While in many parts (especially the faster and harder parts) the guitars will take lead of the music, in many other places the synth will take lead (generally the slower, but not always), and other times, the drums will take lead; but always at least two of the afore mentioned instument groups (and usually all three) will be layered in a way that seems increadably appropirate for both their location in the song and the current state of the lyrics (both the words being sung and how they are being sung).  <br />There are many times when a band will succeed musically, but fail horribly lyrically (or vice versa).  This however, is a common problem that TSTM has been able to not only avoid, but hurtle over, the lyrics are bloody brilliant.  The main reason for this, is that they are not direct (which is a disease that plauges modern music), they either tell a story (such as Buddha For Mary) or describe an enviorment, usually of a mental nature.  Not only are the lyrics impressive and thought provoking, but Jared Leto presents them in an equally impressive format.  He is capable of going from a soft whisper to a sound that describes the emotion of those words perfectly.  That is a major deffining feature of his vocals, he puts emotion into his words to move the listener in the direction the lyrics point, but never gives their true destination away.  These emotions are never overpowering, but fit perfectly with the music at the mometent.  This combination of indirect lyrics and emotion presents the listener with the possibility of the much sought after \\"unique listen\\", the ability to listen to a song and derive a meaning, then listen to it again, and derive a completly different (but still completly relavent) meaning.   <br />   One thing that still captivates me about TSTM's music is how it can allow you to drift to another realm.  This is due to both the lyrics and the supurb layering.  This is one of those albums you can put on and simply let your mind float away with the music, yet at the same time, able to be listened to intently to find the ever changing meaning (something I've found very often based on the listeners current emotions and state of mind). In a time where so many musical artists will try to gain your attention by playing on specific emotions, TSTM will also draw on the listeners mind and imagination as well as emotion.  This is something that is so rarely seen and done sucessfully.
B000002JEV|5.0|Led Zeppelin is great. It's my favorite band, and in my opinion they affected the whole modern rock, not to mention the 70's rock. This double cd captures them in their early days, in their whole greatness and power. <br /> <br />CD 1 is a collection of radio appearances that the band did. The songs were recorded in a studio, and not in front of a live audience. In few of them you can hear two vocals, or two guitars (Page was the only guitarist in Led Zeppelin, and they didn't use any hired guitarists, so they had only one guitar in their live performances). Most of them are in a pretty lousy sound quality, and not a lot different than the original versions, but it's still good after all. <br />There are two versions of Communication Breakdown, which has similar structures, but the sound of the distortion is different. I liked the second one better - I think that Robert sings there better. <br />You can also find some Blues covers - I never paid much attention to \\"something else\\" - A fast and short one, with a nice piano solo by John Paul Jones. \\"The Girl I love...\\" is a very nice rocker, with a catchy riff and a great solo. \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\" is really great. <br /> <br />The end of CD 1 has a live concert by Zeppelin, in the Playhouse Theater. In here you can really feel the energy that filled Zeppelin's shows. In this concert there are: <br /> <br />Communication Breakdown - the rhythmic guitar is kinda missing during the solo, but you get to love it this way. This song rocks live. <br /> <br />I Can't Quit You Baby - WAY better than the shorter version, and than the studio version. Page is amazing on this one. <br /> <br />You Shook Me - again, better than the shorter. Its timing is 10+ min, and every second is worthwhile. If the song would have been more flowing, it could have been better, but it's still great. <br /> <br />How Many More Times - that one is a kind of a bummer. Not flowing, and Robert and Page has this annoying thing where Robert wailssome meaningless words, and Jimmy plays the same notes in the guitar - this is no music and it's not fun to listen. And when they have a part of \\"The Lemon Song\\" is it, the song totally lose it. Except that, it's cool. Good guitar solo, good ending, and after all it is Led Zeppelin, and it is a good song. <br /> <br />Disc 2 opens with great rocking versions of Immigrant Song, Heartbreaker, Since I've Been Loving You, and Black dog. All of them are fantastic. I stopped listening to the studio versions of all of these songs! Well, except Since I've Been Loving You, where the studio version is great as well. <br />Then comes Dazed and Confused. It starts excellent, but in the six minutes breakdown (before the solo) it's going nowhere. The solo is also not that good; again that flowing problem. It's good, but not more than that. <br />After that, you are getting compensation - the first ever playing of Stairway to Heaven, which is wonderful by all means. Yet the studio version is equally good. The compensation goes on with an acoustic set of Going to California and That's the Way, both quiet and beautiful. Whole Lotta Love comes afterwards with power and energy; good drum solo by John Bonham during the interlude. The blues medley is cool and fun, with a nice guitar solo in it. <br />The concerts end with and electric version of Thank You - the best guitar solo of the Album is here, and the keyboards fadeout, make you feel like you have just got out of something special.  <br /> <br />To summarize it all - this is great album by a wonderful band, and you will enjoy it if you are a rock fan, or if you are a Zep fan in particular. <br /> <br />And one more thing about Zeppelin's live albums. They are all pretty... similar. You have the long version of Dazed and Confused, the Whole Lotta Love blues medley, and Stairway to Heaven and each one of them. Not to mention that almost all of CD 2 from here, is also in How the West Was Won - a similar opening, acoustic set, and more. 10 out of 17 songs in HTWWW are in here as well. I want to buy it, but I'm not sure because of it. Or perhaps I'm wrong? HTWWW is great despite that? <br />A little variation will be good. There are a lot of songs both from the early days (Good Times Bad Times, When the Levee Breaks, and more) and the letter days (in My Time of Dying, Ten Years gone, Trampled Underfoot, Achilles' Last Stand...) <br /> <br />That's it, I'm shutting up. Enjoy BBS Sessions! <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|The sound of the album is refreshing, up to date and soulful. Truthfully Mariah never sounded so free and unrestrained with this album. I guess she is really emancipated from the struggles on what should be defined as a Mariah Carey album and it is about time. The album is a perfect balance of ballads and mid-tempo songs which would please a lot of her old fans but also cater to her recent and new fans of her unique R&B sound and up-tempo sound. The album highlights is of course \\"We belong together\\" that is simple yet a thoughtful song which now currently sits at number 12 at billboard which speaks on how beautiful this songs is and could definitely be a number one hit in a few weeks time. Also, album highlights include \\"stay the night\\" and the telling story of \\"circles\\", the live feel of \\"I wish you knew\\" and the gospel ender \\"Fly like a bird\\" that epitomes the thankfulness of a true artist who stand the test of time in faith with God. Also, mid-tempo that are nice includes \\"Get your number\\", \\"To the floor\\", and \\"Say something\\". Actually most of the up-tempo songs are great. Moreover the album signifies only a true musician can create an album that is quality standard in itself because the artist is involved in the project in every possible way as Mariah co-wrote, produced and arrange the song in the \\"emancipation of mimi\\" and a true testament the we can never deny true talent and artistry.  <br />I recommend you buy this album.
B0000027RL|5.0|ok the only reason nirvana made it big was because of seattle bands soundgarden mudhoney and green river. if you listen to this music you see they were not the band to create grunge. as for pearl jam their debt is better than anything to come out of the last decade. top songs once, garden and black show they were not just a singles band.they will live on forever. and the fact they changed their style of music over the years makes this album even more special not to say the music they are making to day isn't any good but this album will stand the times along with albums such as zeppelin 2 and 4 beatles abby road stones exile on main st and the clashs london calling. nirvana was the past pearl jam is the future!!
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Simply put:  IT'S THE BEST FREAKING ALBUM MARIAH HAS CREATED!!!  At first Butterfly was number 1 on my list, but now The Emancipation has EASILY replaced it!!! <br /> <br />Favorite song: \\"One & Only\\" ft. Twista
B0006399FS|5.0|Reading these reviews yields interesting results. It looks as though a lot of people here aren't really reviewing this disc. Instead they are locked in a very heated and passionate debate over U2, and whether they have, or haven't \\"sold out\\". <br /> <br />There are a lot of one star reviews here, which is just silly. At the end of the day, this is a disc performed and produced by a group of musicians who have played together their entire adult lives. Think about it, unless they were recording garage rock in an actual garage with a car running, and damaging their brains with carbon monoxide, the idea that this group of pros would actually produce an album worthy of just one star is a bit ridiculous.  <br /> <br />It's not as though they can't figure out how to tune their instruments and play. <br /> <br />So there is something else going on for the people in the \\"one star\\" review category, and after reading a few of them, it looks as though most feel disappointed that U2 has made an album which sounds so much like... um... U2. <br /> <br />Ok... if that doesn't seem to make much sense, read the reviews. \\"U2 used to push the boundaries and now they are trying to cash in on a simple retread of their early '80s sound\\". That captures the gist of most of the one star reviews. People seem to feel really let down that U2 hasn't reinvented itself the way they did with Achtung Baby. <br /> <br />There seems to be this preoccupation with the idea that U2 must have had no other motivation for sounding the way they did when they were 19 than to make a ton of money. That point of view struck me as interesting, and as I kept reading it got mixed with another observation being made here. Several of these reviews mention that Achtung Baby reinvented the band, and that this album deserves one star because the band didn't reinvent itself again.  <br /> <br />U2 sometimes thinks conceptually with their albums, as when they tried to announce popmart at a Kmart and make some sort of Metastatement about \\"commercialism\\". (Reach exceeding the grasp I suppose). They have also tended to challenge their audience with bold reinventions, as with Achtung Baby, so the fact that this album sounds like a throw back to one of their first three discs threw me for a loop when I first heard it too. Where is the complexity? I wondered while listening to it. Where is the subtext? The comment on commercialism, the big worldly statement to live up to such a heavy handed title as \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\"? Jeez. <br /> <br />I was also kind of bumbed with this disc ... *until* I read all these one star reviews.  <br /> <br />Then I got it. <br /> <br />All these one star reviews are critical because this album doesn't \\"reinvent\\" the band again. That was my thinking too, but as I read it spelled out for me here, it began to make less sense. After all, is constant reinvention really desirable or healthy?  <br /> <br />Does this album sound like the U2 of \\"Boy?\\" Yes. Who would have thought that would be a bad thing!  <br /> <br />When Neil Young puts out an album that sounds like his early work people cheer he's gotten back to the source. When U2 do it there is an uproar they have sold out. How did it turn out that every step U2 makes has to be a grand statement? Why aren't they allowed even the benefit of the doubt that in their forties they might sincerely start to get back to their roots. How did they come to be cursed with such superhuman, which is to say \\"inhuman\\", expectations? <br /> <br />Back in the 80s when U2 got massive \\"the first time\\" people got on their case for \\"marketing idealism\\".  <br /> <br />That's what made Achtung Baby so powerful. The band saved itself by running from itself. They presented the press and the world with a moving target, and proved they were too sharp to be taken down for standing up for the things they believed in. But there is a thin line between being a moving target and being constantly on the run. <br /> <br />The factthat so many people are willing to give a *thoroughly* enjoyable album like this one just one star is a perfect example of how U2 may have painted themselves into a corner with the promise of radical \\"Achtung Baby\\" sized reinvention with each album. Could it be, that by going back to the sound of their first discs it's this very expectation which has caused some fans to explode that the band is trying to dismantle? Could the promise of constant reinvention and with it the danger of constant self alienation, be the Atomic Bomb of the title? <br /> <br />If so... then there is indeed a subtext to this album... a \\"Big message\\" just as large as anything they did in the '90s. If that's the point of the album then maybe it's just like \\"Pop\\" and \\"Achtung,\\" albums which most fans found needed a few listens before they made their purpose plain. <br /> <br />It's strange, but the negative reviews here are so thoroughly ridiculous with their \\"I can't stand this album because it doesn't reinvent my life the way 'Achtung Baby' or 'The Joshua Tree' did\\" perspective have really helped raise \\"How to Dismantle...\\" in my eyes. <br /> <br />This is a simple straight forward album with songs about basic human emotions and experiences. There are songs about a son grieving for his father, and about people just wondering what comes next. This stuff is all very straight forward and human. The idea that some might miss out on this disc's honest thoughts and simple truths, because they are looking for \\"reinvention\\" suggests they are actually looking for escapism, and avoiding real lives lead by real musicians who might not be interested in constantly reinventing themselves. <br /> <br />The search for something constant as opposed to explosive change may actually be what U2 is taking on with this album. Perhaps with a few more listens from this perspective, it will turn out that U2 really are on to something here, picking up on a mindset which would really need to be dismantled in order to dismantle forces as destructive as an atomic Bomb. <br /> <br />Perhaps this album isn't simple so much as it's about the power that can come from keeping things simple. For those fans disappointed by the absence of any bells or whistles, consider this, your expectations might be just what need dismantling. They are, after all, getting in the way of your enjoyment of a very fine album. <br />

B00005JLEJ|3.0|I love Akira Kurosawa but to be honest, I wasn't impressed at all with this movie. <br />The plot is interesting & builds in excitement until it reaches about 2 hours into the movie & then it becomes exhausting and tedious to watch until the ending battle scene which I thought was disappointing & anticlimactic. <br /> <br />The ending battle scene may have been historically accurate but instead Kurosawa should have awarded his viewers with some nice hand to hand combat between Samurai. It's like all those extras weren't put to good use. <br />Pretty much all of the battle scenes in the movie consisted of arquebuses mowing down Samurai. <br />This may have been historically accurate for the time period but it doesn't make for good entertainment. <br />I would much rather see the Samurai hacking off limbs with Naginatas or shooting arrows at each other. <br />The hundreds of extras were not used effectively in my opinion! <br />The plot was fictional, so Kurosawa should have thrown in some fictional battle scenes as well.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the lack of battle scenes also hurts the movie. <br />If I remember correctly, there were about 3. Two very short ones not worth mentioning & then the ending battle scene.  <br />Adding at least 2 more battle scenes of good quality would have made the film more watchable. <br />Action has a magical quality of enticing the viewer back into the movie. (especially after long periods without any action) <br />This wasn't used effectively in Kagemusha. <br />The plot is good but it just isn't enough to carry the viewer through the entire movie alone. It needed more action to go with it! <br /> <br />On a positive note, the Cinematography is excellent & probably the best I've seen in any Kurosawa movie. Possibly the best in any movie period. That actually disappoints me in a way because the great cinematography could have been much more enjoyable if the battle scenes were of the same quality.  <br />But if the lack of Battle scenes doesn't bother you, then you'll probably love this movie. It's rich in color & history.  <br /> <br />The acting was also very well done & so was the costume design. <br />My opinion is that it's worth a rental to see for the first time & if you like it, then buy it. The DVD version has cool special features. <br /> <br />I would also recommend \\"RAN\\" or \\"Chushingura\\". <br />Chushingura also suffers from the \\"not enough battle scenes syndrome\\" as Kagemusha but it's plot is still great & so is the final scene where the 47 ronin raid the castle.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Let's face it, the tunes are catchy and with <br />fun and clever lyrics.  I've only heard the soundtrack, <br />but you can catch most of the story therein.  Some <br />soaring duets and an uplifting trajectory (yes, a pun).   <br />The classic of the decade so far along with the riotous Producers.
B00023GGFI|4.0|Real raw bluesy debut cd. I'm so glad I have been getting in to more blues music recently. Excellent guitar playing, Sound is great as well. Thank heaven for remasters.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|In order to avoid killing off their hero and Orlando Bloom, the writers of this movie completely rerouted the story!  Achilles was never in the Trojan horse, and yet we see him pop right out!  There is no secret passageway for a happy ending, yet all our favorite characters escape to freedom.  Achilles never returns Hector's body, but to make us like his character, he must show this compassion. <br /> <br />But let's put all that aside- how about the acting?  Now, I'm a big fan of Orlando Bloom but I must say that in this movie he came off as effeminate!  And Helen wasn't really stunning- her face would never launch 1,000 ships.  Maybe 2.  Brad Pitt was really fantastic, but the other actors didn't impress me all that much. <br /> <br />If you're a Greek mythology buff, you will be sorely disappointed.  For everyone else, it's enjoyable if you look past its striking flaws.

B000002UDB|5.0|This is considered one of their best albums by many people, and a lot of people who own the CD have never seen the film. Some people believe that the film was the beginning of the end of the Beatles....  <br /> <br />The first part of the CD is a soundtrack to the short film for TV, the film was considered a flop at the time mostly because it had no storyline, but also because it was a color film (with color effects) that most people watched in black and white. It has become a cult classic and considered one of the first long form music videos.  <br /> <br />\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", sung by Paul, leads it off with a rocker, and then into Paul's keyboard driven \\"Fool on the Hill\\", both of which he does in concert from time to time.  <br /> <br />The instrumental \\"Flying\\" is next, something you can see Austin Powers \\"groovin\\" to. George's very haunting \\"Blue Jay Way\\" inspired by getting lost in the Hollywood Hills has a lot of violin and organ music giving it that eerie sound. But then you hear Paul's peppy homage to old-time concert hall music \\"Your Mother Should Know\\". But one of the standout tracks is John's \\"I Am The Walrus\\", one of the best songs of their career with everything but the kitchen sink thrown into it, the song with it's circuslike intro, John's distorted vocals, and crazy imagery he was known for writing (but somewhat influenced by Lewis Carroll's \\"Through the Looking Glass\\") The \\"video\\" for this song is just as loony, and considered one of the first music videos.  <br /> <br />The rest of the CD is comprised of songs that didn't make it to \\"Sgt Pepper\\" and odds and ends recorded after \\"Pepper\\". But because we're talking about the Beatles, these are no \\"B-sides\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Hello Goodbye\\" starts off the \\"non-soundtrack\\" part of the CD, Paul on lead, and is just an upbeat song that has everything great about the Beatles in it.  <br /> <br />\\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" were hit singles that found a home on the \\"MMT\\" sountrack, and were songs that changed radio. \\"Penny Lane\\" was Paul's and was based on a real street, and was a mix of childhood memories, surreal imagery, and slid by the censors with a play on some words that were and still are pretty perverted. \\"Strawberry Fields\\" is John's take on a place he remembered from his childhood, as disorienting as \\"I Am The Walrus\\",also with the strings and drums as well as the words he used.This time he starts off with this innocent sounding keyboard but soon it goes into a really dark sounding, \\"serious\\" song. It's known that he was \\"chemically enhanced\\" when he wrote the songs, but his wit was still intact.    <br /> <br />\\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\" follows, probably the most \\"throwaway\\" track they've done, but is one of the best representations of what made John and Paul a collaborative force. They're both featured vocalists, their writing style seems to be split down the middle, and George's Eastern influences makes it onto the song. The final song \\"All You Need is Love\\" is John on the lead, and ends the CD on an optimistic note (as most Beatle albums except Sgt Pepper have done) during a time of change, a message that still resonates almost 40 years later. <br /> <br />I think that they should put an extended version of the CD out for the following reasons: <br />Most of the album was remastered for the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" film (in surround)and soundtrack (which sounds better than the 1987 CDs) and \\"Anthology\\" (also in surround).  <br />The film had extra songs on it and background instrumentals.  <br /> <br />It would be great to put outtakes and their Xmas \\"Christmas Time Is Here Again\\" on an extended CD version, as well as interviews they did for the TV movie.  <br /> <br />They should put it out as a CD/DVD package loaded with extras, including the making of the film (which was as insane as what they put into the film). There are video promos for \\"Hello Goodbye\\" (2 versions of it), \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", and the first worldwide premiere of \\"All You Need Is Love\\", which would be a great addition to an already classic album.  <br /> <br />
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I was a little hesitant to buy this version of \\"Nausicaa\\".  This is my absolutely favorite Miyazaki film.  It was the first movie of his that I ever saw, and made me an absolute fanatic for his work.  I have two fan bootlegs and an (*ahem) import Chinese version of this movie.  I even imported the soundtrack from Japan over 15 years ago. <br /> <br />There were two reasons I was hesitant to buy this.  First, infamously, when \\"Naussicaa\\" was first released in the U.S. as \\"Warriors of the Wind\\", it was ridiculously edited, missing large portions of the movie.  That release was so awful that Miyazaki did not release another movie in the U.S. market until the early 90's video release of \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\".  Second, with the bare bones release of Disney titles, I didn't know what else this movie would have to offer over the other versions that I have. <br /> <br />I am so glad that I bought this!  First off, the voice overs are very impressive.  Uma Thurman, Patrick Stewart, Edward James Olmos, and Mark Hamill all do a wonderful job, and match the characters very well.  Standing out in the cast, though, is Alison Lohman.  She matches the inflection and emotion of the Japanese voice artist very well.  I am an avid subtitle fanatic, but with this impressive cast, it was no problem watching the movie in English.  As a bonus, there is a Japanese soundtrack for purists, with subtitles having a more exact translation.  Did I mention that the video transfer is beautiful?  It is. <br /> <br />For a bonus feature, there is a featurette on the history of Studio Ghibli, starting from its inception, up to the release of \\"Monoke Hime\\".  As an avid Miyazaki fan, this alone was worth the price of the disc.  Seriously!  I haven't even watched the second disc of bonus material, but any anime fan will want that featurette. <br /> <br />For those who have stumbled across this film because they have seen \\"Spirited Away\\", or they see the Disney name, I think you will be happily surprised by \\"Nausicaa\\".  I don't have kids, but there are some sophisticated themes in this movie, as well as a demon and some violence; so I think you'd probably be safe showing this to a 10 or 11 year old.  As with most Miyazaki films, the main character of the film in an incredibly strong an complex girl, which I think is a wonderful thing for the younger generations to see in a movie. <br /> <br />For those who have never seen the movie, Naussica takes place far in the future after the world has been virtually destroyed by environmental damage as a byproduct of war and industry.  Poisonous forests and giant insects have taken over much of the world; yet, some kingdoms and small villages still survive, managing to stave off the advances of the forest.  The Valley of the Wind is a small kingdom that has managed to survive by trying to find a balance with the forest around it.  (These are themes that Miyazaki will visit again in \\"Princess Monoke\\".)  The embodiment of this attitude of balance and respect for nature is held in the young princess of Valley, Nausicaa.  Soon, outsiders come crashing into the little village and disrupt the life in the Valley, and Nasicaa is forced to grow and deal with situations beyond her control. <br /> <br />This is a simply wonderful, and magical film.  18 years ago I was a fan of loud, violent, nasty, and grotesque anime.  Then, when I saw \\"Nausicaa\\" at an anime convention, it opened me to an entire new world of film.  Miyazaki is the master of making movies that people of all ages can enjoy.  In my opinion, he does this better than Disney.  He never dumbs-down or panders his films for the younger audience.  He creates young characters who are strong, and yet still show the weakness, indecisiveness, and playfulness of youth.  His young characters are never sappy or, even worse, precocious.  This is a film for everyone, whether you love anime, animation, or film.
B00004U2G4|5.0|I think that this and \\"Beck-Ola\\" are great CDs and any lover of rock music should have these in their collection. <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin is usually mentioned because Jimmy Page became Beck's rival for years because he also used \\"You Shook Me\\" with Led Zeppelin, even though it's different. Page however does play on \\"Beck's Bolero\\" (which was used in part of \\"How Many More Times\\"). Because Led Zeppelin became THE band and their albums became instant classics, the Jeff Beck Group albums with Rod Stewart became \\"cult classics\\" in comparison (even though it sold well when it came out), yet don't think they're any lesser, and if anything, Jeff was able to branch into all types of styles after the band broke up. A lot of people who compare the \\"Yardbirds 3\\" (Beck, Page, and Clapton) will admit that Beck is the best of the three.  <br /> <br />However, they missed out on playing Woodstock, Rod Stewart moved on to his own career as well as with the Faces, and Led Zeppelin's legacy overshadowed these albums for the most part, with the exception of Jeff Beck fans who keep trying to point these out.  <br /> <br />The songs on here are great and the styles varied. These albums showcase Rod's voice, a young punk with a bluesman's voice. They start off in Yardbird territory with a reworked psyechedelic \\"Shapes of Things\\", but check out \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" and Rod's take on \\"You Shook Me\\". <br /> <br />I've heard live tapes of this band (as well as seen clips of them) and the question is why those recordings aren't out on CD, either in a box set in its own right (and not part of Beck or Stewart's own box sets), as part of a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" or on DVD? The live recordings blow away the studio recordings.   <br /> <br />Any lover of rock should have this one, and push Sony's Legacy and Jeff Beck into putting out a box set (they recorded a lot of the Fillmore shows and the BBC sessions) that celebrates a great band, long before JB did fusion and Rod got into hot pants or singing \\"It Had To Be You\\".
B0001UL7RY|1.0|This sucks, how does she call herself a punk rocker she sounds just like all the other crappy pop on mtv. What happened to true punk like the Ramones or the Clash, that was real punk. Avril Lavigne also claims that she plays the guitar, so what she plays it like crap, you could pick the guitar up for one day and be as good as her. If you want to here some real music, some real rock music then check out bands like Silvertide and Rose Hill Drive, they are very talented bands. Don't listen to this MTV crap! F**K MTV!
B000002P5W|5.0|Jimi Hendrix shines like the diamond he is on this album. As compared to his first release (Are You Experienced?), this album is more eratic. But I like that. That is a sign of growth and a commitment to expanding as an artist. Feature tracks on this album include Little Wing, a beautifully short number that should be listened to by anyone interested in picking up a guitar; Castles Made Of Sand, which should be listened to by anyone in need of therapy; And Bold As Love which should just be listened to by everyone. I take that back, all this whole album should just be listened to by everyone. Pure mastery.

0385336810|4.0|Let me start this off by revealing a not-so subtle secret: Sophie Kinsella's first non-Shopaholic book, Can You Keep A Secret? delivers - albeit a few tiny hiccups, and I'd certainly reccommend it. <br /> <br />The story follows a 25 year old Londoner named Emma Corrigan, who is a bit lost in her life as we first meet her - unsure of her career in life, a bit nervous about her long-term relationship, and annoyed with various persons and happenings in her life.  After a disasterous marketing meeting, Emma boards a plane to return home, only to think she is going to crash.  In a grip of terror she spills all of her most intimate secrets to a complete stranger, then minutes later, discovers, no, they aren't going to crash after all. <br /> <br />That might be enough to shake any girls nerves up, but Emma's go through the roof when the 'complete stranger' turns up at her office as the CEO of the company she works for.  The story then follows many twists and turns as Jack Harper (the CEO) taunts Emma with his knowledge, and the two of them sort out what they think of one another. <br /> <br />All in all a sweet, fun, enchanting read that had me gobbling it all up within a couple of days.  It would have been much faster had the first couple of chapters moved a bit quicker, but the majority of the book is quite the page turner. <br /> <br />The main reason why I'm giving the book four out of five is despite is hilarity, unique and detailed characters, and intriguing storyline, I found Kinsella relied a bit too much on the mechanisms that are already in place in her Shopaholic books.  In fact for the first few chapters I kept on expecting to be reading a Shopaholic book. <br /> <br />The main character Emma is much like Becky Bloomwood (star of the Shopaholic series), in that she is quirky, impulsive, easily upset and nervous, and rather concerned with her appearance.  Then there are other similarities - the dashing, wealthy, older male character, the slightly ditzy friend(Christina, Emma's work chum fills this role), the twist early on in the book further complicated by a second twist much later on in the book, and in general the style of writing.   <br /> <br />Granted it is a unique style, and Kinsella does what she knows best.  In general I give her props for writing a book outside of the series that has made her famous, and for writing a book well.  Pick it up if you like Kinsella's writing, chick lit, or are just looking for a good read this year.
B00004BZ16|5.0|It was 1980 and the Ultra Righteaous Right had won with Reagan at the Captain's Seat and here come The Clash singing what I consider one of the last protest recordings of our generation ( born in the 50`s ) . Because of it and the anxiety of the times , I left the Usa and moved into the Caribbean where I have been very happy indeed ... Look Here : Up in Heaven ... After Sandinista there was nothing until Big Audio Dynomite came along and very ahead of their time ... Enjoy ...
B00003BDXG|1.0|I hate this movie. I really really do! It's not art, it's crap...all of it. Oliver stone must have been high or something when he made this! There are about 35 cuts in 1 minute (I counted them) and the screen changes colour from yellow to red to blue to black and white and then back to normal again. Confused? you will be. It's totally unrealisticly filmed and practically hurts your eyes when you watch it. i couldn't watch the last half hour it was so bad. Even Tarantino didn't want his name on the credits because he thought it was so bad, and didn't want people to know he was involved in making it.  <br /> <br />I hate may copy. It's broken...I stood on it by 'accident'. <br />
0440236738|4.0|In the book Gone For Good, Will Klein has to deal with a lot of pain and emotional issues throughout his life. First was the murder of his first love eleven years earlier. The suspected murderer was his older brother Ken who disappeared after right after the murder of Julie Miller. Ken was later thought to be dead because no traces of him were ever found <br /> 11 years later, while at his mothers death, Will finds a recent picture of his brother Ken hidden under a picture frame. Wills fianc Sheila later disappears and Will starts finding out unbelievable secretes about both his brother and fianc.  <br /> The book itself was good but it reminded me about his book Tell No One. They both deal with the same issue- a disappearance of a loved one who later receives clues that they are still alive. The book is easy to comprehend and is also a fast read. What I mostly liked about it is that I was never bored. It kept me thinking about what was going to happen next. <br />
B0007XT87G|2.0|Just one listen...that's all it took. Now before you give me the old \\"this album has to be absorbed slowly\\" bullcrap, let me say that normally I will give new albums their due time to sink in and Porcupine Tree is certainly a band who's work normally calls for that. Yet there is nothing in this album that even comes close to requiring attentive and repeated listening, and that's the main problem with \\"Deadwing\\".    \\"Deadwing\\" is prog...I get it. \\"Deadwing\\" has some metal parts...I get it. \\"Deadwing\\" has cute little electronic blips and bloops in the background...I get it. \\"Deadwing\\" has effects-laden vocals...I get it. The reason I got it all on the first listen is because I've heard this all before, mostly from inferior bands.    Good experimental music will always demand lots of time for deciphering...only when the riddles have been solved and the codes broken can a decision be made on whether or not the listener can connect with the message, relate to it and enjoy it. So why are all the five star reviews and proclamations of \\"masterpiece\\" being thrown around so quickly? Because all these people instantly love this album...hardly a reaction you would expect from supposedly \\"progressive\\" music.    Steven Wilson was better than this. He never needed to rely on dumbed down metal riffs to communicate a hard edge in the music. He did it through atmosphere. This album lacks the breathing space to allow any atmosphere to seep in because the arrangements are so circular and busy.    I wonder how many fans of this album are fans of metal. I would ask them if they truly believed ANY of the riffs on \\"Deadwing\\" would be suitable on an Enslaved or Immortal album. At this point, the riffs on \\"Deadwing\\" wouldn't make the cut on a Tool album. So why bother? PT was fine without dabbling in a genre they know little to nothing about. Guest singer Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth is a self-admitted lazy musician and songwriter and he STILL comes up with better riffs. If Steve Wilson just HAD to be metal on \\"Deadwing\\" why didn't he just PAY a Norwegian to come into the studio and blast some fuzz into this album? PT trying to be Dream Theater is not five-star stuff guys.    The non-metal moments try desperately to salvage the albim's cohesiveness, but I got the impression Wilson was concentrating so much on being \\"hard and prog\\" that he forgot to spend any effort fleshing out the softer and more ambient material.    Bottom line: Wilson has got to expect more from his music than quick hits of time-signature changes and stomp boxes set to \\"metal\\".
B00005JNQ8|4.0|The Interpreter is helmed by Oscar-winning director Sydney Pollack and Oscar winners Nicole Kidman, Sean Penn and an Oscar nominee Catherine Zeener. The story line may not be exactly intriguing but offers a good glimpse of the United Nations. What made the political thriller thrilling has to be the strong performances by the leads.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman has come a long way and even in a role where she is required to speak in different languages including an African tribal language (fictitious?), she comes across as being a natural. In emotional scenes, Kidman's facial expression conveys the story even before she speaks. Sean Penn resonates in his role as a secret service agent troubled by the death of his ex-wife. The lines exchanged between Kidman and himself are mostly well-scripted and even funny at times.<br /><br />The part of the story that stuck out as a sore thumb would probably be the suggested romance between the two leads. Luckily, it didn't quite happen.<br /><br />The mix of political theme including United Nations, genocide and terrorism is good material which could easily become too predictable or incredulous if not carefully handled. For the most part, Pollack has kept the story exciting for viewers to want to find out what's happening next. Credit should also go the screenwriter for some of the best lines in the movie: \\"United Nations - too many layer of words but no action\\", \\"Vengeance is just a lazy form of grief\\" and \\"The smallest whisper can be heard over the largest army when it speaks the truth.\\"
B0002OERI0|2.0|Have listened to this three times through and for the life of me don't understand what all the hype is about. It's a listenable pop/punk CD, but not the work of art that it's been built up as. <br /> <br />In fact, it's one big musical cliche after another...almost entirely unoriginal. Take out the vocal track and what you have are rock musical ideas from about 20-25 years ago. Innovative melodies or progressions? none. Solos or musicianship? nope. The instrumental track could be a stock backing track for any intermediate guitarist jam track. <br /> <br />Now let's look at the lyrics. What, another tale of disaffected youth and bashing the middle class American way of life? How many times has this been done? Do we get a new spin here? nope. I'm not a big fan of Rage Against the Machine, but at least their politics are honest. Green Day is a pop band with a formula to sell records...no heart in their political or social commentary.  <br /> <br />Last, the vocals themselves. With their nasal-monotone-fake-Brit-accent vocals Green Day has actually become a cliche of themselves. We get it...you're \\"punks\\". But you're from Rodeo, CA, not Bristol.  <br /> <br />How did this get a Grammy? Wait, Lauren Hill and Macy Gray got this kind of hype too. If you're reading this and going, \\"Who the hell are they?\\"...you get my point. <br /> <br />Gave this 2 stars for being a radio worthy, song for the moment kind of album. Beyond that it's far too formulaic, commercial, and unoriginal.
0802130208|1.0|&#34;Fat, boorish a-hole takes a job.&#34; - Cliff Hillegass, complete first draft  There are, it appears, only two impressions of this book - &#34;Most amazing use of paper since, well, ever&#34; (5 star) - and &#34;I just don't get it&#34; (1 star).  I'm in the latter camp.  Sucked in by all the hype, I began reading this dreck and I kept reading on hoping it would &#34;arrive,&#34; that I'd &#34;get&#34; what all the buzz has been about. Then I reached the back cover.  Confederacy of Dunces is the Anti-Atlas Shrugged.  Where, in the latter the central characters are Supremely attractive, smart, and ambitious, each pursuing some Monty-Burnsian master plan, in Confederacy, everyone is inhumanly vile, unattractive, ignorant, and lazy -- losers all, not so much living as ambling through life in a Brownian sort of way, inflicting unpleasantness and misfortune on everyone that crosses their path.  Evidently this is the stuff of laugh out loud high comedy and there's much money to be made in the novelization of all the Three Stooges shorts.  With no apology to Sam Gross, &#34;That's not funny. That sick.&#34;  This isn't humor, it's sad and depressing.  By mid-way through the book, what kept me turning the next page was a misplaced hope that the author's innate sense of justice and decency would have Jack Torrance come down from the Overlook and plant a fire axe squarely between the shoulder blades of each and every character in this book.  If I wanted to immerse myself in the absolute worst that humanity has to offer, I don't need to read; I can sit back and watch Elimidate.  John Kennedy Toole apparently came to an untimely end due to severe depression.  A tragic end, of course.  If I were forced to spend a year or more in the company of these characters, let alone penning and giving form to these people, however, I'd be inclined to do so, myself.
B000009HF2|5.0|I cannot even remember how many Friday and Saturday nights my friends and I spent listening to this album.  What a great recording by a great artist!  It was the Mid-70s and Peter Frampton was hot.  There has never been and probably never will be a better live recording.  Anyone who does not appreciate this recording, did not live through the 70s rock and roll period.  They have only experienced it after the fact.  Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed.  <br />
B00000K19E|2.0|Just an awful, boring movie. Some neat special effects, but nothing that comes near worth sitting through. If I had the choice between watching \\"The Matrix\\" again or leafing through some month-old copies of \\"People\\" magazine at my dentist's office, I'd go for the magazines.<br /><br />\\"The Matrix\\" is to science fiction as carob is to chocolate. 'Nuff said.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Yes, I actually understand all the hype. I know some people are apprehensive, but if you're a real Mariah fan, then there's a good chance that you'll really dig this album. If you liked \\"Butterfly,\\" then \\"Mimi\\" should be to your liking also. The hype is for real, because collectively, this might be her best album to date. She really does utilize her voice the best on this album. Mariah does strike the perfect balance. I suppose it's hard to imagine her being as good as she was in the 90's if you keep rehashing \\"Glitter\\" and \\"Charmbracelet.\\" But Mariah is definitely back. This is the real album that people have been waiting for. Mariah is a great talent and \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is the definitive example of why.
0783225849|5.0|Ever since first seeing Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork, \\"Psycho\\", it has firmly held down a high ranking in my \\"Top Films Of All-Time\\" category. \\"Psycho\\" began scaring audiences when it first hit theater screens in June 1960, and it's doing the same thing even today, many decades later.<br /><br />This motion picture has a way of \\"sucking you in\\" almost right from the start.  I'm not quite sure why, but (for me) when watching \\"Psycho\\", I always begin to start squirming in my seat just a wee bit during the film's second scene, when the man with the wad of cash enters Janet Leigh's office. It's a feeling that seems to be inherent to a Hitchcock film.  It's probably part psychological on the part of the viewer.  Since we know we're seeing a Hitchcock picture, we automatically tend to feel slightly ill-at-ease at almost every turn.  Hitch no doubt *knew* his audiences would feel this way, and took advantage of it with a masterful subtleness in much of his direction and in the scripts he ultimately brought to the big screen.<br /><br />The plot in \\"Psycho\\" is relatively simple (so it seems), but in the hands of \\"The Master\\" (aka: Mr. Hitchcock), the film takes a drastic turn 47 minutes in, with 57% of the movie still in front of us. I'm sure you know what this \\"turn\\" entails.  If not, buy this DVD post-haste, because you're one of the very few who evidently has not basked in the beauty of this motion picture.<br /><br />Between Mr. Hitchcock's inimitable style of direction, and that unforgettable Bernard Herrmann music score, how could this film be anything but what it is -- an unsurpassed horror/suspense icon.<br /><br />There's a veritable laundry list of memorable moments in the film that are almost instantly recognized as distinct \\"Psycho\\" signatures. Such as -----<br /><br />> The spooky old house on the hill, which seems to be \\"watching\\" all that happens below from its lofty perch.<br /><br />> \\"Bates Motel -- Vacancy\\".<br /><br />> The staircase.<br /><br />> \\"Mother\\" moving past the window.<br /><br />> Marion's \\"eye\\".<br /><br />> That knife-stabbing music.<br /><br />> \\"Cabin 1\\".<br /><br />> \\"Mother...m-m-my mother, what is the phrase? She's not quite herself today.\\"<br /><br />> Mrs. Bates in the cellar.<br /><br />> And, of course, that dreaded \\"shower\\".<br /><br />All of these set-pieces add up to the whole that is the magnificence of \\"Psycho\\".<br /><br />The video quality on this non-anamorphic DVD looks exceptionally good for an older (1998) DVD release.  You can freeze-frame an image in almost perfect, undistorted clarity anywhere on this disc (which is unusual for non-anamorphic video material), indicating a solid transfer.  The image ratio here is the Widescreen OAR (Original Aspect Ratio) of 1.85:1.<br /><br />The audio you hear comes from Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtracks. It would be great if there had also been a Stereo re-mix done here, so that Bernard Herrmann's always-effective music score could be \\"expanded\\" upon in the realm of Stereo (or even a Surround Sound format).  Still, this original Mono track does very well for itself.<br /><br />This single-disc DVD \\"Collector's Edition\\" of \\"Psycho\\" from Universal Studios does the movie proud. It's brimming over with fulfilling bonus supplements, including a scrumptious feature-length documentary, \\"The Making Of Psycho\\", which runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes.  This feature is chock-full of useful behind-the-scenes tidbits and goodies that should delight any fan.  I particularly enjoyed the interview segments with \\"Psycho\\" screenwriter Joseph Stefano. This \\"Making Of\\" is one of the best of its kind to ever come down the pike for any DVD release (IMO).  It's very nearly a \\"second\\" movie on this disc.<br /><br />But the producers of this Universal Digital Disc didn't stop with just placing on it a terrific and stylish movie-length documentary feature. No, there's a lot more where that came from.  The disc also contains:<br /><br />>> Newsreel Footage: \\"The ReleaseOf Psycho\\". -- This splendid bonus, which has a run time of 7:42, is an \\"Advanced Press Book on Film\\" (a quote from this newsreel).  This feature (I assume) was distributed to theaters around the U.S.A. before the film's widespread initial release in the summer of 1960, to demonstrate, as stated in the newsreel, \\"the care and handling of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' \\".

0767836286|5.0|Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins give Oscar-like performances in this chilling tale.  It is a sobering look at home-grown terrorism and how it can be found in our own back yard.  The movie makes one wonder if another Oklahoma City incident is possible.  How many people hate America, using the government as their demon?  In this bone-chilling tale, the good guys don't always win, and that is the most sobering part of the film.
B000002GGU|5.0|This is undoubtediy his most popular album (with 1991's Waking <br /> up the neighbours in 2 place. This has all the best songs of his <br /> 1980's career. It has the power ballad Heaven, which was his first #1 single. It has the rocking side with Run to you, Summer <br /> of '69, and Kids wanna rock. He also sings duet with Tina Turner <br /> on It's only love. I really wish he would try to recapture the <br /> essence of this time, instead of the work he's putting out now. <br /> If you only buy one B.A. album. Make it this one.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This Spielberg/Hanks produced HBO miniseries is undoubtedly the best TV miniseries ever produced and, if compared to films, would be one of the 5 best war films of all time.    In this mini-series, the audience is immersed into the best cinematic representation of what WWII was like for those brave soldiers who fought the last stretch of WWII in Europe from Normandy to Berlin 6/44-5/45.  Germany was on the wane but still had plenty of fighting left in it especially in Belgium during the Winter of 1944 in the Ardennes.  The story follows the lives of soldiers/friends assigned to EZ Company of the 101st Airborne who were dropped off behind enemy lines in Normandy as avant-garde contingents; they continued to serve in France, Belgium, Holland, Austria, and Germany until the end of the war in Europe.  Each DVD also contains an interview with the actual veterans whose lives are represented in the series where they recall and describe (sometimes with great emotion and difficulty) the experiences they felt and the bonds of friendship they formed in those harrowing years.      As for the production values of the film, they are simply outstanding and equal, if not superior, to Spielberg's own 'Saving Private Ryan.'  This 10-hour miniseries is much deeper in character study and plot than any film could be and is therefore a superior production in that respect.  Although the series has one central character it tends to focus on, each episode in the film represents the perspective/narrative of one particular character in the platoon/company/batallion and their perspective on the events.  The acting is simply outstanding on the part of every actor in the series.  The special effects are as good if not better than 'Saving Private Ryan.'  In addition, the production is as faithful as possible to every detail of that period from speech/mannerisms, dress, uniforms, armaments, etc.    This is without a doubt the best miniseries ever made and one of the top 5 war films to be produced.Steven Spielberg has outdone himself in terms of producing this simply outstanding work of art.  This is a great film not only in terms of entertainment but also in terms of educating our youth as to the great courage and sacrifice demonstrated by these valliant soldiers and what their lives and times were like.  The most moving for me was to watch and hear the interviews of those men depicted in the series; when I see them cry and contemplate in silence as they remember those fateful years, I can only feel humble and respect the fact that they have experienced horrors and/or such selfless acts of heroism that are simply too painful for them to recite even today.  This miniseries is truly nothing less than a great mark in the achievement of film and historical reenactment/preservation: I most strongly recommend its purchase.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray left us with a fantastic CD to remember him by. There are 12 songs and I thoroughly enjoyed 11 of them. Probably the best song here is the first one, \\"Here We Go Again\\" with Norah Jones. This baby just oozes with soul and Ms. Jones is mature beyond her years. A close second is Ray's duet with Gladys Knight on the gospel classic \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" with a huge choir and orchestra. To round out my top three is his duet with Van Morrison on the live \\"Crazy Love\\". I think that Ray brings the best out of Morrison. <br /> <br />The rest of this CD is near perfect as well. Some fabulous chart arrangements from Victor Vanacore on \\"Hey Girl\\" with Michael McDonald, \\"Somewhere over the Rainbow\\" with Johnny Mathis and \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\" with an old sounding Willie Nelson. Too bad `Ol Blue Eyes wasn't still around to sing it the way it was meant to be but the strings here sounded spectacular. Ray and Diana Krall nicely cover the Eddy Arnold classic \\"You Don't Know Me\\" and a playful Natalie Cole has some strong chemistry with Ray on \\"Fever\\". Then there's a duet with Bonnie Raitt playing some nasty slide at the beginning of \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?\\" and what a treat to have Ray on piano with BB King playing Lucille on \\"Sinner's Prayer\\".  <br /> <br />The last song Ray ever recorded was his duet of \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\" with Elton John. Nicely done but a bit disconcerting having two men singing a romantic duet together, even if one of them is Elton. The only weak track here is his duet of \\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" with James Taylor. To my ears, Ray sounds more like Randy Newman on this track and is there anybody with less soul than JT? But 11 great songs out of 12 is pretty damn good for a 70 year old man struggling with cancer. <br /> <br />So a superb song selection, nicely written liner notes, Billy Preston on the Hammond B3 throughout most of this CD and amazing chemistry between Ray and whomever he sings with makes for a fabulous swan song to a gloriousand prolific career.   <br />
B0002OERI0|3.0|I have been a Green Day fan since the Dookie days.I grew up listening to Billie Joe, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool and I used to think Green Day was the greatest band in the world...but not anymore.I cant believe these guys have changed so much over the years.I guess the punk rock gods have mellowed (which has made them terribly boring!).American Idiot is a disappointing album and is way too overrated.If you are hoping to find the agressive,cheeky songs which were characteristic of Green Day(pre Warning days) in this album,you're mistaken.Billie Joe's attempt to re-create the American Idiot version(Wake Me Up When September Ends)of Nimrod's Good Riddance is a disaster.But American Idiot is not that bad, I mean there are some tracks like Jesus of Suburbia,Holiday,Whatsername,Give Me Novacaine which kick a**,but I still prefer listening to my old Nimrod cd anyday.
0451450523|5.0|I have watched the movie as the first animation ever on theatre here and was mesmerized by it. Now, I had the second chance to appreciate it by reading the book. Oh, I found the source story is more beautiful than ever. As most movies from book, though the plots are almost the same, but there are details and small plots that weren't included. My understandings, feelings, thoughts and visions are deepened from the reading experience. I must watch the movie all over again.  <br /> <br />Mr. Beagle is a great storyteller. He didn't just make a fantasy with typical plot, but he used details from other fairytales and composed them as the frame to represent his thoughts. So, my opinion about this story has not changed since I watched it in 1980's: this is a beautiful original one. Just consider these points: Do your part in this life though you don't seem to like it now; define your own time; there's no ending to the story of life, only the continuation from one story to the next; and last but not the least: unicorns live forever @-->--
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera captivates you with every lyric, filling you with deep curiosity and flying beauty! Phantom brings you the things you've always looked for in a film, from romance to charm to excitement to sorrow. <br />            While I don't like the fact that Joel Schumacher- of all people- directed it, I think the magic of the musical is still within itself, soaring above all other films at the theater. The few flaws include the small changes in between shots of the same scene, as well as a few singing slips, but the instrumentals cover it all so that you can't even notice it... <br />           I especially enjoyed the music in \\"All I Ask of You\\", which takes you back to the classic movies in it's orchestra phenomenon. I also loved \\"Masquerade\\" as it enthralls you in happiness and wonder, and the lyrics of \\"The Music of the Night\\", which sent chills down my spine. <br />           The honest truth is that 'Phantom' is not the thing you have the chance to see every day. It is original and exciting, from one note to the next.
B0007O38XU|4.0|Following the multi-million-dollar success that George Lucas enjoyed with his original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy of films released in 1977, 1980 and 1983, comedic actor/writer/director Mel Brooks was inspired to create one of his most outlandish films in 1987 entitled \\"Spaceballs\\".  The film begins on the dark planet of Spaceball, which no longer has a breathable atmosphere.  There, President Skroob (Mel Brooks) wants to steal another planet's atmosphere and transport it back to planet Spaceball, so he orders Colonel Sandurz (George Wyner) and Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis spoofing \\"Darth Vader\\") to take a giant military spaceship (much much larger than any of Lucas' spaceships, except for the Deathstar) to planet Druidia to kidnap Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga spoofing \\"Princess Leia\\") and hold her for ransom.  On planet Druidia, Princess Vespa is scheduled to marry the very boring Prince Valium (JM J. Bullock) as arranged by her father, King Roland (Dick Van Patten).  However, when Princes Vespa has cold feet, she runs from the Druidic church with her android, Dot Matrix (voice of Joan Rivers spoofing \\"C3PO\\"), and takes off from planet Druidia in what was to be her honeymoon spaceship.  In space, she is encountered by the giant Spaceball ship, but is rescued by the trader/smuggler Lone Starr (Bill Pullman spoofing \\"Han Solo\\") and his sidekick Barfolemew 'Barf' (John Candy, 1950-1994, spoofing \\"Chewbacca\\") in a space-worthy Winnebago RV.  As with the constant love-hate relationship that Princess Leia and Han Solo had in Lucas' \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, so too do Princess Vespa and Lone Starr have a similar relationship.  Along the way though, Lone Starr finds out from a mysterious Yoda-like character named Yogurt (Mel Brooks again) that he's really a prince and sets out to rescue Princess Vespa who had eventually been captured by Dark Helmet.  It is from Yogurt that we hear those immortal words, \\"May the schwartz be with you,\\" spoofing Lucas' creation of the Force in \\"Star Wars\\".<br /> <br />With hilarious one-liners, a classic Mel Brooks storyline, good actors and reasonable special effects, \\"Spaceballs\\" is a truly funny comedic sci-fi spoof.  Rick Moranis' portrayal of Dark Helmet is one of the funniest roles, especially since he can't always keep his visor open.  Also funny are George Wyner and Joan Rivers.  Overall, I rate \\"Spaceballs\\" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a great spoof by Mel Brooks, sci-fi and a good laugh.  Even product merchandising isn't free of being spoofed by Mel Brooks in this hilarious film.
0596009208|5.0|I noticed that the best praises for this book came mainly from readers who know something about OO-programming and Java.  Readers who bought this book to learn Java seem unable to follow what's going on.  <br /> <br />It's ironic as the book is meant to be a beginner's book.  But why is this book getting praises from seasoned Java programmers and not the other way round.  The obvious explanation is that this book is not easy for a beginner to follow.  A beginner needs structured, step-by-step, no-brainer instructions, which this book doesn't provide.  Head First Java is more of a 3-in-1 book; a thinking book, a helicopter-view book and an enlightenment book.  And that is why it appeals to readers who know Java.  It brought them insight and enlightenment, sort of seeing the big picture.  The experience would be, like that of the four blind man describing an elephant, would have felt if their sight were restored.   <br /> <br />My advice to beginners is not to rely on this book to learn Java.  It's too advanced for you.  Get a traditional book on Java and read concurrently with Head First Java or after you are quite conversant with the Java language.

0143034901|5.0|I give The Shadow of the Wind five stars.  So far, it is one of my favorite modern books.  The disappointment I find is in regards to some of the critics.  I guess one may find the book predictable, but I did not.  Maybe I was too enthralled and fell in love with the characters to bother figuring out its twists.  If you love books as much as I do this book will captivate you catapulting you into a world full of words of wisdom and love.  You either adore or despise each character hoping for the best or worst outcome for each.  In every novel I have read, dialogue between characters can often be corny and/or irrelevant.  The Shadow of the Wind's dialogue brought me to tears and laughter void of dull language.  I have read many National Bestsellers and have been disappointed in the story, language and/or outcome.  Sometimes I wonder how our literary minds define National Bestsellers.  The product of this novel enlightened me regarding my personal goals.  I thank Mr. Zafon for producing a beautiful novel touching the soul of a reader and writer.
1572814349|5.0|I really love the look of these cards. I am not really a collector of Tarot cards but I have set that I use regularly by Hanson-Roberts, I am usually not drawn to other cards but these are quite beautiful, and the collage Kate Black has used to create each card in flawless and captivating. I am impressed by the images she chose. They are rich in color and detail and come in a nice sturdy box to store them in. The edges are gilded in gold and  are beautiful renaissance paintings depicting the traditional Rider-Waite symbolism. My only complaint is they are a little large for my hands as they bigger measuring 3\\" X 5\\" then the standard 2 1/2\\" X 3\\" playing card size. You won't be disappointed with these cards, they are beautiful.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is simply another way to fall in love with a great story and wonderful music. I saw the musical three times and enjoyed it more each time. When the movie came out I read the reviews and pretty much read everything a pompus ill accomplished critic would say. Don't believe any negative retoric, this is truly a masterpiece. This film does as good a job of capturing magic and integrity of the musical.
0375500901|4.0|This is the first book in the Gabriel Allon series by Daniel Silva.  Allon is the reluctant part time spy working for Israeli Intelligence whose covert skills are the stuff of legend within the small community of \\"secret agents\\".  His cover skills are those of professional art restoration, primarily \\"old masters\\" paintings and sculpture, for which his talents in that field are world renown.  <br /> <br />While this may be the first book (as of this review there are 5) in the series, it is not necessary to read this book first, since the book takes place at a time in the life of Gabriel Allon when he has already forsaken his work as a spy.  We learn about Allon's past and his initiation into the world of spying through flashback and his past is not necessarily central to the story.  Other books in the series take the reader into Gabriel's past just as effectively and therefore you don't really have to start with this book to understand what Gabriel is all about. <br /> <br />Daniel Silva has a true gift for captivating plot and character development.  The characters in his books are self reflecting and you really begin to understand the emotional turmoil that goes with the work of tracking down punishing international terrorists.  This book is an exciting weekend read!  Silva has Gabriel on the trail of Tariq the Palestinian terrorist bent on derailing the peace process.  Tariq and Gabriel are not strangers to one another, as Gabriel is the man who mercilessly killed Tariq's older brother and as revenge Tariq exploded a car that contained Gabriel's wife and only son.  The \\"bad blood\\" between these two enemies plays out across Europe and North America in a fast paced thriller that both memorable and very enjoyable.  The surprises and betrayals extend beyond the exciting climatic confrontation between Gabriel and Tariq, and are just part of what makes this book so entertaining.
B00005JNQ8|2.0|It is the slowest dullest movie to hit the screens in recent times.  Kidman plays an Interpreter working at the United Nations who overhears an assination plot.  From there the film just goes downhill, and it's hard to feel anything for any of the characters. Sean Penn acts like he doesnt really want to be there, and Kidman is unconvincing as the South African.  The other problem with the film is that it goes on for too long!  <br /> <br />To market the film, they have plasted Sidney Pollack as Director all over it (as if it guarantees a sure-fire hit) and the fact that it was filmed in the United Nations Building. <br /> <br />I really wanted to enjoy the film but found it uninteresting, dull and a big try-hard.  Definitely one viewing is enough.  Can't understand the box office bliss that it got on its opening weekend.  Assume it was because nothing else was on.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The Mariah I fell in love with as a young teen girl is back! This record is so soulful. I love EVERY track. She gives her all on each and every song. She proves that she is indeed in a  league of her own. Who else can out sing Mariah? Who has her range? I say no one can compete with her in the industry right now.  <br /> <br /> The hip hop isn't on over kill which is great! It adds just the right amount of vibe and collabo to make this a truly GREAT record! I don't skip any of the songs. I really love them all. It was worth every penny I spent!!! Mariah looks BEAUTIFUL on the cover and insert and I'm so glad she's BACK!
B00000099Y|5.0|the reviewers that give this album 1 star are simply looking at this masterpiece from the wrong standpoint. this is progressive, yet if you are looking for a guitarist comparable to john pertucci or any type of overly complex musicianship, than this is the wrong place to be looking. this album is not showy, musically complex or technical, it is purely emotional and intellectual. this album does take time to grow on you, but when it does, you realize that there is a rare amount of brain behind it. for one thing this album is put together no less than perfectly. from start to finish, this album is intelectually deep, and though not complex, musically educated.

B000001FT2|5.0|This sounds just as mind-blowing, sexy, seductive, and way ahead of its time as it did in 1981 when I first bought the LP when I was like 13 years old - been a big Grace fan ever since, but I don't think she's made a more consistent, ground-breaking and just...well...PERFECT album.  The songs here - Walking in the Rain, Pull Up to the Bumper, Feel Up, Use Me, Demolition Man, etc. - you could record them tomorrow, and they would STILL sound like nothing else around.  Grace is/was a singular artist; I just wish she would get more credit than she receives - and while you're at it, why not RE-ISSUE her sadly, glaringly out of print early LPs like MUSE, etc.?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...\\"Firefly\\" deserves second, third, fourth...and so on and so on looks and viewings. From fans to those of you who have never heard of it. Just about anyone can relate to at least ONE of the characters in this story. It's writing is simplistic in its complexity, it uses little words to accomplish so much, and the ship itself becomes one of the most influential characters in the entire series. If there was ONE show that another network should pick up and run with...it should be this one. <br /> <br />Everyone that can...should watch this dvd set and find out for themselves what they've been missing out on...the THEME song is enough to go and watch this set. My recommendation...buy it...watch it...watch it again to pick up what you missed in the parts where you find yourself laughing to yourself...and then...GO SHOW IT TO A FRIEND! <br /> <br />Invite people over to watch it. Loan it out to people (harder to do than it sounds)...but seriously...you should go watch this set, and then purchase it. If nothing else...to support the actors and the brilliant creator of this wonderful show!
B0008JFMEC|4.0|It looks and works great on the PSP, but my only complaint is that there is only two subtitle modes: All off, or all English on. In the DVD version there was an option to translate (display) only the Japanese words and not the English ones. Otherwise, a good buy if you want a great movie on the go.

630200084X|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Tornatore is a master at highlighting the dusty beauty of little southern Italian towns. You find yourself totally engrossed in the movie and it stirs something inside that makes you melancholically look back to your own childhood. <br />One thing however, the magic goes away when you do not leave anything to the imagination. The uncut version explains and dwells on everything so much that it completely destroys the feel of the original version. Fully enjoy the theatrical version FIRST and then go back to the uncut for the extra stuff.
B000683VI4|5.0|\\"The most romantic movie since Titanic.\\"  When I read this in the headlines, I wanted to see this movie.   And trust me, this is a very romantic, emotional, beautiful film.     The actors make the story come to life. They act so good, that you have the feeling that it's all happening 'live' right before your eyes. The way how they express their emotion, their feeling, there love for eachother is very realistic.    The locations and sets that are used in this film are maqnificent to give the movie a great look. You feel like you're really there.  Also the music is used as a perfect background to bring even more emotion to the scenes.    Then, there is the story. A strong love story about two young people who fall in love and have the romance that everbody wants to experience. But then, it goes terribly wrong, and the lovers go different paths, but are brought together again by faith. But of course, the life around them has changed, bringing them in a difficult situation.    I really recommend this movie to you if you loved the lovestories in movies like \\"Titanic\\", \\"Romeo + Juliet\\", or even \\"Pearl Harbor\\", or any other great romance movie.     A few minutes ago I was still watching this film for the first time. All I can say is that I'm breathless.   When the credits were rolling over the screen I was just thinking one word: \\"Wow\\"    I hope you'll have the same experience.
B00005JNVS|5.0|Shanghai, China, the 1930s.  The Axe Gang is taking over the town but is not interested in the poor slums. This leaves the residents of Pig Sty Alley to deal with their overbearing Landlady. One day, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick,  walk into the Alley and attempt to blackmail people there. When the residents of the tenement stand up to fight him, he reveals that he is part of the Axe Gang and signals for help. Gang members show up and the landlady and the tenement residents fight them off. The Axe Gang realizes that they have been called to help someone who is not a part of the gang, but Sing is desperate to become a member. Now that the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley have met, they can't back down from each other, fighting until one group is victorious. The leader of the Axe Gang realizes that he will not be able to fight them alone and brings in The Beast.<br /><br />\\"Kung Fu Hustle\\", written and directed by the star, Stephen Chow, is a fun, exhilarating, fast-paced film, borrowing elements from and paying homage to many other genres. Chow is clearly a filmmaker who loves films; he seems like a kid in a candy store. Now that he can make a film, how many different types of things can he get into the story? \\"Hustle\\" combines all of these elements in a way that is fresh and exciting.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a homage to police interrogation films and westerns. When the opposing sides face off on a dusty road, we are transported from Shanghai to the Wild West. The sky turns magenta and everybody faces off, preparing for a classic gun fight. This scene is very theatrical, comical and sets the tone for the remainder of the film. Of course, we aren't in the Old West and the leader of the Axe Gang uses an axe to prove his point and keep us firmly rooted in the world of kung-fu.<br /><br />The story is a framework for Chow to throw each and every trick in the book at the audience. After he introduces the Axe Gang, we then meet the residents of Pig Sty Alley. Landlord walks through the shops, receiving tributes and terrorizing everyone in a jovial way. Until he meets up with his wife, Landlady, who terrorizes her husband. Everyone in the Alley appears perfectly normal until Sing shows up.<br /><br />When the two groups meet, we learn that people have special skills that they hesitate to use, unless absolutely necessary. They will do anything to protect their lives and friends. This leads to a series of amusing, entertaining fights, in which their skills are comically enhanced by special effects. Chow deftly blends all of these elements together making them appear somehow natural. Amazing considering all of the special effects, cartoon style action and over the top acting. Once we have accepted that these things can happen in this universe, we can accept the behavior as it becomes more cartoonish and more outlandish.<br /><br />The story, while slight, is effective at creating a character that we can root for. Chow's Sing is just a guy looking to join the Axe Gang, but as he witnesses their brutality, he seems more drawn to the people of Pig Sty Alley. He realizes that their efforts to use their powers, only when absolutely necessary, to defend themselves, is the more responsible course of action. Throughout the film, we see glimpses of a pivotal moment in his childhood; he saves a deaf mute girl from a bunch of bullies and buys a book about kung-fu from a street beggar. Later, we learn that Sing may be the Chosen One. To live up to this prophecy, he has to make some changes in his life.<br /><br />All of these over-the-top, disparate elements combined together would normally create a mess of a film. In \\"Hustle\\", they come together to create a fun, enjoyable film that will hopefully spur filmmakers to come up with more creative ways to tell a story.of Pig Sty Alley.

0064407667|5.0|Lemony Snicket has the most unique writing style I have ever encountered. This book is absolutely fantastic and does not cause the reader to feel bored at all. The humor of the writing and the definitions of various words are very entertaining. The story is great as well. Excitement and laughter fill the pages, despite the author's quite depressing description of the story. Buy this book if you can. In fact, buy the entire series if possible.
6304806418|3.0|First off, I'm a huge Madonna fan. I loved her music for over 20 years, but her acting is another story. I agree with most people that didn't like the movie at all. Madonna is not a good actress, but also she doesn't have the vocals to pull this movie off. It's not all bad. In many songs she sounds very good but it does seem strained at times and uncomfortable. No doubt her vocals have improved due to her singing lessons for this film, which is evident in her later albums.   <br /> <br />The movie as a whole is very MTV. It's chopped up in way to get tour attention and distracting from a weak script. I didn't come away really knowing Evita as a person. The movie is completely sung which is a little irritating. If it was done the way most musicals are done then I think there would have been better character development. Let's blame the director for that.  <br /> <br />The DVD itself is bare. It should have the actors at the premiere, Madonna's speech for her Golden Globe (which by the way was very moving). If only she can incorporate those kind of emotions to her acting then she would be on to something. The picture and sound are beautiful and Madonna does look amazing. If you don't care for Madonna, don't subject yourself to this movie. If you are a Madonna fan, skip to the more enjoyable songs. There are some good songs and Madonna does some of those songs well.
0142004235|5.0|I read this book for the first time many years ago because I am a John Steinbeck fan. I thought that Grapes of Wrath was wonderful, but this book is even more mesmorizing. You can picture the characters and actually feel the good and evil and confusion in each of them. I read both Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden at least five times. Both are lengthy, but both tell a story that will keep you up all night reading. If anyone has seen the old movie, it no way compares to the book. What did compare to the book was a television mini-series way back in the 80's which starred Jane Seymour as Kathy. It was wonderful and so portrayed this book.

068987474X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  In fact, I read it back to back!  It is a must read.  Greg Behrendt is absolutely hilarious, yet honest, direct, and truthful thoughout the book.  The book empowers you and gives you a little self-esteem boost, too (ladies, you know you need that sometimes).  You'll laugh and realize how important your time is to you and how you shouldn't waste it on a man who is \\"just not that into you.\\"  Read, laugh, enjoy.
0897500482|4.0|I see that a lot of reviewers that gave this book low ratings seem to think that you can learn martial arts from a book. I will give you this warning now, you can't and never will be able to learn a martial art from a book, but this is a good starting place for beginners to see some of the techniques and ideas put forward in Jeet Kune Do. If you're someone with martial training as I am you can learn a number of things from this book. Most martial arts that are taught today are for exercise, fun, or competition, rarely are they taught for safety or other more historical reasons. This book can help you get back to those roots of your art. <br /> <br />I have studied various forms of martial arts for around ten years now and would consider this book an invaluable edition to my library, which is always growing and always changing and I still rank this book as one of the better ones in my collection. Inside you will find sections of philosophy and sections on technical work. The reason I gave this only four stars is that if you are not a martial artist or if you don't at least have some basic training, the technical section of the book is worthless and will do you no good. However, if you have practiced, you can learn a lot from the technical section of this book as Bruce goes over individual moves and how to use them to their best in a fight. He also explains how to close space between yourself and an opponent, how to mix up the rhythms of a fight, and how to make your attack and defense more effective.  <br /> <br />If you haven't studied martial arts then you will find some sections of this book to be quite interesting while others are utterly worthless. If you have, however, this is one of the better technical manuals that can be purchased that is also veined with the philosophies behind this physical and mental art. It is a wonderful resource and a useful tool for any martial artist.
1932100385|5.0|The China Study is long reaching and you won't find a book anywhere with more background information.  Speaking for myself, a man who's always in a hurry to find out the \\"meat and potatoes\\" of a book (pardon the metaphor), I did not appreciate being first treated to the lengthy autrobiographical chapter about Dre. Campbell's early life on the farm.  To me, this was not strictly necessary.  And yet, when I look back, I see this as a way of humanizing the doctor and making us see that even geniuses had boyhoods (or girlhoods as the case may be).  Some of us grew up in cities, some in unspoiled rural areas, some in the suburbs, but the cold truth is that there are in actually no \\"unspoiled areas,\\" for the food and drug industries, together with the medical establishment, have establihed outposts and dug in their heels in every nook and cranny of the world.  That is why a boy like the young Colin Campbell was force fed lies about protein that it took him a whole lifetime to regurgitate, and why he finally found it necessary to do his work in the far counties of rural China, where THE GOOD EARTH once took place, but now, well, they live a plant-based lifestyle but one which is rapidly changing.<br /><br />In fact, I hope that a far-seeing film company gets the rights to this book and makes a movie out of it.  \\"What?\\" you say.  \\"A movie based on a diet plan?\\"  But THE CHINA STUDY is not only a diet book, nor is it only a condemnation of the linked, globalized drug and meat interests.  No, there's a human interest story in here of a gentle young boy put in charge of a herd of innocent cows and then, in outward circles, we see the boy grow up and become a man, in a tale reminiscent of the old favorite A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, so sensitively helmed by Robert Redford.
B000002LE6|5.0|Prince's \\"Lovesexy\\" might've been a commercial disaster but it has a place in my heart. \\"Lovesexy\\" made me the Prince fan that I am today. First off, Prince was bold enough to not add tracks to the album. Listening to the album in full made me appreciate the album a lot more. The songs intertwine with eachother. From \\"Eye No\\" to \\"Positivity\\" you're taken to Paisley Park and living your purple life. No really, listening to this album put you in a world unlike this one.All of the songs had a distinct message and was a experience. I think songs like \\"Glam Slam\\" and \\"I Wish U Heaven\\" should've gotten more radio play and could've been appreciated a lot more. \\"Lovesexy\\" was a lighter album compared to the dark and more controversial \\"Black Album\\".
0451197968|5.0|First off, if you have seen the movie prior to reading the book and are expecting a similar story, AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE THE PLAGUE. The character created by King in Ben Richards, is a scrawny, down trodden man, desperate to save his family, even if it means risking his life. HE is no where even close to the muscular, hulkying, action hero architype portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film. <br />  It is really a shame, that they screwed the story up so badly, because as a movie the book would be great. It's fast passed, with plenty of action, a simple enough premise, but not one which is trite or boreing, great characters, and message (albiet a unsettling one)of an all too plausible dystopia.  <br />   Back when it was published, the book had a great story. To todays ready, it is a great story, bolstered by the real shows we see everyday. Sure we don't kill people, but it can't be denied that we enjoying watching the discomfort, even the suffering of others. Shows like \\"the Chamber\\" and \\"Dog eat Dog\\" and \\"fear factor\\" or even \\"the swan\\" are akin to the sick game shows viewed by the society of The Running man.  <br />    And with the increasing addiction of the young people of our country to TV, and with the increased sense of apathy and an all around lack of reading, it is easy to see how huge mega corparations could monopolize and dominate our society. <br />   So in the end, this is an all around excellent book, I highly recommend it to both SciFi fans and non SciFi fans alike. Also while you're at it you should check out the other \\"Bachman books\\". In particular \\"Rage\\" (if you can find it. it's out of print) and \\"The Long Walk\\"
B000002LHX|5.0|Prince puzzled a lot of his fans when he decided to compose the soundtrack to Batman. Michael Jackson was initially tapped to do the soundtrack, but Prince got the job thanks to his fan Jack Nicholson. From beginning to end the album rocks. The first track \\"The Future\\" is dark and has a mean beat. And from there on you feel like your in a nightclub in Gotham City. The songs fit perfectly with the film and it's scenes. To make the music more revelant to the film, Prince was clever enough to use voice samples from the film. The highlight of the album however is the slow jam \\"Scandalous\\" that, to me, is underrated among Prince's ballads. Prince went on to compose the soundtrack to Spike Lee's 1996 film \\"Girl 6\\" and further proved his staying power.
B0006FO8RA|2.0|Let me say first that I am at a \\"Crossroads\\" when it comes to liking or hating Britney Spears. I used to be a huge fan of hers when she first came out and that fandom slowly deminished within the years. She is an attention hog and an overly commericalized Barbie doll. This album is just a desperate attempt to rake in some extra cash and I regret getting it, honestly. Like other reviewers have said, despite the fact that she has four previous albums, this is still way too soon to be releasing a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. She has had one song that have rocked the charts and that was \\"...Baby One More Time\\". All right now to rate this album... <br /> <br />1. My Prerogative~I'm surprised she used such a big word. I never pictured her to be an intelligent individual but anyways this song is okay. It's kind of addicting but the lyrics are what bothers me. She is basically complaining about people gettin' up in her personal business. She shouldn't be complaining because she caused this to happen, making scenes wherever she goes, she is always wanting attention otherwise if she didn't then why would she do the things she has done in the past? (IE, her 50-odd hour marriage in Las Vegas, her second marriage and stealing the dude from a pregant woman, nonetheless! And now with her announcing that she's pregnant...) Anyways I give this song 3/5. <br />2. Toxic~ I love this song. I really don't like the music video although it was interesting to see her acting like a wannabe spy-agent or whatever...5/5 <br />3. I'm A Slave 4 U~ This is a stank-nasty song that reminds me of Christina Aguilera's \\"Dirrty\\". It has a dancable beat but Britney's vocals are breathy and annoying. 4/5 <br />4. Oops!...I Did It Again~ Eh. I've heard this song way too many times over the past 5 years. 2/5 <br />5. Me Against The Music~ This song is dancable and it features the Queen of Pop, Madonna. The only thing I liked about this song was Madonna lol. 4/5 <br />6. Stronger~ How is this song a Greatest Hit?I never cared for it. 1/5 <br />7. Everytime~ This song is okay, I suppose. The music video was a little weird and her vocals are EXTREMELY breathy. 3/5 <br />8. ...Baby One More Time~ One of the best songs on this album. This is the song that defined Britney Spears back in the day and where she used to be innocent. I miss that old Britney -.-; 5/5 <br />9. (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix!)~ I loved this song when it first came out. This is the music video had people turnin' their heads because she showed her cleavage in that green top. It has a really great beat and one of my old favorites before Britney turned into the monstrocity she turned into today...5/5 <br />10. Boys (The Co-Ed Remix)~ I'm not an expert on \\"Greatest Hits\\" but why is this track on the album? Pherrell Williams is an awesome singer but I don't ever recalling this remix topping the charts at any given time. It's a nice song but not \\"Greatest Hits\\" material...3/5 <br />11. Sometimes~ A vintage song from her first album. I like it ^^d 4/5 <br />12. Overprotected-The Darkchild Remix~ Okaaay...This song is annoying :P I skip it 2/5 <br />13. Lucky~ Oh My God! I cannot stand this song! It is overplayed and incredibly annoying. 0/5 <br />14. Outrageous~ This song is outrageous. The lyrics and vocals just downright SUCK. 0/5 <br />15. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman~ This ballad is god-awful. I don't like it at all >&lt; 1/5 <br />16. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)~ This is a direct ripoff of No Doubt. Seriously, this song sound like an exact duplicate of a No Doubt song. Find some ORIGINAL beats, Britney. 0/5 <br />17. Do Somethin'~God and I thought it couldn't get any worse. This song is annoying with Britney screechin like a monkey dying. The beat is okay but the vocals, like usual suck. 2/5 <br /> <br />Overall this is a 2.5 CD. This is one of her worst albums to date, if not the worst. I never bothered to buy her last two albums because she got way to annoying for my taste. This CD is horribly labeled to sucker in people to spend their hard earned cashola on this. Take my advice: don't waste your money on this high commercialized barbie doll. She doesn't need any more money people!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This was one of the first movies that actually made me cry. That's what makes this special. The heartwarming material that they produce on the screen make this one of the greatest movies of our generation. This movie has touched me and my family. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! No other movie has been able to top this lately.
0316548189|5.0|Although this book is quite long, you won't feel it.  I don't know how Mandela wrote a book that remained so consistently engaging despite its length-he has an intimate style that makes you feel he is confiding in you personally.  When you finish this book, much sooner than you would have thought you would because you won't be able to put it down, you'll realize what an amazing treasure this man is.  He is the true definition of a selfless leader, a man who gave up what could have been a peaceful and relatively prosperous life for a life without family, comfort, or security.  You will also learn a great deal about South African society and history.   <br /> <br />Although the book deals with tragic events, you will be impressed with how well Mandela maintained his humanity and his sense of humor even throughout twenty-seven years in jail.  To give you an example of the unexpected gems you will come across: Mandela and the older jailed leaders of the African National Congress gave \\"courses\\" to the younger prisoners in the history of the ANC while on grueling work detail.  Truly an inspirational book.
B000286RNY|5.0|It was a regular trip to the movie store. I scanned the racks checking to see if anything good might pop up.  My eyes halted on \\"Shaolin Soccer\\".  I scowled and said, \\"Pff...Shaooolin Socccer?\\"  Like I was asking a remedial child his name.  I read the slogan, \\"Get ready to kick some grass!\\"  By this time I was already on the other side of the store, guessing that it was probably a movie about a kid who learns Kung Fu from an old Shaolin Monk which then helps him, after being a stupid loser for so long, become a champion soccer player and get the girl and his dad's respect.    I guess I have an over-active imagination but that's beside the point.  A couple of months later, scanning the menu of my TV what do I see?  Shaolin Soccer...I say to myself, \\"Ugh, let me see how stupid this really is\\".  The first thing I see is people breaking into song and dancing for absolutely no apparent reason, and then being scorned and asked why they were singing.    I slowly fell in love with the movie and it is now one of my favorite movies of all time.  There is wonderfully beautiful martial arts, hilarious comedy, and a creative plot with a moral side-story.    It's about old Kung Fu master friends who have grown up and lost their talent playing soccer.  Trust me, it's a lot better than it sounds.  Just give it a shot, watch it with dubbing because it's actually much more funny with the dubbing.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This CD is abosolutely amazing!!!  I've always loved Green Day, but I have been listening to them nonstop since I got American Idiot, this and all of their other CD's.  I can't get enough of them!  I usually listen to Green Day while I jog on my ellipitcal trainer 4 days a week for 40 mins. but I had to up the time to 60 mins because I couldn't stop until the American Idiot CD was over!  All of their albums are great, but American Idiot is not only a great Green Day album, it's the best rock/punk album ever made!!!  Now, if Green Day could only do a music video for each song and then put out a DVD with the whole American Idiot album on it.    That would be tre cool.   ;-)  I've watched their International Hits music video CD so much, I think it's wearing out!  I highly recommend this CD to lovers of punk music, rock music, or just great music.  You won't be disappointed!

0743487478|1.0|Some of Kohn's reservations about currently popular parenting techniques (time out, \\"bribery\\") are worth thinking about, but the basic premise of this book--that rewards and punishment should be thrown out of every parent's arsenal--seems not only wildly impractical but possibly a little insane.  <br /> <br />In the face of Kohn's theory I feel compelled to state the obvious: Behavior (a word Kohn dislikes) has consequences whether you are 3 or 63 and rewards and punishments are an inescapable part of life. Isn't it better to acquaint children with this reality? The last time I was pulled over for speeding, the officer didn't open a discussion with me on how we could work together to make sure I drove the speed limit in the future. I just got a ticket. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if it would be possible to live by Kohn's theories, but should parents even try? Has there ever been a society that did not operate to influence human behavior based largely on rewards and punishments?  <br /> <br />If these two means of influencing behavior are so completely wrong, doesn't that mean that Kohn is the only guy in the history of humanity to be right? Which seems more likely to you? <br />
0385510454|2.0|This novel starts out promising enough, but it reaches a point where, for those familiar with Grisham, you think you might figure out where it will head.  Unfortunately in this case, Grisham lost his own formula.  The book spends a great deal of time with the protagonist's Italian studies, whereas this could have been dealt with in a much more expedient manner. <br /> <br />Is it just me, or did any other reader think that Backman might have figured out that he was being bugged and surveilled?  Maybe searched through his clothing and found something?  I really was really expecting more of a \\"Client\\" type of story, where the hero gains the upper hand.  This book was compelling enough to finish, but disappointing in the outcome.  All momentum from the novel was lost with the turn of a single page. <br /> <br />Disappointing. <br />
1593072937|5.0|In a note in the back of &quot;The Hard Goodbye,&quot; Frank Miller explains that this one got away from him.  What was supposed to be a 48-page crime thriller turned into a 200-page graphic novel, all because Marv, the story's brutal misanthropic protagonist, started bossing Miller around.  If you have seen &quot;Sin City&quot; the movie where Mickey Rourke steals the film as Marv, then you can understand Miller's explanation.  You will understand it even more when you read the graphic novel, the first volume in the Miller's comic noir saga.<br />For me Frank Miller began the road that ends in &quot;Sin City&quot; with &quot;Daredevil&quot; #164, which retold the hero's origin.  There is a series of panels in which Daredevil is chasing down the Fixer, the man who arranged the fight that Battling Murdock refused to throw.  In each frame Daredevil gets closer to his quarry and cutting across the panels is a line representing the Fixer's heart beat, which goes from blind panic to full cardiac arrest before flatlining.  It was at that point that I knew Miller was starting to think of what he could do with art in a comic book.  After his work on &quot;Daredevil&quot; there was &quot;Ronin&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns,&quot; and eventually Miller gets to Marv.<br />There is no doubt that Marv is the walking path of destruction that dominates this narrative.  He is extremely violent, deeply disturbed, and whatever medication he is taking is just not doing the job.  Still, he is a sympathetic figure because pretty much everybody he is maiming and killing are the real scum of the earth and he is on a mission to avenge the death of Goldie, the beautiful blonde who gave him a toss in the hay.  He falls asleep in bed with her, having one of those moments of true happiness that never bodes well, and wakes up with her dead and the cops on their way.  Marv is being set up, but that is incidental in his mind to the fact somebody killed Goldie, so somebody has to pay along with everybody else who stands in his way.  The grand irony here is Marv and his interior monologues are the voice of sanity by the time he finds the killer.<br />The characters and the dialogue are easy to characterize as Mickey Spillane types on steroids.  Then there is Miller's artwork as he explores what can done with just black and white on a page.  The result is wildly experimental and sometimes you can a sense of how rough Miller's ideas are by the time he finishes a page.  The first page of the story is more black than white, with Goldie's lips, the outline of her hair, the white skin exposed by the strapless gown and gloves etched out in seductive folds sets the tone for the artwork.  The second page is the opposite with more white than black and offers a more conventional view of Marv and Goldie, and already you like the first page better.  The third page offers a synthesis of the first two and it is like Miller is laying out the new ground rules.  There are figures reduced to silhouettes except for hair or teeth (or bandages), and others reduced to white images against a field of black.  Then we get to Marv standing in the rain in Chapter 8 and looking at the statue of Cardinal Roarke, at which point Miller is trying something completely different from the rest of the book.<br />I have no doubt that if Miller was to do &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot; today that there would be significant changes in the artwork that would provide a refinement of the raw energy displayed here.  There are times when the justification for the artwork seems to clearly be that it is different from the pages Miller has just drawn as opposed to be the best way of illustrating that part of the narrative.  But this is the first story in an ongoing series, so allowances can be made if Miller really did decide to do a page a certainly way for no other reason than he had not done one that way yet.  After all, it is not like he was coming up with 200 different pages of artwork and by the time you get to Chapter 8, which I think is artistically far and away the best of the entire graphic novel, it is equally clear Miller knows exactly what he is doing and all of the pieces are falling into place.  The joy of watching the art evolve in this story makes up for the rough patches.<br />These stories were originally published in issues #51-62 of the Dark Horse comic book series &quot;Dark Horses Presents&quot; and in the &quot;Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special.&quot;  This second edition has come out with the rest of the extant &quot;Sin City&quot; collection in term to be gobbled up by fans of the movie version and those who come from the theater to the graphic novel will probably be surprised how faithful Robert Rodriguez was to Frank Miller's story and vision.  Then again, that was the whole point of doing the film the way it was done.d by the time you get to Chapter 8, which I think is artistically far and away the best of the entire graphic novel, it is equally clear Miller knows exactly what he is doing and all of the pieces are falling into place.

B0007O38XU|5.0|My sister and I used to watch our VHS version of this practically every weekend back in primary school.<br /><br />We had only seen Spaceballs before we really got into watching Star Wars properly. So when i saw those 1998 rereleased ones i laughed quite heartily.<br /><br />Highlights include the 3 minute arrival of Dark Helmets Starship,<br /><br />President Scroob being beamed when it was only next door,<br /><br />Dark Helmet & Lonestar's battle before knocking out the boom mike operator,<br /><br />Prince Valium, Pizza The Hutt, and the little Top Hat N Tails<br /><br />dancing Alien.<br /><br />Its a top movie, great for a laugh, and with all the Star Wars hoopla at the moment, why not watch a film that makes fun of it all.
B0007GAERG|5.0|To the guy three reviews below me, is it really too hard to look into the liner notes of an album? If you did, you'd understand a great reason for all the hype: Mariah Carey writes her own songs. So as far as finding the right writers to find songs to best suit her voice, that is out of the question; whatever the writer writes, she sings the way she feels it best. <br /> <br />Excerpt from February 12, 2003 chat transcript: <br /> <br />Flowers_and_Silence in Onstage1 asks: <br />Your lyrics are so incredibly deep and captivating. What is your secret to great song writing? Especially when you cant seem to make the lyrics rhyme! I have that problem hehe  <br /> <br />Mariah Carey says: <br />With some songs it's not about whether or not the word is a perfect rhyme. With the songs that are personal it's about the lyrics and they flow the best for me like \\"Close My Eyes.\\" I don't think there's a secret. It's a gift I'm thankful for and it's healing for me. I couldn't see just singing other's songs. Songwriting is like 80% of what I do.  <br /> <br />As for the entire album, this is most definitely her most solid effort since 1997's \\"Butterfly.\\" Each song has the potential to be a smash hit. \\"Circles\\" and \\"Stay the Night\\" are absolutely enthralling, as is \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" with its inspirational lyrics. This is an album that simply astounds, and cannot come recommended more highly. <br />

B00004I9VE|5.0|In a sense it's sad. Michael Jackson, clearly the best and most influential entertainer of my lifetime(and maybe ever), has had to deal with controversy regarding his sexuality, his eccentricities and his equally whistfully weird family. Now that he is fighting for his life ina court of law(he's alredy lost the battle in the court of public opinion), let's revisit happier times in the life of Mr. Jackson; a time where his reign in the world of popular music was unchallenged and his lifestyle was unquestioned, just as long as he kept pumping out hits. And speaking of pumping out the hits, Thriller had seven of its nine tracks go to number one of the pop charts. How is that possibile, you ask? Well, Thriller has something for everybody; synth-funk and breakbeats bordering on hip hop(\\"Thriller\\" and \\"Wanna Be Starting Somethin'\\"), hard charging guitar riffs(\\"Beat It\\", courtesy of guitar genius Eddie Van Halen), laid back semi-cheesy pop)\\"The Girl Is Mine, featuring Paul McCartney, who he would later fall out of favor with over a dispute over the purchase of the Beatles master recordings). Michael mania took hold of the world from 1982-1984; everybody was wearing sequined white gloves and moonwalking(which became the default move for everybody who couldn't dance), and Michael became the main target for the tabloids(like he isn't now?) while he ould release albums tht would have great success for him, the shadow of Thriller would loom over him (and everybody else, for that matter) ever since.
B000002MP2|4.0|I find Green Day's Dookie to be somewhat overrated. Don't get me wrong its a great album but its far from what people say it is. There are songs on this album that annoy the hell out of me (ie. having a blast, In the End, and Safarass roots. But there are also songs that I adore, (ie. She, Basket Case, Pulling Teeth, and Coming Clean. But Green Day has such a talent for making catchy, fast paced songs, or slow mellow songs which yes, can be catchy. This is a great major label debut from Green day, yes it doesnt deserve 5 stars because it is hardly a masertpiece. Nevertheless it is still a great debut.
1573223085|5.0|In a nutshell, this is one of the most stimulating and thought provoking books I've read in quite some time. It is wonderfully researched, leaving a great trail of other inspiring materials. And, it has a nifty set of practical applications at the end of each chapter which can be put to use right away. <br /> <br />The chapters on Design, Story and Meaning are especially appropriate in the context of creating memorable experiences. And, these ideas in particular are quite essential to success in hospitality. <br /> <br />A Whole New Mind is one of those rare books which was written from the heart and soul with ideas and principles which are useful both in your everyday life and at work. It's nice to read from an author who clearly places \\"meaning\\" ahead of material gain.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Let me start out buy saying to you idiots. GREEN DAY NEVER SOLD OUT!!!. They have been a pop-punk band since day 1. Just because they are pop-punk doesnt make them a bad band they are still a great group. Its you idiots that give them such a bad reputation. now the review. The cd starts of  with a bang the single American Idiot which I find to be a geat song with a poweful message. Each song moves on with a beautiful tone and sound, also as it moves it also tells a story (which you idiots also probably never new since you are such damn hypocrites. Moving on the best song on here has to be the wonderfully constructed 9 minute Jesus of Suburbia. So in all this has to be one of Green Day's best albums (next to nimrod) you haters go on listening to your good charlotte and I shall listen to my music( by the way you 1 star haters are idiots)
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Most new age metal bands have a tendancy to just scream instead of play their instruments. I wasn't much of a Slipknot fan until I was convinced to purchase this album. Corey Clark's voice suprised me that he was really good. Vermillion, Before I Forget, and Duality are my fav power songs in this album but Circle and Vermillion Pt. 2 show how well the band really plays. They come off as such freaks by their masks but their music is normal and they seem like really good people. If you're into metal and you didn't like the earlier Slipknot stuff you may want to reconsider because this was one of the best metal albums of 2004.
B000002N2P|5.0|Green Day's second major label debut Insomniac is simply great. Although it was overlooked by everyone, they didnt realize that Green Day slightly changed there sound to a more dark punk route. The album starts of with the fast catchy Amartage Shanks and moves on to the catchy Brat, and the best Green Day song ever, stuck with me. The CD is one straight fast paced ride, not one song on here is bad, most of the songs ring out a 2.50 minutes which is the only bad thing if the songs were a little bit longer I would have this cd in my car for the rest of my life.

0060012218|2.0|I purchased this book, hoping to find a funny and riveting tale of growing up gay. Instead, I purchased a book whose author believes that his readers are unintelligent. The story itself was not all that bad (though a bit dull and predictable). However, the manner in which it was written was absolutely pathetic. Hartinger explains each and every thought the character is having with such detail that you begin to feel like he is patronizing you. There is one section of the book where a boy named Brian Bund does a nice deed for the main character, and Hartinger compares him to Jesus Christ dying on the cross! Sorry, Hartinger, but I don't think an unpopular boy who does something nice should be compared to a man nailed on the cross. All in all, I will agree with my fellow reviewers in saying that this book was a breeze to get through-but that was because everything was explained for us and did not contain one thought-provoking moment.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|From what I've heard, I gather they take some liberties with Barrie's life and the controversy around it.  But hey - A Beautiful Mind, Ray ... that's what they do in Hollywood.<br /><br />Depp continues to prove himself as one of the best ators we have and Kate Winslet is just so, so luminous, she just lights up the screen.  The children are beautifully played, the period captured gorgeously ... it is a real treat to look at.<br /><br />It is a little slow and, sometimes, a little less whimsical than you might like, but it is a very moving, heartfelt film. We should all hope that we can find Neverland someday.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|It's been quite some time since a cd has come along that is this superb.  'Neighborhood 1 (Tunnels)' absolutely pulls you in from the beginning with a pulsing beat sprinkled with what sounds like toy pianos while the singer so desperately and pleedingly yelps over the top of it all.  The packaging gives no info about the band but in addition to him there is a female that sings just one song so similarly to Bjork that you would almost swear it was her. <br /> <br />If somebody had told me that track 4 Neighborhood 3 (Power Out) was a vintage New Order outtake I would absolutely believe it - pounding beat and bass in all.  Even New Order hasn't sounded this good in years! <br /> <br />As much as I hear Bjork and New Order on this cd it's really a folk album.  Simple acoustic guitar picking and gorgeous wheezing violins and cellos weave their way throughout.

0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is an excellent book for people wanting to see life and death from a different perspective. When fourteen year old Susie Salmon is raped and murdered with no body to be found, her friends and family are devastated. Readers will enjoy the story being told from the fourteen year old girl who is looking down from heaven on her friends and family.  It is a story of persevering and moving on with life, or death, during a difficult situation. Throughout the story, Susie faces the problem of wanting to go back to Earth and live again. The Lovely Bones also focuses on Susie's friends and family that are still living as they try to adapt to life without Susie. The lessons learned from this novel are what make it worth the reader's time.  <br /> According to Penny who posted her review on allreaders.com, this is a book of hope for families that have lost a member prematurely; we see their lives, their grieving, and their coming to terms with their loss. The Lovely Bones, although depressing, truly shows what it is like to lose a loved one. Any reader going through the same situation would definitely receive hope and enlightment from this novel. It displays the family and friend's different ways of grieving, which could show real-life grievers how to or how not to deal with their loss. During The Lovely Bones, after she dies, Susie spends the rest of the novel watching her loved ones back on Earth. This could help readers feel comforted, knowing that they are still being loved and watched over by the ones they lost. However, the idea of the deceased watching over the living could cause a grieving person more harm than good. This is especially true when Susie enters the body of someone she used to know.  <br /> As the review of The Lovely Bones on threemonkeys.com says, if it is possible to intervene like that, why not do something more useful? The idea of the dead switching bodies with a living person is far from realistic. People who know someone who have passed away could become angry while reading this novel. After Susie switches bodies with Ruth, they could start wondering why their loved ones won't switch bodies with them. Or they could wonder why, if they're being watched over, bad things would happen to them. Alice Sebold meat well by introducing this idea, but it seems a little too unrealistic. However unrealistic ideas are what makes fiction be fiction. Sebold needed to do something original in order to make her novel stand out from others.  <br /> Overall, The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is hopeful and will give readers new perspectives of life and death. I agree with what Boppy on allreaders.com said, this is one of the most unusual books I have ever read. The descriptions of heaven may be a bit unrealistic, but it was good for the most part. <br />
B000002G9S|5.0|Free sounded unlike any other band in the world when they released this gem in the early 70s.  While others were trying to push the tempo envelope farther and faster towards metal, these guys were working at a much more mysterious, soulful pace.  But these songs are not lightweight by any means.  The drums and guitars are right up front and they growl with an intensity that pulls the listener into the room with them.  And Paul has never sounded better or more intense vocally.  I highly recommend this album to young and old.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I would like to say that first I am not a huge Buffy fan nor do I think Joss Whedon is a \\"god\\". But this series is possibly the best Sci-Fi series to ever be on TV.  If you click on \\"see all my reviews\\" next to the names of the single star reviewers you will notice a trend. Almost all of them have no positive reviews of anything. This leads me to conclude that these people are those elitist types that will say negative things about anything that is popular just so they look to be so much smarter than the \\"unwashed masses\\" in comparison.  They should stick to going to coffee houses and critiquing spoken word artists for hours and lay off speaking on those things that they know nothing about. <br />This series is most definitly worth the money and is exceedingly entertaining.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|This is most likely my favourite season of Gilmore girls. I have a few reasons for this. To start I love Jess and this is the season of the Rory/Jess relationship. I think this season had the best story lines although all the seasons story lines are great so this season is amazing! the season just had that extra kick or somthing I was addicted to it. The only thing I didn't/don't like about the 3rd season is I was not a big fan of Alex. Overall this season has great comedy, great drama, and great romance all blended to make this season(in my opinion) the best!
0316172324|1.0|I thought this book would be interesting.  I was disappointed.  Starts off talking about a statue in the Getty Museum.  Trained experts ran tests and were sure the statue was genuine (from 600 BC or so).  Other authorities on art did not run tests, but could tell just from looking at the statue that something was not quite right.  However, with all their training and education, they could not put their thoughts into words.  This is \\"blink\\".  When you decide something, based on your past experience.  Your decison may be right or wrong, depending on what your past experience is.<br /><br />So, stuff you already knew, basically. Because we all know things we don't know how we know, we just know.  But personally, I have enough sense to know when I don't know.  Gladwell thinks that Warren Harding was elected president solely because he fit the American's ideal of what a president should look like.  I must have missed the \\"What An American President Should Look Like\\" class in 5th grade.<br /><br />Gladwell kind of jumps around.  He talks about a professor who studies married couples, and based on whether they show contempt toward each other (rolling eyes), can predict whether or not they'll get a divorce and in how long.  What's the point of this?  Is this important work?  Gladwell also introduces a used car salesman, who never jumps to conclusions based on someone's race, sex or attire, and offers the same price to everybody. He's fair, and he makes a lot of sales through word of mouth and repeat customers. Something any car salesman could learn if he/she had been in business long enough.  So - that's not blinking.<br /><br />Gladwell doesn't back up his stories with any proof.  It all comes across as his own flawed opinion, or maybe just some hokey made-up stories, and I'm not buying it.  I thin-sliced and decided not to finish this book.  Luckily I didn't contribute to his wealth since I borrowed it from the library.<br /><br />Interesting idea, but Gladwell does less than nothing with it.does less than nothing with it.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah could easily be the greatest female vocalist of all time. All other singers wish they could have her range, and exquisite tone. Her amazing talent has been displayed over the last 15 years best with her first album, Emotions, Music Box, Daydream and Butterfly. Emancipation marks the triumphant return and proves that Maraih is miles above any Christina, Jessica, Beyonce or J.Lo. Her album is a gorgous collection of ballads, hip-hop, R&B and a dash of gospel combined together to create her masterpiece. She delights her classic fans with gorgous ballads like Mine Again and We Belong Together. She pleases the listeners who want something to dance to with It's Like That, Get Your Number and To the Floor- all three are incredibly origional hip hop songs-. The highlights of her album are Circles and Fly Like A Bird- the latter probably the most inspirational song since Make it Happen or Hero. Mariah is a star- unmatched in brightness. No one can touch her, no one can top her. Emancipation is essential for every Mariah fan, and will convert anyone who is not.
0375507256|5.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" threw me for a loop.  It shifted gears so quickly I almost got whiplash.  But that's part of the point.  Mitchell picks up where he left off in \\"Ghostwritten\\" (I haven't yet read \\"Number9Dream\\") by writing a novel about identity and disorientation.  And it's a great leap forward.    I didn't know anything about the structure of the book when I started reading, and I'm happier for it.  What a pleasant surprise.  I won't spoil it here (though the other reviews no doubt mention it).  At first I found it kind of gimmicky, but by the end it felt meaningful and satisfying.  You'll have to decide for yourself if you feel the same way.    The different sections of the book are wildly disparate in tone, and Mitchell again shows his talent from writting in different voices.  The characters, all of different eras, struggle somewhat unknowingly with basic philosophical questions: how they got to where they are and what impact they will have had on the world when they're gone--for that matter, if anyone will even notice that they're gone.  And it speaks to our need for closure, for conclusions.    The way the issues and themes of one section builds from the issues and themes of the last is nice, but the writing itself is staggering.  The middle section, which takes place on a primitive island, is written in a difficult dialect, but I got used to it after squinting for a few pages.     That each story can be so different and yet so similar from the others is a testament to Mitchell's talent, and says a lot about the clouds he must be navigating in his real life.    This book is a classic.  One of the best I've ever read.
0670033375|4.0|One cannot judge a book like this on a single level.  There are both writing style and treatment of the subject matter to consider in works of this sort.  In this case, the two are interwoven in such a way that cannot be dissected.  Professor Diamond's writing style in this book is perhaps a bit too simple-minded, but it is perfectly tuned to the material, which is equally simple in its approach.  I should preface this review by saying that the book came well-recommended via a book review in Science Magazine.  Though this is the first work I have read by Diamond, I got into the book expecting it to be a scholarly work by someone pre-emminent in the field of human geography.    The overall concept is a good one, and one that I was happy to see in print.  We need to know that societies are not cast in concrete, nor is the protection to individuals that they seem to offer.  A scientific discussion of what factors limit a society's envelope in history is certainly valuable to we humans who benefit from a society's persistence.    That said, I was not completely satisfied either by the model he had put forth, or the way it as presented.  Diamond's model came across as a sort of grocery list of factors, when in truth the concept should, I feel, have been presented on a more abstract level - at least in the beginning.  The dynamic stability of the social structures we humans weave is a tenuous thing, and as societies grow and change over time, the factors influencing them change as well.  Ultimately the people who comprise a society are forced to change in response to changing environments in order to survive.  But to think that humans can consciously influence the directions history's path ultimately takes is, at this juncture, more like denial than real science.    Diamond compares anthropological data from societies of which we know the ultimate outcome, and uses that model to analyze current global culture.  Why he chose this model is not totally clear.  Normally a scientist would select multiple models, and show why one or another should be discarded or modified.  The reasons he chose the specific cultural examples he presented, or what other models may come into play, are simply not discussed.  To give an example, paleontological evidence of animal population expansion and collapse are evident throughout the fossil record.  Can we use this information to modify the model he presented?  I would have expected Diamond to use the Roman Empire as an example of a more \\"globalized\\" society, and it might have been interesting to understand why he thought this classic collapse example was not usable.  The ultimate test of a scientific model is in its ability to predict future events.  Diamond does not or can not do this, because either his model is incomplete...  Or... he simply refuses to accept the inevitable conclusion of his model.  Instead he lapses into wishful thinking.    But Diamond-the-dreamer is not as effective as getting a message across as Diamond-the-geographer.  We are left at the end with a \\"further reading\\" list - in a sense he is saying \\"I don't know what to do, so I'm leaving it up to you.\\"  I am reminded of \\"The Lorax\\" by Dr. Suess, a far less expensive book.    I still give the book quite high marks for even approaching this subject, and it certainly was readable.  Overall a moderate thumbs up.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Subtitle: \\"...or how a harcore fan tries to fairly review a single-disc retrospective from his favorite artist.\\" <br /> <br />You know how this works.  Usually it's a bunch of complaining.  \\"Why wasn't this song or that song on there instead of this other song?\\" and so on.  Well, since this is Neil Young, and I trust he still \\"ain't singin for Pepsi, ain't singin for Coke\\" I'm gonna try and give him the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br />Ok, the first question a hardcore fan asks upon seeing this is \\"why?\\".  Neil's already released 'Decade' and even 'Lucky Thirteen' (a collection of the best of his experimental '80's material) so why this single disc, with only 5 songs not already on 'Decade'.  Two things come to mind: 1. money  2. a cheap way fo new fans to get an overview of Neil's most popular work.  Now, as much as the cynic (and annoyed fan) in me wants to say it's number one, there's no way Neil can need money.  He's released 35 solo albums, played with CSNY, had huge grossing tours, and even owns the Lionel model train company - he's set for cash.  So you can't fault him for trying to get new fans interested. <br /> <br />Next, a hardcore fan has to ask why this was put out instead of releasing 'Time Fades Away', the first album in the great \\"Doom Trilogy\\" (although reputedly the worst of the three) on cd!  Why isn't this out yet? <br /> <br />And the last major annoyance is why does Neil keep interrupting work on the 'Archives', a retrospective of unreleased and rare material at times rumored to be an 8 to 10 cd set?  It's been over 15 years in the making!  Of course the more I think about it, releasing something like this (which seems so un-Neil) could be a concession to the record company so that they'll even allow a huge set like that to be released exactly as Neil wants it.  Given his shakey relationships with record execs in the past, I wouldn't doubt it. <br /> <br />For the new fan however, this set is perfect, and a smart idea.  Before I became a hardcore fan, I passed on 'Decade' because of the cost, and the fact that it didn't have any of the \\"newer\\" hits.  I made my own single-disc collection which was basically the same as this.  I listened to that cd constantly, so I know a new fan will LOVE this disc.  Personally, I don't own it since I now have every album these songs came from and then some. <br /> <br />So, is it blasphemy that there are no songs from 'Tonight's the Night' or 'On the Beach'?  Well...yeah.  But if you really wanted a complete \\"best of\\" it would run longer than 10 cds and contain many entire albums.  For new fans, the main thing is to realize this is just the tiop of the iceburg.  If you like this, start buying the regular albums.  And if you REALLY like this, check out Neil's biography, 'Shakey', one of the best and most interesting rock bios ever written.   <br />
0790729644|4.0|UNFORGIVEN is marvelous moviemaking.  Clint Eastwood's direction and performance are haunting, evocative and original.  Avoiding a lot of the standard western cliches, Eastwood has fashioned a dark character study in which one's past resurfaces and no matter how hard you try to justify it, the truth wins out, and once you've killed, it's not so hard to do it again.  Clint has assembled a fine supporting cast as well:  Morgan Freeman (who would later work with Clint and win an Oscar in \\"Million Dollar Baby\\") is fine as Ned, Clint's former partner who joins him for one \\"last\\" job; Gene Hackman won an Oscar for his portrayal of Sheriff Little Bill, whose moral code is singular and unquestioned; Frances Fisher (a former Mrs. Eastwood) as the rebellious prostitute who wants to mete her own kind of justice; Jaime Woolvetz as the young gunfighter who idolizes Clint and killing; Saul Rubinek as a writer who finds out the truth isn't always what it is said to be; and Richard Harris as British Bob, an English assassin with tales taller than the Sequoias.  Although I found the film to drag in places, it's finale is riveting and Clint is reminiscent of Dirty Harry Callahan in his showdown with Hackman.<br /><br />UNFORGIVEN resurrected a pretty dead genre with this 1992 film, and its four Oscars helped plant Eastwood in the hall of great film makers.
B000059TFO|4.0|Mississippi Burning captures the American South of the 1960s and its turbulent race relations by telling a story that, while technically fictional, is inspired by actual events that took place. It succeeds by all at once being gripping, emotional, and contemplative. Despite being made in 1988 and taking place in 1964, the film holds up to this day quite well. <br /> <br />The story begins with the murder of three young civil rights activists--two of them white and one of them black--in a small town in Mississippi. Two FBI agents are soon assigned to this as a missing persons case; these are, as they formally refer one another, Mr. Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Mr. Ward (Willem Dafoe). Ward is the younger of the two, and also the agent in charge of the case. The local law enforcement and the town in general is hesitant to accept these big shots from up north, and their views don't much change when Ward decides they need a lot more men, and that this is more than just a simple missing persons case. <br /> <br />The Ku Klux Klan factors prominently into the case, but Anderson and Ward don't have much means for proving that they had any involvement, let alone which members, if any, contributed to the crime. It doesn't help much that nobody in town seems to want to help out--white or black. The FBI men are a little surprised to see such segregation and bigotry still taking place, but trying to explain it to some of the people in town is like trying to sell a newspaper to a dog. Ward's by-the-book style of gathering information isn't exactly producing the results he had hoped, and as a last resort, he decides to allow Anderson to use his more unconventional ways to get some answers out of some suspects. <br /> <br />The film is filled with a veritable who's who of That Guys, actors whose faces you recognize, but whose names you don't always know: R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, Brad Dourif, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Michael Rooker, and Kevin Dunn. All of these men deliver consistently solid supporting work, as does the always-perfect Frances McDormand as the benevolent wife of a Klansman deputy. <br /> <br />Mississippi Burning, while a compelling thriller, drives for something deeper-seeded than a whodunit mystery. In fact, it pretty much gives away the mystery in the first scene. Instead, we get a study on race relations, and director Alan Parker explores the motivations and mentality of white people who persecute others based solely on the color of their skin. For some reason, these people have it burned into their minds that color of skin dictates social rank and intelligence, when nothing could be further from the truth. It would be nice to say that this sort of thinking has been abolished in our country, but that's still not the case. It has died down considerably, but it is not completely gone, and that's a real shame.
0887307280|5.0|For anyone starting a business or struggling to take his or her business to next level, I highly recommend The E-Myth revisited. <br /> <br />Falsely, many business owners are self-employed individuals with the extra burden of maintaining the aura of being an Entrepreneur. <br />  <br />Michael Gerber's book provides a successful model for becoming a true business owner. First, he explains how there are three distinct personalities involved in running a business. Secondly, and my favorite part, he clarifies the distinction between working ON your business instead of working IN your business. Finally, he constructs a working model on how to build a successful business. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 describes \\"The Entrepreneurial Myth.\\" Mr. Gerber emphasizes over and over again, most business owners make the fatal assumption that if they understand the TECHNICAL work of a business, they understand the BUSINESS that does the technical work. Just because you know how to be a carpenter or accountant doesn't mean that you know how to run a carpentry or accounting business. <br /> <br />Chapter 2, \\"The Entrepreneur, the Manager, and the Technician,\\" the three personalities in every person who goes into business. Vision, pragmatism, and action, the contributions of these personalities, are all required for success.  <br /> <br />Chapters 3 to 6 explain different stages in the life of a business. <br /> <br />Chapter 7 dissects and uncovers the new revolution in business today. <br /> <br />Chapter 8 outlines what is called a Franchise Prototype. Not to be confused with retail franchises, it is a method of creating a business autopilot. <br /> <br />Chapter 9 literally explains itself - \\"Working On Your Business, Not In It.\\"  <br /> <br />Chapters 10 to 18 (Part III) show how to develop the systems that will out you in control of your business, instead of the other way around. <br /> <br />After reading The E-Myth Revisited, you will understand the difference between being self-employed and being a full-fledged business owner who leads others and manages systems. <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen ALW's version of the Phantom on Broadway twice.  I was excited to see they'd made a film including Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, though I didn't have high expectations of a film version.  Boy, was I ever suprized!  The film adds so much intensity to the torment Christine feels.  The acting was wonderful, the sets were amazing, and the music was true to Broadway (the actor's voices were superb).  I also enjoyed the addition of the auction years after Christine's opera career had ended.  If you've seen the play, enjoy the movie as an even more moving and close-up version.  If you haven't seen the play, you'll want to after watching this!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I will waste no time in telling you that despite a few notable omissions (\\"Don't Lose My Number\\", \\"I Missed Again\\" and \\"Do You Remember\\"), \\"Hits\\" is an excellent place to start if you're a beginning Phil Collins fan. 16 of Phil's best songs and biggest hits available on an affordable, single disc compilation.<br /><br />The tracks here are a solid sampling of certified classics, including \\"One More Night\\", the chilling \\"Another Day In Paradise\\", \\"In The Air Tonight\\", \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\", \\"Groovy Kind Of Love\\" and my all time favorite \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\\". And while most of Phil's hits were brilliantly crafted self written songs, he also made a knack for making a song by originally by a different artist his own, most notably his magnificent renditions of the Supremes' \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" and the Mindbenders' \\"Groovy Kind Of Love\\" (who even remembers the original version of this one?). The only real filler tracks are \\"Both Sides Of The Story\\" and the Babyfaced - produced cover of Cindy Lauper's \\"True Colors\\", and even they are good in their own right.<br /><br />My advice is simple: if you're a Phil Collins fan who's just starting out or is on a tight budget and can't afford all of his original albums, \\"Hits\\" is the only place to go. Buy it.

B0006J28BO|5.0|The Cat Returns was made by a studio in Japan which I and many many other people love, Studio Ghibli. The Cat Returns is a magical movie and will take anybody (no matter the age!) through a magical adventure! I don't like to spoil the movie for people, so I rather say: Read the other reviews for a review on the movie, but read my review if you want to know if its going to be a good movie. And it is! I purchased it knowing it would be a good one because I enjoyed watching Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Kiki's Delivery Service. Also available from Studio Ghibli on Amazon! This movie is truly a touching tale... so purchase it today... you will not be regretful, at least, I wasn't.
B00000DCHE|5.0|Songs In The Attic is a most unusual live album.  Most artists, when releasing a live record, select mostly \\"hit songs\\" to put on the collection, resulting in a best-of with crowd noise. <br /> <br />Billy Joel chose to use the live-album medium to call attention to some of his lesser known songs, but not simply for the reasons of getting more mileage out of his old albums.   <br /> <br />For the most part, the studio recordings of the songs on this collection were kinda lackluster.  They got the point across, but they often sounded canned, and were usually performed by professional \\"session musicians\\" rather than Joel's actual road band. <br /> <br />When done live, with what the Piano Man calls \\"real road muscle\\", these songs improve tenfold. <br /> <br />\\"Captain Jack\\" is probably the best example.  I'm still upset that they use studio version of that one on his Greatest Hits collection, rather than this live one.  It really rocks.  It has so much more passion, so much more venom!  As Joel mentions in the liner notes, when they played this live they were \\"committing an act of sheer brutality\\", and it comes through here. <br /> <br />\\"Miami 2017\\", \\"I've Loved These Days\\", and \\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\" are also given a much more bravado treatment here, largely due to the arenas they were taped in. <br /> <br />Location plays an equally important factor in other tunes, though.  Joel specifically wanted songs like the snide \\"Everybody Loves You now\\" and the rocker \\"Los Angelenos\\" to retain the intimacy of the small clubs they were recorded in, and it works masterfully.  When you listen to \\"Los Angelenos\\" on headphones, you actually feel like you just stumbled into a sweaty drunken bar and happened to catch a really great local band on a hot night. <br /> <br />Music lovers of all types should be able to find much to appreciate and even cherish on this album.  A brilliant artist displaying his works, each on its individually tailored canvas. <br /> <br />Genius.
006054094X|4.0|My comprehension of how Americas was \\"discovered\\" is a journey unto itself.<br /><br />No wait, that sounded cheesy.  Stick with me.  This story has relevance to the review. No, really.<br /><br />I first attended a seminar on Christopher Columbus back in my undergraduate days.  I learned a lot about just how ridiculous Columbus was, including his insanity, his lack of any true navigating skills, and the fact that he took several useless bushes back to Europe as \\"rare herbs.\\"  By far the biggest joke was that Columbus thought he had discovered China, despite all evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />Columbus was hardly the paragon of virtue that many Italians hoped to cast him as.  And I should know, I'm Italian.<br /><br />This sort of ethnocentrism can be insidious. There are lots of theories about extraterrestrials colonizing the earth, most of them centered on the anomalies and archaeological oddities that have been discovered throughout the centuries. The thinking goes something like this: any major achievement, like the pyramids, cannot possibly be the work of any non-white race.  Therefore...ALIENS MUST HAVE BUILT IT.<br /><br />The \\"alien colonization\\" theory is a new twist on the old belief of Theosophy, the Blavatsky-spawned theory that Atlanteans built everything.  In case you're wondering, Blavatsky helped create theosophy, a philosophy the Nazis used as their ideology for exterminating Jews.<br /><br />So what the heck does all this have to do with Menzies' 1421?<br /><br />In 1421, the Emperor Zhu Di was the most powerful ruler in the world.  With the near-infinite resources of China at his disposal, he performed bureaucratic acts of pharaoh-like proportions: he relocated the capital, diverted a river to serve said capital, and built a massive fleet of gigantic treasure ships for the sole purpose of bringing the world under China's tribute system.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the admirals and generals were sailing to all corners of the world, things at home took a turn for the worse. A storm set the new palace on fire, killing the Emperor's favored concubine.  The horrible human cost of the Emperor's extravagance eventually empowered the Mandarins to rebel against him.  Zhu Di's pioneering treasure fleet became a symbol of his decadence.  When the ships returned, they were disgraced and all record of their travels destroyed.  China withdrew from the world to take care of its own.<br /><br />Menzies' theory is that the fleets were much more successful than ever imagined.  He sets out in intricate detail how each of the treasure fleets colonized every continent, using evidence ranging from porcelain that only comes from China to DNA evidence of Chinese descendants, from oral history of aborigines referencing \\"people in white,\\" to structural anomalies built by a mysterious, ancient race on every continent.<br /><br />In other words, Menzies' references the same evidence supporting the alien and Atlantean theories, down to the Bimini road. Unfortunately, this also means that Menzies' evidence is extremely one-sided.  It's difficult to distinguish between what is given as concrete evidence (Chinese chickens on every continent) and what is not quite as concrete (the realignment of every forgotten map so that it fits Menzies' theories).<br /><br />Ironically, Menzies' hypothesis actually strengthens Columbus' insistence that he had found Asia.  Columbus was convinced he had found China because he carried maps that told said it was there.  Menzies' detractors do their own arguments a great disservice; suddenly, Columbus doesn't seem quite so insane after all.<br /><br />Do I believe him?  Menzies' research is compelling: he quotes several sources that clearly indicate the Portuguese and later Columbus had evidence of unexplored continents before they stepped foot on them.  But the connections are so varied and presented with such authenticity that it's extremely difficult to determine the veracity of all of his findings without being a scholar.<br /><br />Still, given the choice of theorizing just what caused the similarities across continents in culture and mythology, I'll choose the Chinese over aliens and Atlanteans any day.he veracity of all of his findings without being a scholar.   <br /> <br />Still, given the choice of theorizing just what caused the similarities across continents in culture and mythology, I'll choose the Chinese over aliens and Atlanteans any day.
B000003TA4|5.0|oftentimes Kurt's lyrics don't make sense, but they have a kind of sarcastic, gen-x bent to them that is interesting.  I am definitely not a person who liked Kurt Cobain, I thought he was a drug addled loser and overrated musician, but the strength of the songs they made shows why they became so popular so fast.  I thought the other two band members were terrific musicians, especially the drummer, and they were certainly more rational people.  Kurt could craft a darn good song, with completely original values, and captivated a lot of people.  Other reviewers say they are glad he is dead.  Dude, that is probably the most insulting and terrible thing you could possibly say about anyone; you should have your head examined.

It's an incredible, incredible experience... somehow, despite his rather poor physical aging, the godlike Robert Smith has been able to maintain his voice and playing like few other artists can. From the clenching opener \\"100 years,\\" to the closing numbers on \\"Bloodflowers,\\" the band (especially Simon Gallup) are tight, in-tune, and incredibly energetic. Coming from a group in their mid-40s, this is an incredible feat.     This is an incredible DVD for anyone interested in The Cure, even the casual fan. Be sure to check out the newly released reissues of \\"Seventeen Seconds,\\" \\"Faith,\\" and \\"Pornography.\\"    My Verdict: Excellent.

Despite his achievements he has more to regret and fret over than to celebrate over. There's a certain spark in the eyes of the great actor that underlines his dream and wilfulness.I think I learnt from this 2hr 40+ minute film than I can possibly comprehend.I'm not sure on what I derived out of this film but at the same time I must add I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would have.<br /><br />The first hour of the film created a sort of a completely disquieting effect on me.There were quite a few heartbreaking scenes in the film and it does indeed have scenes that I would much rather close my eyes to.By no level of inclination of thought did Aviator seem one bit exaggerated to me.I recommend this film to anyone who has heard it's name.I'm buying myself a copy of the dvd shortly because I can hardly wait to see it again.

0688135455|5.0|With the surging popularity of Lemony Snicket's, \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\", the time has never been better to gently urge children towards those literary classics that sound so mightily similar to their beloved Baudelaire sagas.  And of the great children's authors that employed direct narration, few are so wonderful yet rarely remembered as the fantastic Edith Nesbit.  The woman who single-handedly redefined the whole kid-fantasy genre.  As the Books of Wonder edition of \\"Five Children and It\\" is quick to point out, until Nesbit happened along, children's fantasy novels either took place in some \\"far-off fantasy-land (Alice to Wonderland; Dorothy to Oz)\\" or simply began and ended in their own magical world (The Princess and the Goblin, for example).  No one had really explored normal every day children stumbling across magic.  And that, of course, brings us to the fabulous, \\"Five Children and It\\".  Written in Nesbit's trademark snarky Edwardian style, the tale remains as amusing to children today as it did back in the early 20th century.  I remember it fondly from my own tender youth, and since I'm only 27 that should certainly say something.<br /><br />Now there were once five city children.  The eldest was Cyril and the youngest was simply referred to as \\"the Lamb\\", since it was only a baby and was dearly adored and spoiled by its family.  One summer the children have the delightful opportunity to be left in a seaside house with only their servants to care for them.  While exploring the grounds of their new home, the kids come across a strange furry creature in their local gravel pit.  It has extended eyes like a snail, the ears of a bat, monkey hands and feet, and a big furry spiderish body.  It is, of course, a Psammead (or Sand-fairy) and the kids have a chance to make one wish a day.  In your normal Edwardian novel, this might be a good thing and the kids might have delightfully boring adventures for the rest of the book.  Not here.  The Psammead, you see, is a bit of a jerk.  A self-satisfied eternally complaining jerk.  And whatsoever the children wish for, be it wings or money, somehow their wishes have a tendency to go awry.  Still, when you've a whole summer before you and a pile of wishes waiting to be made, life can get very interesting indeed.<br /><br />To my mind, Nesbit's best book is without question, \\"The Phoenix and the Carpet\\".  That said, this is an excellent companion to it.  Now I had the pleasure of reading an edition with the original Millar illustrations when I was young.  And if you're a fan of pen and ink, that could certainly be a nice choice.  But if you want an edition that's really going to get your children's attention, try the Books of Wonder publication with illustrations by Paul O. Zelinsky.  Zelinsky, as it notes in the back of the book, had a great deal of difficulty drawing the Psammead since Millar's own version was uncommonly faithful to Nesbit's description.  Nonetheless, Zelinsky has the advantage of color and full page spreads.  So when the children acquire beautiful rainbow colored wings, you see them here in all their showy glory.  Better still are the tiny black and white illustrations on the book's inside covers that show multiple amusing scenes from the book.<br /><br />And as for Nesbit herself, none can compare.  She employs the tone of a conspirator towards her child readers.  Often adults are ridiculed for being too blunt and unimaginative to understand what's being said here.  The book teems with plots that would be later employed and stolen by such future authors as C.S. Lewis and (more obviously) Edward Eager.  In fact, as a kid I often got Eager and Nesbit mixed up in my head.  Some critics of this tale sigh with great moans that the kids here don't talk like kids today.  Well lah-de-dah.  The children in the \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip don't talk like kids today either.  Shall we just go chuck all of Charles Schultz's work into the Boston Harbor and forget he ever existed?  Ladies and gentlemen, we simply cannot go about condemning classic children's books because our slang has changed.  Kids today will still love \\"Five Children and It\\" and they'll adore its ridiculous plotting.  If anything is dated about this book it's the truly odd moments of racism in it.  Though Nesbit is to be applauded for giving gypsies a fair shake, the same cannot be said for American Indians.  The British obsession with Native Americans is as puzzling now as it was then.  So you should at least know that there's one chapter in this book that, if you don't particularly care for Edwardian stereotypes, can be easily skipped past if you so choose.  Or not.  It's entirely up to you.<br /><br />In any case, this is a fine fine tale.  They don't hardly make `em like this no more (though they certainly try to).  A tip of the hat to Ms. Nesbit for all that she has done for children's literature.  And a tip of the hat to every kid today that picks the book up for a lark.  A memorable tale.he ever existed?

B0001HAHXW|4.0|Robert Johnson's work has never sounded better than on this CD. Mr. Clapton and company enliven his work with zesty and spicy performances. The recording is as crisp and hot as a plate full of hush puppies. As a relative novice to the blues, I found this album very accessible and downright fun. Even my wife, who listens to freaking Shania Twain, likes it. My only complaint is that in aiming for a semblance of purity, Clapton engages in repetition. Many of Johnson's songs rely on the same little riffs and turnabouts so that by the end of the album, you're wondering if you've heard some songs two or three times. I figure that's a relatively small complaint for an album that is guaranteed to put you in the mood for a plate of extra spicy  ribs with some beans and slaw on the side. Now that's what I'm talkin' bout.
B000002J1L|4.0|1971 was a milestone year for prog-rock. It was the year that Pink Floyd released Meddle, which, in my mind, contains their magnum opus, the 23-minute epic \\"Echoes.\\" In that same year, however, a slightly less well-known group released what was perhaps the most solid work they had done to date. This was Genesis's third album, and their first done with what is probably their best lineup of players. The addition of Phil Collins on drums and Steve Hackett on lead guitar saw the addition of two more outstanding musicians to the already impressive lineup of founding members Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford, and also saw the formation of a surprisingly poignant and poetic group of songwriters. It's hard to believe how young some of them were when this album was recorded (Gabriel was 20 or 21, I believe), as a few of the songs display both an astonishing maturity of form and substance, as well as moments of sparkling musicianship. Granted, there are some shaky moments on this album, but they are outshined by the three gems it contains.  <br /> <br />The first of these is \\"The Musical Box.\\" This album is worth buying for this song alone. The transitions throughout are somewhat choppy, but this song is noteworthy for displaying why Collins and Hackett joined the group. The beginning is wonderful enough. The overdubbing of 12-strings from Hackett, Banks, and Rutherford is quasi-Victorian in its feel, and joined by Gabriel's flute, seems to emulate the tune one would hear from a wooden box with a wind-up key. Then it suddenly shifts to an explosive hard rock tune, dominated by the passionate screech of Hackett's guitar and the driving percussion of Collins. Every time I hear this song, I'm still in disbelief that the man who was responsible for the soundtrack of Disney's \\"Tarzan\\" in 1999 could ever have been involved with something like this. The last two minutes of the song are like a spiritual orgasm. The virtuoso feel of Banks's organ, cymbal-heavy drumming from Collins, Gabriel's repeated shouting of the word \\"now!\\", and the way Hackett's guitar suddenly bursts from the back to the foreground make for a glorious climax (made even more glorious by the way the instruments slowly fade up beneath Gabriel's vocal, and then erupt without warning).  <br /> <br />The second is \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed.\\" The story behind this one really gives the listener a sense of where the band was going lyrically, as far as telling a story and being extremely visual, factors that Gabriel would push to the extreme during the band's stage shows. As with the first track, I love the intro, and the Victorian feel behind Banks's organ, as well as the way it underscores the stabbing vocals of Gabriel. I would also have to say this song contains one of the album's best transitions, in the way it shifts from Hackett's guitar solo to Banks's piano, and then the way the rest of the band builds upon that. Like most Genesis songs from this time period, the story is morbid but lighthearted, as if the band doesn't feel the need to take something like the destruction of the human race seriously. And honestly, who does? <br /> <br />Third, we have \\"The Fountain of Salmacis.\\" I honestly felt that compared to the first two epics, the intro was a bit lacking. It wasn't until Banks's mellotron was joined by that awesome bass riff from Rutherford that the song really took off. From there, the underscoring mellotron tune that carried through most of the song felt oddly appropriate. But for me, the high point of the song is the instrumental that occurs about three and a half minutes in. And the way it ends contains some of the most balanced musicianship on the album. Why couldn't Rutherford's bass have been this prominent when they mixed the other songs?  <br /> <br />This brings me to the reasons the album only gets four stars. While I enjoy the overall structure behind the lengthier songs, I felt that the final mixing could have been better. For example,in the finale of \\"The Musical Box,\\" Gabriel's vocal track is almost buried beneath the tracks from his bandmates. And while the other four songs on the album have some merit, overall they aren't as stellar as the three longer tracks. \\"Harold the Barrel\\" is one of the more primitive \\"conversation songs\\" that the group did. While the song is lightheartedly morbid, ending with the title character killing himself, Gabriel feels like he's gasping for air as he moves from character to character. I will, however, give the song high marks for its ending: the way the band aurally creates a picture of the character leaping from the rooftop is stunning. \\"The Seven Stones\\" is a bit longer, but I always felt that the song didn't end as crisply as the rest. \\"Harlequin\\" is a song I usually skip to get to \\"The Fountain of Salmacis,\\" but I have to admit that I do like \\"For Absent Friends.\\" I look upon it as a way of cooling down after the mind-blowing experience of the first track, and Phil Collins's vocals have a quality that is more organic than his later vocal work.  <br /> <br />All in all, this album falls short in some categories, succeeds EXTREMELY WELL in others, and can easily be seen for what it is: the first in a string of albums from the time period in which the band wrote all their best material. The production fell flat in a lot of areas, and some songs didn't work as well as they could, but there are some moments of solid gold that make this album worth owning, whether you like progressive rock, Genesis, or both.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Foiled again. I had thought that this movie would involve some pithy and profound discussions on the part of the co-stars regarding life in another country/culture. Wrong! Instead we get semi-Ugly Americans who are too wrapped up in themselves to even try to become immersed in anything more challenging or edifying than lizard-y lounges and karaoke/sushi bars. The Bill Murray character is damn LUCKY to be offered millions to do a commercial in Tokyo, since he seemed like a has-been third-rate actor hardly worth the airfare. Nevertheless, he is caught up in his own pity party. The Scarlett Johansson character has at least the excuse of youthfulness to rationalize her less-than-sophisticated pursuits. She seems refined and intelligent on one hand, yet makes rash choices (husband, Murray) on the other. That sort of impulsive poor judgement doesn't bode well for her, not that this movie made me care.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by those who assume that since this is not a typical Hollywood blockbuster, it must be an \\"arthouse\\" picture. NOT! It's basically just shlock.
B00078XGRO|5.0|What could be better to Star Trek fans than a combination of the Borg and time travel?  Nothing.  This is by far my favorite Star Trek movie and I was so excited to finally add it to my DVD collection.  Definately recommend it for any Star Trek fan.
B000007UA4|2.0|i am shocked to see so many high reviews for this album! it's not only her weakest album but it is so plainly obvious that this album was rush-recorded and rush-released. there really are only 8 songs on this cd's the other 2 were totally thrown together at the last minute(too much of a good thing and i guess i like it like that.) <br />The problem with this album is that there are no dance floor stompers like \\"Better The Devil You Know\\" and \\"What Do I Have To Do\\" and also no really catchy pop tunes like \\"Got To Be Certain\\" or \\"Hand On Your Heart.Some may say this album is more mature. No. what it is is boring. First of all, my biggest problem with this album is the OVERUSE OF BACKGROUND SINGERS!!! they appear on almost all the songs escept for 2! I got so annoyed by them. Kylie was reduced to singing backup along with them on a lot of this album. Those 2 songs i mentioned, Kylie BARELY sings at all, although i am almost convinced that she doesn't sing at all on I Guess I Like It Like That, which has no verses at all, it's just one big long chorus sung by background vocalists, almost the same with that other song. \\"Let's Get To It\\" sounds like a rip-off of Color Me Badd's \\"I wanna sex you Up\\", although it's one of the better songs on the album but that's not saying much. the only 2 standout songs are \\"Give Me Just A Little More Time\\" (which i didn't really like when i first heard it on Greatest Hits, but put it next to these otehr bland songs and it sounds like a work of art) and \\"Finer Feelings\\" BUT the Brothers and Rhythm remix of \\"FF\\" is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better. this album version is weird...it's not a dance song, and its not really a ballad, so it never really goes anywhere. the remix saved it by miles! <br />I love Kylie, but its obvious this album was rushed to get out of her contract. NEXT!
B000003TA4|1.0|What happened when these guys bursted on the scene in September 1991? MTV played their video all day. Why? Who the hell knows? It wasn't even a great song. Smells like Teen Spirit. Catchy title, innit? Anyway, the band, led by Kurt Cobain, became the Beatles to the teens of the early 90s over night. Woohoo. Still, he was no John Lennon.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I don't think Nirvana is a bad band, alot of their songs really do have a cool groove despite the lack of any real talent... But to say they changed the face of music or to say they're anywhere near the top 10 bands of all time is just absurd, give me a break guys, they're not all that. All their songs are very simplistic and can be learned by someone that has never touched an instrument within a couple of hours, no joke.<br />Hell, when I started out on guitar, I learned how to play Come as You Are in an hour. Not to mention Kurt is one of the worst performers I've ever heard, live his voice always sounded like complete crap, all cracky and scratchy and his guitar work wasn't much better. He always sounded like he was really drugged up to me, so I guess if that's what you'd call one of the best bands of all time, you're entitled to your opinion, but I strongly disagree.
B0007O38F8|3.0|I Ain't the type to hate but i don't like this dude I don't respect this dude Ja Rule's over this Rappin Body Builder but the CD ain't bad though Word of Damn advice to the whole camp keep Olivia of yall CD's who put her in the G-unit? OVERALL the production Hot, Lyrics are not hooder than GRODT but straight The only thing keeping it from a 5 is where yo squad at?
B00006AG5N|5.0|What else can be said. It is the best of the best. As the ad says, Before Elvis, there was nothing. Then Elvis did it all. How true and this new CD compilation of hits proves it. From \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" to \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" to \\"Burning Love&\\", the King shows us he could rock. And from \\"Love Me Tender\\" to \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" he shows us he could sing a ballad like no other. The only problem I have with this album is the omission of \\"Little Sister\\" and the appearance of \\"The Wonder of You.\\" A great CD from the master of rock and roll. A must buy.
0793518326|5.0|This is one of the best (if not the best) books I have ever set eyes on. I know it's not perfect, but I also know that it's much easier to tear something down than to build something better. Some previous reviewers have done a pretty good job of tearing this book apart, now let's see them try to make something better. It takes a lot of hard work to create a collection like this, and they don't seem to appreciate this. Yes, I know that the print is kind of small, and there are some wrong notes or chords in there, and the book is impossible to put on a stand, but hey, if the type was any bigger there would have to be more than one volume, and thus the cost would be incredibly higher, and if you notice a note is wrong, is it THAT big a deal to fix it? There have also been some complaints about how if you are trying to play solo, this book is useless. This book has helped me tremendously to create arrangements that I couldn't do with just the chords. Also, I have learned a lot about the different styles of the different musicians, and how their technique improved and changed over the decade they were together. So I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any beatle maniac musician.
B000002G87|5.0|Some of the GREATEST guitar interplay in the history of music! Eric Clapton & Duane Allman wrote the book on electric blues rock. Slide guitar that influenced a generation of axe masters. Emotion laden love songs that tear at your heart stings without sounding syrupy.
0440211727|4.0|When I first saw the title of this book, I thought it was a facetious remark by the author. Many people believe that there is never a time to kill, but after reading this book, it may have changed some of those minds.<br /><br />John Grisham loves to get the reader emotionally involved with his stories and A TIME TO KILL was no exception. This is actually his first novel and he has said it was his favorite of his first six books. I can't say that I agree with him that A TIME TO KILL is my favorite, but it is very good and I did enjoy reading it (at least most of the time).  Some scenes were too graphic and too much for me to enjoy.<br /><br />This story is of Jake, a young lawyer (are there any other kinds of lawyers in his novels?), who defends a black Vietnam veteran on trial for murder. Sounds like a familiar plot, right? Wrong! This man kills two white men (and I use the term \\"men\\" very loosely) who raped his young daughter and left her for dead. The telling of the brutal crime against this innocent child had my hair standing on end. It was vivid and had my stomach flipping as I was wondering if such diabolical people do exist in our world today, and they certainly could not exist in the US. But once again I was wrong, they do exist and they exist everywhere that we allow racism to creep into our society.<br /><br />The town is split between those wanting to give the father a medal for killing the scum, the card-carrying KKK members who want to see him hanged, and a variety of others that go the distance of the entire spectrum of characters and emotions.<br /><br />Many will say that this story is too close to the truth, and I admit that parts of it are extremely difficult to read. However it may be necessary in order to open minds that this type of hatred really does exist.<br /><br />This book definitely opens your eyes wide to racism, lack of values, crimes against women and children, etc. You have to be tough emotionally to read this book (I actually cried through part of it) but it is very interesting and makes you wonder if there really is a time to kill.ly cried through part of it) but it is very interesting and makes you wonder if there really is a time to kill. <br />
B00001U03Q|5.0|This man, who has struggled to be recognized, has finally broke through. He is one of the best blues/contemporary musicians that there ever will be. My hat is off to you Eric. This compilation may not be my absolute favorite, but because of the songs I think it definitely ranks up there with EC compilations.
0440214041|4.0|The subject matter of THE PELICAN BRIEF was several years ahead of its time (seems to be the norm for John Grisham). Within the past few years, conspiracy theories have taken control of the spotlight in movies and books and I feel THE PELICAN BRIEF was a front runner to these other ideas.<br /><br />Tulane law student, Darby Shaw, has an idea that she didn't realize could mean her death. She came up with a theory that explained the assassinations of two Supreme Court justices, which occurred in one day. Darby writes a brief about this theory whose conspirator is an enemy of pelicans and other animals. Her boyfriend, and law professor, Thomas, gets killed by a car bomb meant for Darby, and she's on the run. While on the run, she meets Washington Post reporter, Gray Grantham, who is determined to get to the bottom of the assassinations and is willing to help her escape.<br /><br />As is Grisham's habit, he develops the characters so well that the reader can relate to every aspect of them. As Darby is running and hiding in New Orleans, I felt as if I was there, scared, smelling the scents that only New Orleans has, wondering if I'm being watched, panicked, etc.<br /><br />If I had to choose one of Grisham's strongest qualities of his writing it would have to be his character development. His characters emit emotions to the depth where the reader has empathy and actually lives that part in the story.<br /><br />THE PELICAN BRIEF is another excellent story and I highly recommend that if you haven't already read this book, you should definitely pick up a copy. It's enticing and action paced. The time will fly by when you're involved with this one!
B000063JDE|5.0|I love this movie. It's a masterpiece. I don't understand why people say it's bad or stupid, I think it's brilliant. Is it hard to follow the plot? It wasn't for me. This is one of those movies that HAS to be seen in widescreen (letterbox), not pan and scan (fullscreen), even if you hate \\"black bars\\", you just have to experience this movie in widescreen, that is, if you're going to watch it. The only scene that bothered me was the \\"Don't look at me!\\" sex scene between Frank and Dorothy (If you've seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about). Of course, I believe it was SUPPOSED to be disturbing. As to what the movie is about...it depends who you ask. Some people said it's the Hardy Boys on drugs, others say it's about a boy's sexual awakening, others see it as good vs. evil, each one is a valid statement. To me, Blue Velvet is a true art film, one that is multiple things all at once.
0440224764|3.0|THE PARTNER was a little bit different than most John Grisham's novels. Instead of plunging the reader into a crime in which a lawyer steals millions of dollars from the firm in which he's a partner, he begins the story at the capture of the lawyer on the run.<br /><br />This is a tale of Patrick Lanigan who four years previous to the opening chapter in the book stole 90 million dollars and hid it. Not only does the firm that he stole the money from want answers so do the client that was represented by the organization.<br /><br />If you think the action is over since Lanigan has already been caught, you're mistaken (somewhat). Through the use of flashbacks, Grisham gives the reader a sense of the history and involves them in the chase, limited as it may be. He stops short of telling the reader why a person with such a bright future would throw it all away, including a wife and baby, for money (ok, so it was tons of money, but was it really worth it?).<br /><br />THE PARTNER is typical Grisham with lots of twists and turns, but this story is possibly overdone with the changes. Just when you think you've figured everything out, he'll change course and have you second-guessing your answers. Grisham is a master at convincing the reader and then confusing them to the point of them changing their minds, and then he'll do it all over again. By the end of the book, you won't know any answers and be thrilled with the outcome.<br /><br />THE PARTNER has vivid backgrounds, candid characters and some limited excitement. I didn't enjoy it as much as I have his others, but it's still better than a lot of books that have been published. In THE PARTNER, it seems as if John Grisham doesn't have a clear-cut idea of where he wants to lead the reader.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is almost indescribable. I will spare the reader a lengthy dissection by summarizing that this movie is whimsical, magical and poignant. <br />Amelie is a shy girl with an innocent but slightly offbeat sense of humor who goes about trying to right the wrongs of the world and heal broken hearts. But her shyness thwarts her from finding love and happiness for herself. In time well...you just have to see the movie. <br />The movie is full of wonderful sight gags that sometimes are surreal (some of this done with very subtle animation). The movie starts with Amelie coming into the world moves us through her childhood and brings us up to her adulthood. Each episode of her life is portrayed with whimsy irony and humor. It is filled with side jokes like her father's mysterious traveling garden gnome and her almost mythic quest for the man who leaves his photo booth picture all over Paris. Poor Amelie has such insight into the people she knows and such a curiosity of those, like the mystery man in the photos, whom she does not know. <br />Everything about the movie, the acting, the dialogue the plot and even the color palette of the movie cry out with a joy for life, especially for life's absurdities. In it's wackiness it is also a wise movie. <br />Every household should own a copy of this movie in the same way every household should own Band-Aids and aspirin because this movie is a cure-all for the blues. <br />Highly recommended.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I would definately recommend this movie to anyone.  They did a great job portraing the attack on Pearl Harbor on that fateful day on December 7th, 1941.  I love the way the love story was encorperated into the action.  This movie always makes me cry, so be sure to have tissues close by.
B000006TRV|4.0|(The rating should really be 4.5 stars) <br /> <br />I started to get into Pink Floyd about a year and a half ago, and since then I have bought four of their albums - Meddle, Atom Heart Mother, that little-known one with the prism on the cover, and The Wall. While I don't think that The Wall is the best of them, it is nonetheless a great album. <br /> <br />Telling the story of a rock star's complete and total breakdown, The Wall put out what is probably Pink Floyd's best-known song - \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\\". It's a pretty good song, but not near the best on the album. I couldn't possibly name one definitive best track on this album, but there are plenty of great ones - \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"The Trial\\", \\"Hey You\\", \\"Young Lust\\" and more. However, if you want to listen to this album, do NOT skip around and only listen to a few tracks. This is one of those alubms that needs to be listened to in its entirety, whether it's your first or twentieth time listening to it. <br /> <br />The lyrics on this album are great and tell a very interesting story, but the instrumental work is also top-notch. The perfect example of this is David Gilmour's solo in \\"Comfortably Numb\\". Also, when listening to this album, you won't only hear vocals and instruments - there are plenty of other sounds, and even a hidden message (which is infinitely cooler than any other hidden messages, such as Satanic worship in Stairway to Heaven). The sounds aren't completely random, nor do they lower the quality of the album.  <br /> <br />I can't bring myself to give this album a perfect 5-star rating, but it's very close. Overall, The Wall is well worth your hard-earned dough. A must-buy for any fan of classic rock.
B000002P74|5.0|Second Helping(1974). Lynyrd Skynyrd's Second Album.<br /><br />In 1974, following the release of 'Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd', Lynyrd Skynyrd took to the studios and recorded the aptly titled 'Second Helping', the album which would go on to become their biggest hit, spawning instantly recognizable singles such as \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\", \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\", \\"Workin' For MCA\\", \\"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\\", \\"The Needle And The Spoon\\", \\"Call Me The Breeze\\", and the minor hit \\"Swamp Music\\". Although initially unpopular, once \\"Sweet Home Alabama hit the Top 40, 'Second Helping' surged into the Top Ten on the album charts, and has become an album that defines southern rock and even hard rock. A powerful mixture of hard rock, blues, country, and boogie, Skynyrd easily became a sensation in the south, but soon branched out to become a worldwide success. With their three guitar attack and infectious grooves, Skynyrd is often considered the best band ever out of the south by many! So, is this album as good as the hype makes it sound? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Sweet Home Alabama-  The ultimate Southern Rock anthem, \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" is one of the funkiest, catchiest, and simplest songs ever devised, yet easily one of the greatest. As soon as the opening riff comes out of your speakers, this song grabs you and doesn't let go... just pure brilliance. Everyone likes this song, and if you don't, you're crazy!<br /><br />I Need You- A slow, soulful ballad that combines slow blues with southern boogie to create another classic. Van Zandt's soft, hushed vocals, backed up by the hypnotizing guitar work, give this song a dreamy mood... although very long, the song never gets old, whether you're listening to Van Zandt's emotional vocals or Gary Rossington's searing lead guitar work.<br /><br />Don't Ask Me No Questions- The first single Skynyrd released, \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\" is a song sure to get your feet tapping, kind of sounding like ZZ Top mixed in with Led Zeppelin. Upbeat and sarcastic, \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\" is a very fun song, and Skynyrd's three guitarists show their mastery of guitar through their great riffs.<br /><br />Workin' For MCA- A good-humored hard rock song,  \\"Workin' For MCA\\" mixes Van Zandt's punkish vocals with Ed King's and Gary Rossington's funky licks to create an interesting song. One of Skynyrd's more experimental tracks, \\"Workin' For MCA\\" is one of the best songs here. Amazing guitar work!<br /><br />The Ballad of Curtis Loew- Besides \\"Free Bird\\", \\"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\\" was Lynyrd Skynyrd's most popular ballad, a long, emotional roller coaster of a song that combines country and boogie music to create a beautiful ballad. Van Zandt's voice oozes passion and realism, and \\"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\\" seems entirely heartfelt. Very intense and emotional, Lynyrd Skynyrd's musicianship and songwriting is top-notch here!<br /><br />Swamp Music- A minor hit for Lynyrd Skynyrd, \\"Swamp Music\\" is a combination of southern boogie and hard rock, a song that sounds straight out of the bayou of Louisiana. This song basically says what southern rock is all about, with Van Zandt's bluesy lyrics and Skynyrd's three guitarists showing how it's done in the south.<br /><br />The Needle and the Spoon- A song about the dangers of hard drugs, \\"The Needle And The Spoon\\" is a no-holds-barred hard rocker, blending Van Zandt's cautioning vocals with the heavy, searing guitar work of Gary Rossington and Ed King, who rip out unforgettable solos and catchy riffs alike. Without a doubt, one of my favorite Lynyrd Skynyrd songs. Just plain cool.<br /><br />Call Me The Breeze- Another great hit, \\"Call Me The Breeze\\" is a tune reminiscent of The Allman Brothers, starting off with horns and blaring guitars, and developing into an unforgettable twelve bar blues song. Van Zandt's vocals are fun and energetic, and the crunching guitars back him up well. A true southern rock song, this is obviously afan favorite.<br /><br />Don't Ask Me No Questions(Bonus Track)- Exactly the same as the original \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\".<br /><br />Was I Right Or Wrong(Bonus Track)- A slow, quiet tune, \\"Was I Right Or Wrong\\" builds up from a folky, Jethro Tull-ish song into an emotional, heavy rocker that talks about growing up. A very good song, and I'm glad the label included this one!<br /><br />Take Your Lime- A down and dirty blues song, \\"Take Your Lime\\" is a gritty blues rocker that lets Skynyrd's three guitarist and their keyboardist show off all their education in the blues, and Van Zandt lights up the song with his captivating lyrics. Another good bonus track.<br /><br />Overall, there is not a weak song on this album. 'Second Helping' is undoubtedly a benchmark not just for southern rock or Lynyrd Skynyrd, but for hard rock in general. The guitarwork here is phenomonal, containing some of the coolest riffs and licks imaginable, and it's really a joy to listen to. Although you've heard these songs a million times, they never seem to age, and, for me, they never will. Ah, what a great album.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF HARD ROCK AND LYNYRD SKYNYRD! IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY YOUR CD COLLECTION IS COMPLETE!<br /><br />Killer Kuts- Sweet Home Alabama, Workin' For MCA, Don't Ask No Questions, Call Me The Breeze, The Ballad of Curtis Loew, and The Needle and The Spoon<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd- Lynyrd Skynyrd<br /><br />Derek and The Dominos- Derek And The Dominos<br /><br />Tres Hombres- ZZ Top<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!, this is obviously a fan favorite. <br /> <br />Don't Ask Me No Questions(Bonus Track)- Exactly the same as the original \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\". <br /> <br />Was I Right Or Wrong(Bonus Track)- A slow, quiet tune, \\"Was I Right Or Wrong\\" builds up from a folky, Jethro Tull-ish song into an emotional, heavy rocker that talks about growing up. A very good song, and I'm glad the label included this one! <br /> <br />Take Your Lime- A down and dirty blues song, \\"Take Your Lime\\" is a gritty blues rocker that lets Skynyrd's three guitarist and their keyboardist show off all their education in the blues, and Van Zandt lights up the song with his captivating lyrics. Another good bonus track. <br /> <br />Overall, there is not a weak song on this album.

B000002N25|5.0|I'm a big fan of everything Knopfler has done, though to be honest some CD's are better than others.  While I didn't care for some of the folksy, down-home stylings of \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\", I absolutely love Goldenheart.  I've owned this album since its release in 1996, and the songs still convey as much emotion and depth now as they did then.  Part of Mark's genius is the use of silence and off-beat riffs to create new and stirring melodies.  While some are bothered by his (admittedly) limited vocal range, I find that his low, monotone style adds a unique element to this record, and works much, much better than some fancy-pants vocalist.  Let Beyonce worry about how many notes and what range she can hit in a measure, I'll stick to those artists that can write stunning, original lyrics and match them to beautiful guitar work.  In other words, I'll stick to Mark Knopfler.
B0002V7OI8|1.0|...that's for sure. This movie makes Jan De Bont (Twister), Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow) and Paul W.Anderson (Alien vs Predator) look like the greatest and most inspiring moviemakers in the world today - now I'm being sarcastic of course, but it should indeed draw you the picture of how awful Deep Impact is! <br /> <br />I mean; I expected patriotism to some level (as if US is the only part of the world worth saving, or in this case even give a \\"warning\\" - they didn't know where the metheor would strike did they?) , more effects than story, good acting because of the talented and legendary cast (though my expectations weren't high considering the usual outcome of scripts from similar movies about nature-catastrophes striking parts of the earth, and all the usual heroism and moral-speeches about sacrificing one life to save a million and all that), and at least parts of the story to be \\"believable\\". Not a chanse. One thing is that the effects are so not realistic, the movie clearly is a movie made only to make money. There's no joy, no thought, no inspiration behind Deep Impact.  <br /> <br />No excuse for Morgan Freeman to waste his talent on yet another \\"turkey\\", the same goes for Robert Duvall. Didn't they read the script before practising their lines? The president character surely ment to present the US in some idealistic way is just annoying, and do not get me wrong here - I would have nothing against a black president \\"over\\" there, in fact I'm looking forward to it! But why put so much moral and drama into such an \\"over the top\\"-movie. There's some of it in The Day After Tomorrow, but it's not nearly as embarrasing as it gets in Deep Impact! <br /> <br />As mentioned; the story is totally unbelievable. It's like a child wrote the script. Or even better; some stupis father was inspired to make the movie after watching his child play with its' toys. For two years the metheor is raging through the universe, and no one knows about itexept for the president and his staff. Like they're the only nation in the world with equiptment (wrong spelled?). It's kept secret to spend money building some kind of a spaceship to land on the metheor, and then to place a bomb on it? Something like that, I nearly fell asleep.  <br /> <br />And when finally the metheor strikes the ocean somewhere near New York, the best part (haha), the entire nation being warned since long and there's been a countdown for the impact -well, only a few of the people has been evacuated, and when the wave flows in over the buildings people are walking around or driving in their cars like as if it was an ordinary day, and the disaster comes sudden! <br /> <br />The worst movie ever?
B00067BBQE|1.0|I can hardly call this a live dvd. It's more like a live performance with a lot of editing, when I say a lot, I mean it. When playing live, they keep the camera on a band member for less then a second before switching cameras! All these special effects going on really hurt your eyes. I mean, why would like to see a piece of footage in color for a second and then turned into black and white? Sadly, Amy Lee's voice live also is weak. (For all you Nightwish fans out there, you can see the comparison of Amy's voice to Tarja's...) <br /> <br />The only good part I found on this dvd was the extra footage. A true Evanescence fan would love this part.  <br /> <br />The menu quality is pretty good as well. Something you don't normally expect coming out of a live dvd. They've even added a little easter egg into it.  <br /> <br />Not unless you are a hardcore Evanescence fan that you should buy this dvd...it will give you a headache, litterally.
B00005JNTV|5.0|This movie was directly adapted from the graphic novels of Frank Miller. The movie story-boards consisted of the.... graphic novels... the dialogue was written by... Frank Miller's words directly out of the graphic novels. Artistically, this movie felt like a graphic novel. Filmed in Black and White with a splash of color here or there to accent specific elements. <br />Movies like Spider Man and X-Men are very good movies... but do not hold true the comic world. This movie does and it looks and sounds great with a great cast. This movie is definitely going to be a must have for me!
B0007XT87G|5.0|This album deserves 5 stars.  No doubt.  Sure, Porcupine Tree fans will debate which album is best: In Absentia, Lightbulb Sun, Signify, or even The Sky Moves Sideways.  All have something great to offer.  The bottom line is that this band makes music for people who LOVE music.  And this album is another classic.  Yes, Deadwing takes risks and is somewhat different than previous albums, but it still weaves that now classic PT sound into each song. And for that I applaud Steven Wilson and his crew.  In this era of bland and uninspired popular music, Deadwing is amazing, and makes me look forward to what PT will dream up next.  <br />P.S. Be sure to see the band live!  They are incredible!
B000063JDE|5.0|(...)    Blue Velvet comes from my collection of Chinese bootlegs. My sister Bethany and her husband Brian are teaching English in China. Apparently you can purchase a wide assortment of DVD's there very cheaply. So I supply them with big lists of movies I'd like and when they come home they bring me a big stack. There are never any special features on the DVD's, but the picture is usually good and for $1 a piece, that's all I need.    Blue Velvet is dark, scary, freaky, and really good. Which is how you cold describe most of David Lynch's films. His films are often filled with symbolism and it is easy to finish one of his films and have no real idea of what actually happened. They usually take two or three viewings, and a little research to get a good idea what the movie is actually trying to convey. Blue Velvet has a simpler plot that can generally be understood at a basic level upon first viewing, but there is plenty of symbolism and deeper meaning to make it \\"enjoyable\\" for further viewings. I put enjoyable in quotation marks because to many watching it is not an enjoyable experience. It is a movie deep seated in horror, with scenes that make you crawl under the covers and lock the doors. For the cinephile it is a type of pleasure to watch a lurid piece of cinema with enough depth to require multiple viewings. For the weekend movie watcher it is probably too much to stomach.    The film starts with an idyllic, picturesque small town. It's a town where every day has blue skies, manicured lawns, pretty flowers, and quiet simple people. Lynch fills the screen with gorgeous pictures straight out of fifties television shows. But this is a David Lynch movie and the pretty pictures don't last long. Quickly a nice old man who is watering his lawn falls down near death. The camera pans down past the convulsing man and deep into the grass. Digging into the earth until the camera is dark with freshly wet dirt and grotesque bugs. The idyllic town is only pretty on the surface. Underneath the top layer of goodness lies a darker, seedier town hidden from the eyes of most of its citizens.    The plot of the film revolves around Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern delving deeper and deeper into the darker side of the small town. MacLachlan finds a dismembered ear on his walk home from the hospital one afternoon. Finding such a macabre in his hometown sparks a quest to discover who's head the ear could belong to and why it was removed. He involves the good girl Laura Dern in his quest and they sink into darker waters. To tell more of the plot is to give away too much. I'll just say that it is not for the weak of heart.    Dennis Hopper plays one of cinemas creepiest villains to date. His psychosis is even more terrifying in that it is so real. Here is no Freddy Krueger, or even a Hannibal Lector. This is not some crazed psychopath lurking in the corner. Sure he is psychotic, and maniacal, but versions of him can be found almost nightly in any major city newspaper. He is not a homicidal maniac, but a violent, evil man made even more so by his addiction to unnamed drugs.    Isabella Rossellini plays Dorothy Valens with such beauty and sadness it breaks your heart as it squirms your stomach. Her character has taken such horrible abuse over her life she has come to like and enjoy it. Mixed with heavy amounts masochism her performance is remarkable.    There were several times while watching this with my wife, Amy that she said she couldn't keep watching it. After the credits rolled she said she would never watch it again. I suspect this is the sentiments of many viewers after watching Blue Velvet. But if you can stomach the violence, masochism and overall creepiness there is a lot of pure cinema to study.    (...)
1400032717|3.0|I thought this book could have been better a lot of ways.  Perhaps because this type of book (a person with disabilities writing journal style) has been done before in \\"Flowers for Algernon,\\" which I found to be a much better book. <br /> <br />I understand that Christopher is just a child and everything is written from his perspective, but I can't help but wish for more depth from all the characters.  I also found it difficult to garner sympathy for his parents, who are both selfish in their own way.
B00005JLPK|3.0|(...)    When Frida was released into theatres I had absolutely no desire to see it. I'm neither a fan of Salma Hayek, biopics in general, and biopics about artists especially. Add to that my zero knowledge about the artist Frida herself and the movies fate was sealed into never being seen by the likes of me. However, my general lack of new movies here in France and being able to borrow it from a friend for free helped me to reconsider watching it. When I realized it was directed by Julie Taymor who also directed a marvelously beautiful version of Titus then I was actually excited by it (almost).    Like Titus, Frida is an amazingly visual movie. Taymor, who is known mainly for her Broadway adaptation of the Lion King, has an artists eye for visual flair. She has found away to take something as static as a painting and made it alive. Throughout the film she recreates several of Frida's works and makes them a part of the action. It's impossible to explain on paper (or cycberspace) but what she creates is something pure magic.    I can't say how accurately Frida is portrayed in this movie. The picture we get is of a rather flawed woman who lived with a great deal of suffering. Her suffering comes in both physical ways (stemming from an accident early in life) and emotionally (from a cheating husband and her own mistakes). Yet it is this suffering that creates such remarkable art. Taymor manages to create an interesting and moving story within her excellent images.    Both Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina pull out excellent performances. I was especially impressed with Molina portraying the very flawed and yet sympathetic Diega. I had pretty much written this actor after playing Doc Oc in the highly overrated Spiderman 2. But here he shows a real sensitivity to his character. Don't be fooled by the billing of this film. The cover of the DVD would have you believe that Ed Norton, Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd and Geoffrey Rush all star in it. In fact, with the exception ofGeoffrey Rush, all of them have more or less cameos in the picture. Rush is in the movie a bit more, but I wouldn't call even that a starring role.    (...)
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|The album is good but kinda of drags on a little too long. The songs also miss Dave Grohl from the last album as he is an amazing drummer. Overall a great album, but no five stars people. A little too long. Like I said it kinda of drags.
B00005JJX8|4.0|Read all my reviews at [...] <br /> <br />Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 film To Catch a Thief is a light, fluffly picture that differs in content over much of the suspense masters other pictures. Cary Grant stars as a former thief, and patriot of the French Resistence, who is currently suspected of a new series of crimes. Grace Kelly plays the beautiful daughter of a rich American woman who is high on the list of possible victims of the new cat burglar. <br /> <br />The plot is all cotten candy. Shot in the French Riviera, Hitchcock allows his camera to take all of the beauty in. There are simply lovely traveling shots of the location. Hitchcock follows cars driving the streets in high crane shots, simmers through the sea on a boat ride, and stops to take in the view with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly at a picnic overlooking a stunning valley. <br /> <br />Cary Grant is playing Cary Grant at this point, but that's perfectly fine since their are few actors I enjoy more. Grace Kelly is simply gorgeous. Hitchcocks camera is as admiring as a new suitor. Their interply is fun, witty and sensuous. A famous scene between them intercuts their developing romance with fireworks and is pure sizzle. <br /> <br />If you are looking to write a thesis on the genius of suspense then you should look elsewhere. But for a beautifully shot, light hearted romance for a Saturday night it would be difficult to find a better picture.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Dave is an amazing drummer and it shows here. I love about every track on this album. This album is great and up there with his past efforts. His singing is a lot better too. The only disappointment is that the dual disc doesnt come with a booklet or lyrics like past albums. Overall the music is awesome and worthwhile. Trent Reznor was smart for incorparating Dave Grohl into his music.
B00003CWL6|3.0|(...)     The first time I saw American Beauty it was the last in three consecutive weekend movie run. The other two films were Fight Club and Bringing Out the Dead. All three films are about men trying to come to terms to what it means to be a man in America in this day and age. Fight Club finds meaning in deconstructing everything down to base needs, feeling through pain. Bringing Out the Dead gives meaning to its character through drug use, but is was in American Beauty that I found some sense of hope.    In the film, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) plays a middle aged, middle class suburbanite, with seemingly everything he could desire. He has a good, well paying job; a beautiful wife (Annette Bening); a large luxurious house; and a lovely daughter (Thora Birch). Yet, with all of this he is not happy. In fact, all of these things are not quite what they seem. His employer is facing cut backs, and he may soon lose his job. He marriage is in shambles, and his daughter openly hates him. Early, we see him masturbating in the shower, in narration; he states this is the highpoint of his day. All is not well in the house of Burnham.    All of this changes when Lester meets Angela (Mena Suvari), his daughter, Jane's gorgeous, cheerleader friend. On first seeing Angela during a cheer routine, Lester feel a special, lustful connection. Later that night, Lester overhears Angela playfully tell Jane that if he would only work out, he would be sexy. His lust over this teenage vixen becomes the catalyst for the film and Lester's very life.    Soon after Lester quits his job, in fact he bilks the company for a year's salary by threatening to disclose scandalous information that he has become privy to. He begins smoking pot, buys a hot rod.. He plays with remote control cars, takes a job at a fast food joint, and of course does start working out. In every way he reverts back to his teenage years. Even the soundtrack begins blaring out classic rock tunes from the 1970's. Finally after years, decades even, of feeling low, miserable, not alive, he feels great.    This reversion back to his glory days is only the beginning. It is a reversion back to the days when he had fun, when he felt alive. But he is not a man who will stop there. This is just a beginning point to a life long conversion of living a full life, as opposed to a life full of the right things, but that is ultimately empty. Or it would be if he was not shortly dead (this is not nearly the spoiler you might think it is, for Lester announced his death within the first minutes of the film.) Towards the end of the film we can see that Lester is already outgrowing his childish behavior. When he yells at his daughter, he immediately feels the sting of regret. When given the chance to indulge in his lusts, he backs away, understanding that it is not right. Just as the music changed to classic rock with the first change, here it has changed again, turning into the same classic rock being covered by newer, contemporary artists.    Many will probably say that using the lust for a teen, and illicit drug us as a catalyst for change, is not a change for the better. I can already hear my mother scolding me for having seen the movie, much less reviewed it from 2,000 miles away in Oklahoma. Yet, here it works, and works well. I don't believe the film is saying that these things should be the means to a change, these things only served as means for this character to break free from the rut that had become his life. There is a telling scene where Lester and his wife are overcome with sexual desire. As he dips his wife to kiss her, she stops the embrace because he is near to spilling his glass of wine on an expensive couch. An argument ensues with Lester proclaiming that \\"it's just a couch,\\" while his wife is horrified at the thought of ruining said couch. There lies one of the central themes of the film. That these characters are so wrapped up in the material that they lose sight of the better pleasure of life, including love making.    It is not a perfect film. The Burnham's neighbor, Col. Fritts (Chris Cooper) seems a caricatured archetype. His plays a hateful, homophobe who really carries deep rooted homosexual tendencies is too outlandish to be considered real. Though it must be said the part is played marvelously by Chris Cooper. Jane's speech about being a freak too, may move the young kids who consider themselves the nonconformist, shy-type, but it is too after-school special for my tastes.    I've left out some of the best scenes and an important character, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). He plays the drug dealing son of Col. Fritts, who likes to record everything on his video camera. There is a moving scene in which he and Jane watch an old tape of his of a plastic bag floating through the air. It is a moving, poetic scene that conjures up thought of the futility of life and its very beauty. It is that type of movie. It creates beautiful, moving, simple scenes that bring a sense of hope to life, while at the same time, showing the ultimate horror of living it.    (...)
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater is my favorite band.  I love everything they have recorded.  I've been counting down the release of Octavarium since the release date was announced!  This album is the most recent studio release by them (2003).  Although a bit more focus is put into heaviness than progressiveness, don't make that ruin the album for you.  The album is still very complex, and has some great instrumentals.  'As I Am' is a short song that starts out as the end of 'Losing Time' left off.  'This Dying Soul' is a continuation of 'The Glass Prison', starting at part 4.  The CD has an amazing instrumental (Stream of Consciousness) and ends off with a spectacular 13 minute song. (In the Name of g0d.  This album will give you something to remember, and many good things to expect from future DT albums!
B00003CX9S|4.0|Read all my reviews at [...] <br /> <br />David Lynch's second full length film contains the odd assortment of freakish characters we've become accustomed to in his film. Yet, despite one of the more outlandish characters he has ever put on celluloid, it remains his most sentimental. <br /> <br />The Elephant Man is based upon the true story of John Merrick, a 19th century Englishman with massive deformities throughout his body. He performed in freakshows for many years until he was found by Dr. Treves who cared for him and placed him in Whitechapel hospital. It is his time in this hospital that the film concerns itself with. For here, Merrick is able to life, more or less, as a gentleman. He is well fed, well kept, and educated. He can read, write, speak eloquently and even begins to entertain well-to-dos of society. <br /> <br />It is filmed beautifully in black and white. It is a very well made piece of cinema. Lynch, for the most part, stays away from his trade mark imagery and symbolism, and sticks to more traditional story telling, although the elephant involving opening sequence is straight Lynch nightmare. That the characters come from real life and not Lynch's twisted imagination only serve to add to the surrealism of the film. <br /> <br />It has been said that Lynch is too sentimental in this movie. That he manipulates the audience too much. Ebert even goes as far as saying Lynch tricks the audience into believing that Merrick is a noble and courageous man. He suggests, that rather than being noble, Merrick is merely doing the best that he can, under poor circumstances. It is true that the film is sentimental. There is hardly a scene that does not prick the audiences emotions. Yet how can an audience not feel emotion when they see a kind, intelligent man live with such deformities. How many of us would dare to get out of bed each day with similar atrocities. And here, this man, though physically plagued, manages to keep up his spirits and even write and build card sculptures. It would be a poor director at that who could not produce a tear at such a sight. If we pretend it is not a noble feat for such a creature to retain his humanity and good cheer, while being constantly bombarded with inhumane indecencies are we any better than those who stand outside the carnival and jeer? <br /> <br />Yet there is something in these critiques of sentimentalism. Lynch continues to use his tricks as a director to keep our eyes wet. There is a scene in which Merrick meets Dr. Treve's wife and breaks down with tears at her simple kind acts. His tears state that no one has been so kind to him as to treat him like a gentleman. Though effective, this is using the craft of filmmaking to do nothing but manipulate emotions. In other films I would lambaste this type of sentimentalism and chastise the audience for falling for it. Yet the overall sadness throughout the story makes me fall for it here. I cannot commend such use of it in film anywhere, and yet it works for me in this particular instance. <br /> <br />Overall, the Elephant Man is a fine achievement for a young director. Lynch would go on to make more articulate, less sentimental films. But here we find him assured in his imagery and storytelling. He effectively sweeps the viewer into the emotional turmoil of such a sad, hopeless story. <br /> <br />More reveiws at [...]
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Alright, this movie has a Lot of good stuff about it.  I mean a lot!  It's a pretty good movie.   <br /> <br />BUT I wish it was a terrible movie!  I wish it is was reeeeeeeeealy rotted!  Why? <br /> I HATE IT!  Why?   <br />Because just enough is wrong with it to ruin it FOR WHAT IT IS.  WELL, WHAT IS IT?   <br />It is a Film version of one of the GREATEST MUSICAL PLAYS of this half of the CENTURY, THAT's what it is.  The PLAY is incredible.  IT'S ASTOUNDING.  A well-conceived, well-written, well-produced play is ALREADY 4 stars above a movie as an art form.  So when you make a movie OF A GREAT play.  You had better make it REALY WELL.  YOU HAD BETTER NOT MAKE ANY BIG MISTAKES.   <br />Guess what.  THEY DID.  TWO REEEEEALY BIG ONES.  other smaller ones, but I won't even mention them (the smaller mistakes wouldn't have ruined it for me). <br />   First BIG mistake:  THE 'APPEARANCE' OF THE PHANTOM.  Christine: \\"Can I ever escape from that FACE so distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face . . .\\"  PHANTOM: \\"A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing\\"  Me: \\"HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA AAAAAAAAAAAAAH HA HA HA!\\"  What?  HE's a BIG SEXY HUNK.  HE's not an ugly PHANTOM.  Gerard Butler was OBVIOUSLY CAST for his LOOKS!!  Which MAKES NO SENSE: TO CAST the HORRIBLY UGLY PHANTOM by his LOOKS!!  Did you NOT SEE THE PLAY.  That was a good make up JOB!  WHY did they stray so RECKLESSLY from the ORIGINAL CONCEPT???   <br />Well, HAD TO BE good Looking because of the NEXT BIG MISTAKE . . . <br />    Second BIG mistake: THE PHANTOM'S VOICE <br />GERARD BUTLER NEVER COULD HAVE SUNG IN ANY STAGE PRODUCTION OF PHANTOM!!!  SO WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY!! <br />     [side note: a NEW CD just CAME out it's called FABULOUS BROADWAY PHANTOMS.  It features 11 . . did you get that?  ELEVAN former phantoms who ALL sound better than GERARD.] <br />WEBER and his DIRECTOR had NO reason, NO GOOD REASON for choosing BUTLER!!  He sounds terrible.  Theres only like 4 of 5 notes he actually holds, the rest he just kind of Growlingly talk/sings.  HE is the WORST part about the movie, however he IS THE MOVIE!!!   <br />     THAT is why I can not like this film.  I admit their are some good parts in it.  Some cool scenes (\\"Wishing you were somehow here again\\") where the MUSIC and the MOVIE become one and sour and it's wonderful, but Butler isn't in any of those scenes.  The whole concept was so twisted.  Here's this big HANSOME guy trying to impress this chick with his singing and he sounds pathetic.  I'm thinking at this point:  What movie is this?  Can't be the the PHANTOM.  The PHANTOM is a an ugly guy with an BEAUTIFUL, SEDUCTIVE, POWERFUL VOICE that makes YOU (not just Christine, YOU, the audience) like him, not because he HOT, because of his VOICE.  One MOVIE REVIEW I read said it well.  HE said: \\"Christine should have gotten the Oscar for being able to look like she actually was impressed with the Phantom.\\" <br />For what this movie is, it is an EMBARRASSMENT!
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|With \\"THIRTY-THREE & 1/3\\" and this release it could be surmised that George Harrison had reached a pinnacle in his recording career that would not be matched again until he joined forces with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne as The Traveling Wilburys and subsequently deliver the glorious \\"CLOUD NINE\\" album before retiring from the musical limelight. That said, \\"GEORGE HARRISON\\" is (next to \\"ALL THINGS MUST PASS\\") my second favorite Harrison album: a low-key charmer that features some of the ex-Beatles' most unabashedly romantic songwriting (\\"Dark Sweet Lady\\", \\"Your Love Is Forever\\") mixed in with several (\\"Love Comes To Everyone\\", \\"Faster\\", \\"Soft Touch\\", and the Number 16 smash \\"Blow Away\\") of his finest compositions ever. Throw in a great lost Beatle classic (\\"Not Guilty\\" which was originally written during the \\"WHITE ALBUM\\" sessions), a quirky little slice of humoresque (\\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\") and a beautiful, uplifting closing number (\\"If You Believe\\") co-written with ex-Spooky Tooth member Gary Wright, and you've got a masterpiece worthy of an ex-Beatle. HIGHEST POP ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 14.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Seriously, that title is not an exaggeration. This is one of the best electronic albums ever, and certainly the greatest of the 90's  <br />\\"nu-jazz\\" and chillout trend. Sort of like what \\"Kind of Blue\\" is to jazz, or what \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" or \\"Revolver\\" is to pop music, etc. This is the best of its kind ever created. No other \\"chillout\\" or \\"lounge\\" or \\"nu jazz\\" cd ever matched the brilliance of this release. I would rank this along with Thievery Corporation's \\"Mirror Conspiracy\\", Koop's \\"Waiting for Koop\\", and perhaps the first few \\"Hi-Fidelity Lounge\\" and \\"Private Lounge\\" releases as the best chillout albums ever. If you are a fan of the above-type music or are just interested in hearing some wonderful nu jazz, this is highly recommended. In fact, it is required!
B00005JNVS|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I went to see \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" in theaters but I'm a big fan of Chinese foreign films and needless to say it exceeded all expectations. It's a mobster movie like you've never seen before set around the 1930s. The Axe Gang wear nice, fancy black suits, and after killing some apparent foes in the beginning of the movie the credits show flashes of the \\"tough\\" gangsters doing a strange sort of dance in unison I couldn't help but chuckle at with unparalleled delight. At that point I knew this was going to be an interesting film and I was absolutely right. Legends with inhuman powers arise from the unlikeliest of people, crushing the Axe Gang's superiority and pride of being the \\"bad-asses\\" you should fear for your life from. They in turn hire countless assassins to wipe out an entire village but their attempts prove futile as the population contains more than just weak farmers and housekeepers... I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" (think Looney Toons meets Kill Bill) and recommend it to anyone who looks for odd, quirky movies that are also smart and creative, yet totally out there. The subtitles didn't even bother me as I find that most films in Chinese sound much better in the original language verses being horribly dubbed in English (ie-House Of Flying Daggers).
B000929AJQ|5.0|with teeth is a great nin album after the downward spiral and pretty hate machine.very highly recommended.ignore the one star reviews and get all three albums.five stars.PLEASE AVOID THE FORTHCOMING ALBUM FROM THE LOUSY BACKSTREET BOYS.THANKS.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Another five or so years have passed, another Nine Inch Nails album on the shelves. In 1999 The Fragile sounded fresh, and in 2005, With Teeth keeps up tradition and serves up some of the best NIN yet.<br /><br />The album begins to build with the drum n' bass intro track, \\"All The Love In The World\\". The icy beats and synths crescendo into a barrage of piano and guitars that make for a strong opening that quickly jumps into the frenetic drum intro of \\"You Know What You Are?\\". Definitely not one of the standout tracks on the album, but still good nonetheless. Think \\"Head Like A Hole\\" meets \\"Heresy\\". By the time \\"The Collector\\" kicks in, you begin to realize Trent's vision when he enlisted Dave Grohl to lend a hand on a good chunk on the album's live drumming. Nothing needs to be said about \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", the first single taken from With Teeth. \\"Love Is Not Enough\\" is a nice catchy track but also falls under the non-standout category.<br /><br />The album really hits its stride with \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\". Borrowing elements from many songs in his back catalogue, Reznor manages to put a new twist on what can be defined as \\"Nine Inch Nails: 2005\\" but still carry his trademark sound. It then seamlessly bleeds into the centerpiece of the album, \\"With Teeth\\", beginning with mechanical sounds reminiscent of \\"Reptile\\". It's a heavy number that will bludgeon your senses to death. You've got to love all the tambourine he sneaks into the album. Right in the middle of the barrage of noise that is \\"With Teeth\\" we are treated to a beautiful piano interlude where Trent whispers \\"I can not go through this again\\". Exploding once again, we move into \\"Only\\", a track that may leave you scratching your head at first listen. It carries one of Trent's best vocal performances to date, and is just a very fun track that pays homage to Pretty Hate Machine. Think \\"Ringfinger\\" meets \\"Into The Void\\". The next track, \\"Getting Smaller\\", sounds like something that could have come from the Broken sessions. It's a fast blaze of hard drumming from Grohl and a menacing guitar riff.<br /><br />Moving into the last section of the album, \\"Sunspots\\" starts off with its tantalizing drum beats and eventually progresses into a sexy chorus of crunchy guitars and a wailing synth noise that is quite pleasing to the ear for some reason. Think \\"Closer\\" meets \\"Reptile\\". \\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" comes crashing in with some brutal drum and guitar work that will most likely blow many sets of speakers. It has a surpsingly ethereal chorus and an outro reminiscent of some Fragile-era tracks. Humming along, suddenly you are listening to \\"Beside You In Time\\", the album's most hypnotic moment. With a building synth line and whimsical vocal delivery, the track pulses along until about halfway through. The track then explodes into a barrage of beautiful noise, arriving the coda, \\"we will never die, beside you in time\\". The final section has what I would describe as a Loveless (ala My Bloody Valentine) feel to it. The album then closes out with the Still-esque \\"Right Where It Belongs\\". Early reviews had dubbed it the \\"Hurt-killer\\" but they really sound nothing alike. All they share in common is that they are both charged with closing out their respective albums in a melancholy fashion. \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" does this perfectly.<br /><br />Overall, With Teeth is successful departure, leaving the sound and epic scope of The Fragile behind. Where The Fragile can really only be appreciated with a listen from start to finish, With Teeth's tracks for the most part tie in together, but work well seperately also. It is easy to pick up, and benefits from being under an hour in length. A few more changes could have probably been made, but Reznor insists that the process was quick and he wanted to abandon too many fancy gimmicks. It works. With Teeth is a decisive and hard hitting collection of Nine Inch Nails that doesn't abandon what long time fans have come to love; yet itis not as esoteric as The Fragile or The Downward Spiral.<br /><br />My point is, With Teeth is on par with NIN's first three LPs and once again gives fans something fresh. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Download: The Collector, Every Day Is Exactly The Same, With Teeth, Onlyyet it is not as esoteric as The Fragile or The Downward Spiral. <br /> <br />My point is, With Teeth is on par with NIN's first three LPs and once again gives fans something fresh.

0679745653|4.0|First I recommend that you read the story before watching the movie.  I did and I'm glad.<br /><br />Breakfast at Tiffany's is a great story, plus you get another 3 in this edition - I enjoyed them all, especially \\"A Christmas Memory\\".  \\"House of Flowers\\" and \\"A Diamond Guitar\\" are nicely written too.  I easily read all four stories in one day.<br /><br />I recommend this collection...along with In Cold Blood, also by Capote.
074322454X|4.0|This may be one of the very rare times when the movie is actually better then the book!  Don't get me wrong, the book is exceptionally enjoyable and informative, but the mini series, because it is so long, can afford to delve into more detail then most 90 minute movies, and even offers some insights that the quick, 336 page book does not. <br /> <br />I watched the mini series first and then read Ambrose's written account, and I was pleased to find that the two were remarkable compatible.  Hanks and Spielberg took very little literary license in creating the script, and the two together, book and movie, combine to be a power-house of education on the European theater of WWII.  I would love to see ten other mini series and read ten other books on ten other companies. <br /> <br />I don't doubt, as one of the reviews stated, that the book has errors.  It's true that the research Ambrose did was largely oral interviews.  But I guess I'm willing to forgive him for the errors, however, because he has presented the stories in a livelier and more vivid manner then most other accounts of WWII that I've encountered.  The bulk of what we read and watch is all true, even if some of the details are sketchy or exaggerated.   <br /> <br />All in all, a fantastic book that will survive the test of time.  If you have seen the mini series, you owe it to yourself to read the book.  If you haven't seen the series, read the book first and then watch it.  It will leave you a changed and better person. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000929AJQ|5.0|It's been over six years since the last full-length studio release from Trent Reznor, and a difficult six years at that. Reznor has since come clean about his battles with substance addiction and crises in confidence about his musical abilities. After hearing the pre-release single \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", the Internet buzzed with hot-and-cold reactions to its more accessible sound. Had Reznor actually lost the edge that had produced so much crucial music over the last decade and a half?     A single listen to \\"With Teeth\\" is enough put such concerns to rest. It's a return to the \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" idea of creating an album of songs, not a synth symphony with returning motifs such as \\"The Fragile\\" or an industrial-rock opera like \\"The Downward Spiral\\". Each song displays a lot of maturity in the writing and recording - plenty of raw emotion gets across with less aggro-angst overkill (let's face it - too much more of that and Reznor would have been on the way toward becoming a real self-parody). Some songs are upbeat, some are heavier than anything that he's done before, some are delicate ballads that will have crowds waving lighters in the air. But the tracks still maintain enough continuity that no tracks are stranded - although diverse from song to song, the album is without a doubt a comprehensive work.     As for the performance, each song on the record is geared toward being played as-is by the current tour lineup - not that it's stripped-down, but you should be able to count on live performances sounding like the album without overreliance on pre-recorded tracks. Dave Grohl, this millennium's hardest working man in show biz, laid down a lot of the drum tracks on the studio recording and the entire album has a very man-made, organic rock sound. The result is a very satisfying record, not just compared to other acts' current releases, but also to NIN's earlier works.     Here are some notes on the tracks in case you can't wait until the release date:     1. \\"All The Love in the World\\": Begins with a complex almost drum-and-bass rhythm over quiet vocals and ends with a major-key piano chord progression over the chorus. Progressive in the Radiohead vein but unmistakably NIN.     2. \\"You Know What You Are?\\": When nin.com promised that the upcoming tour would \\"destroy\\" audiences, this was the track that Reznor had in mind. A thrashy, incredibly fast beat immediately kicks off the track's verse, sounding a lot like Ministry; this is broken up by a slower but incredibly heavy chorus.     3. \\"Collector\\": This is the first of several tracks that express the defining sound of this album: live, organic drums and heavy bass guitar building a rhythm that's a mile-high and two tons of heavy. It's reminiscent of \\"The Big Come Down\\" without so much electronic production. Keeping with the in-person feel, it also features a surprising but well-placed piano solo with discordant jazzy chords and scales - think Bowie's \\"Heart's Filthy Lesson\\" or \\"Just Like You Imagined\\" from \\"The Fragile\\".     4. \\"The Hand That Feeds\\": You've likely heard it either like it or hate it. Get over the keyboard solo and get on board.     5. \\"Love Is Not Enough\\": A quick rock number that features another huge rhythm foundation and a complex beat that is reminiscent of \\"I Do Not Want This\\".     6. \\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\": A mid-tempo electronic number that features many familiar NIN sounds. It includes a very memorable chorus that is anthemic without compromising its tone. It will get stuck in your head with no warning.     7. \\"With Teeth\\": Far and away the oddest track on the album. First off, it has a shuffling beat that will throw listeners off-kilter for the first several bars. Imagine an uber-muscular version of Siouxsie's \\"Peek-a-Boo\\". But the real kick is the incredibly quiet piano interlude in the middle of the song. This track manages to be possibly the noisiest on the album without resorting to the typical aggro conventions.     8. \\"Only\\": This, the second single from \\"With Teeth\\", begins with a very unorganic eighties-throwback drumloop backing Reznor freestyling spoken vocals - not a rap, but almost a beat poetry reading. The arrangement of guitar and synths and the lyrics of the chorus are vintage NIN (\\"Ringfiner\\") while the beats are very danceable (\\"Into the Void\\").     9: \\"Getting Smaller\\": Another mosh-ready rock number similar to \\"You Know What You Are?\\". Probably the most disposable track on the album.     10: \\"Sunspots\\": A slinky, seductive number that builds to a catchy rock stomp during the chorus. Think \\"The Only Time\\" from \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\".     11. \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\": Trent's vocals are at their emotional peak on this one. Virtually atonal during the verses, with live drums that are distorted and electronically chopped up to great effect. The chorus is almost dreamy in comparison but anchored by a 4/4 war-drum tempo. By the time it hits the chorus, this track sounds very much like \\"The Day The Whole World Went Away\\" except fully realized this time around.     12. \\"Beside You In Time\\": This is the track that is played under the recent web ad on nin.com. It's not all instrumental, but it maintains it's 2/4 electronica feel throughout. It's a throwback to the Coil remixes on \\"Fixed\\".     13. \\"Right Where It Belongs\\": The album ends with its sole quiet track. A plainly pretty melody (reminded me of the verses on \\"Even Deeper\\") sung over top of keys and a detuned piano. Not quite \\"Hurt\\", but not bad, either.     \\"With Teeth\\" solidifies Reznor's place in musical history by displaying his capacity for growth within the sub-genre that he created for himself. It's undeniably Nine Inch Nails without being tired, repetitive or derivative of earlier works.     DUALDISC NOTES:  The 5.1 mix is great, but the extra content is pretty lackluster.  The video for \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is the one being played on MTV, not the fabled alternate clip.  The only other extra is a discography that contains short pieces of selected songs/videos.  Plus, DualDisc editions aren't as universally compatible as the standard CD.  If you're only going to get one, go for the standard CD over the DualDisc.
B000957O82|4.0|Oh my goodness, this was a fun show!  One of the most enjoyable, cleanest, good-humored comedies I have seen in a very long time.  Will is a natural in the romantic comedy role, and I think we'll certainly be seeing him in more. <br /> <br />I would most certainly recommend being on a date when you watch this movie... spouse, girl friend, boy friend, best friend, it doesn't matter.  It's just a fun, clean, pick-you-up and make you feel good kind of comedy.  You'll laugh a ton and enjoy yourself immensely.   <br /> <br />One of the things I appreciated the most about Hitch is that it is free of the overt sexual innuendos that are so common and accepted in most romantic comedies... it could almost be rated PG.  It's just a show about a guy who helps guys get the girl of their dreams to fall in love. <br /> <br />A fantastic show all around  Enjoy!
B0008ISM40|5.0|Since this review is attached to the DualDisc edition, I'll begin there.  The 5.1 surround mix is worth the additional price for the DD;  it brings the sound alive just as the 5.1 reworking of \\"The Downward Spiral\\" anniversary edition did.  However, the additional content is pretty lackluster.  The video for \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is the one being played on MTV, not the fabled alternate clip.  The discography contains short audio/video samples of NIN's entire career, but they're nothing new to any fan.  It's also important to note that the DualDisc format isn't as universally compatible as the standard CD and can even get stuck and/or scratched in certain laptop and car CD drives.  So, unless you plan on listening regularly to the 5.1 mix, I'd save the couple of dollars and stick with the regular CD edition.  Now on to the album itself. . .    It's been over six years since the last full-length studio release from Trent Reznor, and a difficult six years at that. Reznor has since come clean about his battles with substance addiction and crises in confidence about his musical abilities.

B0002Y4TM4|5.0|Marbles was the first time I've ever heard Marillion, and let me just say - wow. This is an absolutely amazing album, listening to it will make you want to go out and pick up their older stuff.<BR>Very mellow rock, just put it on and take yourself on a trip.<BR>I still can't believe I haven't heard of them until now. I've been missing out. If you're looking for a fresh sound, definitely pick up this album!
B000929AJQ|5.0|Nine Inch Nails fans can finally breathe. The follow up to 1999's The Fragile is finally here. It's hard to believe that Trent Reznor's music can stay so consistently amazing and relatable for how long he's been around. As with his other CD's and EP's, Trent Reznor's brilliance shines through the grittiness and roughness of his music. With Teeth is no exception. With Teeth is a CD that is approachable to anyone, yet still holds the depth and multiple layers of emotion that will have you listening to it for years to come.  <br /> <br />That is the genius of Nine Inch Nails. It is immediately accessible to anyone who is even minimally interested in rock. Before Nine Inch Nails, \\"Industrial\\" was a very esoteric type of music. Pretty Hate Machine paved the way for The Downward Spiral to break Industrial into the mainstream. Trent Reznor's pop-influenced song structure and ABAB rhyme scheme helped shape Industrial into what it is today (while still keeping a cult-esque following), and his record sales can prove it.  <br /> <br />Don't believe the hype that Nine Inch Nails is dead. At fist, some people may be taken aback by the new textures of the disc. All The Love In The World sounds like a dance track, but amazing nonetheless. However, as with all great artists, it's important to adapt and evolve to keep your music meaningful and refreshing. With Teeth is a small departure from what you may be expecting, but all the elements that made you love NIN to begin with are intact.  <br /> <br />I won't go into a track by track review here; there are plenty of other people willing to do that. Instead, I'll give you my personal favorites off the CD: <br />The aggressive, super-distorted guitar riffs of \\"Getting Smaller\\"  <br />The dark, brooding, nihilistic lyrics of \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" (This is my favorite song off the entire CD so far): <br /> <br />  \\"Every day is exactly the same/ There is no love here, there is no pain\\" <br /> \\"Sometimes I think I'm happy here,yeah, I still pretend\\"  <br /> <br />The subdued, yet poignant lyrics of \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" are among the best of the disc, along with the most euphoric moment on the entire CD. I won't spoil it for you, but trust me: you'll know what I mean when you hear it. <br />Track 12, \\"Beside You In Time,\\" slowly builds tension through the amazing synths, and delivers an amazing ending. It sounds as though it would fit perfectly on The Fragile.  <br /> <br />Even the tracks that are not immediately your favorites can grow on you. A great example of this is the Title Track. On fist listen, it seems underdeveloped and hastily thrown together. Yet every time I listen to it, I begin to understand it more and more. I'm sure there are other tracks on the CD that I will come to love with time.  <br /> <br />With Teeth is a CD no fan of Nine Inch Nails should be without. No matter who you are, you're music collection isn't complete with out the masterpiece that is With Teeth.  <br />If you're curious about Nine Inch Nails, With Teeth is actually a great place to start. The approachability of his other CD's remains intact here, along with the multilayered, emotionally charged lyrics, and dark, rough, gritty soundscapes that make us keep coming back for more.  <br />After 5 years, Trent Reznor delivers another masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br />P.S. to Trent: Please don't make us wait another 5 years for another disc! <br />
B000929AJQ|5.0|Trent Reznor has done it again... an amazing album... that rehashs his late eighties concoctions and mixes it with his late nineties... it's beautiful... \\"all the love in the world\\" is my own personal anthuem... Trent has branded himself sui generis in his own field... if not the world of music... his lyrics are still the same old architypal, nihilistic woes that have made him a god in his own time...  <br />the only complaint: there is no booklet... i always look forwward to nin's packaging... the art... the words... this c.d. has none of that... but it does have a picture of trent, and i don't think any of nin's albums have ever had that... except for a blurry picture of Trent in Pretty Hate Machine and And All That Could Have Been... and might i add- if were gay... i'd be all over trent...
B0007GAERG|5.0|I am probaly the biggest Mariah fan you will meet...And I Love the cd....Every Chance i get i am listening to the cd...It took me less than a week to learn all the songs....Shes like wine only gets better with time...Although i L O V E  the old mariah with her soulful songs and soothing voice...This cd is any pop and rnb's lovers dream...and definatley a Mariah Fan must have.
B000088E6D|4.0|This kid from Quebec has more talent than many major singers out today. Yeah, I said it...<br /><br />Michael Bublë is a wonderful singer. His adaptation of classic jazz standards are addictive and, most importantly, believable. This kid is good!<br /><br />`Fever\\", Kissing a Fool', ` You'll Never Find ...\\", and `The Way you look Tonight\\" are sure to be classics. The gifted Paul Anka produced this vivid CD with aspiration bleeding out of the covers.<br /><br />This one is a buy!!!!!
B000002BHE|4.0|..and it got me hooked. No stopping me from there. The song I loved the most was It's all coming back to me now. I had never heard such a beautiful song in my life. It is her longest song, but well worth the 7 minutes to hear. I had decided if that sounded great, I should check out other songs on here. I was not disappointed. Because you loved me is a great song that can apply to at least one person in your life. All by Myself is a bit sad, but it's a great song to hear Celine's vocal abilities. Following All by Myself, is the much more upbeat song, Declaration of Love. One of my other favorites on this album is If that's what it takes (Por que tu maimes encore). It sounds better in French but I still have an appreciation for the English version. I'd recommend this album for Celine's vocal abilities, and some really great songs.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes are just too good.  I never heard them until a few months ago.  It took a lot of arm twisting from a friend and now I'm hooked.  Wonderful fun indie pop, great hooks.  \\"12:51\\" just spins around in my head. Still have not heard their first cd. I have something to look forward to.  All this talk of \\"Television\\" and New York scene is over my head.  I could spend my days waltzing around to \\"You talk your way too much\\" and not care a whit about anything else.
B000929AJQ|5.0|an amazing album.After the beautiful and lonely opener,the pent up venom explodes in the second song(\\"You Know What You Are\\").The same kind of political,social anger that made \\"March of the Pigs\\" so great.     Trent Reznor spits melodic,well-written venom for 13 tracks.  There isnt a single bad song on With Teeth.From the heartfelt lonely lyrics and beautiful singing of \\"All The Love in the World\\" to the amazing closer \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" this is an album that I will be spinning for years to come.Because such honesty and pure,rock exorcism is very rare.    after over 8 years of Nu Metal posturing and posing and cartoonish pro-wresting angst,music with meaning and depth and pretty-hate is back with With Teeth!As an oldtime fan-great album!
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Ryan Adams, the only artist im aware of that truely sounds different on each album. Fans say this shows his veretility in all forms of music: Detractors call him unfocused and unable to stay with a genre. Either way, you have to give him something, he is very prolific. Since 2000 he has had 7 official releases(this includes Whiskeytowns beautiful Pneumonia album.) All albums were staggering testements to whatever genre Ryan found himself in at the time. Even his worst album, 2003's Rock N Roll, had its strong points. Despite each albums greatness, he has never been able to fully craft a masterpiece. Until Now. <br /> <br />Cold Roses is a staggering album. 2 disc 18 songs with a running time just under an hour and a half. The songs are as strong as they are on any album, and thats saying something. The thing that gives this album the edge over all his other is the fact Ryan isnt alone this time. Enter The Cardinals. These 4 back up muscians take ryans songs to a plain that he has always pushed for, and they do it in a very simple way; by being laid back. You will find none of the gloss that covered Gold, none of the orchastration, that at times plauged Love is Hell, and none of the faceless studio muscians that failed the craft of Heartbreaker. These guys know where ryan is and where he is going. And they provide the train. Their influence is all over the album: The opening prayer of Magnolia Mountian, the replacments-esque thrash of Beautiful Sorta, and the radio-ready romp that is Let it Ride. On each song The Cardinals match and in the case of a few (Cold Roses, If I am a Stranger) surpass their frontman. <br /> <br />The Cardinals, however great they are, wouldnt be able to pull this album of without Adams. and thankfully for the first time in years he has braught his heart with him. Every album since gold was marred by Ryans detachment. But here he cares. Here he breaks your heart again. Here is a man who has finnaly settled completly into a genre (for one album at least) and his heart breaks with yours. the songs are intiment and touching. Songs like Sweet Illusions and Meadowlake Street will stop you in your tracks. And there are 16 more tracks that share that trait. <br /> <br />This is definetly Ryans best album. furthermore i find this to be the best album to have come out in years period. So make sure you dont miss out on this album.
0316172324|5.0|I'm really shocked at the few negative reviews - some want more scientific language describing what is known about how the brain works - others think this is too anecdotal and is NOT scientific. I think it's brilliant stuff - it draws from existing studies and maps out a practical guide as to how people can craft protocols for reaching better decisions, i.e., when to trust snap judgements and when you have to look further to make sure you are not introducing bias. This is heavy sledding and requires a lot of thought, but Mr. Gladwell makes it easy to read and understand. Applying it is hard, but he give plenty of examples. I'm not sure what more he could do to bring this topic to life?
B00070QXL8|3.0|What I loved about the Bridget Jones books and the movie most was the fact that we got to see a heroine who was far from perfect in every possible aspect. She was someone women could relate to and perhaps laugh at her flightiness and in turn make the rest of us feel better that we are not in her shoes. However, watching the film version of Bridget Jones: The Edge or Reason was like watching a parody of the aforementioned anti-heroine. Almost every scene in the sequel centers on Bridget Jones going through humiliating moments that are too over the top at times. There were some poignant and sweet moments with Bridget and Mark Darcy, but they were few and far in between. The plot also seems bloated, like the editors tried to add as many elements of the book as possible in 110 minutes. And the solution regarding relationship interloper Rebecca is too contrived and simplified for my taste. Also, the elements of Jane Austen's Persuasion that were in the book are missing here.  What happened?  The first book had been inspired by Austen's Pride and Prejudice and said inspiration was also apparent in the movie.  This is yet another major flaw in this film. But despite the aforementioned things, the movie was indeed funny and entertaining and Renee Zellwegger (who gained more weight to do this film than she did in the first one) and gorgeous Colin Firth had great chemistry. Hugh Grant is always fun to watch whenever he plays a bad boy. Grant is more believable in the aforementioned roles than he is when he plays the boy next door type of characters he played in Notting Hill and Love Actually. All in all, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is not as good as the Helen Fielding novels or as good as the first movie and I'd advise you to rent the DVD before you buy it.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|Dylan released one album before this one, but \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" is really where it all begins. After all, who hasn't heard \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\"? Arguably, it's one of the most influential folks songs ever written. Throughout the sixties covers of the song flowed like Niagra from the guitars and mouths of folk bands, rock bands, and singer/songwriters inspired by Dylan's example. The song has almost become synonymous with the concept of \\"protest song\\". It helped define the music of its era, and remains one of Dylan's anthems.<br /><br />The album consists of Dylan, Guitar, and harmonica with one exception: \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" includes a small band. Otherwise it's a one man show. That makes this album all the more incredible. Neil Young once said about playing solo acoustically \\"You gotta be good to do that\\". And so it appears. Very few solo acts can pull off what Dylan accomplishes here. The solid but not too perfect guitar playing, his wavering and slightly abrasive voice, and the boisterous harmonica somehow create a coherent whole that is neither boring or sloppy. He probably couldnt've consciously created a better tribute to his greatest influence Woody Guthrie.<br /><br />\\"Masters of War\\" contains some of Dylan's most fist-clenching lyrics, such as \\"You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins\\", and \\"Even Jesus would never forgive what you do\\"; it pulls out all the stops with \\"And I hope that you die, and your death will come soon.\\" The whole song spills venom in large pools.<br /><br />\\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" evokes nightmarish images.  The lyrics seem to prophesize a coming calamity. Some have claimed that Dylan predicted the strife of the 1960s in this song. Regardless, it remains one of Dylan's outstanding and unforgettable songs.<br /><br />\\"Oxford Town\\" deals with racial injustice and is supposedly based on the story of James Meredith. Imagery of guns, clubs, and tear gas bombs pervade the song.<br /><br />\\"I Shall Be Free\\" ends the album on a humorous note. It's based on the \\"We Shall Be Free\\" tune that Lead Belly and Guthrie once sang together. Dylan \\"updated\\" the song for the 1960s. Pay special attention to the Bridget Bardot, Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren line. Did the somewhat prudish scene of 1963 miss the baudy double entendre?<br /><br />This album and 1964's \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" put Dylan right at the center of the folk and protest music scene of the 1960s. He started hanging out with Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Phil Ochs, and others who would spitefully condemn Dylan just a few years later for abandoning the scene he helped to boost in popularity. The years repute Dylan in this debate. After all, who could expect him to make two better folk protest albums than his first two? Dylan would have burned out quickly without exploring other avenues. In retrospect, he couldn't have stayed where this album put him. So he fled the scene. It wasn't the first or last scene he fled. It was just the beginning of one of the most intriguing and influential music careers of the twentieth century. \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" remains a classic. If anything it has gained in prestige since its release over 40 years ago. That alone speaks volumes.nds the album on a humorous note.

B000002GYI|5.0|How can anyone dare to criticize this album. It is topshelf and perhaps I should leave it at that but I wont. Ill tell you more. As the other review mentions, this album was released in 1981: wow. It still digs out a beat unconnected to the decade in which it was born. In other words, it could have be produced last year. All electroheads will probably have herd of this album like Gary Numan and Dada Pogrom but if you have not then, welcome. Listen to the clips and get down.to the cash register!
B00080ZG10|4.0|Long as it is, 'The Aviator' is never boring.  It has 2h 49 min running time full of dramas, costumes, cameos, flying planes, and the enticing glitter of golden Hollywood.  As many other reviewers have rightly said, DiCaprio shows surprisingly mature acting, and other actors are as wonderful as he is.  But somehow, just somehow I mean, there is a slight feeling that something is wrong with the film. <br /> <br />I'm not saying 'The Aviator' is bad.  Its story about the ledendary figure Howard Hughes could never be boring, and how could it be?  Known as the aviator, film director, company owner of TWA, or whatever you name it, Hughes's unique persona never fails to fascinate us.  The film wisely chose the time of his life around the 30s and 40s, when he showed up before the public as celebrity, and before he virtually started to hide himself, living like a hermit. <br /> <br />For Hughes, everything must be done with extraordinary scale, and this bio-pic insists on showing it.  From his costly shooting of 'Hell's Angels' to his fights with the authorities, the life of Howard Hughes is always exciting.  That's how the script of John Logan ('Gladiator' and others) shows, but it does not show us any single insight into his eccentric behaviors.  For it's the job of the good actors.   <br /> <br />Leonard DiCaprio is excellent as Howard Hugh though I think he may look a bit too young at times (when with beard in particular).  Among many supports, which include Ian Holm, Alan Alda, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, Willem Defoe, and Kate Beckinsale, it is Cate Blanchett who is most impressive (and who won Oscar).  Her performance as tomboyish Katharine Hepburn resembles uncannily the real Kate.  Perhaps, I am afraid, too real for some. <br /> <br />Lots of CGIs are used for the flight scenes.  In spite of the raving reviews from some professional critics, I am not impressed with these special effects.  Not that they are ineffective.  I'm just saying that they kind ofstick out in this Martin Scorsese's film, which I believe is about the human beings like his past films.  Did he need CGIs to make 'Raging Bull'? <br /> <br />Martin Scorsese is clearly seeking for something new, leaving his favorite city of New York far behind, and teaming up with DiCaprio, as if forgetting his long-standing collaborations with Robert DeNiro.  But DeNiro also has changed as 'Hide and Seek' shows you, so why not Scorsese?  'The Aviator' is hailed as another masterpiece from the maestro.  Though I admit its merits, I disagree.  It's just the beginning, which might or might not turn out good for him.
B000065RMP|3.0|Now this is emotional stuff quite like the Angels of the Universe sound track from Hillmarsson who is also Icelandic. The album is beautiful and often child like. I want to say cute. The only thing that is rather irritating with bands from Iceland is that I swear they all share the same keyboard for the exception of Dada Pogrom. Think of Mum, Kanada, and Worm is Green. That is not necessarily a bad thing though. I think this album has caught the attention of many people.
B00005JNQ8|2.0|Sean Penn is a very talented actor. So talented that I willingly laugh off his incredible arrogance. In \\"The Interpreter,\\" though he seeems to be just a little bit off his game. Everyone seems to be just a tad uninterested in the preceedings, and I share the feeling    This thriller moves at a plodding pace. I wasn't engaged at all. It's not a terrible film by any means, but considering my level of anticipation, and the film's pedigree it was a considerable disappointment.
B000929AJQ|3.0|first things first - i am just amazed by the photograph inside the album case - it fascinates me to no end. <br /> <br />lyrically this album seems to go along with the image in the CD case and with the song titles... themes of complacency, aimlessness, boredom, all tied in with feelings of fading away and being insignificant (as the review before me says \\"a mid-life crisis)- the CD has a very \\"mature\\" feeling to it... even more so than the Fragile. <br /> <br />musically, it sounds reminiscent of the Fragile, but it does not sound the same. personally i am a big fan of the more experimental, electronic stuff that NIN have created, and this album certainly features much less of that and focuses more on the songwriting itself. <br /> <br />as far as the songs, a few really stand out immediately to me. the first song \\"all the love in the world\\" is AMAZING.  maybe putting such a great song first kind of spoiled the rest of the disc for me.  this song has very cool, mellow drum patterns accompanied by piano and vocals.  just awesome. reason enough to buy this disc if you like NIN. <br />the other songs that grabbed my attention were \\"every day is exactly the same\\" and \\"the line begins to blur\\" <br /> <br /> <br />now time to go look at that cool image again.... <br />
0316172324|4.0|A lot of prior reviewers seem disappointed in this book, but I found it interesting. Maybe it is because I spent 15 years as a newspaper editor and the past 21 years as a domestic violence counselor. Perhaps I have more experience with \\"snap judgments\\" and with \\"social science research\\" than many readers. Author Gladwell contrasts the two ways of making decisions, and attempts to explain why the quick, instinctive opinion often works out better. The book has a little too much repetition, and jumps from one situation to another without always connecting the former with the latter effectively----but those are small flaws. Consider this short work an introduction to the topic of instinctive responses, not the final word, and you should be content. His section on traumatic, temporary autism as an explanation for things such as police officers shooting suspects who turn out not to have been threats will be controversial, but makes sense to me. So does his contention that \\"contempt\\" between spouses is the best predictor of divorce. I'm glad I read it. If you are cautious due to the reviews which are not as positive as mine, just go fetch your copy at the library, as I did. Then, if it does not hold your interest, you are only out a little time, but no dough.
B00000F14B|5.0|This was one of the first movie musicals I ever saw+to this day still one of the most thoroughly entertaining films of all time.  If ever a man was meant to play a role it was Robert Preston.  His Professor Hill is a character for the ages.  Shiley Jones's lovely voice+great presence match him very well.  The fact that,like Rex Harrison,Preston could not carry a tune makes his performance all the more astonishing.  You would never know after hearing Preston+Jones sing \\"Till There was You\\" that he was not a singer.  Supporting cast is outstanding especially the Mayor--a sort of archetype of a bumbling politician.  Though it may seem corny,my favorite song is still \\"76 Trombones\\" followed closely by \\"Trouble\\"  Finally,I suggest those reviewers who do not feel this film is in the same class as My Fair Lady or the Sound of Music give this film another try.  They will not be disappointed.  A must for any DVD library
0385510454|4.0|Un bel libro, se lei vuole imparare italiano. This is a great book, with an opportunity to learn Italian.   <br /> <br />There was an intricate story line, weaving from plot to plot to blend everything together in only the way Girsham can.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the ending.  I was hoping for an exciting ending, when, suddenly, I turn the page... and the book ended..  But still a great read.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I know...Most of you now have a deep hatred for me and are grabbing for your plastic light sabres(is that the \\"darkside\\"gaining control over you?hmmmm?)..But to be honest..as a Sci Fi fan...this was the most entertaining! I have never felt as impressed with the star wars special effects that in their day were supposed to be revolutionary(even though a decade earlier 2001 was released with effects that in my view were much more effective...but really that is apples an oranges)but I could never get over the fact that as omminous a character that Darth Vader was....his men were terrible shots....not a particularly dangerous Empire really..and the Death Star(While on the outside looked immense...on the inside looked like a flying high school...with small narrow corridors(which curved.!!...on a planet sized craft they shouldbe straight and look like they go on forever!!)And when viewing the original series when they were rereleased in the theatres I actually fell asleep halfway into \\"A New Hope\\" These are dated films people....Not really up to snuff with current standards.....hokey lines/inept enemy villians/....I guess it is like saying the \\"Emperor\\"has no clothes.These films are light entertainment....but no match for what can be done now in storytelling.Compare this old 70's series with The Lord of the Rings......NO COMPARISON! Great story'great effects..great epic!!..Ok....I've said my piece.....May the Farce...I mean... Force be with you(what a lame line that is!).
B0006399FS|1.0|They cut the wrong wire on this one. Overall the album stinks. The fallout from this one will affect many but there is hope. While bathing my body in iodine, I realized that I could salvage my purchase by playing the CD backwards. Needless to say it sounded a lot better. On track three (backwards)I am still wondering what \\"love the robot\\" means.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera was not given the credit it was due. Although the film was snubbed at The 2005 Academy Awards, and incredulously did not receive even one award for its amazing artistry, it will be forever remembered and loved by all who have been graced by it's magic! This is not just a movie, nor just an opera, but a beautiful masterpiece! In fact I believe this to be on of the most visually and sensually stunning movies I have ever viewed! If you like the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage show then this movie is for you! The actors were amazing! The costumes were superb, the music's like the breath of God, and set design was incredible! The singing was unsurpassed; especially the performances by Emmy Rossem, Gerard Butler, and Patrick Wilson. The acting was well done by all. Minnie Driver is hilarious as the opera house Diva. You will be enchanted by the mysterious world of the Phantom of the Opera. Even kids love this movie!    Gerard Butler, (was also in these great movies: DRACULA 2000, ATTILA, TOMB RAIDER II, and THE JURY)is the man behind the mask, and is without a doubt one of the most talented actors of our time! As the soulful mysterious Phantom, he gives a commanding performance with presence and an intensity that Richard Burton would have been envious of. Though he had not had any classical voice training, believe me when I tell you this man can sing! His voice has a rich powerful quality yet it has a graceful classic sound which resonates right through your soul! Gerard Butler embodies the real art of acting. He can emote more passion and feeling in a single glance than most actors can with hours of dialogue. The Phantom of the Opera DVD set is wonderful, and will be a cherished addition to your collection!
1400032717|4.0|I thought this book was very amusing.  At one point Christopher writes \\"I rolled back onto the lawn and pressed my forehead to the ground again and made the noise that Father calls groaning.\\"  After I read this sentence I could just picture Christopher slowly rolling onto the ground and moaning.  I think this sentence also helped the reader understand how someone with Asperger's syndrome doesn't understand something as simple as what a moan is.  He states that the noise he was making was what his father called moaning, not a noise that he knew himself to be moaning.  I love how descriptive this book is without being too descriptive.  I think a good example of this is when Christopher was trying to describe the way his head felt when a police officer was asking him too many questions, \\"They were stacking up in my head like loaves in the factory where Uncle Terry works.\\"
B000929AJQ|3.0|There are a few songs on here that will definitely be added to the collection in my head of \\"All-time greatest songs (and groups of songs),\\" but overall, this album was a let down for me.  <br /> <br />Don't misunderstand me, this is a great collection of songs that is better than most things that have come out recently. But it is *just* that: a collection of songs. It lacks the cohesiveness of past albums. \\"The Fragile\\" begs to be listened to as an album. <br /> <br />[For example, a bass line introduced in \\"La Mer\\" on \\"Left\\" comes back as the main line in \\"Into the Void\\" on \\"Right\\".] <br /> <br />And overall, the songs flow very well from one to the next. Whereas, \\"With_Teeth\\" is more like 13 (14 for those with imports) individual songs that can too easily be extracted out of context. So much so that they almost seem forced together. This wasn't entirely unexpected though. It's long been known that this album was going to do away with instrumentals. (You can't fool us Trent....\\"All the Love in the World\\" is an instrumental.....only with words =P). <br /> <br />The songs are very stipped down. I feel like some of the songs are just missing something. Songs like \\"The Collector\\" and \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" are great songs, but they could be better. <br /> <br />I understand that bands need to change and grow, and until now NIN has continuously re-invented their sound in a positive way. Overall \\"With_Teeth\\" feels like a step backwards from \\"The Fragile,\\" but it is still well worth the money paid for it.
0143057189|2.0|I couldn't stand the narrator's voice. The first chapter was a yawner about Montana farms or something...I tried several times to listen to this book but kept shutting it off. I'll give the book the benefit of doubt and two stars instead of one.
B00008VGL6|5.0|Counterfeit, the 1989 release proved that Martin Gore was not just a great lyricist but a muisician and vocalist. This 2003 much delayed followed up, called Counterfeit2 we get more covers by Gore. It is a plethora of different artists that he has covered this time for example David Bowie, Nick Cave and John Lenon to mention a few.  Martin Gore is a much better vocalist then he is ever given credit for and his muisicanship is not merely to plunk some fingers on a keyboard. The book-let is quite nice with photos of Gore in different poses. He could need a haircut though and that hat that he is wearing on the front is dreadfull. Even so it is very well done cover album with great tracjs such as his rendition of loverman, stardust and many others.
0142002038|5.0|Ian Fleming's Dr. No is early James Bond fun, one of the first novels and the first film. The Bond character is not yet fully stylized into the high tech gadget-loving, multi-lingual, card-playing, three women per film character that we know from the films. However the lovable vices such as the vodka martini and the pistol in the shoulder holster, are already well established.   <br /> <br />In fact we see glimpses of another side of Bond, especially early on when Bond is nearly drummed out of the 00 branch. Remember that From Russia With Love immediately preceded Dr. No, and Bond had nearly died from the shoe-tip poison injection.  <br /> <br />Bond had spent months in hospital and M was unsure that he was fit for return to full duty, so he sent him to Jamaica to close out a few loose ends on what was thought to be a minor Human Resources problem. M saw this as an extension of the rest and relaxation period, a point which Bond uncharaceristically later mocks M about in his communique to the office. <br /> <br />Bond spreads about some cash and assembles the old team in Jamaica. He quickly discovers that the real story is homocide and terrorism, not an aging colleague taking off with a vivacious young assistant. Of course Bond makes his way to a tropical paradise where he meets Dr. No, his dragon, and the unforgettable Honeychild Rider, played by Ursula Andress in the film. The famous stunt in the film, where the good guys hide in the lagoon breathing through bamboo sticks, turns out to have actually been Honey's idea.   <br /> <br />It is always interesting to me as a fan of both the novels and the films to see where they went different directions in telling the story. Most unfortunately, Honey appears in the novel without her famous bikini. Interestingly she has a disfiguring broken nose, one souvenir of a very difficult life as a Jamaican orphan, descended from supporters of the Restoration.  She also has quite a store of knowledge of local plants and animals, much of which turns out to be quite useful in her adventures with Bond.  <br /> <br />Dr. No's occupation has also changed from guano farmer/missile expert in the novel, to some kind of poorly defined nuclear scientist in the film.  <br /> <br />No is one of the better villains, and he gets a chance, over a long dinner, to tell his story. He had been a big-league gangster in both China and America, and has actually earned medical degrees. He was accused correctly of theft, had his hands cut off to mark him as such, and was shot in the chest and left for dead. Fortunately for No, he was the one man in a million whose heart is on the wrong side and he survived the shooting.  <br /> <br />Read the book, see the film again and enjoy a glimpse of the early Bond years. Some comical characters, such as the governor, from the Edwardian era still populate the gentry of the final days of the colonial times.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|I am not really all that fond of music that came out in 1998, and this is one of the albums that I feel is why I'm so down on the music of that particular year. Mind you in 1998 I was in a real funk anyway, but the music made it worse. To me this was a real disappointment as far as albums go. \\"Pretty Fly\\" sounds like a rewrite of \\"Come Out And Play\\", and not as good sounding either. \\"Why Don't You Get A Job?\\" doesn't make me think of sandy gold beaches in the Caribbean it makes me think why are these people writing about this? Has rock and roll gotten that dead that we can't think of anything else to write about? For the most part this album is horrible with only one song that I can say I can halfway tolerate, and that was \\"The Kids Are Not Alright.\\" It put me back in the frame of mind I was in back in 1998, and that was one of angst and depression. I was 30, and still single, and hating it every moment I saw a couple together, and being all lovey dovey. It made me remember all the anger I felt, and to a certain extent still do. However, with all things I have to go beyond this stage as I have felt stagnated, and down on things. I don't know what it will take maybe a different attitude towards people, or hopefully someone will take the time to see who I really am. I also know one thing now that I have gotten this out of my system as this was one of the things that have bothered me STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM!!!!!!! It's gaurunteed to get you down on life, and make you want to kill yourself. Not so much the words, but the music.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I was slightly unsure of this movie in the beginning because of the 'romantic' content between Wendy and Peter - but fortunately this was redeemed during the dance scene when Wendy realizes that for Peter it's all pretend.  Jeremy's portrayal captured nearly perfectly what I always envisioned Peter as: cocky, careless, and yet so charismatic that one understands why Wendy would fly off with him.  Those reviewers who don't like how Peter and Tinkerbell are portrayed in this film need to put down their Disney versions and read the book!  Much of what they don't get (the kiss in the corner of Wendy's mouth, etc) is straight out of the book, and that's exactly why I loved this film so much.  It's a film to watch again and again, and it made me smile, remembering what a crush I used to have on Peter when I was a little girl.  Lots more little girls are going to be sighing over Jeremy's Peter, in this fabulous version of a beloved book.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Season 1 of Gilmore Girls is as good a season of TV as I have ever seen. It ranks right up there with the single season shows My So-Called Life and Freaks And Geeks.    I love everything about this season of this show. I love how Jackson catches Sookie buying someone else's strawberries. I love how Lorelai tells off her mother at the end of Rory's Dance. I love how Paris smiles as she watches her two best friends get yelled at by Lorelai. I love all the music. I love how the final scene in the last episode of the season gives a wonderful, joyous sense of closure, as if the writers were worried that there might not be a second season.    Simply put, the first season of Gilmore Girls stands very well on its own. And as far as I'm concerned, it's the only season of the show that I ever wanted to own.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|The marriage of the light-hearted, whimsical Cuban jazz and rumba of Bebo Valdes with the soulful masculinity of El Cigala's voice - one of the richest on Spain's vibrant flamenco scene - creates a heartbreakingly beautiful CD that makes you fall in love upon first listening and doesn't disappoint ever again.  You won't know if you're in a packed flamenco bar, an Argentine tango hall or a jazz club in Havana, and you won't give a damn.  If you follow the lyrics, you'll also find yourself smiling often.
B000002KY8|4.0|I think every Prince album is good, but the five albums from \\"1999\\" through to \\"Lovesexy\\" are amazing. This may not be the commercial success of \\"Purple Rain\\", but it will funk you up just the same. This double-album is front-loaded with hits, and there's no doubt that \\"1999\\", \\"Little Red Corvette\\", and \\"Delirious\\" are all classics. However the good music keeps coming with the next few tracks, and \\"D.M.S.R.\\" is especially catchy, lengthy, and dance floor ready. The last three songs are really good also. There's only 11 tracks here, but many of them are quite long, and the album is roughly 70 minutes, which didn't happen much in 1983. Now if Prince is really shooting for longevity, his next album should be called \\"2099\\".
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie to me was like wow when I first saw it I just could'nt stay in the theatre {but did} it shock me and hurt me inside. To see such a beautiful person being torture made me see how the world can be. See THIS MOVIE NOW.
B000002IZ4|4.0|Stone Temple Pilots remind me of bands like Primus and The Cranberries, in the way that each bands debut was excellent, then each following album was weaker and weaker. Therefore I find \\"Purple\\" to be their second best album. Though not quite as hardcore as \\"Core\\", it's still rooted in grunge more than the following albums were, and the songs are still mostly strong front to back. \\"Meatplow\\" is a good opener, which leads to \\"Vasoline\\", one of their catchiest tracks ever. \\"Interstate Love Song\\" is another classic, and afterwards is \\"Still Remains\\", which I have always loved. Then there's the simple \\"Pretty Penny\\", and \\"Big Empty\\", also found on \\"The Crow\\" soundtrack. Everything else is still great, right down to the hidden track, which really does sound like Johnny Mathis.
B0007GAERG|5.0|THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI is one step better than \\"the return of the voice.\\" it's the official return of Mariah Carey. Any anyone who doubts that she's lost her stunning vocal ability should take a listen to this record. If the album was so bad, the 1-star reviewers wouldn't waste their time. But on the contrary, their spamming because it's too good. The fact is, people had written her off. They expected her album to flop, but it hasn't so the haters come out each week. It must be selling. People must be talking about it if the haters are wasting this much time and energy. This is a real comeback for Mariah. She has surprised a lot of people. So may rumors, so little time. Mariah chose to focus on her music and songwriting and that's why this album is so tangible. It's probably her most accessible material. There's something on the album for both older and newer fans. Mariah took a chance. She didn't have to comeback and try to sell a single record. But as a longtime fan, I'm grateful that she gave it another go. This album is exactly what you would expect from Mariah Carey.
B000007T2Z|5.0|The opening monologue of Dead Flag Blues, followed by approximately five minutes of the most gloriously bleak and desolate music imaginable, is worth the price of this album alone. This is the hymn of civilization's final days.<br /><br />Some critics love to refer to as Godspeed You Black Emperor! as pretentious, and I can see where that claim is valid. The protracted song lengths, the symphonic pretenses, the long expanses of what seems to be dead air, the found sounds, the apocalyptic imagery (as noted in aforementioned monologue), the whole lot. But this post-rock collective (pretty hard to refer to them as a \\"band,\\" what with a rumored nine members and orchestral feel) easily transcends all those petty criticisms with their awe-inspiring and challenging music.<br /><br />F#A (infinity) is not at all an easily digestible affair. We're talking 3 tracks, each composed with several movements, and the shortest being over 16 minutes, the longest close to 30. Even by post-rock standards (eight-minute songs are not outside the norm for bands like Explosions In The Sky and Sigur Ros) this is pretty inaccessible. Short attention spans need not apply. The instrumentation consists of guitar, violin, cello, bass, various electronics, drums, brass and more. In this respect, I am reminded of late Talk Talk but whereas the touchstone in albums like Laughing Stock was jazz and ambient, Godspeed You Black Emperor! seems to take its cues from classical orchestra.<br /><br />Dead Flag Blues kicks off the album, establishing the desolate, resigned mood that defines the experience with its weeping strings and distant guitar. It's just devastating in its emotion and in the pictures it paints (\\"the skyline was beautiful on fire\\"). The third movement (The Cowboy) builds on a motif that is vaguely spaghetti-western, almost Morricone-ish, and ends in a twinkling, almost happy theme that suggests that there is hope, however distant it may be.<br /><br />East Hastings kicks off with a sample of a crazy street preacher, backed by a short reprise of Dead Flag Blues on bagpipe. This eventually gives way to The Sad Mafioso, which is one of the most stirring pieces on the whole album (this was features prominently in the movie 28 Days Later, giving its most memorable and creepy scene even more resonance). The instrumental buildups, culminating about 11 minutes in, are so harrowing in their power that the quick retreat in the next movement (Drugs In Tokyo/Black Helicopter) takes one aback. The track concludes with a hazy, creepy, almost narcotic drone that is one of the most quietly terrifying things I've ever heard.<br /><br />The final track, Providence, begins with another sample and continues in a vaguely similar fashion to The Sad Mafioso with its first two movements (orchestral buildups, though neither is as huge as its predescessor), and progressively getting more abstract before drifting off to a false ending. After several minutes it all returns for one last desperate hurrah to close out the album.<br /><br />To my ears, this debut is Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s best, though the Slow Riot For New Zero Kanada gives it a run for its money. Lift Your Skinny Fists.. is good, but feels a little too drawn-out at times; and their latest Yanqui U.X.O. sounds a bit too much like the \\"band\\" simply repeating themselves (and also loses out on the found sounds, which I thought gave their previous albums a lot of character). At any rate, if you like post-rock in the vein of Dirty Three, Sigur Ros, and Explosions In The Sky, this is for you.<br /><br />[On a totally unrelated note, does anyone else think the packaging for this album bears a striking resemblence to Slint's Spiderland? It's got the black-and-white pic on the front, a small illustration on the back, even the font used is similar.. a homage perhaps?

B0007YMUZW|5.0|Just got Ryan's Cold Roses album and wow. The lyrics are so touching, heart spoken, and mature. His music is focused, beautiful, and perfect. He's always had the ability to give you a glimpse into a world of drugs, alcohol, love and loss, but with this new album he sounds like he finally grew up. His new band, The Cardinals, matches him note for note. An homage to his alt. country days, but with the experience of a well rounded artist. This is an album that every Ryan Adams fan will love, and if you're new to him, it's a great springboard to start with. Take the time to read the lyrics while listening, it'll give you an even greater appreciation for each and every beautifully crafted song. I love Bright Eyes and Damien Rice, but Ryan Adams has stepped up to the plate and hit a grand slam, proving to be our generation's Dylan. He's a singer/song writer unmatched in these days of producer-made pop.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Since their birth in 1985, The Flaming Lips have produced albums that totally rocked things off, including those highly valued socks that you are wearing at this very moment.  Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots is a highly valued piece of artwork in my collection of way cool albums.  I will have to admit that I did not enjoy my first listening experience, but we all know that the songs you grow to like never seem to stick at first.   <br /> <br />Overall upbeat, this psychedelic mixing of melodies is delightfully pleasing to the ear.  Yoshimi is a journey, going from an epic battle of gargantuan proportions (as in \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\"), to an epic battle of self exploration (as in \\"In The Morning Of Magicians\\").   <br /> <br />This album is one of few that I can listen to all the way through.  There are not really any moments that I find myself skipping, although, sometimes you have to wonder what in the world head Flaming Lip Wayne Coyne was thinking when this album was put together.   <br /> <br />\\"Do You Realize\\" is perhaps the most entertaining track on this 2002 album.  In the back of my mind, I somehow envision the Muppets donating their vocal abilities to the cause.  This track is all about not letting your life slip away, and being honest with everyone in your life.  Essentially, this song makes you realize that the end could come at any time, only not in a so depressing way:  \\"Do you realize that everyone you know someday will die?  And instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know you realize that life goes fast.\\"  Those are huge ideas, and cause life wondering questions to occur inside that bundle of neurons of yours. <br /> <br />\\"Fight Test\\" is another one of those life reflecting tracks that forces you to think about the social stipulations placed on the male gender.  Is it right to let something slip away, or should you fight for it?  If you don't fight, is that wrong?  Coyne is left with no answer for this one, as \\"it's all a mystery\\".   <br /> <br />Even though this album deals with subjects that cause you to think about your life, it is accomplished in a way that you don't really notice.  This album is just nicely put together, and things seem to fit to a sequence.  This album is so good, although I just didn't realize it at first.  The words come effortlessly, and fit with the music so well.  In fact, I rate this album 4 spatulas.   <br /> <br />Standout Tracks:  \\"Ego Tripping At The Gates Of Hell\\", \\"Do You Realize??\\", and \\"Its Summertime\\".   <br /> <br />If you like The Flaming Lips, be sure to try other artists like Wilco, The Postal Service, and Neutral Milk Hotel.  Although I highly value the Lips, these groups are just as sweet and awesome.
1401300901|4.0|Other reviewers have already told the whole story of this book (why do they do that?). I will just say this was a great premise that was lost in the not to par writing style. Ahern is a new novelist that will grow into herself. Unfortunately, this book came early in her career.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book, it reminded me of Bridget Jones. The characters were able to laugh at themselves and were genuine. I would read a sequel to find out how Ahern sees the future of the characters. A sequel may actually show improvement...
B000002GB2|4.0|Styx had a 'vision' (perhaps they saw it in a Crystal Ball?) that they would be changing style. This album was an 'Equinox'. Perhaps it wasn't so much a vision, but rather a 'revelation' (about writing more commercial material and, thus, being more successful, if platinum is your idea of success).     Shame this was the last album to feature 'John Curulewski', he's a talented wunderkind of progressive giants, but perhaps such epic songwriting didn't have a place in late 70's Americana. Anyway, almost all the songs are excellent, even if simplistic, joyous, celebratory 'prog-rock' is a hard proposition to swallow for some people. This album packs the biggest sound this side of that mythological river called 'Banks' (an appropriate name for a river!)    To hide the fact they're stingy (less than 35 minutes for the price of a full LP?) they drag out the last song by repeating certain riffs a lot. Oh well, it's comforting to know Dennis DeYoung only had to write about 20 minutes of music, and the others even less... (Rating ***3/4, or 3.75)
0385720920|4.0|This is a book about a man who hates himself. He hates you, too, so back off. He doesn't want you to read this book. He wants you to go do something better with your time.  <br /> <br />This is Victor Mancini. He's a med school dropout working at a colonial village and going to sex-addiction therapy meetings to get dates. His mom's got Alzheimer's and he can't afford to get her a feeding tube. He's a con artist with a purpose. He pretends to choke on his food for three reasons. One, the people who rescue him feel like heroes for saving him. Two, he gets to feel at least a little loved. Three, they feel obliged to him and send him money.  <br /> <br />Sound promising? Well, yes, actually. And there are good things about this book. The scene at Colonial Dunsboro, which is full of drug addicts and ex-hippies, is very funny, though it gives re-enactors a bad rap. It's run by a man who is obsessed with period accuracy - you get put in the stocks if you so much as wear chapstick to work - and that rang a little true. Victor's friend, whose name has slipped my mind, is a wonderful character. Actually, he's the best one in the book, for my money. He collects big rocks and reads about architecture in the library. He uses this information, too, though I won't say how.  <br /> <br />Those are only a few characters and situations, but they're probably the best ones. The biggest problem is the main character. He is so unpleasant and hates him self so much, that for almost all of the book, you kind of hate him too. Admittedly, due to his mother's eccentric parenting style (which is putting it nicely - she kidnapped him in a school bus once), he has every right to be angry and messed up the way he is. But every now and then, you kind of want to smack him and tell him to shut up.  <br /> <br />It's good, but only if you've read other Palahniuk novels first. I recommend reading \\"Lullaby\\" before reading this one. That's how I read it, anyway, and I don't think I'd have put up with this one for long if I hadn't read \\"Lullaby\\" first.  <br /> <br />Still, it's an okay sort of book. It's a quick read. And you'll at least chuckle when you think of Colonial Dunsboro
B00000272N|5.0|This is without a shadow of a doubt, the best grunge album ever and will stay that way! Every track is bad ass, kick ass, etc., etc., etc. But one thing I dont understand is that why Nirvana got and gets more exposure. This cd came out before Nevermind and still \\"Nirvana is the best.\\" Dont get me wrong, they're awesome, but Alice In Chains is way better than them, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and all the other grunge acts. AIC got ripped off 'cause they should have got more respect than Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Nirvana, but didn't. Take for example, when Kurt Cobain died, it was like the music world died to, but when Layne Staley died, it was announced on the radio and now is forgotten. What the hell?????? Another example is when Soundgarden broke up, everyone was so sad and disappointed. And AIC doesn't get any credit. Now rumors are going around that AIC might get back together to do one last studio cd with Mike Inez, Sean Kinney, and Jerry Cantrell, as well as release an Essential AIC cd. Everyone pray and cross your fingers that, that rumor comes true.
B000929AJQ|5.0|The wait is over, and it was worth it. Full of all the great lyrics and hard hitting music we all know and love,this is Trents' most polished and solid album yet.  Yes, it does have it's share of slower stuff at times, but just give it two or three listens before you say it is not good and give it a one star review. As a NIN fan for the last ten years , I know I am going to enjoy this album for a long time to come.
B00005JM20|2.0|This movie was funny and interesting for the first five minutes, and from that moment it was just a steady downward spiral towards boredom and redundancy.<br /><br />Besides, Rowan Atkinson doesn't make the sexiest of hero's to fall in love with as he smashes into the wrong buildings, and constantly bumbles around destroy 'covert' operations.<br /><br />I expected more, but for once the trailer was funnier than the movie, and frankly, thats never a good thing. You'd rather sit and watch the trailer three times over than spend uninteresting time over the whole movie.<br /><br />For children maybe this would be interesting, but not for us that expect more out of a film. Quite a letdown, because I waited a long time to see this movie come out to DVD.<br /><br />I think my heart is breaking.....no wait....nevermind, that was just my eyelids flickering open for a brief moment.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Napoleon Dynamite, starring Jon Heder as the title character, is a comedy that is completely reliant upon \\"This is so stupid it's funny.\\"  Now I consider myself something of a stupid-humor connoisseur, laughing (and laughing frequently no less) at movies like BASEketball, Dumb and Dumber, Scary Movie, There's Something About Mary, etc.  However, the difference between those movies and Napoleon Dynamite is that those movies make attempts at a plot, or at least a clothesline to hang jokes on, and they set up their jokes.  In most comedies there is a set-up and a punchline, and the audience laughs.  In Napoleon Dynamite, there's only stupidity, and the audience is expected to laugh regardless.<br /><br />It would be one thing if the movie at least bounced all over the place, so that even if a viewer like myself found some parts of it dry then at least there would be other sprinklings of humor to choose from.  Unfortunately, the movie also finds repetition funny.  Napoleon saying \\"Gosh!\\" ad nauseum or his uncle repeating over and over that \\"if Coach would have put me 4th quarter we'd'a been state champions for sure\\" is not humor.  At least the uncle gets credit for being remotely animated, as most of the characters- Napoleon, his brother, Pedro, and Deb speak in monotones for almost all of the movie.  Again, this is apparently funny.<br /><br />Unless you like 90 minutes of stupid sketch comedy (with no plot that's is exactly what the movie feels like) then avoid this film.  Unless of course you need to know phrases like \\"I caught you a delicious bass\\" to make conversation with middle school boys. 4/10
1573223085|3.0|Got an MBA? Passed the MCAT with flying colors? You're in a profession that requires analytical skills, a logical mind, where numbers prevail and where dry thinking is common practice? So you the accountant, the engineer (well, let's label you the \\"left-brained\\" --&agrave; la Daniel Pink), you thought the future was yours? Dryly said, think again! According to Daniel Pink, whose book is entertaining and whose thesis is partially valid, it's not just your left or your right brain; it's your whole brain that matters. So no half-brained please, but if you can't help it, you'd better be right-brained because the future will most likely belong to them; those who are empathic, holistic, and can see the big picture. You see? Nice tag along Daniel Goleman's emotional intelligence theory, which could be grossly summarized by: your I.Q. will get you the job you want, but your I.Q. will be insufficient. It's your E.Q. (emotional intelligence, a right-brain activity) that will determine how well you'll do at that job. So leave a piece of your I.Q. in the cloakroom and put on your social-empathic hat or you may schlep to that same desk until you're fired or laid off, boldly said.<br /><br />Fair enough; Pink's book may help persuade left-brained business leaders that they need to change their approach to managing their companies. It may also help them become more right-brained since the author offers some tools and resources in the \\"portfolio\\" sections of the book. You have to exercise your creativity. Get the picture?<br /><br />However, after reading this book, readers who are in search of 'excellence', who want to work their brain more evenly, may still be looking for tools. In other words, how do people actually make their right brain work more? Or even more pertinent: how do they get more... whole-brained? Probably not something you can get at your nearby grocery store. Since we're talking about shopping, I thought I would use a clich&eacute; to make a point:  success is not just about doing things 'right', it's also about doing the right thing and Mr. Pink isn't depicting a very rose picture: many of the author's examples, drawings, and photographs depict white males, which make you question whether the author's thesis can be applied to women. A book inclusive of gender dis/similarities, if any, would have been insightful. But that's a Whole New (kind of) Mind, mind you.
B000929AJQ|4.0|on the surface this albulm sounds ..poppy..almost made to quick even though it took 5 to 6 years to come out. <br /> <br />on my first listen to this cd i was not only amazed i was totaly dissapointed..because i hyped myself up for this album to be something like : the fragile meets Broken. broken being one of my all time favorite ep's EVER. this album just doesnt have the hatred or the overpowering energy of Broken. what it does have is some of the most powerfull lyrics i have heard in my lifetime. ill go by track and describe what i get <br /> <br />1 all the love in the world : what can i say..so depresssingly true to those of us that have been in a rut where you feel like noone loves you and somone has all the love in the world..it explains itself...but we hide it so much this is still a slap in the face <br /> <br />2 you know what you are : this track is one of the harder tracks. its really good and is to the point <br /> <br />3 the collecter : just simply amazing. slightly not about 1 thing but about a collection of little things...good title for it to <br /> <br />4  the hand that feeds : the worst track on this album..and its the single..this is the dissapointment song..but its more a statement against religion/politics interloping..them biting the hand that feeds them <br /> <br />5 love is not enough : 1 word AMAZING <br /> <br />6 Every day is the same: if you cant relate to this song then i dont know how you could relate to anything nin has made in the last 3 albums..and thats about all i have to say <br /> <br />7 With Teeth : hard yet soft..a soft song..With Teeth (pun intended) got to love how trent (and i hope everyone knows that trent reznor is Nine Inch Nails although he does get help everyting is done by him pretty much) says With teeth <br /> <br />8 only : the most painfull song on the album...most people blame others for thier pain ie. girlfriend breaks up w/ you and they have hurt you. this song makes it....the hurt faul \\"i just made you upto hurt myself..and it worked\\" and the line \\"there is no you there is only me\\" GREAT SONG <br /> <br />9 Getting smaller: nice song...not the worst not the greatest..has a popish beat to it..but trents lyrics rip it from pops dead hands <br /> <br />10 sunspots : very painfull song <br /> <br />11 the line begins to blur : great song stands out..but not sure why <br /> <br />12 Beside you in time : quitesentialy the \\"great below\\" of this album ..kinda similar to me..but not lyricly or musicly..just..the feeling of the songs really <br /> <br />13 right where it belongs : ends the album on an excelent note...that everything is right where it belongs...~,~ <br /> <br /> <br />remember now..you need to LISTEN to this music..and dont EXPECT anything just listen
B0007GAERG|1.0|This is my second review because I have read all the reviews done after mine and cannot believe all the 5 stars!!  Obviously, most music listeners of this CD don't have a very good ear.  I have to agree with the negative reviews.  Sorry, but there are about 6 or 7 reviews (like my original review) that hit the mark.  Listen to her unplugged and then this...you don't hear the problem?  She goes from whispers to high shrieking.  No in between notes.  Again, she should have stopped that super high stuff when she began to lose her voice at the end of the 90's.  That's what did her in.  It was always a little annoying anyway, and I think her fans would not have missed it!  I can only assume what other honest reviewers are saying is true...that all of these 5 stars are from record companies or paid reviewers.  Anyone with half a brain and a taste for really good vocals can see thru this like a window.  I'm sure this review will (again) be buried by a deluge of 5 star reviews from people without any music tastes.
B0007KTBIU|4.0|When \\"Pocahontas\\" was first released in theatres 10 years ago (damn I'm getting old!), I was still in my \\"everything Disney is good\\" phase and I bought the companion soundtrack to the movie.  My favorite song from was the CD was \\"If I Never Knew You,\\" sung by Jon Secada and Shanice, but I was curious as to why it was on the soundtrack when it wasn't in the movie.  Well a couple of years ago when \\"Pocahontas\\" aired on ABC's Wonderful World of Disney, they showed the deleted scene where Mel Gibson sings the song in the film.  It was wonderful.  I was so disappointed that the filmmakers chose to cut that scene because the song is great and it adds an emotional resonance that most critics accused the film of lacking.  (The scene occurs the night before John Smith's scheduled execution when Pocahontas goes to visit him.)  I was further disappointed when \\"Pocahontas\\" was released on DVD and Mel's song wasn't on it.  Well, ten years later, Disney finally got a clue and we'll actually get to see and hear the song in the context of the movie.  Granted \\"Pocahontas\\" doesn't compare to \\"The Lion King\\" or \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" but 10 years later it's still alive and kicking.  If you enjoyed the movie then, you'll more than appreciate Mel's musical contribution to the film now.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Sadly, its not. The new Nine Inch Nails is definitley more organic, which is what Reznor promised. The drums, the keys, vocals, everything sounds more live. NIN in 2005 is actually more of a \\"Band\\" than an expanded one-man project that it used to be. Dave Grohl's drumming is pretty good I guess, it's solid anyway. I'll tell you right off the bat, if you loved Nine Inch Nails mostly for the heavy, loud, grating aspect they once had, then you will be disappointed with this release a little...you just will. If you, like me, like NIN for the lush melodies, cool drums patterns and an overall dark ambient/heavy feel then you will probably like this album. I will admit it is most definitley not Trent's best offering...fans will attest. There is a prominent 80's funky feel throughout the album. However, this is NOT in anyway the same style as Pretty Hate Machine, With Teeth actually expands on that style. I'm not doing a stupid track by track review b/c everyone's opinions are different anyway, but the best songs that exemplify the new Nine Inch Nails sound is Only, Every Day Is Exactly The Same, and Getting Smaller. Definitley a retro feel going on here. The whole album is mostly bass-driven which is totally new for NIN. The guitar is there but its not as prominent as the bass. This combined with some warm, mellow keys thoughout makes this album very low and thunderous, while still being very melodic. Even though its not as dark as all the other albums, it sure as hell isnt all kisses in the sunset. This is just me, but I did notice some songs just seemed to meld together towards the end of the album...I couldnt tell where one song ended and another began unless I was looking at the track number on the cd player. The album is less-varied towards the end but still an entertaining listen, especially for Sunspots. That song is awesome. Sunspots sounds like old school NIN, with the throbbing low bass and the anthem-like guitar chord changes. Think Reptile, but updated. Take note when you listen to With Teeth that even the heaviest tracks on the album(You Know What You Are & Getting Smaller) arent even that heavy! There is little to no screaming on this release. But it's still good. The only thing this album lacks compared to past releases is the anger. The dark, anger-induced lyrics that made past songs like Big Man With A Gun and Wish so heavy and gritty are not on this album. Nine Inch Nails intensity hasn't backed down, but Trent isn't angry anymore. I would most definitley recommend With Teeth to any Nine Inch Nails fans b/c without it, your collection is incomplete. I do recommend it to fans of rock music and industrial heads as well. It is definitley worth listening to repeatedly just like the other records. Just remember: This is far from a \\"masterpiece\\". Trent has had several of those already and has chose to release a more straight-forward album. Why not? This is the best way I can sum up the new NIN album. You decide.

B000929AJQ|1.0|Man, what a waste of time waiting for this one.  I love NIN, but this is more like a depressing slow song cd. And when the songs do begin to get heavy (which are few and far between) they sound like they should be on the top 40 pop countdown.  I was extremely dissapointed by this cd.  I know it is hard to try to create another one like the downward spiral, but with as much time that he worked on this one it should have been pretty close to it.  Sorry Trent but you really let me down!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLKN|2.0|Although Red Dragon is closer to the storyline of the book, it did not have the haunting eerieness of Manhunter.  The only thing Red Dragon had going for it was Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector.  Edward Norton played Will Graham in Red Dragon and I have to say he was not very convincing.  It was orginally played by William Petersen of the series CSI and he was much more believeable and tangent as the FBI investigator.  Edward Norton seemed way out of his element.  I'm not saying that Red Dragon is a bad movie.....it's just not as good or as creepy as Manhunter.
B0007DAZW8|1.0|I've been a fan since the beginning and even followed the duos side projects on Crydamoure and Roul.   This has to be some of the most hollow and soulless music they've ever done.  It's extremely repetitive even for electronic music.    All the signature Daft Punk sounds are there, but they lack  the proper song structure that would make them really catchy tunes.    In other words, they lack an intro, verse, chorus, breakdown section, and outro.  The majority of the songs go right into the verse or a chorus and repeat over and over until the end of the song.  There aren't any hooks that make you want to hum the tune all day.  It's just too boring and repetitive.  You don't even need a lyric, just a nice bass line would do.  I am convinced that they know how to make a good song, so I'm not sure why they moved in this direction with their style of music.   Maybe they did it just to be anti-pop, but I don't care for it at all. <br /> <br />Don

B000001GK9|5.0|Mahler's Ninth Symphony is arguably both his most deeply moving and his most enigmatic. It is as if Mahler was looking back on his own life through a distorting musical mirror, seeing moments of peace and struggle along the way. (The first movement of the Ninth is all about that struggle, with peace eventually winning out.) But then, as the final quiet notes slowly die away, Mahler seems to have looked forward and accepted his impending death. In death, he finally finds a kind of spiritual peace.    Lest that sound a bit too self-consciously poetic for some, I defy you to come away from this classic recording of Mahler's Ninth and not see it in a similar way---and not be deeply moved.    At the very least, Herbert von Karajan, in this live 1982 recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, shows that the Ninth is not merely a tragic utterance. Leonard Bernstein often interpreted this valedictory symphony as personal tragedy; thus, in his final Royal Concertgebouw recording of the Ninth, he stretched that final Adagissimo nearly to the breaking point, as if he felt Mahler could not bear to let those notes go. As usual with the charismatic Bernstein, the sheer intensity of the performance---and that Concertgebouw Ninth sure was intense, especially the drawn-out concluding Adagio---disarms criticism. But, as Herbert von Karajan convincingly proves with this performance, it may not be the whole story as far as Mahler's Ninth is concerned. In Karajan's interpretation of the Adagio, there is nobility to go along with the sadness, and, as performed gloriously by the Berlin Philharmonic, it is equally moving.    Karajan may not be everybody's idea of the ideal Mahler conductor. Those who learned Mahler's Ninth through Bernstein's numerous recordings might miss the expressive freedom Bernstein brought to his performances. Karajan is more content on securing beauty of sound and maintaining the musical line than necessarily transforming lives through music. But while Bernstein perhaps is a little insistent on presenting the music in a certain way, Karajan allows the music and its underlying emotions to speak for itself. And while some might argue that Mahler was never much of a subtle composer---and I wouldn't wholly disagree with that---Karajan's more modest approach still manages to pay dividends in this performance. It may not always sound like Mahler (or, at least, Bernstein's popular supercharged vision of Mahler), but it is hardly as emotionally sterile as some of its critics have made it out to be. Listen, for example, to the bitter intensity the Berlin Philharmonic brings to the work's demonic third movement; surprisingly, for all its technical perfection, it never sounds merely careful. And those strings in the final Adagio---what heartbreaking beauty!     This 1982 recording of Mahler's Ninth may not be the only one you'll want to hear---Bernstein is almost never easily dismissed in Mahler, especially in his recording of the Ninth, which he saw as one of Mahler's central works, a work for our troubled times. But Karajan's noble interpretation is just as valid as Bernstein's tragic view; it is, indeed, powerful in its own way. Recommended.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Rating: A <br />While it could be argued that although Nine Inch Nails previous efforts was one of those albums that took repeated listens to actually grasp, and completely love, it was not as wholeheartedly received by the NIN's community as well as say The Downward Spiral. However, upon the first listen to NIN's groundbreaking new album With Teeth, all naysayers and doubters are swept underneath the carpet, as not only does mastermind Trent Reznor accomplish what he set out to do, he has bit back (pun intended) with the ferocity, that causes you to listen intently from the beginning, until the all too soon end. The album opens with All the Love in the World, a gripping song that builds tempo and pace slowly, and leads gracefully into You Know What You Are with Dave Grohls pounding drums, and Reznors ferocious lyrics letting you know that NIN is not going soft on you. Throughout the album Reznor applies his trademark sound to each song, even shifting his focus slightly away with the eccentricly placed Only, which shows those Linkin Park boys how to make a catchy tune without sacrificing lyrics or the chorus in the process. Other Standout tracks are The Line Begins to Blur, and the Final two songs Beside You in Time, and Right Where it Belongs.  Both tracks are excellent closers to the album, and offer a variety of insights into Reznor's frame of mind while recording this album. Structured more like Pretty Hate Machine, in terms of how each song exists unto itself, but with the tendency to blend songs together much like The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, this is probably NIN's most accesible album yet, though not their best, although repeated listens , and time will only help the album grow on me. An excellent album that cannot be missed out on, every track is excellent, and just shows you that NIN never left rock, Reznor just needed to give it a good kick in the @ss.
B0007WZUMO|1.0|Ugh, I don't know what to say other than \\"What happened to NIN?\\" If you're anything like me, you'll be sorely disappointed by this album. If you're a big fan of pop tracks mixed in with a bunch of \\"brutal\\" underproduced songs then maybe you'll like it... a bit.

By the way the Dual Disc format gives this CD such a whallop, that songs like The Line Begins toBlur, and You Know What You Are become even more pulse pounding experiences, as your head just trys to wrap around how damned good thi album really is. So where's the DualDisc release of Pretty Hate Machine we've all been clamoring for. Just Kidding, Reznor outdid himself this year, and I can't wait to see these songs performed live. <br />

B0007GAERG|3.0|I am in between with this one...Mariah is great, but has tendencies to make dumb songs.  Most artists would sell their souls to have a voice like Mariah's, yet she wastes on silly butterfly and unicorn filled songs.  The only track on this album with any substance is \\"We Belong Together\\".  It's the only song that sounds real, the rest of the CD is jumbled mess; for example, what is the point of the song with Nelly?  The lyrics are a joke! I am from Missouri, so I usually rep. Nelly, but not today.  I was hoping that she would emancipate her voice from the dumb songs of past albums, but her voice is still being held captive underneath all the glitter, blonde extensions and butterfly mood rings.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's game is probably the best science fiction story that I have read. Whatever you do, don't let anyone tell you how it ends. I hope that there is a movie before long.
B000929AJQ|4.0|We've hit the five-year mark, so it's NIN time.  In this chapter, Trent Reznor builds on what we've heard in \\"The Fragile\\" and \\"Broken\\" and continues to weave the David Bowie thread throughout the songs.  Dave Grohl (Nirvana/Foo Fighters/Killing Joke) replaces Chris Vrenna on drums.  Grohl's drumming only makes an album better; it's like putting Rip Torn in a comedy film. <br /> <br />\\"All The Love in The World\\" starts out quiet and builds in layers, showcasing Reznor's singing.  Instead of jumping out and grabbing you, this songs draws you in.  Honest to God, the second half has elements of '70s Philly Soul music. <br /> <br />\\"You Know What You Are?\\" is a cross between \\"Starf*****s Inc.\\" and David Bowie's \\"I'm Afraid of Americans\\".  In case you're worried that Reznor has mellowed with age...don't. <br /> <br />\\"The Collector\\" is standard \\"Fragile\\"-era NIN, mid-tempo and laced with piano. <br /> <br />\\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is a *shade* more industrial than it is disco.  This song is all about the rhythm section groove - a guaranteed dancefloor hit. <br /> <br />\\"Love Is Not Enough\\" is a good example of the more stripped-down approach of this release.  The piano and distorted guitars are still in the game, but there's a LOT less of the ambient dread that filled \\"The Downward Spiral\\". <br /> <br />Frankly, I'd like \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" as the radio single.  Awesome, especially if you like A Perfect Circle. <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\" is one of the weaker tracks, along with the even MORE disco-ish \\"Only\\". <br /> <br />\\"Getting Smaller\\" yanks the disc back into high gear with a shot of punk.  Debate amongst yourselves... <br /> <br />\\"Sunspots\\" reminds me of NIN's cover of Joy Division's \\"Dead Souls\\", with a good snarly bassline. <br /> <br />\\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" reminds us that in Reznor's world, entropy is king.  His trademark distortion on the instruments and queasy harmonies are back in full effect. <br /> <br />\\"Beside You in Time\\" has a slow, hypnotic minimalism that harkens to John Lennon or This Mortal Coil.   <br /> <br />The cheering crowd in \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" reinforces the vibe of disconnection from people.  In this song, Reznor isn't the voice of a generation, but of a resignation (Rezignation?).  This has always been his strong point as a lyricist, and the lyrics do not deviate an inch from what he's always addressed. <br /> <br />These songs don't bleed together enough for a \\"concept album\\" feel, but the variety does yield more catchy hooks and a tighter, cleaner sound than I've ever heard from NIN.  Reznor has gone back to his roots, dug them up and poured concrete.  The things that make NIN what it is manage to break through to the surface.  The Way Out Is Through, indeed.
B00003CXCT|4.0|What I cleary mean about being good or bad, is if you prefer having such updates in the movie and if that alone is good or bad. <br />I personally don't care for most of the updates that were done. However, on one side note, some feel more like Star Wars I & II. <br />Is that good or bad? We may love Star Wars I-II and IV-VI, but not IV-VI if it feels more like I & II? <br />I guess that's the only way I look at it to like the new updates. <br />I-III gave us one sort of feel to the films, and IV-VI gave us another, so having IV-VI to be like I-III may disturb some of us. <br />I would of course prefer THE ORIGINAL film, the way it was done the first time with widescreen, but these will have to do. <br />I did however, save the originals with the THX and Widescreen on VHS. <br />The bit that I don't like, is that George Lucas did say \\"original\\" on DVD. <br />Other than that, and some minor changes, you have it restored on DVD, able to even play it on the PC. <br />Overall, 4 stars. 5 if they were the original, or at least having George Lucas say it's the updated version.
B000929AJQ|5.0|A great surprise! A lot of people seem keen on the idea of passing over this album. But to do so, would be a huge mistake. <br /> <br />This is a step in the right direction for NIN, as there is less obscenity, and more beauty. Admit it, that was one of the things you liked most about NIN to begin with were songs like \\"Hurt,\\" (which is now beat by Right Where it Belongs) rather than say \\"Starf*ckers.\\"  This album has excellent drumming from Dave Grohl, and it only adds to the energy of the album. Do not be a cynic, (even if you haven't liked their stuff in the past) this is a very different NIN release, in a very good way. <br /> <br />This is my favorite NIN release so far. (I enjoy it more than TDS and The Fragile.)
B0008ISM40|5.0|Wow, has it been five years since Fragile.  Trent has not missed a beat, this is typical NIN.  once you put the disc in, you'll never look back. Trent should have called this Pretty Hate Machine II, and that's not a bad thing.  This will be the best cd of 2005, nothing has let me down.  This is the first cd i bought in five years, lol.
B00005QEO1|1.0|This album has not put up on me at all. This album had too many <br />songs that have screaming and yelling in it. Aerosmith were totally better in the 70's. The reason I got this album is because Janie's Got a Gun was one of my favorite songs of all time. Other than that, the songs were just YELLING, SCREAMING, <br />& totally worse. Dire Straits are better because Mark Knopfler <br />has a much better voice than any other band. This album is just <br />as bad as Appetite for Destruction, & Use Your Illusion I. Don't <br />buy this album, buy Dire Straits albums insted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0156027321|5.0|Early on in Life of Pi this book reads very slow and is a boring book that is very tempting to just put down, but if you can read past the 100 page mark you will find a truly inspiring book about survival on the open seas.  I think that Yann Martel did a great job putting just the right amount of fiction and seemingly non- fiction into this book. While some parts are unbelievable some could happen at any time and this balance makes this book a winner.    <br /> The book starts out in India where Pi's dad owns a zoo that supports the family.  During his time in India Pi becomes very religious and ends up worshipping to three religions at the same time, much to the disappointment of the various religious leaders that he was involved.   Then because of various situations that arise the family decides to move to Canada along with many of the animals which they have grown so very fond of.  When their boat sinks and Pi finds out that he is the only survivor. He must fight with loosing his entire family, and much to his horror his little life boat is full of animals, many of which are very dangerous and as the story progresses kill each other off until Pi is left with just Richard Parker a full grown male Bengal tiger.  As they travel the open seas for more than 200 days they  have to rely on each other to survive.   <br /> This book while started out slow defiantly picks up after the first 100 or so pages and then be prepared to read it through in one sitting because it gets very gripping.  This is a great book for beginner and advanced readers alike, being just the right length and flowing nicely.  I would recommend this book to the whole family although very young readers should stay away because of some graphic scenes but other than that this book is for everyone.
B00005JNQ8|4.0|MOVIE:<br /><br />This movie can best be compared to the recent remake of The Manchurian Candidate, except that this movie is actually relevent to events occuring in the world. The film centers around two main characters, an interpreter and a Secret Service agent. Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter who accidentally overhears an assassination plot to kill the dictator of a fictitous African country. Sean Penn plays the agent sent to investigate the case. What follows is a movie that focuses mainly on the action rather than the story.  Yes, we do get the troubled pasts of the two characters, but it's really the past of Kidman's characters that matters, because it is her that Sean Penn suspects as being a lier.  The film has a lot of political mumbo jumbo that I won't get into, but it's not all stuff that will bore you, it will only bore you if I write about it now.  There's really not much I can talk about because the film relys on tension building and what the audience doesn't know.  All I can say that it is a very intelligent and well made thriller.  James Newton Howard's score adds to the tension, and he borrows some of Zimmer's African vocals at the end which I really enjoyed.  I loved the ending to this movie, there was a real sense of closure, something very rare in films today.  It doesn't end right after the climax peaks, no silly one line from the main character and a fade to black, but an actual end that closes the film. I liked it, some points were slow, but Syndey Pollack handled it well.<br /><br />ACTING: Sean Penn was great, Nicole Kidman was not.  I really thought Kidman's acting was stale, she had the same tone of voice throughout the entire film, she never changed her tone of voice. Sean Penn on the other hand shows that he deserved the Oscar, his acting was very emotional and very real. Everyone working here is a veteran in the film industry, the result is a professional and intelligent result.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Tense moments, very satisfying ending. A great thriller from a great filmmaker, with great acting for the most part. It's not stupid, you won't ask questions, no real plot holes. Just plain movie fun.nding. A great thriller from a great filmmaker, with great acting for the most part. It's not stupid, you won't ask questions, no real plot holes. Just plain movie fun. <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|this is a great album. the only track i did not like is forgotten. the rest are fabulous. the one track i LOVE is probably he wasnt or fall to pieces. its a tie =) everyone else is being so mean to avril. they dont know her. she is a great album. this is my scale 9.2/10
B000929AJQ|5.0|I am a huge Nine Inch Nails fan, so of course I am going to like what ever he releases.  When I first heard With Teeth the whole way through, I have to admit, my first reaction was, \\"eh\\". I wasn't impressed and I wasn't disappointed.  I have now listened to it all the way through about 6 times and am starting to realize it's brilliance.  It is an acquired taste, just like The Fragile was. I actually like this better than The Fragile. There are atleast 6 really good songs, and 5 good songs and 2 songs that are skipable. That's not too shabby, What else can you ask for in an album?  There will never be another Downward Spiral, so people need to stop expecting one.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen are all brilliant actors and Mike Nichols almost always directs films that last forever in their emotional depth. (Check out his resume). Patrick Marber wrote the original stage play and it almost makes me want to seek it out in its truest form, as this film brought out nothing in me other than cynicism and dismay. In fact, the main emotional themes seem to be neurotic passion, heartbreak, sadness, anger, evil vengeance, pathetic pleading, deception, and honesty to the point of brutality. Some may find this an interesting exploration of emotions mixed with complex personalities in confusing circumstances. Some call this entertainment, but I think all involved could have done much better. This is a very personal film and one that can only be interpreted by the viewer. I found it very, very bleak.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Once again, Trent Reznor has proved that he can do anything, be it a heavy face melter, or a catchy pop track. With Teeth is surely one of the best NIN albums, all the perfect blend of songs fast and slow, and Dave Grohl kicks some major ass on those drums. I can see this album winning awards...
B0007YMUZW|4.0|I began by liking Adams with the few Whiskeytown tracks I've heard -- 16 Days & whatnot -- then went through a faze of being annoyed by \\"New York, New York\\" because it was so ubiquitous in the fall and winter of 2001/2002 & had so many connotations.  Also was pretty aware that he had a pretty strong Paul Westerberg fixation, and whenever I would hear this guy I would just get hungry to put in Stereo or maybe Tim...  I pretty much dismissed him & never thought I'd listen again with any particular enthusiasm.   <br /> <br />So a couple of weeks ago I was listening to the random copy of \\"Love is Hell pt. 1\\" that I had aquired and was delighted to learn that it was a meditation on just the thing that had kinda turned me off...  and it was actually rather a brilliant collection (or make that partial collection as I hadn't bothered with pt. 2) of sad, wintry, meditative songs about NYC the winter after the Towers got hit.  The terrorism aspect never enters into it, at least as far as I can discern, there's nothing exploitative there, it just seems to be a bunch of songs about falling out of love during a sucky winter in NY (so you are enjoined to seek out that / those discs).  Suffice to say I went out and picked up Pt. 2 immediately.   <br /> <br />When I read a review on the Boston Globe today of this 2 CD set, I made a special trip to pick it up and have spent the last hour and a half listening to it straight through, which in and of itself should be considered praise, because I usually don't have the patience for such a listening session with a new CD.  It takes me a little while to find the mood of the peice and to make the associations that either put the record into my head or put it on the path to the local used record store.  I'm still not completely sure where I am with this one, but it has a number of really nice tunes and most likely will stick with me.   <br /> <br />It's a pastiche (which I am given to understand is a common RA MO) of early seventies folk rock -- several of the songs have titles remeniscent of Grateful Dead songs, and there's also a strong tinge of Neil Young.  I listened to Young's On The Beach right after this and found OTB to be very similar, though a much better CD,  Which is the problem with pastiche.  Young is shooting from the hip, Adams is being mannered.  Young covers a lot more sonic and emotional territory in his eight songs than Adams does in more than twice that many.   <br /> <br />As I say, I like this collection of songs so far, and I am gonna let it grow on me some more.  I am excited that there's a younger artist out there exploring this sort of expansive, melodic, song-based rock, and I have a nagging suspicion that Ryan Adams is going to blow us all away in a year or two, once he gets past the sort of facile work he's been doing for the last couple of years and *really* digs deep.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|Fine film let down by the well-below par Gerard Butler, who has absolutely zero charisma.  And what happened to the Phantoms face?!  He is meant to be a grotesque - that's the whole point of the exercise - yet this guy is a Calvin Klein model under his mask!  Emmy Rossum is very sweet and has a fine voice for one so young and it's a shame she is let down by such a poor leading man.  You only have to see the rather fleeting glimpse of Michael Crawford in the documentary section and the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.  That's how it should be done.
B000929AJQ|3.0|There is really nothing bad to say about this album.  Its not good.  Its not bad.  Its just there, which is why I am dissapointed with this release. <br /> <br />I started listening to NIN during the Downward Spiral era.  That album took a while to grow on me, but once I got it, I really got it, and I couldn't stop listening to it for months.  Even now, I listen to the recording quite often.   <br /> <br />Then I went back to Pretty Hate machine.  I loved it.  Great album, awesome lyrics, awesome songs.  Nothing bad to say.  I was too young to enjoy the real experience of that time, but I felt like I could understand it. <br /> <br />Now the real time for me was when The Fragile came out.  I loved the build up to the release of this album.  The NIN website was updated almost everyday with new pictures, teasers, etc.  After it was released, they updated their page with tour photos, reviews, videos, etc.  I love the album, I played it 2 or 3 times a day.  I just loved Trent for making awesome music and lyrics that just went straight to your heart.  You knew he was bleeding out emotion when he screamed the lyrics on earlier releases. <br /> <br />Now.  He's just going through the motions.  There is no intesnsity, there is no emotion.  The screams are there, the haunting whispers are there, but it means nothing anymore.  I saw them live at Coachella, and while Trent and company ALWAYS put on an awesome show, I just couldn't help but feel that this is something that he doesn't want to be doing anymore. <br /> <br />In the past I could feel Trent's energy through his albums, through his website, and of course through his live performances.  Now it just feels like a greatest hits band.  This album is not cohesive at all like other releases.  Just a collection of OK songs that will appeal to a younger NIN audience and soccer moms. <br /> <br />Dont get me wrong.  Alright album.  Nothing like the emotional stab to my heart everytime I heard another great NIN album for the first time.  I hope that Trent can regain the drive he felt earlier, but I think that most of the time, when its gone, its gone. <br /> <br />I will always treasure the old releases though and I wish trent and company the best.   <br /> <br />
B0007TKH66|5.0|I have been a faithful watcher of the Star Trek series from the absolute beginning - thru the cartoon series, dozens of books, on to the TOS movies, and finally the several TV offerings & ST:tNG movies.  I have loved all of them for various reasons and to varying degrees.  What all the TV series had in common was a relatively slow start picking up with Season 4 (excepting, of course, TOS which started strong and ran out of steam towards the end).  Bottom line, \\"Enterprise\\" is superior in every respect to all of the previous offerings.  It's a shame it won't get past Season 4.  But I'll take what I can get - Season 1 being no exception.  I'll miss you Star Trek and shame on UPN for abandoning ship.  No wonder the network itself is sinking.  Anybody from Sci-Fi Channel (Universal & NBC - the original home of Trek) listening?  Paramount - how about some movies from any of the series, but especially, from Enterprise...?
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python is one of those things people think is incredibly funny - or incredibly stupid. I fall into the incredibly funny camp. This film still makes me laugh so hard I almost pee my pants. I think you can tell a lot about a person by asking them what is their favorite line from the movie. Mine: \\"Watery tarts handing out swords is no basis for a system of government.\\"<br /><br />I only wish that they had restored the film for this supposedly deluxe special edition. The picture is still as washed out and grainy as I remember it from the late-late show.
B0007OASII|5.0|This is a wonderful album. I have been a fan of kamelot since the release of karma and have watched the band's musical growth. The Black Halo is their best release to date. Each and every musical aspect is fine-tuned to perfection.  The vocals and melodies are wonderful and the guitars are harder. With songs like \\"March of Mephisto\\", \\"The Haunting\\", and \\"Abandoned\\" this album displays the true passion of Kamelot's power metal perfection.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. I KEPT WAITING FOR IT TO <br />GET BETTER. <br />JULIA ROBERTS SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO HAVE HER NAME <br />ATTACHED TO IT. <br />IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN.
B00005JNTV|5.0|I think Miller likes to take things to the next levels and be extreme. In an interview I read he liked the works of Ayn Rand, and her novel the Fountainhead. The character of Howard Roark in the novel is echoed in the villianous Roark characters in Sin City. I think Miller is commenting on free will taken to the extreme and shows the negative side of this in his work of Sin City. Where as Rand is optimistic, Miller is the pessimist. In a world where film noir is taken to the next level, Politics and Religious figures take advantage of their power and commit sexual acts without remorse. (...) Where everyone is pretty much the antihero and where men become caricatures of a film noir hero, our heroes have become bad and the antiheroes have to run wild exacting proper justice. Even the action in the work becomes a little ridiculous because I think Miller is caricaturing the world and shows us that this film noir world is extreme and extreme action must be taken and sometimes this is ridiculous. Miller is showing us the evolution of the film noir and that means, taken to the extreme, being a man means to be brutish lug who slap around helpless females. He is showing their evolution of their negative nature right? But the white light is love in this ying yang relationship in film noir, that is worth fighting for.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Its not that all of todays music sucks, its that all of todays popular music sucks!  IT wasn't always that way. <br /> <br />I've always loved Zep and placed them somewhere in the highest of the high of the real rock gods from the decade known as the 1970's(music has been going steadily downhill since and mostly the fault of the business itself that insists on shooting itself in the foot)I've always felt they were right in there with the Stones, BEatles, Floyd, Hendrix as the best of the best.  After seeing this though my feelings have changed.  Led Zepplin is on another level.  Rock music just does not get better than this.  One look and listen to the \\"Ocean\\" and I was floored.  There has never been a cooler song performance than this and thats just the start.  Page and Plant are Gods but I want to also sing the praises of Jones and Bonham who are just as great and essential to whats going on.  Musically its just 3 guys and it is powerful beyond compare.  If you love real Rock then this is the place to start.
B000929AJQ|3.0|This album is very different from other nin stuff and I can't decide whether that is good or not. I enjoy it, but not the same way that I enjoy TDS and the Fragile. To me it feels more like a remix album than a straight studio album. There are moments listening to it when I think \\"this is really good\\" but then there are also moments when I just want to skip the track. Who knows maybe it will grow on me...
B000002AVF|3.0|Mariah's first CD, \\"Mariah Carey\\", was basically full of safe ballads that showcased her vocals.  With Mariah, Columbia had found a female singer to rival Arista's Whitney Houston.  Her 2nd CD, \\"Emotions\\", was a drastic improvement.  Instead of suffering the Sophomore jinx, she grew as an artist with the rollicking title cut, the inspirational \\"Make it Happen\\" and the emotional \\"Can't Let Go\\". <br /> <br />Following hot on the heals of that release was the \\"MTV Unplugged\\" EP which gave us her fantastic remake with Trey Lorenz of \\"I'll be There\\".  The next full studio album, \\"Music Box\\", took a few steps backward into Whitney Houston territory with the rather bland \\"Hero\\", although \\"Dreamlover\\", \\"Anytime You Need a Friend\\" and her cover of \\"Without You\\" saved this album from being a total yawn. <br /> <br />We'll skip over \\"Merry Christmas\\" and come to her next release, this CD, \\"Daydream\\".  Some of the reviews have referred to this being the CD where Mariah moved away from AC and into R&B.  If so, the results were certainly mixed.  Here is a track by track review: <br /> <br />The first cut, \\"Fantasy\\", is easily the best song on the album.  It is bouncy and fun and harkens back to \\"Emotions\\".   <br /> <br />\\"Underneath the Stars\\" is also a nice, breezy song.  It reminds of Minnie Riperton's \\"Loving You\\".  This should have been a single instead of \\"Always be my Baby\\". <br /> <br />Her duet with Boyz II Men, \\"One Sweet Day\\", was a huge success. However, the song was overplayed so much during that time, that I would be happy to never hear it again during this lifetime. <br /> <br />If you are going to cover a song like Journey's \\"Open Arms\\", you need to do something extraordinary with it.  Despite her vocal prowess, Mariah does nothing to improve over the original.  After having hit cover version with \\"I'll be There\\" and \\"Without You\\", I assume the record company was looking for another hit cover song.  Wisely, they chose not to release this as a single. <br /> <br />\\"Always be my Baby\\" has got to be one of Mariah's most boring, safe singles.  It reminds me of Madonna's \\"True Blue\\" (which was one of Madonna's most boring, safe singles). <br /> <br />\\"I am Free\\" is a dull attempt at gospel. <br /> <br />\\"When I Saw You\\" is another safe, bland, Whitney-esque ballad.   <br /> <br />\\"Long Ago\\" has a funky vibe.  The song is still a little boring, but at least Mariah is starting to loosen up a bit with this tune. <br /> <br />\\"Melt Away\\" has Babyface's fingerprints all over it.  Babyface has worked magic for singers over the years (Madonna's \\"Take a Bow\\", Eric Clapton's \\"Change the World\\", etc), but this is not one of his better efforts. <br /> <br />\\"Forever\\" once again takes us back to the AC bombastic ballad category.    <br /> <br />\\"Daydream Interlude\\" gives Mariah her first shot at being a dancefloor diva.  Her songs have certainly been remixed over the years for dancefloors, but this was the first time she included a dance remix on a studio album.  A definite high point of this CD.  Oddly enough, dance mixes tend to be longer tunes, and this is the shortest song on the CD. <br /> <br />\\"Looking In\\" is actually quite good as a ballad.  It avoids that sing-songy safe territory of most of her ballads.  Instead, it is somewhat mysterious and moody, similar to Lauren Christy's \\"The Color of the Night\\". <br /> <br />So there you have it, 4 awesome songs (Tracks 1, 2, 11 and 12), 7 so-so songs (Tracks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10), and one song that should be banned for life (Track 3).
0671015206|3.0|Although this book is not bad, it is somewhat repetitive and slow. The authors discuss some common misconceptions regarding wealthy Americans, which is a little interesting, and then go on to describe how one should go about acquiring wealth. While I think everything these authors say about acquiring wealth is true, I also believe it is common sense. There are some statistical tables that the authors include which demonstrate their points (and help alleviate the reader of boredom).  <br />Overall I gave this book a three because it's very mediocre.
1577311523|1.0|There's nothing new here, but if you get something out of this classic premise of being in the moment, that's great. I think the now-classic WHEREVER YOU GO, THERE YOU ARE title by Jon Kabat-Zinn is a much better take on this important Zen topic.
B000929AJQ|4.0|This is definitely one of the most \\"pop\\" type of albums Trent Rezner has come out with.  Its not dark like the fragile or broken.  Has a lot of 80's retro feel to it which isn't really a bad thing.  Overall I like it, but its not his best album by far and I was a little disappointed not hearing any real good \\"Angry\\" music.  But I still love Trent and NIN and I'm looking forward for some remixes of this album!!!<br /><br />Ok well now that I've had some time to fully get used to this album and 1 live NIN concert/tour later.  I appreciate this album much better more now.  Yes it is different then his other albums but whats wrong with a little change?  I think Trent knows his roots and he will get back to them in his next album.
B000089RV6|4.0|Hard rock masters AC/DC unleashed this monster upon the world and spawned big classics, like the title track and \\"Shook,\\" among others. It's no wonder that it still sells in droves over two decades later.  But, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's their best.  Albums like Powerage and Let There Be Rock have stronger, rawer productions and much more \\"epic,\\" less radio-friendly tracks (ex: Sin City, Whole Lotta Rosie).  Still, this an essential purchase for anyone who likes their rock 'n' roll undiluted, without the synths, orchestras, teary-eyed ballads, or eyeliner.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|like many artists have before, daft punk are with the title of this album telling us they fully understand it's not what we or they were hoping for. human after all sounds more electric, empty and cold then discovery, at times resembling highly filtered faceless detroit techno or missy elliot instrumentals, at times sounding as a corporate ordered carbon copies of previous accomplished works, meant to be used in advertising. <br /> <br />at it's best (make love, television rules the nation, emotion, human after all, the prime time of your life) \\"human after all\\" appears as even more lazied works of alan braxe & fred falke. at it worst (the rest), sounding as the worst moments from homework covered by an obscure german electronic collective. <br /> <br />with most tracks sounding as though they could have flourished further, or as though they were wrapped up too quick due to some sort of severe disheartened state, the hope for this album lies in it's substantial remixing potential.
0385510454|1.0|This is nothing but a travelogue of Italy (a poor one at that!) and some copy/paste from 'Italian for Dummies' book, and copy/paste from amazon's listing of a Wireless Phone/PDA device , wrapped in a hint of plot, I cant comprehend how John Grisham has become a best selling writer
B000679N96|3.0|Unique among material by the Cure, \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\" is a reflection of the band's early sounds and catalog, guitarist/vocalist Robert Smith is joined here by bassist Michael Dempsey and drummer Lol Tolhurst and produced a great post-punk pop record.    The best material on here is rhythmically driven, light, and flexible-- what the band lacked in talent (Tolhurst) and aggression (Dempsey) they made up for with dexterity, primarily from the guitar chair-- songs like \\"10:15 Saturday Night\\" (one of the early classic Cure songs), \\"Griding Halt\\" and \\"Fire in Cairo\\" have a fantastic lilt to them and move nicely, with superb arrangements capitalizing on what the band has to work with.  Other songs, while not nearly a agile in their arrangement, benefit from fantastic songwriting-- even at this early stage, Smith is instantly recognizable on \\"Accuracy\\", \\"Another Day\\" (the song that most clearly points the way for the future) and the off-kilter pop of \\"So What\\".  And while there is more than a shre of filler on this one (the lifeless \\"Object\\", although the Dempsey-sung cover of \\"Foxy Lady\\" is so awful it must be heard), the good far outweighs the bad.    The sound on this material in the remastering is breathtaking-- clean, really playing to the strengths of the recording, and a definite improvement over previous releases.  The bonus disc is interesting, although largely extraneous-- the singles (\\"extra album tracks\\") \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" and \\"Jumping Someone Else's Train\\" are both essential, and are both as good or better than the material on the album, but for the most part, the demos, while interesting from a historical perspective, are pretty poor in sound quality.  Still, as document, this is amazing to hear.  Noticably absent (and taking one star off my rating) is the brilliant 1979 single, \\"Killing an Arab\\"-- I'd guess concerns of racism (its about Camus' book, \\"The Stranger\\") kept it off, but its a shame, its a wonderful track.  This is all topped off with fantastic liner notes discussing the album and the band's history.    The Cure definitely would do better things in the future, and this probably isn't the best place to start (\\"Disintigraton\\" or \\"Wish\\" would probably be), but it is a great album and well worth checking out.
B0007P3582|4.0|I can't lie, I didn't like the CD at first.  The tracks were so-so, and he wasn't killin lyrically like he usually does.  I was expecting another classic like Get Rich or Dye Trying...that's not happening!  But after giving the CD a couple plays...it's good ol' 50.  He has about four tracks that I still can't listen to but the bangers are real bangers.  Now I play the CD every couple days.  Don't be so quick to judge the content, if you like 50, you'll like the CD.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Mutter, Rammstein's third studio release, is personally my favorite that the group has done, and I believe that it's their best.  This album has a great combination of heavy ballads like Mein Herz Brennt and Sonne, with pulse-pounding industrial tunes like Rein Raus and Feuer Frei!.  This should be a must have for fans of Rammstein or industrial metal.
B000929AJQ|4.0|1999 - 2005 : This was the gap between the previous NIN record , The Fragile, and the recently released With Teeth. Even if this time the gap wasn't so quiet as the one before it, thanks to the releases of Things Falling Apart, the live recording And All That Could Have Been and the anniversary re-edition of Downward Spiral, this new cd is definitely a welcome return. A more straightforward and song driven record, With Teeth features 13 tracks (14 in europe with the inclusion of b-side Home), rather short compared to the 2 cd Fragile and pretty much devoid of the requiems and instrumentals that had appeared on the last records, maybe this gives to the songs a more simple and band like feel that probably will make many of them live show favorites. Candidates for that are the lead single, The Hand That Feeds, which definitely screams live performance thanks to is driving drums and synths, Only, that presents and odd disco beat which forces you to dance and Everyday Is Exactly The Same, which i see as the most NIN sounding track on the record. The more aggressive tracks like You Know What You Are and Getting Smaller achieve a sense of frantic urge Reznor seemed to find only on the live enviroment during the last years, and all this without resorting heavily on noise and dissonance. Probably the only flaw of this record are the most emotional songs like Right Where It Belongs and Home, despit being well composed songs they somehow lack the grandeur and powerfull climax that caracterized previous efforts such as The Great Below, And All That Could Have Been or Hurt, and ultimately lay low, something that won't help so much when played live maybe alongside other emotional heavyweights. <br />Despite that With Teeth is a great record, something rare in this day and age, and holds it's own within the wonderful catalog of NIN releases. Definitely a must for every fan and worth checkin out for fans of industrial rock
B000001ES9|5.0|before Peart, Rush had a hard time getting anything done.  It was hard/nearly impossible to get these songs out to the people at the time.  This is a blast as far as listening to but the band worked damn hard to get it out and have every right to write a song called \\"Working Man\\".  Working man has a breif bass solo(well more a start to the interlude) and some good John Rutsy drum/cymbol mashing.  An often overlooked song is \\"Before and After\\", although starts out slow, as it picks up, Alex's gitar work is awsome with the similar style as in a much later 1993 song called \\"Cold Fire\\".  \\"Before and After\\" is better though.  Although Peart made the group, Rutsy has good strait foreward drumming as in most Hard Rock/Heavy metal bands.  Rush was good even before Peart.  Geddy and Alex wrote both the lyrics and the music, which was very dynamic and not at all amaturish or raw. They also formed 'Moon Records' to release this albumn without the beaurocracy of major record companies.  These guys were not professionals, they were just kids in a band at the time, but they wrote, played and sung like pros.(even before the omni-presence of Neil Peart).
0064471837|5.0|The book Sabriel is a thrilling fiction novel about a girl and her father and how she grows up to become the Abhorsen and save many, many lives. It starts with Sabriel waiting for her father to come to see her at Wyverley College in Ancelstierre. While waiting for her father to come she receives a message from death that her father has sent. Sabriel must fight necromancers, free magic beings, and send the dead back to death, with the help of Mogget of course, the sassy servant of the abhorsen line. Sabriel tells the chilling tales of her life and is followed by the books Lirael and Abhorsen. These wonderful books contain all of the elements needed for a great story; love, tragedy, suspense, good versus evil, death and life. I dare you to try to put this book down. This wonderful world created by Garth Nix will leave you wanting to read more and more. I guarantee that you will love it.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|I thought: \\"The Phantom of the Opera at last on film...Wow!\\"      I couldn't wait to get the DVD and view it on my Widescreen TV. OK, granted, the production values are superb - but all efforts are wasted in the hands of director Shumacher.  The viewer is not allowed to savor any scene or set piece without being disconcerted by the MTV style jump cutting.  Once or twice, the camera relaxes - as in the Cemetery scene - and we sadly experience the missed potential of the whole.    Plotwise, all changes from stage to film are acceptable, with one exception: The face of The Phantom.  This charming guy could have certainly gone about society with a simple patch on his eye.  And, with his multi-talents been accepted in the finest circles in Paris at that time.  Therefore, the unmasking scene is a bust.   Also, there is nothing to indicate that he is MAD!    The entire cast is fine, and under the mastery of a director like Milos Forman (think Amadeus) they would have shone brightly in a modern day classic.  Instead the audience gets a two hour-plus, pop video.  What a shame.    Something is wrong with a DVD package where the extras are better than the film itself.  Scenes from various stage productions are electrifying.  One wishes one of these stagings were taped and offered to the public.    Reading the above reviews, I realize that I am in the minority.  To each his own.
0446310786|2.0|Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a true piece of literature that teaches everyone vital lessons dealing with poverty, racism, and even the way to place your self in another's shoes (Amazon.com).  \\"Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time getting to the heart of her tale\\" (Amazon.com).  This is very true: the first chapters of the novel were a little random and hard to follow, but the book really developed and by the end I could hardly set the book aside.  As stated by one of the reviews posted on Amazon.com, every character in Lee's novel has great dimension.  Lee has an extraordinary talent of showing off the way society was run back then by the nature and actions of her characters.  Her inventive characters, such as the mysterious Boo Radley, the kind hearted Atticus, and even the weird Mr. Dolphus Raymond, really display the town's feeling toward abnormal people, especially African Americans, in 1930's Alabama. <br />All of the characters seemed very realistic and natural, like you're reading an interesting biography.  Lee's main character and narrator is Scout, who is said to behave similarly to the way Harper Lee acted as a child (Biblio.com).  You can tell Lee really knew her little narrator well just by the actions Scout would take and the questions and remarks she would make. In the last few pages of the novel, Scout stands on the porch of Boo Radley, the man whom she has been deathly afraid of for years and years, and she brings herself to look at her neighborhood from Boo's perspective.  She brings up the past and remembers her and Jem fearfully sprinting back and fourth in front of the Radley Place.  It was clever the way that Lee pulled fourth this bit of maturity from eight-year-old Scout.  Jem wasn't necessarily my favorite character, but I really enjoyed watching him grow up through the eyes of his little sister.  Atticus was a perfect role to have in this novel.  I loved to keep reading and see what his responseswould be to Scout's questions.  Dill was quite a wonder.  I loved the line, \\"beautiful things floated around in his head\\" because it really displayed his character. <br />When Atticus is chosen to defend Tom Robinson, a whole new story begins.  Now the reader, along with Jem and Scout, are introduced to the nastier side of Maycomb.  Racism is exposed everywhere, and it seems that only Atticus is going to stand up for what is right.  Scout is very confused at how the strict and upright ladies forming a missionary society with her aunt can try so hard to help others and then discriminate against the black citizens of Maycomb.  Scout's teacher, Miss Gates, tells the class America is a democracy.  According to Miss Gates, democracy is, \\"Equal rights for all, special privileges for none.\\"  Scout wonders at the way Miss Gates can encourage democracy and still be totally against her father for defending a black man.  Isn't America a democracy... why are whites allowed special privileges?  However, Lee expertly is able to demonstrate a good side to even some of the worst people, such as the bravery and strong will seen in the evil Mrs. Dubose as she breaks free of her morphine addiction (Amazon.com).  In the end, Scout finally realizes that even the cruelest people have a hidden kindness in their hearts (Amazon.com). <br />Of all the reviews that I searched for of To Kill a Mockingbird, not a single one had any sort of negativity.  To Kill a Mockingbird was the only book that Harper Lee has ever published, and with this one book she has won a Pultzer prize and her book has been made into an Oscar winning film (Biblio.com).  Overall, Lee was brilliant in the way she was able to lead us through the tough era of the Depression, full of racism and merciless judgments and hateful rumors, behind the eyes of a young girl with a strong heart...much like her father.
0399143904|2.0|*spoiler* The terrorists' master plan is to kill off all humans that are polluting and destroying the earth in order to save the earth. To do this they intend to use a virus to infect and kill everyone except themselves because they have a vaccine that will protect them from it. They test the virus and it works on rats and monkeys and they even test it and find it works on humans. Never mind that some of the biology is wrong, the point is that if it works on rats and humans it's going to kill off a majority of the mammals on the earth - they're trying to save the animals! These are supposed to be smart terrorists with the ability to create a virus but for some reason they don't realize they're about to kill everything they want to save.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I have been listening to Mr. Reznor ever since he produced The Downward Spiral and I believe in his incredible music ability.  This album is nothing like his previous efforts, but I am still adapting to the new sound.  I wish him the best.  He's a genius in my eyes and no matter what he does, he will always be a legend across the world for millions. Some songs that I particularly enjoy are: the line begins to blur, you know what you are, and only.  I think, however, that his best song ever is \\"something i can never have,\\" that song is incredible.
B00008QSAA|5.0|CLIMBING! is a great debut from Mountain, featuring the contrasting smooth/rough tenor vocals of bassist Felix Pappalardi and guitarist Leslie West, and the pure crunch of West's guitar. This album would be equalled on the followup, and at variuos other points later in the band's career.
B000929AJQ|1.0|i've been a NIN fin since spring 1990. PHM, broken and TDS are absolutely pure genius. but unfortunately NIN is dead.  <br /> <br />track 1: terrible disco rock with wussy falsetto  <br />track 2: best track on the album  <br />track 3: creepy piano is cool, everything else terrible  <br />track 4: bad disco rock wannabe song with a dull music video  <br />track 5: the live version (fresno bootleg) is great, but the studio version is bad  <br />track 6: mediocre song  <br />track 7: mediocre song  <br />track 8: this is the worst song i've heard in years. a 12 year old could've written it with a casio and $40 drum machine. turn on the disco ball and puke.  <br />track 9: catchy but mediocre  <br />track 10: terrible  <br />track 11: okay song  <br />track 12: boring, repetitive, waste of time  <br />track 13: okay song but predictable  <br />nonLP \\"home\\": mediocre song  <br />photek remixes: terrible  <br /> <br />if a new band released this album, nobody would ever hear more than about 2 minutes of it before it got tossed aside and ignored, but since it's NIN it will go to #1 and people will say it's great but quite frankly it's terrbile, uninspired, cliche, boring and proves trent is completely out of ideas. trent could put jewelry in a blender, record it for 79 minutes and it would still sell a million copies so go buy it anyway because you know you will. but the days of good NIN is long gone. and pick up the expensive vinyl and dualdisc and canada CD5 and german CD5 and japanese album and spend $200. within a few months you won't even be listening to it anymore but hey it's your money not mine.
B000929AJQ|5.0|After a 6 year excrutiatingly long wait since The Fragile in 1999, Trent Reznor is back and better than ever in 2005. For a man who's been in the music business for over 10 years, and dubbed the God of industrial, Trent never fails to impress fans with his angst-driven, yet in most cases, beautifully haunting music. From the classic upbeat Pretty Hate Machine, to the heavy hitting yet euphoric The Fragile, Nine Inch Nails has always seemed to cover just about every scrap of ground that one could cover, in the world of Industrial-Rock. With Teeth is somewhat of an exception though. Trent's new album seems like 5 steps backwards, covering what already was, but improving upon it with new material, and an actual live band backing up his vocals. That's right, Trent is no longer a one-man band, he actually has a live band backing up most of the songs on this new release. With Teeth, the former \\"Bleedthrough\\", is a 13 track regression, that covers what already has been in terms of sound, and a tad bit of new sound to add to the flavor of the album. With Teeth is an extremely adverse album, that goes from hard hitting, to upbeat, to melodic, and repeats the cycle numerous times.     Almost every single track on this 2005 release has major replay value, and not a single song on the album, is bad nor doesn't belong. With Teeth has everything...melody for the lovers of melodic pieces, upbeat tracks for fans of Trent's early years, and hard hitting tracks for fans of disc 2 of The Fragile, and tracks such as \\"Burn\\", and \\"Starfu*kers, Inc.\\" If With Teeth had to be compared to any release that Trent has put out, it'd have to be a cross between Broken and The Fragile, which in my own personal opinion, are 2 of Trent's best releases to date. So with that said, you already know you're going to be getting good music on this disc.     The subject mannor on With Teeth is for the most part, love-driven. The entire album is based on the ups and downs, of love. This may upset a few fans of Trent, as it may seem like a midlife-crisis that Trent should've kept to himself, and it may also please other fans of Trent, as...well...the music is just really really good, and you just can't argue with that. Lyrically, this album kind of sinks to a low, and really doesn't offer anything devastatingly amazing, but still finds a way to capture the listeners soul, and send it to a land of angst and euphoria. Also, at times, the album can be lyrically redundant, and extremely saddening. But knowing Trent, this is something a typical 5+ year long fan of Nine Inch Nails, needs to learn to expect, or even has learned to expect. Trent just loves to repeat the same things over and over, and With Teeth kind of proves this. There are even at times, With Teeth song titles in other songs on With Teeth. This may show a lack of creativity, but it's well worth it once you take a listen to it.     In the long run, With Teeth is going to be an album much debated amongst fans of Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails. Some will like it, and some won't. But don't let that stop you from atleast giving the cd a chance. I did, and it's now my 2nd favorite studio release the band (or therein lack of a band in most cases), has put out to date. The first obviously being The Fragile and probably always will be.    Standout tracks on With Teeth include the following:     \\"With Teeth\\", \\"Every Day is Exactly The Same\\", \\"Only\\", \\"Love is Not Enough\\", and \\"Right Where it Belongs.\\"    Every other track on With Teeth is also quite good, but the above mentioned, are standout tracks, and really showcase the best of With Teeth in a nutshell, especially if you're looking to hear Trent go backwards and cover past classic styles.    The title track \\"With Teeth\\", has a dark vibe to it, some decent lyrics, and even a soft spot at about 3 minutes into the song where it goes silent, and Trent breaks out a piano and says, \\"I cannot go through this again.\\" It's the most beautiful part in the entire song. This sounds somewhat like a song inspired from RIGHT of The Fragile. Which was a great era of Trent, and possibly the best.    The second standout track, \\"Every Day is Exactly The Same\\", showcases alot of what we really, really loved about the The Fragile era of Trent. It reminds me alot of, \\"We're in This Together\\" from LEFT of The Fragile. Not quite sure how, but it just does. It has some of the best lyrical content on With Teeth as well. The song for the most part, even full part, is fully melodic. But believe me when I say this, this track, is by far the 2nd best song on the cd and simply cannot be skipped.    The third standout track, \\"Only\\", is somewhat of a return to the roots of Trent Reznor...somewhat. It's an extremely upbeat song, with refrences to the classic that we all love, \\"Down in It\\" This song very well may be a sequel to it, infact. Furthermore, it has some of the most addicting lyrics ever, such as, \\"I just made you up, to hurt myself...and it worked...yes it did!\\"    The fourth standout track, \\"Love is Not Enough\\", is a return to the Broken era of Trent. The song can be MAJORLY and almost ACCURATELY compared to the Natural Born Killers track, \\"Burn.\\" It has more than an 80% \\"Burn\\" vibe to it. The lyrical content, is dark...very dark and angry, with such passes as, \\"In your eyes is a place, worth remembering. For you to go and take this, and smash it apart...I've gone all this fu*king way, to wind up back at, back at the start!\\" It's a good song..don't skip it!    And lastly, the fifth standout track, \\"Right Where it Belongs\\", is a return to the The Downward Spiral era of Trent. The song is completely synth, and piano based. No drums, no guitars, nothing. Just a piano, and a synthesizer. This is *the best* song on the cd, because it has the best lyrics, such as, \\"You can live in this illusion, you can choose to believe. You keep looking but you can't find the words, now you're hiding in retreat.\\"  This song is a *prime* and promising for the future example of the talent that Trent has within himself, and this track just simply *must not* be skipped. You'll love it, I promise you that. Besides, it has kind of an \\"And all that could have been/Hurt\\" vibe to it. And those are 2 great songs from both The Downward Spiral and Still.      Notice that all of the standout tracks make good examples of past Trent eras? This is why I picked them. If you're really wanting to hear Trent revert back to what was good in the purist fan's mind, listen to those tracks, and if they can't change your mind or atleast make you like the album a little in terms of it sounding even a tad bit like older more enjoyable Trent, then With Teeth has failed you and you should just really take this in, as a new era of Trent. A new clean slate to call an era of Nine Inch Nails in terms of sound. Even if you hate it.    To sum up this review,    With Teeth is a great effort by Trent Reznor, and fans of the The Fragile and Broken eras of Nine Inch Nails, need not hesitate, and give this cd a chance. Like it or leave it, it's been made, and it's not going to leave untill it makes its impact on the select few fans who enjoy it.     Give With Teeth a chance, you won't regret it.    I hope this review has helped atleast a few of you people decide to buy this Trent Reznor masterpiece of a disc.    And as a bonus, I suggest picking up the UK import edition of With Teeth. It comes with 2 bonus tracks which include a 2nd cut of the track, \\"Right Where it Belongs\\", which sounds like an outtake from the Still EP, and the much coveted supposed \\"vinyl only\\" song, \\"Home.\\" 15 Tracks in all, and no remixes.

B000929AJQ|5.0|I'd say that this album, out of the entire NIN catalog, is the only proper successor to Pretty Hate Machine - concise, with pop sensibility in the music, and very confessional lyrics. I know that NIN fans are often bitterly divided over Pretty Hate Machine, but I'm squarely in the camp that loves that album. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this is not the same Trent Reznor as the Trent Reznor of 1989. Nor of 1999. It's an older, less angry, less experimental, more melancholy, more focused Trent Reznor. A Trent Reznor who has come to terms with his own sound, and (shockingly) the sound of the popular music of this decade. I've been trying to fault this album ever since it went live on nin.com last week, but the more I look for flaws in the album, the more I end up loving it. <br /> <br />Thematically, there is a basis for comparing this to Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" - a desperate retrospective on a long career. Perhaps NIN's final album?
B000929AJQ|5.0|I love this album!!!!  It's alot more of a pleasure to listen to than \\"The Downward Spiral\\", and while I did like \\"The Fragile\\" I felt that it would have been a more interesting album  if it was 14 or 15 songs instead of 23.  This album is one of the most \\"Listenable\\" NIN albums, my favorite since \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\".  A MUST-BUY if your a NIN fan, and YES, it was worth the wait.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are...<br />ALL THE LOVE IN THE WORLD<br />THE HAND THAT FEEDS<br />EVERY DAY IS EXACTLY THE SAME<br />ONLY<br />SUNSPOTS
B00025ETIW|5.0|I used to despise emo with a passion. I thought they were all a bunch of whiney  baby's who were jumping on the bandwagon and giving the stupid teens these days what they wanted to hear. This may be the case for some of them, but DEFINITELY not for My Chemical Romance. I saw them live with Green Day a week and a half ago and they were amazing.. although it was a little decieving, the sounded a lot more metal live because of the accoustics. But that doesn't matter. After hearing their new single, 'Helena', on the radio a few times since then, I have sucked up my anti emo pride and I caved and bought \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.\\" It's an amazing album, my worst fears about the album were NOT true. This is not whiney at all! It is violent but thats what I listen to metal for! Ill go through the tracks... <br /> <br />1. Helena(5/5) They opened with this song at the GD show. I was blown away, and it sounds almost as good on the album as it did live. <br />2. Give 'em Hell Kid(5/5) This song is a fast paced, 'get pumped' song. <br />3. To The End(5/5) Sheer evil... amazing. Gerard sounds really sinister in this song. One of my favorites. <br />4. You know what they do to guys like us in prison(5/5) A fast violent song with a sweet solo and lots of screaming, another one of my favorites. <br />5. I'm not okay(4/5)While this isn't a bad song, it is very poppy and it gives many people the wrong idea about the cd. The rest of the cd sounds nothing like this song. <br />6. The Ghost of You(4/5) A slower song.. I'm not really a fan of this one. <br />7. The Jetset Life is gonna Kill You(4/5) Good song, but nothing stands out about it. <br />9. Thank you for the Venom(5/5) Amazing rhythm guitar and lyrics <br />10. Hang 'em High(5/5) The opening is REALLY decieving, this is one of the heaviest songs on the album. <br />11. It's not a fashion statement, its a deathwish(5/5) Fast, heavy and good guitar work. <br />12. Cemetery Drive(5/5) Such sincere lyrical ability, an amazing song.. i love the chorus. <br />13. I never told you what I do for a Living(5/5) Perfect close to the album. <br /> <br />Just give these guys a chance, they may be popular, and they may be emo, but that doesn't mean they are bad. Just pick up this cd and you'll never look back.
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|Ok ok, Mike's still got it. I am surprised that he waited so long to release fifteen songs never heard by the world before. As well as classics, disc 1 starts with the Jackson 5 and gradually goes in to his solo career. They put all the hits of what started the Jackson 5 at Motown on here! \\"I want you back, Abc,  Ben.\\" Those are just some of the Motown hits. Of course, you get to hear other classics from \\"Off the wall, Thriller, Bad, and Dangerous.\\" As I said, there are also fifteen songs never heard by the public and this collection is a classic. One of the unreleased songs has become one of my favorites. It's called, \\"Someone put your hand out.\\" Another track that I like is, \\"On the line.\\" Ok. Now for the sad part of my review. Why sad you ask? Because this box set has a Dvd with it. This Dvd has a concert that was recorded and aired originally on Hbo in 1992. I have had three of these box sets to date and the DVD sounds terrible! I can see the picture but, the audio track souhnds like your listening to white noise. I have had two friends in Seattle confirm that it is not my DVD player after they went and bought the same set. So, the record company needs to check these out, or have a recall on them. I know, I have never given a terrible review on a product until now. This is a first for me actually. I hope the record company can find out what's wrong with these DVD's and either give people their money back, or send them a box set from the company themselves.
0743487583|4.0|In the book Frankenstein, the author, Mary Shelley tells a story about a monster that the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, creates. Well at the beginning of the book, it leads off with the narrator, Robert Walton, writing letters to his sister Margaret Saville. They are summarizing what Walton did, when he met Victor Frankenstein and how he nursed him back to health. After Victor is becomes healthy, Victor starts telling Walton his story. Victor starts by telling Walton about his early life, where he was born and where he lived, just a little back round information. After this is when you start to learn about Elizabeth, Victor's lifelong companion. Later in the years he starts to make a new friend named Henry Clerval, their friendship blooms. At the age of seventeen Victor goes to a University in Ingolstadt. Before he leaves his mother catches scarlet fever form Elizabeth, who she is nursing back to health. While at the university he creates a monster, which has no name. The monster terrorizes Victor and he becomes ill. Henry nurses him, when he is healthy again he receives a letter from his father saying that his brother William has been murdered. Justin Mortz is convicted of the murder she didn't commit and is executed. But come to find out the monster killed William. Later you find out that Victor meets the monster and finds out that he can talk and he shows emotions. The monster tells Victor of his past and how he learned how to speak. But when Felix scares him away he promises to himself that he will reject all humans. He comes across William and William mentions the name Alphonse and is strangled by the monster to death. After the monster finishes his story he tells Victor that he wants a female companion, after an agreement Victor agrees to make a female monster. When Victor, his father, and Henry go on a two-year tour, Victor finds himself making the female monster. But when he has second thoughts that they will make a \\"Devil race\\" he destroys the monster. When the monster finds out that Victor destroyed the companion the monster kills Henry. Victor is found innocent of Hery's murder and goes back to Geneva.<br /><br /> I found that the book was well written and that Mary Shelley, describes the characters with greatest descriptions. I believe that when the monster was telling his story that she put a lot of effort into letting people know what happened to him. That made me want to read the book more.<br /><br /> I would suggest that all ages should read this book because it is great entertainment when you have nothing to do. People who like mysteries will have more fun reading this book then a person who likes drama.When the monster finds out that Victor destroyed the companion the monster kills Henry.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|This cast is Amazing !!!! and the movie....Simply Marvelous !! <br />I've seen them all , stage and movies and this one far outshines anything in the past !! <br />
B000002U9Y|4.0|Some major things happened in the Pink Floyd camp when their second album was being recorded. Well, just one really. Frontman Syd Barrett was getting pretty..damaged, mentally. Thus, Roger Waters to the rescue, and \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is the result. <br /> <br />Barrett only contributes one tune, \\"Jugband Blues\\", another colorful, weird psychedelic pop song like those from their debut album. Sadly, that would be his last contribution to the band.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album is much different from \\"A Piper at the Gates..\\"; the pieces are longer, more atmospheric. Still very trippy, but in a more omnious sort of way as opposed to the colorful pop tunes that Syd wrote. <br /> <br />\\"Let There Be More Light\\" is a brooding opener. Very psychedelic, a bit intense, and has a slight Middle Eastern feel. \\"Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun\\" has a similar brooding, omnious feel; tribal-like drums, eerie vibraphone, etc. <br /> <br />Rick Wright's always underrated contributions include \\"Remember a Day\\" and \\"See-Saw\\". The former is a nice, breezy little pop ballad with a hazy psychedelic sheen. The latter (which Roger gave the working title: \\"The Most Boring Song I Have Ever Heard\\") is quite lush and gorgeous. It doesn't really *go* anywhere, but I really enjoy it. <br /> <br />\\"Corporal Clegg\\" seems like Roger Waters' attempt at writing a Syd styled quirky pop song. It's deliciously strange, really. Part heavy acid rock, part kazoo-laden stomp.  <br /> <br />And then, the title track (which featured equal contribution from all four band members). It's a lengthy (12 minutes) piece divided into four parts, and purely instrumental. There's a creepy organ throughout, some awesome drumming in the middle, and a beautiful, choral finale.  <br /> <br />\\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is one of Pink Floyd's more overlooked albums, lacking both a well known song and critical word of mouth. It's really an excellent album, a bit experimental and transitional, but it settlesin after a few listens.
6305313687|4.0|This is a great movie, don't get me wrong. It was well written and the cast was exceptional. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ending. I'm sure many people have written about the end of this movie and why it seems so wrong. The whole movie basically centers around the fact that racism is wrong and then at the end a black kid has to kill Daniel, who has struggled the whole time realizing that racism is wrong. What is the point? This only shows the ignorance that many people have, which is sad because it is true. Racism is not only white against black - it goes both ways.
0800177177|4.0|Having been a fan of Francis Ford Coppola, I was expecting a good vampire moving and a good adaption of Bram Stoker's novel ( that's what the audience is lead to believe by the title ). I did get a good adaption, but somethings seemed to be out of....place and definetely some mis-casting.  <br /> <br />Well, we all know the dracula story, so I explain, as simple as possible. Johnaton Harker goes to Dracula's castle to offer him retail/land to buy. Dracula sees picture of Johnaton's fiancee seeing his lost love. Leaves Johnaton to his other \\" wives \\" while he goes to search for her in London. He bites Mina's ( Johnaton's fiancee ) best friend, Lucy, causing Dr. Abhram Van Healsing to go after the damned creature. Lucy dies becomes vampire Van Healsing kills her. Dracula and Mina share passionate moment in her room, he bites her and leaves when interuppted. They try to save her, kills Dracula's wife. Leads to a showdown with all the characters.  <br /> <br />As I said, I like this movie, I even own it. But there are somethings that good costumes and imagery just can't save, and one of them is actors : Keanu Reeves. I mean come on, he's fooling no one with the english accent, there is one scene in which is suppose to be taken seriously but is laughable with Keanu's accent, \\" I saw where the Bastard sleeps.\\" Also ummm, I love Winona Ryder's acting and everything, but here is an actress who was taking on a complex character. Mina's character is suppose to be torn by Dracula and Johnaton, denying her love for Dracula, and coming to realize he is the one! But Winona's accent is also something that brought this movie down. Even though she has the look ( the pale complexion, big brown eyes, black long hair etc. ), her accent is somewhat iffy is how I could describe, one min. it's there one min. it's gone. But over the years I did grow use to it, so it's doesn't bother me half as much as it use to. One thing that got on my nerves, was the nudity, I have nothing against nudity, but I mean really did you need THAT much? Still who am I kidding? I liked seeing Gary Oldman without his shirt. Oh let me go to the postive side of the movie now. There is some brillant acting in this movie, despite what I described above. Gary Oldman was great as Dracula he had the accent down and everything. He also made Dracula quite......cool, confident, calm, sexy. Everything Dracula was made to be. Anothy Hopkins is another great actor who did his role to perfection ( if that is even a way to describe him ). The music is nice for a Dracula movie, not my cup of tea but okay. The costumes, where now, just beautiful, nothing was done more less or more perfect, it was just.....beautiful. So I do recommend this movie for a friday night, something to fill in the time. Or just frankly watch it if your a fan of Francis Ford Coppola.
B00006CXSS|4.0|this series is for anyone that is interested in a historical and personal account a very tumultous period in the world. heck yeah.
B000002UB3|5.0|Upon their final studio album (although not the last to be released), The Beatles bow out on top; \\"Abbey Road\\" is a brilliant ride showcasing a band (who were largely at odds with each other at the time) at a total creative peak. Well, 1965-1970 was one large creative peak, but consider this the peak of the peak.    \\"Abbey Road\\" is stylistically diverse, like we'd come to expect. There's anthematic hard rock (\\"Come Together\\"), silly children's songs (\\"Octopuses Garden\\"), old timey soul (\\"Oh Darling\\", possibly Paul's best vocal ever), lighthearted pop (\\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", which is so bouncy and fun you won't notice how dark the lyrics are!), druggy dirges (\\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\"), and more.    \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" is a mini-suite ala \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\", but it's Paul, so it's not nearly as dark. Helluva tune, though. As is \\"Because\\", a glorious juxtaposition between a dark, minor key melody and heart wrenchingly beautiful vocal harmonies.  George Harrison also pens two of his best songs: \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is, appropriately, an uplifting, sunny pop song. And \\"Something\\" is only the greatest love ballad ever.     Side 2 meshes all these song fragments (unfinished ideas, likely) into one amazing song cycle. \\"Sun King\\" is gorgeous; it floats admidst the rich, lush harmonies. \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" is a catchy rocker; \\"Polythene Pam\\" is part surf-rock, part punk (punk? in 1969?). \\"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\\" is a soulful rocker, followed by the brief but magnificent piano ballad \\"Golden Slumbers\\". What a gorgeous song. \\"The End\\" is, well the end. It's fun, upbeat, it has a cool drum solo..it's a great bow out from the best band of all time.
B0007GAERG|4.0|As would be expected when purchasing a Mariah album over the past few years, I had my hesitations.  But the title promises so much!  \\"MIMI'S FREE!\\"  So I gave in.  And I'm glad I did.  The CD doesn't break any new ground or branch out into some new version of Mariah (ie. Gwen Stefani or Kylie Minogue) but that's not a bad thing. <br /> <br />One of the key problems w/the latest Mariah offerings were that the Mariah we grew to love (the powerful voice, the high notes) was lost!  All we got was a handful of overly produced tracks with her cooing and breathing in the background.  But that's all changed with \\"Mimi\\".  She's back in form belting out power ballads, she's hitting ALL the right notes as high as ever, and she sounds wonderful.   <br /> <br />I guess \\"Mimi\\" was emancipated in a sense ... she's been set free from the BAD MUSIC HELL she was trapped in!  And it's good to have her back.

B000929AJQ|4.0|With a Title like \\"With Teeth\\" you'd think this album was something that would, well, bite the heck out of you and not let you go. An album that you'd never take out of your Cd player like \\"And All that Could Have Been: Live\\".  Unfortunately, it's not the case. I didn't like the fact that Trent repeated alot of the same lyrics, seemed like he ran out of things to say, so he was desperate to not leave open music playing.  The album overall is good,  but i still believe \\"The Fragile\\" is Trent's best work.   <br /> <br />01.  \\"All the Love in the World\\" The first track is pretty good, i love the lyrics, and i love the piano in it.  Pretty good opening song <br /> <br />02.  \\"You Know What You Are?\\" Hardest song on the album, really fast. Lyrics give a remeniscence of \\"The Big Come Down\\".  Awesome ending. <br /> <br />03.  \\"The Collector\\" This song is ok. I like the Chorus part. something about the way he sings it along with the playing music that'll have you repeating it inside your head.   <br /> <br />04.  \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" This is probably the only song that is middle ground. You can understand the lyrics well, the music doesn't get too distorted, and it just sounds like a NIN song, more likely to have fitted between PHM and Broken. <br /> <br />05.  \\"Love is Not Enough\\" Awesome song. Music is great, lyrics are great. <br /> <br />06.  \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" Ok song. Guess i need to give it some more listening.   <br /> <br />07.  \\"With Teeth\\" This one i don't like alot. The way he sings chorus line \\"...With-uh Teeth-uh\\" doesn't really sound good. <br /> <br />08.  \\"Only\\" Another song that belonged between PHM and Broken.  Very 80s. i've made it my mission to hate the 80s, but the chorus is great.  Sounds more like a story. <br /> <br />09.  \\"Getting Smaller\\" This one kinda seems more like background music. I'm sure if you're driving in your car, you won't really pay attention to this song alot. <br /> <br />10. \\"Sunspots\\" Just like 09. <br /> <br />11.\\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" I think the only great thing about this song is the chorus with the guitar in the background.  It's a decent song, better than \\"With Teeth\\", \\"Getting Smaller\\", and \\"Sunspots\\". <br /> <br />12.  \\"Beside You in Time\\" Love this song. Love the backwards sounding music.  The end is cool, sounds a little like \\"TDTWWA\\". <br /> <br />13.  \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" Great song. Awesome lyrics. Kick-ass thoughtfullness. Great way to end the Cd.
B000002UA0|5.0|The Pink Floyd on their debut, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\", is a much different Pink Floyd than that of \\"Dark Side\\" or \\"The Wall\\". Mainly, because at this point, Syd Barrett was the frontman, and his style is drastically different from that of Waters and Gilmour.    The best description for this album is storybook psychedelia. There's a lot of happy sounding songs on here, such as \\"Scarecrow\\" and \\"Flaming\\". The instrumentation is diverse, quirky, and trippy, not too far removed from what The Beatles and Beach Boys we're doing at the time.    \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is a classic rock song off the bat; it's spacey and wildly psychedelic. As is the lengthy instrumental \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", the heaviest thing on here.    Songs like \\"Lucifer Sam\\" and \\"Matilda Mother\\" continue in the vein of trippy pop songs; the hooks on this album are everpresent and really melt in your mouth after a couple listens.    \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" is one of the more experimental things on here, an instrumental with equal parts jazzy piano noodling and bizarre high pitched chanting. \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" is an early Roger Waters composition, and, well..he got better with time.    \\"The Gnome\\" is more lush psych-pop, terrific stuff. And \\"Chapter 24\\" has some really nice harmonies.    \\"Bike\\" closes out the album on a blissful note. It's wildly catchy, colorful, classic late 60's psychedelia. Syd Barrett had the makings of a true genius, and it's too bad the drugs got the best of them. He'd contribute one song on their follow-up album, but after that, the band went on without him. And the rest, they say, is history.    Nonetheless, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is one of the best debut albums ever. Since \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wall\\" became such massive successes, this tends to get overlooked. But it's really the cream of the crop, as far as Floyd albums go. A classic psychedelic pop album.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel, by Garth Nix, is an action thriller, fantasy that I could never put down. This is one of my favorite books ever written. The book is very well written and is very deep in its detail. The story starts with Sabriel, an 18 year old girl, getting an urgent message from her father. He is in grave danger in the Old Kingdom, a world of magic and Death, and needs her help. Her father, the Abhorsen, is a Necromancer that binds people to death instead of to life. It is up to Sabriel with the help from a talking cat and the blood Prince of the Old Kingdom to save the Abhorsen. Throughout this book, Sabriel learns courage, love, and that if she believes in herself, anything is possible.<br /><br />\\"Rich, complex, involving, and hard to put down... is excellent high fantasy,\\" raves Publishers Weekly. This statement is completely true. When a character feels emotion, you feel for the character. You can feel the pain Sabriel feels when she finds out her father is dead and you feel the sorrow when Touchstone tells his tale. \\"The action charges along to a gallop, imbued with an encompassing sense of looming disaster,\\" says reviewer Sally Estes in a Contemporary Authors article. Throughout the book, the action never slows down. The action is constant and the thrills keep coming until the very end. You never know what to expect next.<br /><br />  The book is not your typical struggle for good against evil. It is much more. The characters are so human that they seem like real people. They feel joy and they get angry. By the time the book is over, you know the characters' personalities. You know that Sabriel hates when people act lower than her or when people threat her differently for being the Abhorsen. She is a fun character that keeps you coming back for more. Touchstone is very soft-spoken but you know he has a heart of gold. You can even feel the secret passion that lingers between Touchstone and Sabriel.<br /><br />Sabriel is the perfect book for anyone. The entire book is an emotional rollercoaster. Through all the sadness and Death, is a heartwarming tale of a little girl who will stop at nothing to see her daddy, even if it is just for one last time.  I promise you won't regret reading this novel for the rest of your life.tire book is an emotional rollercoaster.

B00005JNTV|5.0|I wasn't really surprised when I saw that some people rated this movie as 1-star (even the very best cinema has those who rate it low, for whatever reason). However, they often fail to cite reasons why, or the reasons are inexplicable. Anyway, here is why I rated it a five: <br /> <br />Visual-Amazing! The way that each frame of the movie is like the frame of a comic book simply draws you into the experience. The black and white nostalgic look with colors that blazed forth from the screen. Nothing short of excellent. <br /> <br />Dialogue-While many criticize the dialogue as 'cheesy', you have to remember that this movie is based off of a comic book. It's supposed to be a little cheesy sounding, just like a comic book is. <br /> <br />Characters-God how I hated Rourke. How I loved Hartigan. How you grow to love and hate the characters and become a part of their experience is amazing. I hated Rourke so much..... <br /> <br />Plot-Taken from Sin City comic books, and those were just....amazing and original. <br /> <br />Soundtrack-The music did what it should: provide the boost of emotion (suspense, happiness, etc.) without interfering with the movie. <br /> <br />Themes- This is where many fall short. They criticize the movie as being \\"for serial killers or psychopaths\\" whithout looking at what the movie is really saying. Just because a movie contains cannibals doesn't mean it is endorsing cannibalism. So what themes are in this movie? I'll list a few: 1.Justice-What is justice? Is justice killing a murdurous cannibal, regardless of its legality? Is justice obeying corrupt officials? Is justice mudering a bishop who eats people? The movie points out that justice sometimes goes against traditional ideas of legality and personal morals. 2. The price paid for good- Every person who does good in the movie suffers for it. The movie seems to portray the idea that \\"no good deed goes unpunished\\". Upon further viewing and analysis, one can find even more themes. And no, I amnot reading into it, people write movies-*gasp*-to portray ideas! Godforbid a deeper meaning... <br /> <br />Those are my reasons for rating this movie so high. While many complain about violence, objectification of women, ask yourselves, \\"Why did Rodriguez put that there?\\" And no, the answer is not to be gratuitous. <br /> <br />An old man dies. A little girl lives. Fair trade.
B000002U8G|4.0|(4.5 Stars) <br /> <br />\\"Meddle\\" is where things started to get really good again for Pink Floyd. This is pre-\\"Dark Side\\", but they're already in the realm of greatness at this point, picking things back up after a couple decent but forgettable albums. <br /> <br />\\"One of These Days\\" is a classic; a grinding, intense instrumental assault. Yet, buoyantly catchy at the same time. The mood lightens considerably for \\"A Pillow of Winds\\", a dreamy accoustic based song that is as lush and gorgeous as anything Pink Floyd has done.  <br /> <br />\\"Fearless\\" is a wonderful Syd Barrett tribute; it's uplifting and anthematic, with a great guitar hook throughout. This could have been a big hit in my mind.. <br /> <br />\\"San Tropez\\" is a bit irrelevant, but a nice jazzy-pop tune nonetheless. And, well..\\"Seamus\\" is terrible, but it's not supposed to be good. All is redeemed by the last song, \\"Echoes\\", which fills up the entire second side. Oh wait, CD's don't have sides. But it's close to 25 minutes nonetheless. Sure, it'll take a few listens to fully appreciate, but it's a wild, psychedelic classic. <br /> <br />\\"Meddle\\" isn't exactly a lost gem; it gets a fair share of recognition, and it deserves all of it, if not even more. A couple less than stellar tracks, but everything else makes up for it.
0060234814|4.0|According to a customer on Amazon.com, \\"When read on an adult level, the Narnia Chronicles function as a powerful medium used by Lewis to impart powerful spiritual truths about Christianity and theology. But these spiritual truths are conveyed more by Biblical allusions than by rigid allegory.\\" <br /> This statement is absolutely correct.  While I was reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, it sounded like I was reading the bible.  Aslan, symbolizes God, and the White Witch symbolizes Satin.  When Aslan gets stabbed at the Stone Table, it is symbolizing Jesus dying on the cross, and when the lion comes back to life, it is symbolizing the Resurrection. <br /> C.S Lewis' use of symbolism does not make The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe a better story.  Some people may think that symbolism makes it good, I think it makes it worse.  If a person wanted to read about that, they could just read the bible.  C.S Lewis should have incorporated more of his own ideas into the storyline. <br /> There are a lot of good things going for this book.  There are interesting characters, good conflicts, and good detail about the scenery.  I just think that C.S. got carried away with symbolism. <br />
0375507256|4.0|This book is worth reading for the last two pages alone. David Mitchell wrote one of my favorite books, \\"Ghostwritten\\". That was a tran-satlantic crossing that started in Tokyo and ended in Manhattan. The stories were loosley threaded together which is somewhat what he does here. I can only compare the two books and say while I liked this book, I did find some of the sections (particularly the middle), quite difficult to really hook into. With Ghostwritten each story was as fascinating as the one before. Here, while I marvelled at his ability to tackle six very diffrent genres of story telling in six very different locales, I was left a bit removed as he moved into the not so distant future. That said,  I do believe he is one of the great writers today, and one that more people should be talking about.
0743454537|5.0|The only reason Sara and Brian Fitzgerald had another child was so that she could be the perfect match for their daughter Kate, who was diagnosed with leukemia as a child. Anna is know thirteen and she has gone through the same amount of surgeries as her sister and is getting fed up with it. She doesn't want to spend nights in the hospital when she doesn't have to. She decides to use the money she has been saving up and hire a lawyer and sue her parents.    Jesse, the oldest child and the rebellious one, brings Anna to her first few meetings with the lawyer until their parents are told about the whole thing. Anna's mom, Sara thinks she's just doing it for attention but her father, Brian thinks Anna's not doing the wrong thing can understand why she's doing it. At times Anna doesn't know if she will be able to go through with this and wants to give up. Will she stay strong and stick with this or will she succumb to the pressure of her mother and give in?    This book is what I would refer to it as a Chick book I don't think many men would be interested in reading this book because it does not have that much action material in it. I thought the book was an excellent. I enjoy reading books on this type of material because when I grow up I would like to be a nurse who works with young kids who have illness's like leukemia and cancer.
B000001Y5J|4.0|(4.5 Stars) <br /> <br />\\"Broken\\" is an essential EP that serves as a bridge between the dance/pop feel of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and the intense, anguish of \\"The Downward Spiral\\". All of a sudden, Trent sounds a helluva lot angrier and LOUDER..much louder.  <br /> <br />\\"Wish\\" is a heart pounding kickstart, with a maddening, rapid beat and abrasive, metal like guitars. This is *intense* stuff, way more intense than anything on \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". <br /> <br />The same applies to \\"Last\\", which ranges from raucous to even more raucous! The omnious instrumental \\"Help Me I Am In Hell\\" leads into the killer \\"Happiness In Slavery\\", which is pretty risque stuff, lyrically, for 1992. The verses are nice and noisy, and the chorus is a bit more beat heavy like that of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". Controversy aside, it's an awesome song.  <br /> <br />Finally, there's \\"Gave Up\\", with its machine gun-like beat and acidic, anguished chorus. Noticing a trend here?  <br /> <br />Oh wait, there's also two hidden tracks. There's the sexual grind of \\"(You're So) Physical\\", and the industrial-funk of \\"Suck\\". More good stuff. <br /> <br />\\"Broken\\" may not be a full length album, but it's an essential EP to own, as it shows how Trent evolved from his \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" into his \\"Downward Spiral\\". And changing sound aside, it also has some awesome songs.

0151001634|4.0|Charlie is a mentally retarded adult who has agreed to be a human guinea pig.  Scientists want to see if they can improve one's IQ by performing an operation.  The operation is done on Charlie and a mouse, Algernon.  The scientists compare results and see that both IQ's grow very high and very quickly.  Charlie's challenge is to act normal as he deals with his genius status.  One day, Charlie notices that Algernon is not acting normal.  He is irritable, forgetful and unclean.  Charlie knows this will also happen to him. <br />Because of language that could be offensive, and descriptions of a nude picture and making love, this book is for mature readers only.
B000002U9W|4.0|\\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is certainly one of Pink Floyd's least accessible releases, but that's no reason to pass it up.  <br /> <br />The title track is a 25 minute suite, purely instrumental, and composed of different sections. It's very orchestral, featuring strings and horns, as well as some choral chanting and weird sound effects at times. The length alone makes it a very challenging piece. I hated it the first time I heard it, but now I regard it as one of their best songs. The moral of the story is, don't give up after one listen. <br /> <br />There's some shorter songs in the middle, like Roger Waters' folky \\"If\\", and David Gilmour's also light, folky \\"Fat Old Sun\\". Stuck in the middle is the best of the bunch, Rick Wright's \\"Summer '68\\", which starts off as a fairly unassuming piano ballad before exploding into a fantasia haze of orchestrated psych-pop.  <br /> <br />Finally, there's \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\", another instrumental broken into parts. Not nearly as long as \\"Atom\\", but even weirder. You can hear snippets of a guy preparing/eating breakfast in between each part. I really enjoy the final part on it. <br /> <br />All and all, a strange album. Nothing leaps out right away, but after a few listens, a lot of it starts to work. And I think, if you give it a fair change, you'll enjoy this album.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|My favorite all time movie with an incredible DVD presentation ! I've been waiting to see the complete 2 hour \\"Making-of\\" docuementary for years ! This Bonus feature, along with a price which by comparison to the original Laserdisc (over 100 dollars) is peanuts, might just be enough for me to forgive UNIVERSAL for not giving us all of this on the 25th. anniversary edition.  <br />Can't wait to buy this movie yet again, 3 Betas, 3 VHS's and 1 DVD later !
B00005RZV4|5.0|\\"And All That Could Have Been\\" is a live album from NIN's 2000 Fragility Tour. I'm not usually big on live albums, but this one is awesome. The sound is absolutely masterful, as if you're right up on stage in front of Trent and his touring band. <br /> <br />As for the songs, there's a nice mix. Of course, you have the obligatory favorites like \\"Closer\\", \\"Head Like a Hole\\", and \\"Hurt\\", all of which sound at least as good as the originals.  <br /> <br />\\"March of the Pigs\\" is as intense as ever, and \\"Piggy\\" is as omnious and creepy as ever. Then, there's a selection of songs from \\"The Fragile\\" of course, including the epic, powerful \\"The Wretched\\", the heart wrenching ballad \\"The Great Below\\", the slow building \\"The Day the World Went Away\\", and a killer extended version of the instrumental \\"The Mark Has Been Made\\".  <br /> <br />My favorites are \\"Terrible Lie\\", \\"Sin\\", and \\"Suck\\", three of Trent's earlier songs. On their respective albums, they were good songs marred slightly by dated production. However, in this live setting, they really come to life, sounding much more powerful and intense than the studio versions. <br /> <br />Let me also recommend, try to get ahold of the companion EP to this titled \\"Still\\" (as opposed to \\"Live\\"). It features some new songs as well as stripped down versions of some NIN classics.
B00007JVBI|5.0|this album is creepy, like a kudzu vine.  it has slowly creeped into my mind and grown roots, where it now lives, in a dark corner of my subconscious.  it's genious, i think, has yet to be discovered -- it is ahead of its time.  chan marshall is a seer, a mystic.
B00001PE4D|4.0|Everyone knows that few people can be more cruel than the young, particularly teens. Some, unfortunately delight in the torment of others ann can even take this torment to the next level by posing as \\"friends\\" thereby giving themselve even more opportunity to do harm. That such people exist is frightening; that they can change is enlightening. <br /> <br />Cruel intentions is a character study of one such change. Two fithly rich step-siblings delight in the way they can manipulate others. They also exercise a degree of psycho-sexual torture on each other. Each wants to get the upper hand. For the most part, though, they do not let this get in the way of their prime motivation of hurting others through backstabbing and deceit. These two miscreants decide on a wager that will seem to give both what they desire. He bets his classic car against the pleasures of her body. The challenge is to utterly destroy the reputation of the new girl in school who is as clean as the driven snow. What neither counted on, however, was that some of the cleaness rubs off on him. His character change comes in fits and starts; he can still be an manipulator but it is clear that he is really changing. Sis doesn't like that and sets him up for a big fall, thereby setting herself up for her own fall. <br /> <br />This film is strong drama all the way through but is a little weak towards the end. It is filled with moments of sadistic glee, lightened by humor of all things. Many is the time while watching that you see some cruel act taking place and have a bit of guilty twinge for appreciating the subtlety and sometimes the humor with which it is done. <br /> <br />The is no doubt that this is a modernized knock off of the \\"Dangerous Liasions\\" story. The basic premise is the same but it is set with modern teens in Manhatten. That just multiplies the opportunities for cruelty to reign. It makes me glad i am no longer a kid. <br /> <br />Rarely do the \\"special features\\" of a DVD interest me but Idid pay attention to the ones on this disk. Compared to many others, they are not exceptional but they do help to illustrate the complexity of the characters involved. I mean in particular the deleted scenes selection. In it are a few seems that were omitted. These would seem trivial but each is begun with a director's commentary which describes why the scene was cut or re-edited. This does an effective job of showing the difficulty in creating a truly dastardly character and trying to rehabilitate that character before the film is over. In most cases, the scene was shortened or cut because it was felt that inclusion would drive peopel too far into hating the anti-hero and make caring for him by the end too difficult. This was not at all apparent to me until seeing these scenes and then it was obvious. <br /> <br />This isn't the greatest drama ever made but it is good and is certainly worth the effort in viewing it.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Words don't even describe the greatness of this album! It is trully legendary. \\"Nas is the rebel of the street corner\\" - Nas <br />Nas has trully surpassed Jay-Z in his powerful and thoughtful lyrics and his head knocking beats!!!
B00000JPH6|4.0|So often, \\"fantasy\\" invovles much that is familiar. Elves, wizards, dwarves and dragons are par for the course. \\"The Dark Crystal\\" takes you to an entirely new fantasy realm. Creatures such as gelfling, Skeksis and the like are teh inhabitants of this universe.    The story is very simple and involves the conflict between good and evil. A gelfling, Jen, must heal the crystal controled by the evil skeksis. The crystal was originally damamged long ago and a prophecy states that if a gelfling does not heal it before a certain astronomical phenomenon, the skeksis will rule forever. It is typical \\"go on a heroic quest\\" sort of stuff but it works.    The pseudo-muppet characters demonstrate a wonderful degree of creativity and the artwork is wonderful. The voices of the skeksis threatned to drive me nuts with their whinny quality but I guess that is what you would expect of a bunch of self centered bad guys.    This is a fine movie for young people. It has none of the depth that a production like Lord of the Rings has but it doesn't need that depth. Good fights evil in a simple, adventurous story.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Hey, if you want pure popcorn entertainment that takes you away from your daily worries.....the original trilogy is the best!  Also, on equal ground is the Indiana Jones trilogy.......with these six films you've got a whole lotta fun going on!!
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|This movie is incredible, I can-t believe that someone can make movies like this one, it is wonderful, it is romantic, sad, it deserves the Academy Award.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I never really had a doubt that I would love With Teeth.  Trent Reznor has never dissapointed me and I believe the only way he could would be to stop making music. People complain that this cd took five years to make but i read in a interview that he almost has another one done and plans on releasing it soon, maybe next year. But I think Reznor has finally realized that he needs to come out of the dark and step into the light. What ever he decides to do or change, I will always be there to standing in line the first day to get. His work is really one of the only things I look forward to, so keep on rocking man.
B000087DRK|5.0|OK, I am going to try this again. I think the content of my last attempt at a review did not go over well with the censors.    My basic thesis is that this is a great (and archetypal) showing from a band that does not appear to have been ready-hatched for your 14-year-old nephew by the great music industry Engine of Mediocrity.    TN comes at you nice and hard with a surprising melodic undertone in there that keeps the music mentally interesting. It's definitely not your emo-wuss bilge that makes you beg the band to please grow up, nor is it the trite distorto-crunch mess with some dude trying to growl like he's actually a tough guy.    This is for those of you who would like to get your (...) kicked but would rather not feel like you are a) still working through your teen angst; b) trying to annoy and/or scare your parents (although this will do plenty of that); or c) trying to escape the taint of your middle-class, hyper-feminized, neo-suburban, gotta-go-to-model-UN-so-I-can-get-into-Harvard, the-losers-at-the-soccer-tournament-should-get-trophies-too, upbringing by listening to \\"hardcore\\" music.
1591396190|5.0|A Must-Read for anyone interested in making a difference for his company, his institution or for the public in general. This book gives you the tools to think out of the box and to succeed. It will help you concentrate on the customers needs rather than on your competition.   <br />Kim and Mauborgne have produced a jewel: it is so well written and convincing that, after reading it, you will rethink your strategy in terms of opportunity and not in terms of war.  <br />
B00005JN2Z|1.0|The movie is absurd. Any hit man that had half brain and one who chooses his suits to be handmade from a Hong Kong tailor to \\"blend in\\" would not hire a cab to go around and kill people and maybe, maybe, maybe, he would do this once, but repeat it as a consistent MO. C'mon. All Vincent has to do is go to Yahoo maps and find where these people live.  A previous reviewer said set your Cruise Control to \\"evil\\", how about setting it to \\"pathetically absurd\\" or better yet, you the potential viewer, set it to \\"reverse\\" and don't waste you time watching this drivel.  And by the way what the hell is happening to Michael Mann, going from Daniel Day Lewis in \\"Last of the Mohicans\\", William Peterson in \\"Manhunter\\", and Pacino, Deniro, and Kilmer in \\"Heat\\"--to now, Cruise and the fumbling Jamie Foxx and soon enough Colin Farrell in a \\"Miami Vice\\" remake?  Huh?  This movie sucks a big fat one.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Another album that took 5 years to become a tumor in my cd player. The sound of this album is totally raw and powerful. The addition of live drums is intense. I will admit that trent hasnt really ascended to any level he wasn't previously at, but at least he didn't sell out into some ballad rock format. The IDIOTS who question an electronic 4/4 based beat as 'disco' need to stop listening to electronic music all together and just stick to AOR and Producer/Label created bands. Industrial music began as a 4/4 throb with layers of any device that would add to the collage of sound... Recreation of society in collapse perhaps... just maybe.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Rarely, if ever, does music reach down so deep in my soul and give me chills.  Michael Buble's beautiful, clear, expressive voice is simply awesome.  Wow.<br /><br />When I first saw his commercial, I thought he was just some punk who was trying to be Harry Connick, Jr.  Boy, was I ever wrong!  Don't make the same mistake I almost did.  Listen to a few clips and hear for yourself just how amazingly talented this guy is.  Outstanding!
B000929AJQ|4.0|You know I read the bunk reviews below that many people have written and I went in expecting nothing from this album besides the first song being a hit, well guess what, many of these songs rock!!  #5 \\"Love in not enough\\" makes me feel as if I am in the French Quarter bar the Dungeon in 1995.  #8 \\"Only\\" has the best lyrics I ever heard.....\\"Yes I'm alone, then again I alway was.....I just made you up to hurt myself and it worked.\\"  12 monkeys type of stuff there!  The beats, guitar and lyrics seem to flow.  Remember all the instrumentals on previous albums, well Trent speaks out on this one.  Sit back and Enjoy!
0385484518|3.0|\\"Tuesday with Morrie\\" seems to be more about Mitch Album than Morrie Schwartz. <br />It claims to give lessons about life greatest lessons but it doesnt. Album's life and his commentary <br />overshadow everything on the insights and last days of Morrie. <br /> <br />It is a fast reading book in that it skips around alot with flash backs, to the present and to his so called <br />visits to Moorie.  Album doesnt let Morrie speak for himself for he inserts his own interpretations of his own <br />insights that overshadow and overcome everything Morrie says. <br /> <br />One lesson in life is to be quiet and listen, let the speaker speak and let the listeners come to their own <br />relevance and interpretation of what is being said. <br /> <br />Seems this book is more about Mitch than its about what Morrie had to say. <br /> <br />
B0007VNGX0|4.0|This review is really aimed more at the UMD version for the PSP. If you want a review of the movie, there are plenty of those here...<br /><br />After placing the UMD in the PSP, it's immediately obvious that even at full volume, the built-in audio for the PSP just won't cut it for movies. The dialog is barely audible, while the explosions, gunshots, etc. are blaring. To combat this, try a couple of things:<br /><br />1. Access the movie menu and increase the volume output<br /><br />2. Turn off the volume limiter<br /><br />3. Use some external speakers or headphones<br /><br />4. Turn off the EQ - EQ should be flat<br /><br />I used some speakers for the movie, and the experience was great. I hadn't seen the movie before, and it looked great on the PSP's screen. Of the PSP's UMD titles available, this is one of the better ones.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I'm not sure what drives all the negative reviews. I've started using the tape of this workout when I lived in a dorm in undergrad school, and it (fairly quickly) got me in the best shape of my life. The workout is, indeed, challenging, even after using it for a while. I've never had an issue with any injuries while using this tape. I didn't need to lose weight, but I did need to tone up, and this video helped tremendously. It's been a few years since I've used it last (the tape belonged to my roommate), and I am grateful to find that it's out on DVD. I'm looking forward to returning to this workout set (which can't be said about too many workout videos), and I know it works - I've seen the results before. The leg workout, in particular (ladies - I know it matters!), literally kicked my (...) - away. That's where I always gain weight first, and the exercises are very challenging, yet very effective.    It's always true that watching your form during exercise is important, but I've never thought there was any issues with the form Cindy uses in the video. Just be careful, as with any other exercise program.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is my favorite album of 2005 so far. Mariah sounds terrific and I can't stop listening. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" represents the Mariah we all know and love. \\"We Belong Together\\" is destined to become a classic. Mariah is one of the few female vocalists that can truly make a ballad dynamic and memorable. This CD is a must for all Mariah fans.

0670033375|5.0|This is not a quick read, an easy read, or a particularly fun read. It is, however, a must read for anyone concerned about our future.<br /><br />In _Collapse_, UCLA geographer Jared Diamond explores the question of \\"how societies choose to fail or succeed.\\" In the book's 560 information-packed pages, he studies societies that have disappeared, including Polynesians on Easter and Pitcairn islands, the Anasazi of the American Southwest, the Maya, and the Norse in Greenland. He also examines several current societies experiencing varying degrees of disintegration or risk -Rwanda, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, China, Australia and, surprisingly, Montana.<br /><br />Early on Diamond rejects simplistic models. He notes that many ancient societies damaged their environments, but refutes that as the sole reason for societal failure. \\"There are always other contributing factors,\\" he writes. He proposes a framework of five major factors that he thinks apply in almost every case--environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, over-dependence on trade partners, and a society's response to its environmental problems. Much of the rest of the book is an extremely detailed sifting through what is known about societies that have collapsed and societies currently at risk, in the light of these factors.<br /><br />Diamond's mastery of detail is amazing. He seems to have absorbed and summarized all of the salient history, archaeology, climatology, sociology, polynology (the study of pollen grains) and just about every other source of information about each of the times and places he analyzes, down to the level of individual rulers, specific events, even individual farms.<br /><br />This wealth of detail makes for slow going, but it insulates Diamond from the pitfalls that seem to trip up many discussions of these issues. Diamond dodges political, ideological, and academic presuppositions, and instead relies on the best evidence, keen observation, and commonsense reasoning.<br /><br />Several themes emerge again and again. Deforestation cut the Easter Islanders off from the rest of Polynesia, and kept them from going to sea to fish. It also was a factor in the demise of the Anasazi in a totally different environment. Invasive plants and animals, often introduced deliberately frequently turn up as likely culprits, for example rats on Easter Island and rabbits in Australia. Many societies made maladaptive choices, often clinging to traditional values and \\"solutions,\\" that led them on to collapse.<br /><br />Diamond also shows us some of the dynamics of collapse. Many societies, it seems, fell apart within a few decades of their peak in terms of population and power. These precarious peaks were usually built on over-exploitation of their environment, aggressive subjugation of neighbors, and an increasing distance between the elite and their subjects. Warfare and rebellion often seem to have been the proximate causes of collapse, but these in turn were often caused by other factors. Problems may take centuries to reach critical levels, but once they do, the end can come quickly.<br /><br />I found Diamond's exploration of how societies adapted or failed to adapt to their challenges the most relevant to today's world. Some societies, he shows, adapted remarkably well to threats such as deforestation. One example is Japan, where a series of shoguns clearly recognized the extent to which the island had been deforested, and introduced a series of very effective measures to solve the problem. Today, despite Japan's dense population, close to 80% of the country is forested. (To be fair, Diamond also points out that Japan now leads the developed world in devouring third world forests).<br /><br />In contast, Diamond makes a convincing case that the Greenland Norse would have had a much higher chance of surviving if they had been willing to stretch their identity as European farmers to incorporate Innuit kayak-making, fishing, and whale-huntingtechniques. The Norse did not, so when a worsening climate and reduced trade stressed them, they were unable to survive.<br /><br />Incidentally, Diamond was at his best in describing Innuit technology. His description, starting on page 258, of his first encounter with a whale-hunting kayak, in which he compares it to \\"a miniature version of the long, narrow, fast battleships of the U.S.S. Iowa class . . .\\" is the most insightful and respectful appreciation of indigenous technological prowess that I've ever read. (I remember being struck by the degree to which Diamond showed similar appreciation for the intelligence and capability of indigenous and non-Western people in his Pulitzer Prize winning book, _Guns, Germs and Steel_.)<br /><br />Another point that I thought Diamond made convincingly was that it would be extremely naïve of us to rely on technology to save us from the risk factors that we are piling up around ourselves. While it's true that new technologies-for example the Green Revolution-may avert or delay an impending disaster, they equally often create whole new problems.<br /><br />As he brings his discussion to bear on the present, Diamond summarizes a dozen current threats: global deforestation and habitat destruction, the collapse of fisheries, loss of biodiversity, loss or destruction of soils, rapidly rising energy use, shortages of fresh water, exploitation of more than half of Earth's capacity for photosynthesis, toxic wastes, the spread of alien species, natural and human-caused climate change, and a still-burgeoning world population whose impact is multiplied by the rapidly rising standard of living in countries such as China and India.<br /><br />Still, Diamond professes to be guardedly optimistic about the future. He believes that we have the capacity to solve our problems and avert the disasters that have befallen many previous cultures and civilizations. But if and only if we recognize the problems and work together rationally, pragmatically, and promptly to solve them.<br /><br />He offers as a model the Netherlands, twenty percent of which is below sea level, in the form of dike-protected fields called polders. \\" . . . we're all down in the polders together,\\" Diamond quotes one of his Dutch friends as saying. \\"If the dikes and pumps fail, we'll all drown together.\\"<br /><br />Diamond's bottom line? \\"Because we are the cause of our environmental problems, we are the ones in control of them, and we can choose or not choose to stop causing them and start solving them.\\"<br /><br />I have an idea. Buy _Collapse_. Read it. Then send your copy plus a heartfelt note to someone in Washington or someone who heads a multinational corporation, someone who has yet to grasp the first part of that statement, much less made the decision to help solve the problem.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (Wiley, 2002), and _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_ (Wiley, 2004)., and whale-hunting techniques.

B000929AJQ|3.0|I'm not feeling this album as well as I felt TDS and The Fragile. Perhaps I was hoping it would be more meditative, and less dancey/poppy. Even the songs that are supposed to sound a bit harsh and dark seem to be lacking a certain element of nihilism or something. I could go on about the aspects that I don't like, but the main fact is that I'm just not feeling any strong emotions from these songs. The album isn't completely awful though... just kind of mediocre and unexciting.
B000022TSY|3.0|The best part of this DVD is the bonus \\"Making of Easy Rider\\" documentary.  It unintentionally helps to deflate all the current bloated ideas about the significance of this movie.  Take this movie for what it is: a film with two hippies enjoying freedom by riding cool bikes through beautiful scenery with cool music.  Add to it some good acting by Jack Nicholson (which offsets Peter Fonda's atrocious acting) and some fairly good documentation of the zeitgeist, and it's certainly worth 90 minutes of your time.  But don't look to this as a profound comment on life and society, because it's too mixed up and/or lightweight.   <br /> <br />Why was it mixed up?  Partially because everyone except the cinematographer was stoned all the time, including the director Dennis Hopper.  No one was really in charge.  Everyone had big ideas for how things should go, more than half the dialogue was improvised, and lots of other things were determined on the fly as well (after huge arguments). The funniest revelation in the \\"Making Of\\" documentary was the fact that Hopper's original cut of the movie was three hours long! He apparently thought he was making a huge statement with this thing, but it really just shows his lack of directorial judgement and clear concept of what he was trying to accomplish. <br /> <br />There's a lot of silly, amateurish symbolism in the film: the scene where Peter Fonda throws off his watch, the simultaneous horseshoeing and motorcycle tire-fixing, the \\"Wyatt\\" and \\"Billy\\" cowboy stuff, etc.  The \\"Making Of\\" documentary reveals that the guys thought they were packing the film with a lot of other symbolism as well, none of it very well done: the cemetary statue that Peter Fonda talks to is supposed to represent the Statue of Liberty; when the plastic tube full of drug money is being shoved inside Peter Fonda's Stars and Stripes gas tank, that's supposed to represent money screwing America; and so on.   <br /> <br />When the guys producing/directing a film have no real focus,  are making it up as they go along, have no self-editing abilities to begin with, then aggravate that problem by staying stoned all the time, it's expecting too much for there to be a coherent end product.  What is the message of this movie anyway?  There's probably a little morality tale in there somewhere, something along the lines of \\"freedom is good, prejudice is bad\\", but to read much more than that into it is to wander into a thicket of half-constructed themes that aren't very well thought out or presented. <br />   <br />So, don't take it too seriously.  It's definitely better than the rest of the biker films of the era, because it doesn't rely on the scandalous antics of depraved Hell's Angels-types.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000DG1R|5.0|Duran Duran could very well be the most underrated group of the 1980's. With big acts such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince and \\"The Boss\\" ruling the charts it's easy to see why Duran Duran could be overlooked. Dubbed \\"The Fab Five\\" Duran Duran produced many memorable hits and videos, such as \\"Girls on Film\\" , \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\" , \\"Rio\\", \\"The Reflex\\" and \\"Wild Boys\\" to name a few. It was groups like Duran Duran that really brought MTV to the forefront in the early and middle 80's. Unfortuantely the original band dismembered to soon when in 1985 when Andy and John Taylor (no relation) left to form \\"The Power Station\\" with Robert Palmer while Simon LeBon, Nick Rhodes and Roger Taylor formed Arcadia. Duran Duran was reduced to a trio in 1986 with Lebon,Rhodes and Roger Taylor.  <br />Anyway, this album has it all from \\"New Moon on Monday\\" to \\"Notorius\\" to \\"Is There Something I should Know\\" \\"Planet Earth\\" \\"Save a Prayer\\" \\"Union of the Sanke\\" \\"A View to a Kill\\" and even includes their two top ten hits in the early 90's \\"Come Undone\\" and \\"Ordinary World\\" plus more. This is an awesome compilation by one of the best groups of the 1980's and my personal favorite. If you are a big fan of \\"The Fab Five\\" this is a definite must for your collection!
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|The 3 stars are for Matt Damon and the erotic scene where he takes the girl out of the tram and takes her to the staircase. Was I the only one turned on? <br /> <br />The other 0 stars are for the horrible filming of the movie. Who the hell puts a camera on their shoulder and runs around trying to catch up to the actors? I can see that crap on the show COPS. I was so dizzy and nauseous by the end of the movie. <br /> <br />Way to ruin the movie, mr. director and mr. so-called camera man! If ya didn't want us to watch your movie \\"the way it was intended,\\" then you shouldn't have bothered filming.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Ryan Adams is a true talent and I've enjoyed watching him grow and impress me with each release. COLD ROSES in no different. This album follows up his wonderful LOVE IS HELL album. Here we have 18 tracks spread over two discs, and it's unlike anything he's done before. I would list highlights but truthfully the whole thing is an experience. Not one bad track here. He has a beautiful voice and his lyrics are painfully honest and truthful. I wish more people knew about him, because a lot of people are missing out on a true talent here. Check it out!
B0006FFRVQ|4.0|I've had no problem with this or any other DualDisc. The warnings are included because the DDs are slightly thicker than the standard for CDs and thus do not qualify under the redbook guidelines to carry the official CD logo - the labels are playing CYA. While I've read of isolated problems here and there, they seem to be limited to a small handful of players and, in a few cases, authoring problems on the part of the label. Most users posting to various audiophile websites report being able to play these without trouble. <br /> <br />Also, you don't exactly get a \\"DVD\\" as in a full length video on this one. The appeal of this particular release is the high-resolution DVD-A layer. If you don't have a DVD-A player, the extra value of the DD here is marginal (standard-res 5.1 mix); if you do have a dedicated hi-res DVD-A player, it's doubtful you'd be playing the CD layer anyway. <br /> <br />Regarding the program itself, it's a good pop-oriented set from Krall, though nothing special. Special kudos go to her new guitarist, Anthony Wilson. He's been doing great stuff on his own for a few years, and is a solid addition to her band. The hi-res surround mix isn't flashy, but works well to bring you into the middle of the band.
B00005JKJA|5.0|\\"There's a man . . . in back of this place. He's the one who's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face. I hope that I never see that face ever outside of a dream.\\" <br /> <br />After you watch this twice, I recommend watching the 'reality' parts followed by the 'dream.' A dream is an amalgam of (1) everyday events consisting of both minor and major events in one's life from both the past and the 'near' present and (2) fantasy. Things will become much clearer after this third viewing. <br /> <br />One thing that should be clear to even the most confused viewers is that this movie has an extremely intriguing and important storyline which Lynch twists and mangles and manipulates to fit the mental state of the main character. By doing this, he creates a uniquely personal experience for us.  <br /> <br />This movie is not the least bit gimmicky, the plot is an excellent one, but Lynch is clearly not satisfied with simply an interesting story, he must bend it and warp it in order to fuse it with a psychological theme that ends up making the entire experience MORE real, not less. <br /> <br />If you cannot understand or figure any of this out, then just try and appreciate the quality acting, first-rate directing and mesmerizing visuals and relax.
B0002V7ODS|5.0|I seldom ever write reviews - if somebody likes things I do not like (or viceversa) they are wellcome to it. As they say, de gustibus.... <br /> <br />I only have one question to Guillermo Del Toro - can I have another one?!! Please, please please make the second one. I do not want to part with Ron Perlman as Hellboy and with others. I loved every moment of it, I want more!
0380789035|5.0|With \\"American gods\\", Neil Gaiman, one of the most imaginative authors of his generation, creates his own pantheon of old and new gods living in the present United States. His main character, though, is a common man, just released from prison after his wife suddenly died in a car accident. On his way to her wake, he finds the mysterious Mr. Wednsday, who offers Shadow a job as a handyman. Mr. Wednsday is not who we think he is, but neither is Shadow, and, in fact, neither is any character in this book.<br /><br />As Shadow makes his errands through the backroads of America, he begins to see there's a storm coming, and a war within this storm. A war between gods, the ancient ones and the modern ones. Shadow, a man with no identity, with no beliefs, is caught in the middle of the approaching storm. As Gaiman describes Shadow's life after his release from prison, he introduces a grand variety of unusual characters - gods, jinns, daemons, fairies, computer and technological entities, creating a tale very different from everything I had read until now. Interestingly, it's not the gods' stories that make \\"American gods\\" a great book, but Shadow's tale, his detached amazement, his coin tricks and his seemingly lack of illusion about life. Nevertheless, Shadow will be drawn to what is happening around him, and he will play an important part in the battle.<br /><br />\\"American gods\\" is an unusual book. It's very difficult to understand it at first, but once the reader grasps what Gaiman is trying to tell, the reading becomes very pleasant.<br /><br />Grade 8.9/10
0689504764|1.0|I'm sorry to be the party pooper here, but this is an awful book, which might not be the writer's fault, since it's based on a terrible song.  The activities along the way are fun enough. But if a child's book is supposed to be fun, it's also supposed to teach little life lessons.  What does this one teach?  My 3 year old is terrified of the book.  He says the bear is mean.  I say, \\"Why?\\"  \\"Because he looks big and scary.\\"  So my kid has learned that big, scary-looking, unknown things are mean (if you haven't read the book, the bear does nothing \\"mean\\"--he's just hanging out in his cave).  More--if they're provoked and they chase you, it's because they're mean (not because a bunch of kids provoked them).  At the same time, my kid loves Shrek, and I love the fact that it teaches him to look beyond surface appearance, to face a big, scary thing and learn about it--not to call it mean when you don't know it, not to bother it and run.  The book's just screwy.
B0000041TD|5.0|I own two recordings of Puccini's La Boheme, and this one is my favorite. I love this set, the recording is excellent. Pavorotti and Freni are magnificent in this version. This is just an excellent opera. It is so beautiful and touching. It is one of my all time favorite opera's.
0930289331|5.0|Batman before he was Batman, great stuff. I love the part when Cat woman comes in and seeing Commissioner Gorden 10 years younger doesn't hurt much either. All in all a solid work, almost as good as Bruce Timm and all his work for the animation (the only guy who can draw batman the way he looks). But then hey, we all had a stab at drawing batman. Haha! Lol!
B0002OERI0|5.0|That all changed with this CD.  Yeah, the song American Idiot took some getting used to but now I like it ok.  The rest of the album is absolutely great.  I listen to this over and over again and am still not tired of it.  I love this cd!!!  Give it a chance and you will be pleasantly surprised.  I have never been a fan of Green Day, in fact i've always hated them...can't say that now with this album.
B000929AJQ|5.0|The accessible music on With Teeth is incredibly catchy, and it shows that not all rock music these days has to be utter crap. For me, there was at least two or three weak tracks on each previous NIN album, except for Broken and Still. With Pretty Hate Machine, those tracks were That's What I Get and Kinda I Want To. With The Downward Spiral, it was Ruiner and Big Man With A Gun. With The Fragile, it was Where is Everybody, Even Deeper, and The Big Come Down. With With Teeth(HA!) there is only one weak track in my opinion, and that is Love Is Not Enough. All the rest of the songs, especially Right Where It Belongs and Only, compel you to listen more, and sing along. The first track, \\"All The Love In The World,\\" makes me want to dance, strip, and make love at the same time. Not many songs bring that side of me out. \\"The Hand That Feeds,\\" is one of the catchiest rock songs I've heard in a long time. I have Trent to thank for that. I've listened to this album about seven times now, and I highly recommend it to anyone with good taste in music. This is a great album to introduce someone into the more complex and not as catchy NIN albums. My mom, who is currently 53 years old, likes most of the tracks on this album, particularly All The Love In The World, Only, and Right Where It Belongs. This record will probably be the best one to come out in 2005. Thank you Trent, for you have created another great album that will be greatly remembered(at least in one fan's eyes).
0780628551|5.0|As a piece, the cover mainly sold me because of Theron. Just watching the film, I watched it on its own merits, and it was a neat ride. If you take on too much baggage when viewing any movie, or reading some books for that matter, you lose the fun. <br />It might very well be a Candy floss sort of movie, but I enjoyed it. People enjoy all sorts of simple things, not filling, not nutritious, but they still enjoyed it. Hell, why analyse it if you enjoy it ? <br />I had fun. Nice and fluffy, vacuous and entertaining. <br />Grab the popcorn, park the brain, and have a nice time ... at this price, its worth the while. <br />
B0002RNXNM|4.0|Well, it's about time Manchester got a revival -- it's been around fifteen years since bands like the Happy Mondays and Stone Roses erupted onto the music scene. Now with late-70s and mid-80s music being revived in newer, trendier bands, it's about time we got to England in the late-80s and mid-90s.<br /><br />Enter Kasabian, a Leicester band who put out catchy, synthy, and extremely entertaining rock'n'roll. What does their self-titled album sound like? Well, it has some echoes of those Manchester greats, except that it has a synth edge over those heavy riffs. Add in some very radio-friendly melodies, which are almost guaranteed to get these guys noticed by the media.<br /><br />Not that that's a bad thing -- they resemble fellow electro-Manchester band South, which happens to be among my favorite Britpop bands. Kasabian is just lighter. They kick things off on a strong note with the expansive \\"Clubb Foot,\\" which pairs gritty rock with sweeping synth, over Tom Meighan's languid vocals.<br /><br />Fortunately this is not one of those albums that has one good single, and then gets lazy. Things stay catchy and gritty, all throughout the album, with heavy riffs and steady rhythms, and Kasabian keep their style varied enough that listeners won't be left thinking, \\"Oh man, are they playing that riff AGAIN?\\"<br /><br />Not to mention the singing: Meighan has a very strong, melodious voice. In almost every song, he sings slow and lazily. He sounds either stoned or inattentive, except for a few wonderful songs where he sounds completely into what he sings. \\"John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD/Interested in mind control and how the monkey held the key/Said that all life is experiments somebody's planning for the heir/It's for the unexpected citizens who hallucinate in fear,\\" he purrs happily.<br /><br />Yeah, it can get pretty heavy. but the music is also tempered with an ethereal edge -- there's a brief interlude which is all muffled riffs, deep synth and angelic vocals. At the very least, all that synth serves to lighten up what could have been a dark album, and adds an epic edge to what could have been terribly ordinary music.<br /><br />The flaw? It gets a bit fragmented, with two peppy electronic \\"interludes\\" sitting between harder rock'n'roll. They're pretty, but they feel out of place.<br /><br />Things climax with hints of another possible direction for them to go in: \\"U Boat,\\" a rich soundscape that fades away into silence... before fading back into a different mix of \\"Reason is Treason.\\" It's all hard angles and explosions, and if anything, this mix is even better than the radio-friendly original. (Talk about having your cake and eating it too)<br /><br />One of the few albums that is catchy and musically rich, Kasabian's debut is one of the best releases this year. It's reminiscent of Britpop greats, but somehow that doesn't matter -- they're original enough to have their own fun sound.ynth and angelic vocals.

B000929AJQ|3.0|I love NIN... but this CD is crap. I'm tempted to give it only 2 stars. Why did it take Trent five years to make this? There isn't one track that stands out on this album!! I'm glad I didn't have to buy this CD because then I would have to go through the trouble of reselling it here on amazon. I will continue to listen to the old NIN, which I love deeply- PHM, Downward Spiral, Broken, Fragile......<br /><br />the only people who are going to say they like this album are the people who are denial... they can't admit that Trent blew it on this one.<br /><br />If this is the evolution of NIN- I'll stay stuck in the past... this CD is boring.
B00000BKDV|5.0|It you were to choose your first Maiden album, this should be it. It is not their best, but it captures the essence of the band perfectly. Unlike Seventh Son, for example, it is not heavy on lyrics and latent meanings, so it is easy for beginners to get into. It is also the band's first album with Nicko McBrain on the drums, and this group - McBrain, Dickinson, Harris, Smith, and Murray - proceeded to produce some of the Maiden's best albums.      <br /> <br />Now, to the contents:  <br /> <br />Where Eagles Dare is a classic opener - aggressive, fast, and will get you right into the Maiden frame-of-mind. It is also quite repetitive, which may become boring if you listen to it often.  <br /> <br />Revelations is one of their greatest ever. It is not a typical Maiden song, as it is slow and melancholic at times, but herein lie its true beauty and uniqueness. The guitar solo is great, and the lyrics are touching, if abstruse.  <br /> <br />Flight of Icarus is one of their most famous. Based on the myth of Icarus and Daedalus, it tells the story of the boy who flew too close to the sun. It is short but powerful.  <br /> <br />Die with Your Boots On is not a great song, but it ends very nicely with a guitar solo and Dickinson's \\"they died with their boots on\\" screams. The guy has the best male voice in the history of music.  <br /> <br />The Trooper may be their most famous and successful song ever. Aggressive, fast-paced, and speaking of war and death, it is a Maiden classic. Smith and Murray do a great job on the guitars.  <br /> <br />Still Life is great particularly because of the lyrics. Dark, mysterious, and macabre, it speaks of nightmares meshing with reality, and, of course, death. The entire Maidenian spirit is captured in this song.  <br /> <br />Quest for Fire is short and boring, but it contains an excellent guitar solo.  <br /> <br />Sun and Steel is short, highly repetitive, and one of their worst ever.  <br /> <br />To Tame a Land is a perfect piece to end an album. Written by Harris and based on the series of \\"Dune\\" sci-fi books, its pace changes frequently and it ends with a fantastic guitar solo, one of their best solos ever.  <br /> <br />In summon, while not their greatest album, it is nonetheless a masterpiece that every Maiden enthusiast should cherish.
B0007GAERG|4.0|The only song that bugs me on this cd is \\"Get your #\\"  I wish someone would do a rap Intervention on Mariah and convince her that she needs to Move on. (Please move on girl).  The rap works sometimes but limit it to one song per album. \\"We Belong 2gether\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" have become some of my favourite mariah songs of all time.  \\"Circles\\", \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Stay the Nite\\" and \\"Say Somethin\\" also stand out. I can't believe that I'm actually starting to like \\"One and Only\\" when I hated that song.  I guess people should wait at least 2 weeks before they review an album.  I've been listening to Mariah since 1989 so I'm allowed to be analytical and fussy  of her music, I've earned my right.  That's a REAl fan!

0451169514|5.0|Again, Stephen King has come up with a brilliant book. It turned out as any other horror book. The bad person wins the battle, but good guys won the war. The book turned out to be a good story even better than the movie. The only thing was, it was a long book. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the characters like William Denbrough, the clown, and the other characters was amazing.The decussions between the characters just pull you in. You just need to know what's going to happen next. They just talk about what happen in the past during their childhood. That's what I like about Stephen Kings books you just can't seem to put the book down. <br />  <br /> I recommend this book to anyone who loves horror books. As a little kid watching this movie all the time made me think about the book versionof it. The book turned out to be great. The book book gives great details it explains them real well. The book just keeps you guessing on what's going to happen next. <br /> <br />
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I first saw BE on video rental, then I watched the director's cut, and the ending was very sad, when she was giving birth and he died. It made me cry. The movie is well acted but the story is very sad and disturbing. I DID NOT LIKE THE PART WHEN THE DOG WAS SET ON FIRE!!!! And whoever did has problems because that was horrible. There is alot of violence in the film, but what do you expect with a rated R version. Amy Smart is a very talented young actress and gives an unforgettable performance as the estranged girlfriend who was abused by her father. Both versions were sad, and both endings, but especially when he has to save everyone by wiping out his own existence by not being born, which the psychic said he was never meant to be alive, a still-born was suppose to be his fate. If you put all the tragedies together, it's a depressing story about fate, and how changing one thing can cause a rift of disaster. I think this is the first serious film Ashton Kutcher has done. I wish that it wasn't so sad and dark.
0142004235|2.0|My problem with this book isn't its length, because to me length is an asset when the book is fascinating-I didn't feel the length of Crime and Punishment, Anna Karenina, Mandela's Long Walk to Freedom, and these are all 500 page plus books.  <br /> <br /> The problem with this book is that although there is a sort of guilty pleasure involved that keeps you going for a very long time-how evil is this woman?-it does not pay off.  We all enjoy stories about fictional characters without a conscience, because it creates all kinds of interesting possibilities.  But after a while, the heavy symbolism of Cain and Abel, the repeating family tragedies, and so on, become tedious and the book just drags on and on until you just can't wait for it to be over.  This is not an indictment of Steinbeck (or Oprah, whose book recommendations are usually very good), because I've liked other writings of his and he is certainly an American treasure in his depiction of so many early twentieth-century experiences, social situations, etc.   <br /> <br />This book didn't really have much of a moral in my opinion, which is fine, but the writing style wasn't good enough to compensate for a lack of it and to stand alone based on the beauty of the writing.
1592400876|5.0|Being a future secondary English teacher, this book really made me look at learning and talking about punctuation in a fun, sarcastic and critical way. Truss really illustrates the \\"downfall of punctuation in society\\" with hilarious but far too familiar examples in pop culture. From a future teacher's point of view, this book really shows the value of knowing correct punctuation with rules clearly spelled out. She writes her book in a way that notices the value of punctuation in every day life; this is exciting for any teacher who struggles with the question from students \\"When am I ever going to use this?\\".  <br /> <br />Being a teacher in the future, Truss pointed out to me that technology will have an immense impact on the writing of our students. As they are engaging in email, texts messaging and who knows what else, our students could lose the rules all together. Truss invites her readers to join in the fight against bad punctuation by stating \\"sticklers unite!\\". Not only does the book entertain with Truss' side-splitting British wit, but she also teaches you something along the way. She gives the history of punctuation and guide on how to use even less familiar punctuation like the dash, the hyphen, and the semicolon. This book could be used in the classroom, in conversations with friends, or as a manual for any corrector.  <br /> <br />Though I personally enjoyed this book, there are pieces of the population who may find Truss snobby and over the top. But, being a future English teacher, I feel that Truss did a great job inviting even those who aren't particularity interested in punctuation to think about making things correct. This is a triumph in my opinion. While Truss may go over the line in bringing white-out and a pen with her to correct signs, this book definitely has value for anyone who wants to be more confident in punctuation usage and who doesn't mind being amused along the way.  <br /> <br />
0312983867|3.0|I think this is when the series really began to decline.  I read and loved and laughed out loud at the previous seven adventures of Ms. Plum.  However, suddenly things became tiringly repetitive, but worst of all, Stephanie betrayed Morelli by finally giving in to temptation with Ranger.  I know, they were broken up at the time, and Ranger certainly sounds cool, but I still think it was a betrayal.  It's obvious that Steph is meant to be with Morelli.  In the beginning of the series I applauded Stephanie's resilience, humor, and independence.  <br /> <br /> By the time you get to the eighth book I felt like Stephanie's mother.  Why won't Stephanie settle down with Morelli?  Fact is, she is continually putting her hamster, her grandmother, and all who love her in constant danger with her blundering bounty-hunter mishaps, and while that's cute at first, you start wondering why she needs to torture those who care about her after awhile.  The series gave me great fun but I think Janet should wrap it up real soon with a happy ending-Morelli, marriage, (Lula as a bridesmaid, that would be something), and then start a new series.   <br /> <br />Clearly the lady has talent and an amazing sense of humor, but I think this character's outstaying her welcome.
006054094X|1.0|Dear John, I don't want to discourage you from lending/giving me books.  But 1421 is just too much.  I was sceptical of the scholarship of a British submarine officer with no Chinese language and no scholarship credentials.  It seemed unlikely that he would be the discoverer of a long lost Chinese civilization, and the chronicler of its achievements.  I recall that you had reservations about his conclusions, and that's one of the reasons you shared the book with me.  Well, I didn't take notes, but in the first three chapters alone we have ample evidence to conclude that 1421 is just so much historical fiction.  It's too much to believe that Vasco de Gama and other Portuguese exporers had utilitarian navigation charts (as opposed to ornamental ones), that were developed by the 1421 Chinese armada.  For the Chinese to have made charts of the accuracy credited by Captain Menzies, they would have had to have been able to determine longitude.  For this they would have to know that 1) the earth was spherical, 2) that the universe was heliocentric, 3) and have had chronometers accurate to a few minutes a year.  And they would have had to have this knowledge PRIOR to departing.  And they would  have had to have had this knowledge and technology aboard several of the ships in the fleet.  Then there is the matter of the size of the ships.  Four hundred eighty feet?  One and a half football fields?  They might have made a royal barge that size for use on quiet water, but not an ocean-going vessel, and certainly not a fleet of them.  Made of TEAK?  Because of its high silica content, teak woodworking requires carbide-tipped saws and drills which they didn't have.  Their metallurgy was limited to soft ores, such as gold, copper, tin.  They didn't have high carbon steel.  But wait, it gets better: Menzies states they had provisions (including fresh water) for thirty thousand men, enabling them to stay at sea for three months without landfall.  Sorry, this is science fiction.  How do you chart a coast you can't see?  And if you do follow the coastline, reprovisioning is no problem.  The touch I like the best is the billowing silk sails.  Perhaps for a spinnaker on a racing dinghy, but not for the South Atlantic.  Not for the Arctic Ocean.  And not one shred of evidence survived the political holocaust upon their return?  Not one chronometer?  And no ships built over 100 feet for the next three hundred years?  I think that to best enjoy this book the reader has to suspend belief...as you would for fiction.  But then good fiction requires the development and maintenance of creative tension, which is also lacking in what amounts to Captain Menzies' 500 page hypothesis.  Thanks, again for lending me this book; all Chinese history is exciting.  But I put it in the category of \\"Bridges of Madison County,\\" or \\"Flashman,\\" in which the author makes the case that the events COULD have actually happened, even though the reader knows perfectly well that they didn't.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|Hands down, this is my favorite musical film (and I love musical films).  Christopher Isherwood's autobiographical \\"Berlin Stories\\" were adapted for the stage by John Van Druten as \\"I Am a Camera\\" and then as a musical by Hal Prince-John Kander-Fred Ebb-Joe Masteroff.  When the musical finally brought to the screen in 1972 by dance master Bob Fosse, you might have thought the material would have been exhausted.  Think again.  Bob Fosse was a genius.  His direction is absolutely inspired (so good that he won the Oscar).  Jay Presson Allen's screenplay is a marvel - Isherwood couldn't have asked for a more faithful adaptation.  Every detail - art direction, sound, costumes, photography and film editing are superb.  Liza Minnelli (so wonderful in \\"The Sterile Cuckoo\\") won the Oscar for Best Actress.  Joel Grey likewise won the Oscar (he also won the Tony for the same role).  Michael York's performance is perfection.  The question of his character's homosexualty is breathtaking in it's honesty (especially for 1972), and who wouldn't fall in love with York - he's unbelievably pretty.  I love every frame of this brazen and original film musical.
B00000295Y|3.0|This is one of those reviews where I think, \\"Am I listening to the same album as everyone else?\\"  Even 4 stars is a bit too generous.  Don't get me wrong, Black Sunday can be a blast to listen to, but it has many flaws that make it far inferior to their classic self-titled debut.<br /><br />B-Real's high-pitched whine sounded fresh on their debut and it still has certain uniqueness on Black Sunday.  However, lyrically he shows no growth at all.  B-Real often strays back to the same subjects of weed and guns, and the lyrics aren't as clever as they were on the debut.<br /><br />Sen-Dog, on the other hand, isn't much of a rapper; he's more of a Latin version of Flava Flav.  He kicks a few verses here and there, providing a ying to B-Real's yang in terms of voices and vocal dimension, but his main purpose seems to end up being to repeat what B-Real says in each hook in formulaic fashion.<br /><br />The best part about Black Sunday is most definitely the beats.  DJ Muggs provides a great backdrop to B-Real's paranoid rhymes with horns, sirens and haunting basslines everywhere.  The beats never get redundant, and it's hard to imagine Black Sunday sounding any different.  Samples are used kind of sparingly compared to other rap from '93, but songs like \\"Hits From The Bong\\" contain some extremely clever dug-up samples, as opposed to easily-recognizable ones.<br /><br />The last real beefs I have with Black Sunday is that the two interludes in the middle of the album completely destroy what would otherwise be impeccable song pacing.  Also, the album seems a bit rushed, like something's missing; perhaps a result of the formulaic hooks - I can't quite put my finger on it.<br /><br />Other than the flaws (most of them minor), Black Sunday is a blast to listen to.  The songs range from classic (Insane In The Brain, Hits From The Bong, Cock The Hammer) to lukewarm (A To The K).  Fans of the Hill should have this in their collection.  New fans should cop the classic self-titled debut instead, no matter how tempted they are to buy this one because of Insane In The Brain.<br /><br />Best moments: Hits From The Bong (personal favourite), Insane In The Brain, Cock The Hammer, Lil' Putos, I Ain't Goin' Out Like That.f-titled debut instead, no matter how tempted they are to buy this one because of Insane In The Brain. <br /> <br />Best moments: Hits From The Bong (personal favourite), Insane In The Brain, Cock The Hammer, Lil' Putos, I Ain't Goin' Out Like That.
B00008OLIC|4.0|Being a huge fan of both 80's hair metal and hard rock, it is good to see that bands in both of those genres have had their CDS being re-issued lately. And luckily enough,Motley Crue, one of the most talented hair bands of the 80's, have gotten their albums re-issued,and it is great to see that time is being kind to Motley Crue's fifth album, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" (1989). Yes, you read right, this album has finally been re-issued. This, in my opinion, was Motley Crue's best album. It produced Motley Crue classics such as \\"Dr. Feelgood\\", \\"Kickstart My Heart\\", \\"Without You\\", among others, and not only are the songs great, but you get special appearances from artists like Steven Tyler, Bryan Adams, Skid Row,etc. Now this has everything a Motley Crue album needs.<br /><br />My favorite songs: \\"Dr. Feelgood\\", \\"T.nT. (Terror In Tinseltown)\\" (this is like part one of \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" (the song), \\"Slice Of Your Pie\\", \\"Without You\\", \\"Kickstart My Heart\\", and \\"Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\\", which sounds like an \\"ode\\" someone might send out to a snobby ex-girlfriend- listen to the lyrics, it starts off as a very pretty love song, and then it gets to the \\"I Don't Care About You Anymore\\" part of the song- there is a reason why I like this song so much, but I don't know what it is, I just do.<br /><br />As for the re-issuing on this album,there are five bonus tracks: original demos of \\"Dr. Feelgood\\",\\"Without You\\", \\"Kickstart My Heart\\", and \\"Time For Change\\", as well as a demo for a song that was never released at all:\\"Get It For Free\\". The producer of this album, Bob Rock, wrote a few small liner notes inside the album sheets, and Nikki Sixx commented on three of the bonus tracks while Mick Mars commented on the remaining two. I would have liked to see Vince Neil and Tommy Lee comment on one or two of the bonus tracks also,but getting some comments from at least two members of the band is better then not getting comments on the bonus tracks from band members at all.<br /><br />Besides the thing I just mentioned about the liner notes, my only other complaint is that while this CD is enhanced, the only other bonus thing you will get if you pop this CD into your computer is the video for \\"Kickstart My Heart\\". Kind of dissappointing, but this might serve good for people who can't afford Motley Crue's \\"Greatest Video Hits\\" DVD. Again, something is better than nothing.<br /><br />Overall,this is a great album made even greater, and if you are a Motley Crue fan, then pick up the re-issued version of this album. It can't get any better than this. If you enjoyed this album, then I also recommend all of Motley's albums (studio, live, and greatest hits, as well as their box sets)and if you enjoyed this album, then you will probably like the re-issued versions of the debut albums by both Slaughter and Warrant- the re-issued versions of Slaughter's first two studio albums are \\"Stick It To Ya\\" and \\"The Wild Life\\", and the re-issued versions of Warrant's first two albums are \\"Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich\\" and \\"Cherry Pie\\". Besides this album, I also have all of the albums that I just mentioned, and they all rock, just like Motley Crue does! If Vince, Nikki, Tommy, and Mick all read my review of this, then I have one thing to say to them: Please make a new full-length album!ned about the liner notes, my only other complaint is that while this CD is enhanced, the only other bonus thing you will get if you pop this CD into your computer is the video for \\"Kickstart My Heart\\".

0962477060|5.0|Other reviews have done an excellent job shouting this book's virtues, so I don't really need to rehash any of those details.  I do want to add my stars, though....Back when I started playing guitar (25 years ago), you were lucky to find a book that contained even the modest blues scales all the way up the neck.  You might find a selection of scales and modes in one position...it was up to you to figure out the rest. <br /> <br />This book is particularly useful for the beginning player who hasn't committed scale patterns to memory in the order they are usually presented.  What Edwards presents makes for more sense intuitively.   <br /> <br />I wish I had this book 20 years ago. <br /> <br />
B000929AJQ|5.0|This is a good entry-level disc for the novice NIN fan and a well-waited for album for the hardcore fans who have been waiting for a little under 6 years for new stuff.  (6 years!!) <br />Some of the songs have that dance-type sensibility to them... which will either make you want to smash the CD or dance along wildly.  It depends on what kind of NIN fan you are. <br />Overall, this CD's got a good blend to it.  Kinda reminds me of PHM (Pretty Hate Machine), but with more instruments.
0609610570|4.0|Larry Bossidy is Chairman and former CEO of Honeywell International. Ram Charan has taught at both the Harvard Business School and the Kellogg School of Northwestern University. This book is split up in three sections (consisting of two to four chapters each), plus an useful introduction and conclusion. <br /> <br />In Part I - Why Execution Is Needed, the authors explain the discipline of execution. \\"Execution is a specific set of behaviors and techniques that companies need to master in order to have competitive advantage. It is a discipline of its own.\\" This discipline is based on a set of building blocks that every leader must use to design, install, and operate the three core processes of execution. <br /> <br />These building blocks are described in Part II - The Building Blocks of Execution. I believe that Chapter 3, which describes the leader's seven essential behaviors, is the best of the book. This chapter is followed by Building Block Two - Creating the Framework for Cultural Change. \\"To change a business's culture, you need a set of processes - social operating mechanisms - that will change the beliefs and behaviors of people ...\\" The final chapter in this part discusses human resources management, or having the right people in the right place. A large part of this chapter is based on Bossidy's experience within General Electric (under the leadership of the legendary Jack Welch). <br /> <br />In Part III - The Three Core Processes of Execution, the authors introduce the three core processes required to fulfill the building blocks of Part II. The three processes are the people process, strategy process, and operations process, which are each explained in an individual chapter. \\"Leaders need to master the individual processes and the way they work together as a whole. They are the foundation for the discipline of execution, at the center of conceiving and executing a strategy.\\" <br /> <br />I have re-read this book once I completed Jack Welch's autobiography. Following the first read I was somewhat disappointed as I thought that the title was wrong and was only useful for senior executives and above. I have had to change my mind, the processes introduced should be used at all levels within organizations and not just at top levels. I still believe that the book is somewhat repetitive and although there are some good chapters, it is not worth the 270 pages. This book is useful for people who want to improve their implementation skills and get things done around their organizations.
B000268QB2|5.0|While peripheral similarities may exist with Coldplay and a few others, Keane has created a novel concept of instrumentation for today's pop fare (not unlike White Stripes).  Stripping the players of any pyrotechnic virtuosity tends to place the focus on the solo vocal (yes, this music is virtually devoid of vocal harmony, but you won't miss it!).  And Tom Chaplin is more than up to the task.  His etherial, moody vocals and the band's familiar, but novel changes bring out the outstanding quality of the songwriting and lyrics.  Dipping way back, one may liken this to some McCartney and even Harry Nilsson work.  Likely to be a \\"tailess comet\\" with no real precedent and no real successor.  Enjoy them while they are here!
0800177975|1.0|Last Action Hero had all the markings of being a great film. A good director, good actors (Charles Dance would be a wonderful villian). What made it fall apart was a weak story, and this would follow nearly all of Schwarzenegger's films post True Lies. To say Last Action Hero was rushed is quite an understatement considering John McTiernan did such a marvelous job depicting Bruce Willis and Sean Connery as two badass heroes in two brilliant written stories. If your a Schwarzenegger maniac go ahead and pick it up. But if your looking for that \\"movie within a movie\\" premise, skip this and check out Wes Craven's A New Nightmare.
B000929AJQ|4.0|i have always loved NIN but i get sick of waiting for new releases, why does it take 5 years to make a album? anyway, this album is good....i dont think its a Masterpiece but its a good album. i know dave ghrol, who is a AMAZING drummer, did alot of work on this album with the drums. i dont know what songs dave recorded but the drumming on all the songs are great. so i wouldnt be surprised to know dave did all the drumming...and im glad that trent didnt continue the \\"downward spiral\\" electronical sound and went back to the \\"broken\\" sound...dont get me wrong, i love the \\"downward spiral\\" sound but i always LOVED \\"broken\\" the best....so anyway, GOOD ALBUM, GET IT!!!!!!!!!
038542471X|5.0|I recently just started reading again, thanks to the great Grisham.  About two months ago I picked upt \\"The Pelican Brief,\\" and I've been hooked ever since.  I devoured this book in about a day and a half, and it did not disappoint.  The plot keeps the reader hooked, no matter if they are interested in law or not.  With suicides, murders, and excellent mystery/drama this book is an excellent read.  Grisham makes all aspects of law involved in the book easy to understand even for new Grisham fans.  The book follows true Grisham form with several unexpected twists and turns.  Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone looking for a good book to get lost in.

B0007KTBIU|1.0|Disney was on a roll: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Alladin, and the Lion King.  After The Lion King, it appeared Disney could do no wrong.  Well, Pocahontas dispelled that myth.  While this 10th anniversary edition was carefully put together, it does not hide the fact that at its core is a severely flawed and uninspired movie.  The movie's slow pace makes it somewhat difficult to watch despite the brilliant colors and awesome sound.  Disney fans are used to action and adventure appearing at expected and unexpected moments.  And there's always a love story somehwere.  Pocahontas, however,  is almost devoid of any action and really does not have a love story.  For that matter, there isn't much of any kind of  story.  I am sure that Pocahontas, a legendary figure in our history, deserved a much better treatment that this hauntingly weak Disney dud.
B000000YIQ|4.0|Although not as strong and flowing as the superb \\"Saxophone Colussus\\" this record still contains some very good tracks. In particular I liked the swinging songs of \\"I'm an Old Cowhand\\", \\"Wagon Wheels\\" amd \\"Way Out West\\" which showcase some great solos from Sonny Rollins. <br /> <br />Bassist Ray Brown and Drummer Shelly Manne make worthy contributions with some excellent solos of their own in the rhythm section but feel a little dissapointed with the absence of piano or guitar. When listening to all the songs it sometimes feels in my opinion as if there is something missing eventhough Sonny's playing is mostly wonderful.
B00005Y7LD|5.0|\\"Charmed Life\\" was recorded during a bad motorcycle accident that Billy had, hence as I recall, the title.<br /><br />By 1990, Billy Idol had matured into a rock artist and this album is miles away from the youth appeal of \\"Rebel Yell.\\"  It shows the former Gen-X punk wanting to grow his music and it works.<br /><br />From a kickass version of \\"The Right Way\\" and \\"Prodigal Blues\\" (the originals) to \\"LA Woman\\" to \\"Endless Sleep\\" (the covers) - this album is well produced, well-written and will grow on you.  There really isn't a bad track on this.<br /><br />Steve Stevens had left the fold to pursue a solo career at this stage and Mark Younger Smith shows his guitar chops.  The change of style is refreshing.<br /><br />As a songwriter, Billy peaked with this one.  I didn't much get into \\"Heroin\\" - his next album.  This and \\"Rebel Yell\\" remain indispensable parts of Billy's collection so get it if you can.
B000002UQJ|5.0|I'll be the first to admit it: I'm a Maccamaniac. I have McCartney, Ram, all the Wings albums, Tug of War, Flowers in the Dirt, Flaming Pie, Driving Rain, two live double-albums, and assorted classical and instrumental projects. I've got more Paul than I do John, George, and Ringo combined and doubled. So when I made my latest purchase, 1993's Off the Ground, I figured I had reached the lower echelon of the man's catalogue and was simply rounding out my collection. Suffice to say I was pleasantly surprised.    Flowers in the Dirt from 1989 and the monstrously successful world tour that accompanied it were viewed as a comeback for Paul after his mid-80s slump. Off the Ground might be considered \\"Flowers in the Dirt, Part II\\". Again collaborating with Elvis Costello on a handful of tracks and playing with his touring band, the albums have a similar feel to them; and yet not so similar. For one thing this disc is less produced than its predecessor, while still maintaining a crisp, clean sound comparable to Steely Dan - a few cuts even sound a bit like the Dan (Peace in the Neighbourhood, for instance). It has fewer highs (and lows) as well, but it compensates in overall consistency.    Off the Ground may be Paul's most socially conscious outing to date. Several songs are pleas for peace and animal rights, including the epic closer C'mon People/Cosmically Conscious (orchestrated by the one and only George Martin, no less). Two more McCartney-Costello collaborations grace the record, - Mistress & Maid and The Lovers that Never Were - both of which would have felt quite at home on Flowers in the Dirt. Toss in a few love ballads and one of Paul's punchiest rockers (Get Out of My Way) and you get more than the usual McCartney fare - you get one of Paul's most impressive, balanced offerings. The only downer is Biker like an Icon, a bland bit of the character-sketching Paul is usually so good at, and Winedark Open Sea may be just a minute too long. But apart from that, it's great.    For being such a fine album Off the Ground sold pretty miserably - it is, to the best of my knowledge, Paul's least successful outing commercially at any rate. It deserves better. After being woefully overlooked for years I'd say it earns the dubious distinction of \\"Most Underrated McCartney Record\\", and if that means anything to you Off the Ground is well worth a listen.
B0008ISM40|5.0|First off, dont listen to those complaining that the album is pop, or blah... they have been lost in the dark for too long.  If you have grown up as well, then you will enjoy a different sounding NIN that actually brings Trent back to his begining... who ever said this was Pretty Hate Machine 2 was right on, and its exactly what I wanted to hear... <br /> <br />Now to the important stuff... YOU HAVE TO GET THE DUAL DISC to fully enjoy this one... there are so many things that you can hear in 5.1 stereo surround that you just miss in regular stereo.  This is the way the album was intended to be listened to.
B0000942LT|4.0|There are a bushel of misnomers floating around when it comes to Staind, the most popular one being \\"Staind is for low-life crybabies\\".     Yeah. Right.    With \\"14 Shades of Grey\\", the band's fourth album, they've managed to ease away from the intense catharsis of \\"Break the Cycle\\" and instead reflect on life as it is happening now. This is where Lewis sums it all up in \\"Fray\\":    I know that everything can change,  what I need is to open up again,  so never again will I look back in vain  cause today's not the past,  I don't need to relive it    I approached \\"14 Shades of Grey\\" as a bumbling consumer rather than a fan of Staind, and listened to it in that mindset because I bought the album on the strength of their two hit singles (\\"Price to Play\\" and \\"So Far Away\\"). What I can tell you is that there is a lot to be harvested from this CD, from the great singles to their subtle insights on influence (\\"Zoe Jane\\", about Lewis' daughter, \\"Fill Me Up\\", about Lewis' wife, and \\"Layne\\", about the late great Layne Staley whose talent has obviously rubbed off on Lewis and the rest of the band). As the album winds down, it also tackles absolution and bringing friends out of dark stupors by basically saying \\"Wake up and smell the coffee\\". Yes, Lewis once again analyzes himself in two different lights on two separate tracks, but they aren't as tedious as some might say, although \\"Blow Away\\" tends to disrupt the overall theme of the album. The last track, while not as epic as it strives to be, serves as a plain \\"thank you\\" to his family and fans, and a \\"f**k you\\" to the jaded, the fake, and the judgmental. All in all, it comes to a rightful close.     If you're a skeptic who is deciding whether or not the naysayers are right, take this one out for a spin. I didn't call this one of 2003's best albums for nothing.
B00003CXXS|1.0|Most sequels never seem to live up to the original film, and \\"Jurassic Park III\\" is no exception. The film pretty much rips off from the first film, but they add some new dinosaurs to movie including the deadly Spinenosaurus; the Raptors start showing signs of intelligence. The film is about a boy and his brother wave boarding, one day, on the outskirts of a deserted island. Unfortunately, the boat crashes, and the boy is forced to fend for himself. However, it seems that the island that the boy is stranded on is actually another Jurassic Park that was secretely under development a few years ago. It's now up to the paleontoligist from the original film to go to this island and save this young man before it's too late. The movie fails to offer anything original to the series except for a few new dinosaurs. Overall, I still think fans of the series will still find some things good about this film but don't expect too much out of it.
0670033375|5.0|This is one of the most brilliantly competent books I've ever read, a historical and geographical tour de force of detail and synthesis. One would be hard-pressed to overpraise Diamond's books, this latest being at least as impressive as his Guns, Germs and Steel. From the ancient Mayans and Easter Islanders to brilliant analyses of today's industrial-environmental problems, I can't think of a more recommendable book for anyone with any amount of intelligent concern for the future of humanity on planet earth. When Diamond makes a case, rebuttal is almost unthinkable. Please read this book.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I loved this album. When I listened to it for the first time, I was very impressed by her music. She puts a lot of a emotion into her lyrics and music. I like World on Fire. That song is excellent.  There is not much more I can say about this album. I can sum it up in just one more word. Amazing!!
B000001E3V|2.0|Boring, bloated, overlong, repetitive half-baked arrangements of Clapton classics made even worse by Bobby Whitlock's horrible, intrusive over-the-top \\"backup\\" singing.  <br />2 stars for some nice guitar solos and drummer Jim Gordon's amazing work, but it is not worth the 29 dollars. Better you should buy \\"Wheels Of Fire\\" or \\"Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert\\" or \\"Layla.\\"  <br /> <br />Pass.
B00064MW6A|1.0|Although, this movie is filled with big names like Halle Berry and Sharon Stone, it lacked originality and substance. This movie started off right with it's brief tease of it's originality with scenes of \\"cat woman's\\" origin, but then got lost in the lack of thought in the story line thereafter. Making this movie very predictable and boring.  This movie depended on too many special effects and not enough realism to enjoy the characters. Even the romance scene was lacking the animal attraction and chemistry between the two characters, making their romance a very forgetable one.  Although, Ms.Berry is a very beautiful and attractive woman, this movie focused more on her sexual appeal in a cat suit instead of her ability to act. As she uses her whip and shows some skin to draw audiences, mainly of the male species, her true ability as an actress is over shadowed. Bottom-line: it was very disappointing to say the least.
B000069HJL|4.0|Supertramp were a special band in their own way: they had their typical sound and their way of composing like no other band from the progressive/ art-rock movement. On one side you had Roger Hodgeson, the blessed hi-pitched singer-keyboard player-guitarist-composer and on the other there was Rick Davies, the fantastic composer-keyboard player but unfortunately less blessed singer. <br />This live album was released shortly after \\"Breakfast in America\\", which was the band's first commercial succes due to Hodgeson's (melodic)input. Davies realized that Hodgeson was gaining ground in the band and when watching the video of this concert you can see him desperately trying to draw attention to him with all sorts of stage antics. But being a good composer was not enough and Davies just couldn't make it come true on a live stage with his limited voice compared to Hodgeson's.  <br />Things became rather tense between the two and Hodgeson soon departed pursueing a solo career. <br />As expected Supertramp never really recovered from Hodgeson's departure so this live album has to be the band's swan song. <br />Enjoy !
0316172324|3.0|I'm reading this book now, and I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. Gladwell's a good author, but he has little authority. I suppose I might really buy into this if it were, say, written by an expert in some field... but Gladwell isn't. He's a journalist. It's sort of like- he's not an expert, but he plays one on TV. <br />I looked at the blurb about the author at the end of the book, expecting to see that Gladwell is professor emeritus of (insert esoteric field of expertise here) at (insert over-glorified university here), and on and on and on for the rest of the page and then the name of his golden retriever. But there's only a sentence about him, saying only something like that he writes about science for the New Yorker. The New Yorker's a great magazine, don't get me wrong, but I was hoping for something a little more. Oh well, I guess he doesn't have a golden retriever. <br />Am I just a little bitter that it was his idea to gather up all these other peoples' loosely associated experiences and ideas, package them neatly in a book and get rich off of it before I could? Yeah, okay, I can admit that. I am slightly embittered. <br />But I'll tell you what really gets me. I keep getting fed the same 4-5 sentences and catch phrases over and over and over again, as he tries to pound it in my head that his themes are something more than loosely associated. I'm already very tired of hearing about how much smarter the world's art afficianados are than the stupid scientists that the Getty hired to examine the Greek kouros statue.  <br />That's probably more criticism than the book really deserves. It's actually pretty good, and a very fast read. It's not exactly life changing, and it's not exactly coherent. The connections aren't really all there, but it's still something that you are better off having read.
B0006U4UAU|3.0|Sorry to say the same cannot be said of the second disc of early singles. I am obviously in the minority with that belief, as most reviews I have seen here seem to favour the singles on disc two. They to me are jokey, samey, and thin sounding. Now of course I do  realise this is all part of some movement that never really  caught on called Electroclash, and is supposed to sound \\"dated\\" and \\"Eighties\\". I read enough music magazines to know that much. But I was in high school in the 80's , and this sure doesn't sound like the dance music we listened to. Having said that, I am absolutely crazy about the first disc. While LCD Soundsystem obviously wear their influences on their sleeves ( fans of artists like Wire, Can, Gang of Four and Brian Eno will spot them ) they could have certainly picked worse artists to be influenced by.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|The third season of \\"Gilmore Girls\\" is probably the most perfectly realized year of the series yet released on DVD.  Okay, Lorelai (the amazing and totally hot Lauren Graham) maybe isn't as prominently featured as we would like, but her relationship with Luke keeps deepening in preparation for its full flowering this year in season 5.  Season 3 has lots of action for Rory (the terrific Alexis Bledel): academic pressure during her senior year at Chilton; first friends, then enemies, then friends again with the hilariously nasty Paris (the great Liza Weil) and her airhead flunkies Madeline and Louise; the traumatic dance-marathon break-up with Dean and subsequent stormy relationship with that little punk Jess.<br /><br />The season kicks off with probably my favorite two Gilmore moments, at the beginning and at the end of the episode \\"Those Lazy-Crazy-Hazy Days\\":  Lorelai's dream that she is pregnant with Luke's twins, and their reconciliation in a deserted Luke's diner at the climax.  These two scenes, with their splendid blend of wise-ass humor and genuine emotion, are typical of what makes this series so special.  If you purchase these discs, you just may wear them out by playing them so much.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|I have been a fan of Ryan Adam's music since his time with Whiskeytown.  This is a cross between then and all of his solo releases.  This album is definitely Ryan Adams at his finest.  I would compare it to Whiskeytown's album Pneumonia.  Just the right mix of alt. country and soft rock.  You will find a consistent sound from both cd's with a near perfect blend of acoustic, electric and steel guitars.  This is more proof that Ryan Adam's is one of the great songwriters of our time.  Definitely worth buying for anyone who already is a Ryan Adams or Whiskeytown fan.  If you are unfamiliar with Whiskeytown material, it is worth checking out.
B000929AJQ|2.0|I remember how, in 9th grade, when Pretty Hate Machine had just come out, I played it on an almost nightly basis.  It was definitely a breath of fresh air, and the fact that it sampled both Jane's Addiction and Prince gave me a warm fuzzy feeling. <br /> <br />The Downward Spiral came out my first year of college, and I enjoyed it quite a bit, though I was in the process of growing out of the \\"angst music\\" phase of my life, gravitating more towards bands like Pavement and My Bloody Valentine. <br /> <br />I didn't actually even listen to The Fragile until about six months ago, when a younger industrial DJ friend of mine played it for me.  I was surprised at how good it was. <br /> <br />And now, we have With Teeth.  First off: The first and last songs on the disc are actually quite good.  Unfortunately, everything inbetween sort of flows seamlessly together as a montage of reasonably generic guitar-rock with precious few original hooks and barely a clever lyric to be found. <br /> <br />By the fact that it took him so long to make this album, one would expect something, if not good, at least RADICAL.  Such is not the case.  Again: this is basically just straight-ahead and uninspired guitar rock.  I won't even speculate as to why Trent chose to go this route, but I can virtually guarantee this will be his worst selling album, and for very good reason.  It's not bad, it's something worse: utterly mediocre.  If this was what he was going to release, he should have been able to write it in six months. <br /> <br />
B000929AJQ|2.0|Undoubtedly, anyone who was in their mid-teens and older in 1989 remembers Nine Inch Nails' \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\"  After the era of Madonna, Tiffany, The B-52's, Blondie, Culture Club, and even Billy Idol, Nine Inch Nails appeared with a message far from the typical '80's fare.  Being treated to the likes of \\"Bow down before the one you serve / You're going to get what you deserve\\" and other lyrics which attacked the very core of society, most everyone was shocked.  Perhaps, however, what was more shocking than the release of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" was its success.  Over the course of a few years, Nine Inch Nails established themselves as a band appealing to a new generation, a new mindset, and a new culture, appearing on bumper stickers accross the US. <br /> <br />For five years, countless individuals have waited for this album.  This, however, is not the album we've waited for. <br /> <br />Nine Inch Nails began as the forerunners of the Industria genrel, combining Heavy Metal with synth-beats in an intoxicating manner that proved irresistable to any fan of either type.  Over the last five years, however, Heavy-Metal, Synth-Pop, and Industrial have made enormous leaps and bounds.  Nine Inch Nails has not. <br /> <br />\\"Head Like a Hole\\" defined the group.  \\"Terrible Lie\\" further proved their dominance.  The entirety of \\"The Downward Spiral\\" solidfied NIN place as the pinacle in their genre.  \\"The Fragile\\" gave us a glimpse of the amazing potential they had, stretching through Metal and Synth and Industrial.  \\"With Teeth,\\" however, lacks originality, inspiration, and inventiveness. <br /> <br />The first single, \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" sounds promising, if not a bit typical.  Being somewhat catchy and exciting, it leads one to believe that the rest of the album will follow suit.  Sadly, however, the rest of the album shows quickly that in 2005, this was the best NIN had to offer.  The rest of the album contains sporadic drum beats, no inspiration, and a completely absent chorus.  Long-gone is the originality of tracks such as \\"Closer\\", \\"Starf*ckers, Inc.\\", and \\"A Warm Place.\\"  Instead, NIN has released an album of depressing typicality and regurgitated guitar riffs and choruses. <br /> <br />Sadly, a legend has died.  Time has proven that the era of NIN has long-since come and gone.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Everything Ryan Adams touches turns to gold (pardon the pun). He's done it again with his new release Cold Roses, a double cd that (suprise) doesn't sound like anything he's done before. It's filled to the brim with beautiful and bittersweet laments on lost love, with a voice that will pierce your soul if you let it. Listening to a Ryan Adams cd is akin to sitting down with the man and having a conversation; by the end you feel you know him, and your life is better for it. If you have never heard Ryan Adams it would be difficult to advise someone what cd they should start with, because he changes from day to day, from country (Whiskeytown), sparse folk (Heartbreaker) riff heavy rock and roll, (Rock N Roll) to music that is so brilliant it refuses to be labeled (love is hell) and now comes Cold Roses. I would say you can start anywhere; Everything he has done is far superior to most anything else that is coming out today. <br />Turn off MTV; turn on your mind. It doesn't matter what I say or think, or what the dissenters will claim, the fact is the man is a musical prodigy and he has done it again. Chances are this cd will be playing in my car until this summer when his next masterpiece is released to an unsuspecting world.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Much less one about high school football. However, Friday Night Lights manages to make you care about these kids and the pressure they're under, plus provides some good insights into the small town mentality and the politics involved in public school sports. It also goes to show how relative achievements (don't want to create any spoilers here) not only in competitive sports but in people's perceptions of life.
0767903862|5.0|I never thought a travel book could be laugh-out-loud funny, but this one definitely is.  Bill Bryson travels to Australia, not only to the cities and tourist areas, but also off the beaten path to more unconventional spots.  Packed with informative historical information and tidbits (most of which are likely to shock you) about the oft-misunderstood nation, Bryson mixes in his hysterically funny adventures, told with his unique spin on things.  After reading this book, I not only want to visit Australia, but I am also determined to read more books by Bill Bryson.
B0002OERI0|2.0|I'm going to shoot myself if I hear \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" again. In the face.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This movie epitomizes the decade of Reagan and it was a great and fun ride due to movies like this with a great soundtrack. Why is this movie great? first, it is hilarious with the one-liners from Bender (Judd Nelson).Brian played by Anthony Michael Hall is a nerd in this movie, but a cool dork. Look for the scene when he responds to Bender's question why (brian) is in the physics club. Ally Sheedy playing the nutcase is funny when she dumps her dandruff on her art. Molly Ringwald is funny just being the stereotypical  stuck up \\"princess.\\" Estevez is the cool-head in this movie. <br /> <br />Finally, the song, \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" performed by Simple Minds fits perfectly with the movie. It plays at the beginning with the introduction of the actors and credits. However, it is effectively appropos when it's played at the end when everyone resolves their differences while Verner reads Brian's letter. The movie being filmed in a real high school in the suburbs of Illinois is effective as well. <br /> <br />Teenagers and kids today will realize how bad they have it with the no talent hip hop crap artists they listen to and the crappy movies they see nowadays.SInce the 80's ended, the music has been horrible. People viewing this movie will discover why the 80's had great songs and artists. <br /> <br />This movie is the best high school movie of all-time, but honorable mentions are Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty in Pink, and St. Elmo's Fire due to all their great soundtracks.
0142004235|4.0|East of Eden is the saga of a family and their search for love and acceptance.  The themes in this classic John Steinbeck novel are timeless and presented in such a gifted manner that time and place are transcended. The reader is drawn into a story of siblings  spanning the generations, fighting to define who they are and what their lives are about.  The harm that is done to them in their quest feels staggering and the fathers draw your ire for their failure to just love their sons.  The repetition of mistakes on the next generation of sons is heartbreaking.<br /><br />The characters are full and rich as befits a classic novel.  There are strong and weak aspects to each of them.  In some, the evil pervades their soul, if they have one,and  one can understand the question, \\"Are there some people that are just born soulless.......??\\"<br /><br />This is a novel to be reread many times.  It is complex, and to reach into it's depths could be daunting if you only read it once.  What appears to be the central thought at one age will be completely overtaken by a different reflection after a subsequent reading.
0385512058|1.0|Someone wrote a book on how to make \\"friends\\" and glorified himself the whole way through it, and even better I'm guessing he had his \\"friends\\" write reviews on how helpful it was.  Impressive.  I actually saw Mr. Ferrazzi speak out here on the east coast, and for an hour and a half he spoke about how to build relationships while speaking of every CEO/CMO/COO he's ever met, the book is much the same.  He should of just made a list of names...Larry,Bob,Joseph,Bill,Christian,Henry,Donald, etc...  I'm glad I kept my receipt.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|As most reviews mention, this film basically runs backwards - it's divided into 5-15 minute scenes, each scene ending where the previous scene started.  We meet the hero of the film, Leonard (Guy Pearce, in another great acting job) just as he has murdered a man named Teddy.  So we know what happened (Teddy is murdered), but we don't know why.  It turns out Leonard has brain damage and cannot make new long-term memories.  He can, however, condition himself (in a classical, Pavlovian sense), and so he writes notes to himself, takes pictures, and prints tatoos on his body to keep his life and quest straight.  The quest? - finding and killing the man who murdered his wife.  The first scene implies that Teddy must have been the murderer.  But is he, or is Leonard being set up by someone and can't remember it?  This is the crux of the question that is answered as we learn how Teddy came to be murdered. <br /> <br />The gimmick - playing scenes in reverse order (but the scenes themselves play forward) - is essential for the enjoyment of the film.  First, it puts us squarely in the shoes of the protagonist, who always knows what he's doing, but doesn't really know why.  There are many visual clues - scratches on his face (how did they get there?), a picture of a man he's beaten up, a cryptic message on the photo of Teddy - \\"Don't believe his lies.\\"  Second, the story is too straightforward to view in forward order - watching it in order would be no more interesting than a typical episode of Law and Order (much like viewing Pulp Fiction in chronological order). <br /> <br />At this point, I should mention that the film has an unfair reputation of being difficult to follow and of being violent.  The most violent scene is, in fact, the opening credits, which are more violent by a long shot than the rest of the film.  Similarly, the film is not difficult to follow.  Sure, you may not be able to piece together every little detail (the same can be said for most good Film Noir) with just one viewing, but the answer to the question of the first scene - \\"why was Teddy killed and did he deserve to be\\" - is obviously resolved. <br /> <br />There are two main problems with this DVD edition.  One is with the film: Leonard's memory problem seems to vary with the needs of the plot.  At times he can hold things in his head for a long time, at other times he forgets in the middle of doing something (for example, at one point he is in the process of running and can't remember why, but at another point he manages to gather up a bunch of items, drive to a deserted lot, and burn them, which must have taken quite some time).  This is something you only think about anfterwards, though, so it does not detract from the film.  The second problem, for which I deducted a star (it's really a 4-star film) is the fact that this particular DVD edition is extremely bare-bones.  There is a special edition of Memento, which would be the recommended format for repeated viewings. <br /> <br />All-in-all, though, this is a very enjoyable movie.  It's the type of film that many people will want to own and watch repeatedly to understand all the little nuances of the plot.  That's not to say that the film doesn't hold up to a single viewing - it's very interesting and intriguing, mostly because of the manner in which the film is constructed, but also due to the actors, who do a good job throughout.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I have long thought The Beach Boys' music to be overrated, underdeveloped, redundant, and oftentimes plain irritating.  I bought this album at the urging of a friend out of curiousity and after 3 or 4 listens, what do you know?  It's a really GREAT album.  Is it better than The Beatles, specifically Sgt. Pepper?  Personally, I believe Sgt Pepper is The Beatles' worst album, but it is still unsurpased by Pet Sounds.  Pet Sounds does not possess the musical, vocal, and stylistic variety of The Beatles' albums; there is a chasm between each Beatles song whereas Beach Boys' flow together.  While Pet Sounds demonstrates a lot of growth almost every Beatle song is a new and revolutionized piece of art, especially where John is concerned. The Beatles are a better band than The Beach Boys because they had 4 musical geniuses working together at once (yes, Ringo too, believe it or not), whereas Brian Wilson was doing it all by his lonesome, and it shows is the product.  I say all this having no love or even like for either Paul McCartney or Brian Wilson for reasons not important enough to get into; my point is that I favor neither and loathe both.   <br /> <br />Pet Sounds is a wonderful album, but one wonderful album does not the best band ever make. Surfer Girl is still unlistenable, although Brian Wilson maintains it's one of the best songs ever written. Sometimes I think the people who try to deny the power of The Beatles are doing it to be interesting renegades, and because Brian Wilson and his hurt ego says, Brian Wilson  and his hurt ego whines...  Brian Wilson has also said that the only reason The Beatles were more popular than The Beach Boys was because of their haircuts. All of these ideas are equally likely... <br /> <br />At any rate, like whichever band you wish.  I am not one for consistent sound, I like innovation, I prefer The Beatles.  At the same time, Pet Sounds rocks. <br /> <br />There is a Yiddish saying, That if everyone says it, it's probably true. <br /> <br />So are The Beatles the greatest band ever? Absolutely.  Is Pet Sounds then invalid or unimportant? Certianly not; it's an incredibly pertinent album in the history of music.  Buy and enjoy.
B0007P3582|3.0|He talks all that trash about how ja rule sings on track and has nothing but girl tracks, and basically thats what this whole album is. The album is ok but I don't think its better than ja's and he copied the same format as ja with how his album tracks are with the serious tracks into the \\"larry love\\" type tracks. Its an alright album to have but only for the moment theres only a few songs on the album you can listen to but others are just annoying to listen to. 50 got alittle too cocky on this album cause he slacked off and made a watered down ja rule album.i'm suppose to die tonight, candyshop,this is 50 are the only solid tracks on this album.For who he claims to be this album was on some regular shelf filler type cd.    p.s. your reign on top is short like leprechauns
B000929AJQ|5.0|i have been waiting for this release for quite a while now , and it was sure worth the wait. i was skeptical because a few people informed me of its \\"poppy\\" feel. and i admit a few tracks do have that feeling, but not in a negative way. this is a cd that you can listen to all the way through. anyone with an appreciation for nine inch nails will enjoy this.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Nine Inch Nails has put out another great album! I highly recommend going out and buying this album.
B000929AJQ|5.0|<br />I will come back and edit this review later to be more comprehensive, right now I'm too busy enjoying listening to it!  <br /> <br />Go out and grab this album - it's got everything...amazing piano melodies, dance beats, great drumming, guitar assaults and all the emotion NIN has come to be known for!  <br /> <br />It's a great time all around!
B0007DAZW8|1.0|Being a huge fan of \\"Discovery\\" I was really excited to hear what \\"DP\\" was going to come out with next. While listening to the CD I was quickly disappointed. The first 2 tracks, somewhat reminiscent of \\"Discovery,\\" start out with some potential but just when you think the song is going to begin it never does. This trend only gets worse as the CD goes on. Every song seems to be composed of a 5-10sec loop repeated over and over for a intolerable 5 or 6 min. To be honest Im pissed off that they would release this. Being a fan Im insulted that they are trying to push this garbage on us. It might be the most anoying CD ever!
B00005LQ04|3.0|Well, being completely honest, I think this was a great movie OVERALL. The music is quite annoying frankly, I didn't care for the music, and it didn't fit that great with some scenes. A lot of the movie was kind of a lead up to the last 20 minutes (which happened to be unbelieveable). I thought the concept was excellent, but with a better cast of actors, and a better story, to keep viewers entertained with the mystery, rather than the place of where Susy is...I'd say this movie can be a lot better, but is definetly worth seeing
044024157X|5.0|Loved it! Grisham's back! Not since Bailey's \\"Cries of the Orchids\\" have I been so captivated, quite literally on the edge of my seat. Can't wait for the next!
0316743003|5.0|I enjoyed this book from cover to cover.  It is full of information from various people including pilots, engineers, and military personnel.  It has a few technical errors regarding the Sea Shadow for example, but I found it to be very accurate without being sensational.  I highly recommend reading this book.
B000929AJQ|2.0|I remember distinctly the day I bought 'The Fragile', taking it home on a Sunday afternoon, closing the curtains & dialling it right up - and getting totally blown away...    Today's experience was the exact opposite. The songs don't 'bite' like the ones on PHM/Broken/Spiral/Fragile, there's no sense of menace like the earlier stuff...    Seeing the video for 'The Hand that Feeds' I thought, allright, okay song, maybe the rest of the album will be better...    Sadly not, don't bother with this, just stay at home, put on the DVD of 'And all that could have been' really loud and remember Nine Inch Nails as we love them... {sob}    P.S. If you want something to really rock your world try 'Cale:Drew' by Jakob - now there's an album!!
B00005JNQ8|4.0|The movie \\"The Interpreter\\" is the first ever to be filmed inside the actual United Nations Manhattan complex and the inside look at the building, hallways and conference rooms is a main attraction for me and a show how important and powerful Hollywood has become. Take for instance the 1959 thriller \\"North by Northwest.\\" Denied at the time even the chance to film the exterior of the building Hitchcock's people had to resort to covert means to grab the shot of Cary Grant approaching the entrance (legend has it that the camera was concealed in a van.<br /><br />So here we are almost a half-century later and the United Nations opens up its doors and they couldn't have chosen a more intelligent and globally relevant, classy effort by veteran moviemakers.<br /><br />The story begins with simultaneous translator Silvia Bloome (Nicole Kidman) overhearing a whispered exchange in Ku, the little-known language of the fictional South African nation of Matobo. The message may signal an assassination attempt on Matobo's President Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), soon to arrive at the U.N. to defend himself against charges of in humane acts.<br /><br />The threat activates the Secret Service's Dignitary Protection Squad, in particular Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), a troubled and weary man soon fencing with the glacial, guarded and lonely Silvia.<br /><br />Is Dr. Zuwanie a patriot or a terrorist? Is Silvia herself a target or a sleeper? The trail leads to immigrant walk-ups and a Central Park rendezvous. The players assemble -- Zuwanie's head of security Lud (Jesper Christensen), his political enemies Kuman-Kuman (George Harris) and Xola (Curtiss Cook), plus a photographer who has seen too much (Yvan Attal). Bodies begin to accumulate. The key is in what Keller will be able to extract from Silvia's murky past as their private lives begin to merge.<br /><br />\\"The Interpreter\\" builds a creditable sense of claustrophobia and dread, with the occasional heart-thumping spike, but is more often a long stall with the phrase \\"It's got nothing to do with you\\" used once too often.

B000002UA5|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers here who love the live disc but have no patience for the studio disc. I do, however, really like \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" from the studio disc. I think it's a great mood song - like a Saturday morning thing or coming down from a good trip, mellowing-out song. Well, speaking of tripping, this is the strength of the live disc. It is perhaps the best acid record ever.  I grew up on this music. \\"Astronomy Domine\\" remains my favorite Pink Floyd song. One of my most memorable concert experiences was seeing Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon tour in 1973. Not only did they play the \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" album from beginning to end and \\"Echoes\\", they closed the show with \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene\\" from this album. Wow! I'll never forget it. Yes, the live disc is powerful, spacey music. Much more powerful than the original recordings of these four classic slices of ultimate late 60s psychedelia. I knew some folks who never touched acid and enjoyed listening to \\"Ummagumma\\" because it made them feel like they were tripping. How many other albums can do that? How many other bands can do that? Only Pink Floyd. They should consider releasing just the live disc of 'Ummagumma\\" for half the price, and include \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" on a compilation. Most of the studio disc is just a lot of screwing around.
B0007GAERG|4.0|The more I listen to this cd, the more I like it. However, is this the best cd of Mariah's career? No. This cd is only slightly better than Rainbow and Charmbraclet and 100 times better than Glitter. This cd still can't touch Butterfly or Mariah's earlier cds. For one thing, there is too much sampling going on. And it seem that Mariah has lost trust in her own writing ability because she allows others to take over too much. At times, I wondered if this was JD's cd because he seems to be everywhere. Mariah called this cd \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\", but what is lost is Mariah. Who is she? What we have here is a 35 year old woman still trying to compete with Beyonce. Having said that, this cd blows the younger divas out the water. Every song is made for radio and there is something for everyone on this cd. My favorite songs are: <br />   <br />* We Belong Together- Mariah sounds amazing with this track. <br />* Say Somethin' featuring Snoop Dogg- I love the drum beat. <br />* Stay The Night- the vocal arrangements are great. <br />* Circles- old school song, almost a Minnie song. <br />* Joy Ride- reminds me of the old Mariah.  <br />* Fly Like A Bird- very powerful.   <br /> <br />I like this cd, but I wish Mariah would show more faith in her own ability and not rely on these 'hot\\" producers too much.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Well, I'm sure many people are going to read this and hopefully agree with the following statement. <br /> <br />Finally, something past 99 that is a GREAT album, sure there is some good music here and there thats been out, but this is a GREAT.  Will be a must have for any NIN fan, and I have a feeling it might bring a new era of NIN fans because we are all so FREAKING bored with the rest of the era. <br /> <br />The last song, it by far my favorite, some what of a Matrix type song you could say. <br /> <br />Some mellow-dramtics in the album, some suprisingly upbeat songs. <br /> <br />-Fin
B0001KL5DA|2.0|I recently watched this series.  I remembered really liking it and looking forward to Sundays on HBO and couldn't wait for a DVD release.  I was so disappointed.  I found it to be so depressing I had to force myself to get through it. So long, Fishers.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I first became a \\"Phan\\" last spring after hearing the original London cast and reading Gaston Leroux's novel.  Though I have unfortunately never had a chance to see the stage show, I have been eagerly awaiting this film from the moment I first found out it was being made. <br /> <br />The roles were all very well-cast.  Emmy Rossum (Mystic River, The Day After Tomorrow) was absolutely perfect as the young ingenue Christine Daa.  Her voice sounds pure and innocent, and her acting (I thought) was quite good, especially in the final scenes.  Gerard Butler (Timeline, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider 2) was a very convincing Phantom. (Incidentally, the Phantom's real name is Erik.)  Though his voice is nowhere near as spectacular as that of Michael Crawford (the original stage Phantom), his acting skill more than makes up for any weaknesses in the singing department.  My only complaint with his character is that the makeup under the mask is not the least bit ugly, but that's the fault of the makeup artists.  Patrick Wilson (The Alamo, Angels in America) brought much more depth to the character of Raoul than most other actors who played the role.  Now, he's no longer just a \\"pretty-boy,\\" but actually gets to prove that he deserves Christine's love just as much as Erik does.  Additionally, the fact that Raoul is now a tenor and the Phantom is a baritone makes Raoul sound more \\"heroic,\\" voice-wise.  I thought that was a rather nice touch.  Minnie Driver was absolutely hilarious as the diva Carlotta.  Though she didn't do any singing during the film (that was dubbed by trained opera singer Margaret Preece), her comedic timing and diva-ish attitude made her extremely fun to watch.  I see a very bright future in film for all of these actors. <br /> <br />I thought the film was extremely well-directed.  The sets are simply gorgeous, the camera angles are just about perfect in almost every scene, and the additional scenes that were not in the stage musical further the plot and give it amuch deeper emotional center.  Andrew Lloyd Webber definitely made the right choice when he hired Joel Schumacher to bring his masterpiece to the screen.  My overall favorite scenes are probably \\"Point of No Return,\\" the Overture, \\"Music of the Night,\\" and the climax in the Phantom's lair. <br /> <br />I highly reccomend this film to theater-lovers everywhere.  If you loved the musical (or even if you didn't), see this film with an open mind.  Who knows?  You, too, may grow to love the poor, unhappy Erik.
B0000D96NW|5.0|This is an excellent album for Machine Head.  It is the first album I ever listened to of them.  It took me a few trys to get into the album, but once I got in it, there was no looking back.  Being a bass player, I judge most bands on the bassist.  Adam Duce is no pushover, that's for sure!  He is an excellent bassist and the guy who said he was not easily heard, does not know what bass really sounds like!  The guitars hit extremely heavy even in the B tuning!  The production is top notch on this album, and every instrument sounds so clear.  Days Turn Blue to Grey, Imperium, Wipe The Tears, are my personal favorites on the album.  Rob Flyn's singing is incredible on Days Turn Blue to Grey, someone said he was too screechy.  Why does everybody have to pick apart a band for no reason?  I love the album and I suggest any Machine Head fans and Metal fans to pick up this album.  I can't wait to see them in concert!
B00005IC2H|5.0|Three of my favourite adjectives should be sufficient to some up this album, and they are: spiffing, smashing, and wizard. <br /> <br />The sounds on Agaetis Byrjun are ethereal, unearthly, and simply beautiful. I fell in love with it at first listening, and still listen to it at least once a week. Some people dismiss Sigur Ros as boring, but I think the minimalistic approach to music-making that they have merely adds to the infinite charm of their stuff. <br /> <br />Buy this album, I urge you.
0618526412|5.0|The Heart is a Lonely Hunter began as a short under a different title and eventually was completed as this masterpiece of a novel that has earned it's place in the best of American Literature. <br /> <br />McCuller's story takes you into the south in another time but what she wrote about then still rings true in the heart of the human soul.  Her's is a story of human wants, desires, needs, loss and the true human condition.  There are single sentences alone in this book that will take your breath away as McCullers simply puts into words what we can never seem to find the words to express what we feel, what we want.  I loved this book and seriously believe everyone should consider reading The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.  After discovering McCuller's work through this book I have continued to read other books such as Clock Without Hands and others.  She has become among my favorite authors of all time.

B00005JKGK|1.0|With sell-outs like Amy Tan, who need white people to stereotype Asian males? It's disturbing to see how Asian men in the movie are portrayed as unredeemable jerks, rapists, and misogynists, while the cheating white husband of one of the daughters is portrayed as a temporarily wayward little boy, to be returned to the arms of the virtuous Asian wife.    It seems quite evident that Amy Tan has a strong dislike of Asian men. It's perhaps no surprise that she is married to a white man.  Unfortunately, this pattern of aiding and abetting of self stereotype seems to be a way for some Asian Americans to distance themselves from their own ethnicity, ingratiate themselves with the white majority, and gain acceptance of their works by the mainstream.    It is sad, but perhaps understandable, that while their cousins in the Far East are turning out movie classics, Asian Americans still have to find success by self-deprecation.
B000007NZ5|4.0|This is not like any other Black Sabbath I have heard In the past. <br />I like this alot better than anything else and Tony Martin can't sing?! What the h**** is that all about?! <br />I wonder If you have hearing problems or some other dissorder?! <br />This Is the kind of album I can listen to over and over again without being bored. <br />And you guys who compare this album to other Black Sabbath records are way out of line. <br />This is one of a kind.... <br />
B00004RF97|5.0|\\"You're slipping, Red.  I used to be afraid of that look - the withering glance of the goddess.\\"<br /><br />The movie begins with one of the most classic scenes in film history.  The audience does not know who the characters are in the first scene, and no dialogue is used.  We see Cary Grant angrily slam the front door of a mansion and stalk towards a car parked out front. A moment later, Katharine Hepburn, dressed in a nightgown, follows him out, carrying a bag of golf clubs. After removing one club, she contemptuously throws the bag filled with the rest at him, haughtily breaks the one club over her knee, throws the halves at him, and stomps back towards the open doorway.  Grant follows her, taps her on the shoulder...and when she wheels around, he pulls his fist back as if to punch her, but instead mashes her face in the palm of his hand, shoving her backward through the open doorway, where we next see her rubbing her neck as she sits up. The scene ends.<br /><br />Cut to \\"Two Years Later\\" as the title informs the audience; the day before Philadelphian blue-blood Tracy Lord's (Katharine Hepburn) second wedding. The audience also realize that the mashee in the opening scene and the masher were formally husband and wife: Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) and C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant).  Soon Dexter has makes a surprise visit to the Lord household on the eve of the wedding.  Tracy is about to marry George Kittredge (John Howard), her stuffy and rather chauvinistic well-to-do fiance.  What Tracy doesn't know at first is that Dexter, perhaps seeking revenge on Tracy, has arranged for Mike Connor (James Stewart), a writer for a tabloid-like magazine named \\"Spy\\", and Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey), a \\"Spy\\" photographer, to do a story on the wedding under the guise of being friends of a friend of the family.  Once Tracy is informed by Dexter that she must either allow the story to be written or her father's ongoing illicit affair with a dancer will be the big story instead she consents, but Connor and Imbrie do not know that she knows who their real identities and purpose...and she plots to \\"really give them something to write about...we'll set them on their ears!\\"<br /><br />The first scene where Tracy meets Mike Connor and Liz Imbrie, and practically interviews them sets the tone for the rest of the film.<br /><br />To reveal more of the story would spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film.  But in the next twenty-four hours Tracy and the others find their lives turned upside-down in an alternately hilarious and touching series of events.<br /><br />Katharine Hepburn made the extremely wise move on the advise of Howard Hughes, whom she was dating at the time, of buying the film rights to Philip Barry's play - she had been a hit onstage in the role, which was written for her.  Recently having been labeled \\"box-office poison\\", even being offered a role in a film tentatively entitled \\"Mother Carey's Chickens\\", it was the only way to guarantee her the role in any filming of the play.  She had spent a year on Broadway in the film version, and interrupted the tour of the play to film it for MGM.  For the film, she had wanted Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy for the roles of Haven and Connor.  She got Grant and Stewart - hardly shabby!  And better choices anyway, IMHO.  Donald Ogdent Stewart took over for the screenplay adaptation, as Barry had apparently requested too much money.  The dialogue is some of the best of any film of its time, and Hepburn, at her most radiant, is beautifully costumed by designer Adrian.  She is at times \\"lit from within\\", as Stewart's character Mike tells her, and at other times \\"made of bronze\\" (as her father, played by John Halliday) asserts.  Dinah, Tracy's young sister, is portrayed to hilarious effect by child actress Virginia Weidler, who makes her appearance to the reporter duo in ballet toe shoes, spewing French and finishing her introduction to them by manically playing and singing a lusty dance-hall song on the piano.  Pinch-prone Uncle Willie (Roland Young) adds great spice and fun with his smaller part.<br /><br />Side note:  In the scene where Mike arrives drunk at Dexter's house late one evening, Stewart purposely hiccups to try to crack Grant's straight-faced resolve - and it works.<br /><br />\\"The Philadelphia Story\\" won six Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Actor (Stewart), Best Actress (Hepburn), Best Supporting Actress (Hussey), Best Screenplay (Donald Ogden Stewart), and Best Director (George Cukor).  James Stewart and Donald Ogden Stewart won their nominations (Stewart's sole Oscar win), and although Katharine Hepburn did not win for this role (she lost to Ginger Rogers for her performance in \\"Kitty Foyle\\"), she received the New York Film Critics' Award.  The film revived her professional reputation, was a huge success, is of course considered to be one of the all-time classics of romantic comedy, and my personal favorite of Hepburn's films of this genre.dance-hall song on the piano.

B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Whether viewing this film as a time capsule of alienated youth in mod London of the 60s, or seeing it as one man's mental disintegration, this film is a classic to be admired by generations to come. Antonioni, the great Italian filmmaker, turns his x-ray lens on a British photographer (played with cranky verne by the late David Hemmings) who is so self-obsessed that he has disconnected himself from reality. Blithely moving from situation to situation without focus until he comes across what appears to be a murder in a series of random photos taken in the park one day, Hemmings faces a moral and mental crisis he cannot turn away from. One of the people he intrudes upon is Vanessa Redgrave, who will stop at nothing to obtain the photos. The meaning of the photographs is not as important as Hemmings's reaction to them. If he has uncoverd a murder, will he get involved? The haunting ending with the invisible tennis game surely had audiences shaking their heads. Examined within the context of the film itself, it makes perfect sense. This film also contains a rare concert performance by the Yardbirds featuring both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck. Some of the still shots from the movie (Hemmings's photo shoot with the model Verushka and his bare chested pose with Redgrave in his studio) have become iconic statements of the 60s. A film to see again and again, gleaning new meaning from each viewing.
B0007PALRU|1.0|I spent a year watching this movie once.  Couldn't even get excited about the special effects which were mainly been-there and done-that (think Deep Impact with Morgan Freeman). <br /> <br />The world (at least the industrialized, Western-Civilized portions of it) is coming to an end, and it's all our fault.  We're bad, bad, BAD overconsumers, and now we must pay the price.  Best of all, at the end of the movie the U.S. Vice President (formerly depicted as a meany) is humbled & grovels for forgiveness to 3rd world countries who \\"graciously\\" took in ice age refugees, in exchange for the U.S. forgiving billions of dollars in 3rd world debt. <br /> <br />Made me want to run out, buy a Hummer, start smoking, and shellac my hair with Aquanet.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Was at the April 26th show in Northampton, MA, not knowing how much of the new stuff he'd play (was about half the set).  Was not too excited after that, but apparently that's a product of his live shows and not the material on the album.  If you ever listened to jam-bands and thought, \\"hmmm, I wonder if anyone can recapture that feeling of a 4:51 song being too short?\\", you've found it.  18 tracks and 86ish minutes later, you're glad Ryan stopped by.  And you might just hit \\"repeat\\".
0316172324|2.0|If are hoping to gain insight about \\"rapid cognition,\\" how we arrive at snap judgements or gut feelings you'll be disappointed. The book is almost entirely devoted to describing instances of snap judgements that either assisted or led people astray in their decision making. No great theories on how the mind does this or why. <br /> <br />The startling conclusions in the book are that we make snap judgements and that sometimes they help us and other times they hurt us. I was expecting something more like Steven Pinker's work in \\"How the Mind Works\\" or his other books. This is nothing like those. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time and money. Don't even bother checking it out at the library.
0060589280|1.0|this book was enthusiastically suggested to me by a friend.  after reading it i realize two things: first, he is not my friend and second, he just wants to sleep with me.  this book was my introduction to paulo coelho; i had heard a lot about him and assumed that because he has sold millions of books that automatically made him a good writer.  fool. <br /> <br />you know that saying \\"write what you know\\"?, this book was written by somebody who knows nothing about the place, characters and situations he's writing about.  the settings are barely described, he doesn't transport you to another place like a good writer should.  the characters are predictable, unlikable and unidimensional; if it wasn't so pathetic it would be funny how one moment the narrator describes mara as deep and intelligent and the next he lets you \\"read\\" her diary and you realize she's a dumb country girl pretending to be intelectual.  the storyline is ridiculous.  this girl supposedly has to experience the deepest, darkest sex before she can find the most sacred.  for coelho this means her never experiencing an orgasm except when tied to a bed and hit with a wip by a client and then conveniently falling in love with a rich, good looking, sexy, crazy for her, young and famous all over the world painter...  who is all of this and then some before he is 30.  that's gonna happen... <br /> <br />the overall level of coelho's writing is best described as elementary.  i tend to look for books that can inspire and challenge me.  this wasn't it.  this book is the literary equivalent of one of those stupid telenovelas on tv.  i finished it hoping it would get better eventually.  yeah, right. <br /> <br />needless to say, this was the first and last book by coelho i am ever wasting my time with.  you want to read a latinamerican novel? read anything by garca marqus.  now that's a writer.
B000929AJQ|4.0|You have to give NIN credit, they are one of the few bands to make it this far.  I had read a review that the new Backstreet album will be beter. I'd like to remind that person the BSB can't play instruments, write songs, or even sing without major computer assisstance.  I also read this was crap compared to TDS.  Of course it is! TDS is a once-in-a-lifetime album that no one can touch, not even NIN.  But i'm getting sidetracked.  the first half of the songs is trent saying 'here you go, some singles to sing along to.' The next half of the album will melt your spine to molases.  Tracks like 'right where it belongs' are one of NIN's better songs.  This album has a place in every NIN fan's collection, and I recommend it, just not with gusto.  So for anyone who thinks trent can't sing, at least he didn't blow his career like that tart, ashlee, now there's your phony.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have bought both of Limited Edition and Special Edition, as I like this Musical very much. The movie gives me a different view of this musical. Although both of musical and movie are the same story and same songs, there is a different present. <br /> <br />I think none of Phantom's fans can miss this movie!
B0000024JN|3.0|this is more like 3.5 stars. the beasties were a fun band and this is pretty much a fun album, but I think that the samples don't add that much to the music and honestly, it seems stupid to me oftentimes.  when I am feeling strange and funky inside I put this on, but it is not something I come back to often.  It is also not very consistent, and varies little from the \\"yo I'm so bad\\" format and repeats itself a lot. <br />that said, songs like \\"no sleep til Brooklyn\\" and \\"girls\\" are highly enjoyable, and it was songs like those that convinced me to keep this cd.  The beastie boys typically have a good amount of filler, but the whole point of the band was to be \\"terrible, and admit it\\" which is a fun and self deprecating thing for them.  you should check this out sometime if you feel curious, it is kind of a novelty from back in the day.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Ryan Adams is by far...THE BEST songwriter of the post Westerberg generation. I loved Love Is Hell and thought Rock N Roll was OK at best, mainly because his usual impressive songwriting was missing.<br /><br />On Cold Roses there are so many personal, deeply personal, songs that it makes for a real intimate listen. Sweet Illusion alone is absolutely amazing (that last verse!)He has managed to put out material that is of consistent quality without ever making the same album twice. A lot of people seemed to get sucked into a genre-thing where if it sounds a certain way they love it or hate it. Ryan Adams is not bound by a genre if he feels he has written a full album of really great ukelele songs with great lyrics would you buy it? I would!! He is blessed with the talent of sharing....passionately sharing his failures and what ever mood they arise out of. You may buy into the rock star ego that he portrays but listen to his lyrics. It's one failed relationship after another...why? just listen.<br /><br />Cold Roses has something different that all other of his CD's, It has a real flow that makes you want to hit repeat over and over again, truly beautiful music.<br /><br />Buy it now and give it a lot of listens the payoff is worth it!
B000002VQQ|5.0|this is Smith's first, and best, album.  Her voice is so terrific in its sarcastic drawl I can't beleive it.  I never heard another person sing so effortlessly like she does, it contrasts and uplifts the beautiful piano oriented music backing her up.  The whole cd is oriented around a lilting piano/arrangement, with punk-rock type subjects, but then changes to complete punk on their live cover of \\"my generation.\\"  THis is a strange and beautiful creation, and a true rock classic.  If you want to expand you cd collection with unusual and thrilling music, get this now!
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie is far and beyond anything you will ever see or are likely to see.  I won't bother trying to explain the plot to you, because it is so complex that only some sense can be made after multiple viewings.  It is a deep and a dark look at Hollywood through the eyes of a woman in search of stardom, but nothing is what it seems.  I would recomend that for those of you who view this the first time, to not make sense of anything until you watch it the second time.  David Lynch is a master director and this film is beautifully directed, produced, and acted. (espeically Naomi Watts) Now despite all my praise for the film I only gave the dvd two stars, for the lack of supplimental material.  There are no making ofs, interviews, or anything.  The only thing that saved the DVD from getting one star was a feature that David Lynch himself requested.  There are no chapters on the dvd because David lynch thought that this film should be viewed all the way through without skipping any scenes and on this I agree with him.  But despite my problems with the dvd, the movie is amazing.  I would recomend this film to anyone who has enjoyed David Lynch's other works.
B000003TAR|5.0|I like a lot of the stuff they put out, but this is easily their best.  variety and honesty of songs did it for me; this is a more honest view of what the band is about than Nevermind was (though of course that one is good too).  A little uneven in places and kind of odd sometimes, it is nevertheless a classic album and a must have for any Nirvana fan.  If you want to get into Nirvana, get this and Nevermind.  Enjoy!
B0007YMUZW|5.0|This is a difficult review to write, because I still haven't been able to wrap up all my thoughts about this amazing effort.  I will do my best to sum up exactly what makes this album the best work of his career.   <br />If Ryan Adams has been knocked for something most often on his albums, it is that he seems to keep changing his sound.  Personally, I'm not sure how it can be negative to continually grow and not dwell in one particular niche - but I'm not paid to write reviews.  On this album, Adams hits to all fields - and sends out more than enough to keep all his fans happy.   <br />There are those who want him to do an album more like Whiskeytown - for them he has written Sweet Illusions, When Will You Come Back Home, Dance All Night, Cherry Lane, and the first single Let It Ride.  There are fans that want him to go back to the intimate acoustic sound of Heartbreaker - for them he has written Meadowlake Street, Now That You're Gone, How Do You Keep Love Alive, and Rosebud.  There are fans that wanted something more like the almost British sounding Love Is Hell from last year - for them he has written Life Is Beautiful and Friends.  Some fans want the vintage sound that Gold had to it - for them he has written Beautiful Sorta.  Somehow, he has also found room to grow and put out great songs like Magnolia Mountain, Mockingbird, Easy Plateau, and Cold Roses - all of which sound like nothing Adams has done before.   <br />Somehow, all these different Adams sounds come together perfectly into something that should not be dismissed as a prolific artist putting out too much.  It is absolutely jaw-dropping to hear so much quantity and quality at the same time.  Being his first double-album, one might expect some filler material.  There is simply none to be found here.  While there may be a song or two that you may not care for (Blossom comes to mind for me), odds are you'll find several other fans that have that track pegged as their favorite.  To me, that is the reason I would consider this Ryan Adams' strongest album to date.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|just get this, the music is the most PERFECTLY made I have ever heard.  I cannot get enough of these 3 soundtracks, they are pure brilliance.  THe movies could never have been so good if the music wasn't simply incredible, which it is.  I can't sing its praises high enough.  You NEED this in your collection, along with the other three soundtracks.  LOTR rules! <br /> <br />putting Annie Lennox on here for the last track was a stroke of brilliance.  Her singing will bring you to tears
B00005JNTZ|5.0|This is truely a great show. Everyone needs to watch this so it doesnt go off the air. This season was so good and can't wait for the finale. Kristen Bell is a great actress. Watch this and i'm definely gonna buy the season when it comes out on dvd.
B00005QZWI|5.0|often uplifting and powerful, this soundtrack and the others will knock you over at how brilliant they are.  my favorite part is the hobbit music, it is just so beautiful and happy and perfect.  I never get tired of this cd or any of the others, and make it a point to alternate through these paramount orchestra triumphs that we call the LOTR soundtracks.  Don't even think of the music in terms of the movie (though it is hard to separate the two, the music is just such a huge part of the movies) enjoy it for its own sake if you can.  It is beautiful and perfect, and should be considered a classic!!
B0007P3582|1.0|If you like dark underground murder, murder, murder albums this is for you.  I like gansta rap and this is B.S. Beats don't knock as hard and dude thinks he's it now b/c he's  rich.  Man you ain't pullin' no triggers your too rich for that.  Why lie about laying people out and say that's your life?  Let's be real he can't even get into a fight without being sued so it's just trash talkin'.  I'm not hatin' his 1st album was TIGHT.  Good beats and everything but I seriously think he fell WAAYYY off with this one.  I didn't try to sell my copy i just threw it out.  Its my fault what did I expect from an album call the massacre....GARBAGE!!
B00007BH5C|5.0|get this and the other two LOTR soundtracks, they are the best music I have heard from any soundtrack.  They demonstrate the immense power that an orchestra can have, I absolutely cannot get enough of this music.  stirring, powerful, perfectly arranged all at once, you will absolutely think its the best thing ever.  If you loved the movies, you are really going to enjoy the soundtracks.  even if you didn't see the movies you will become extremely hooked.  This and the others are that good!!!
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This is the most PRETENTIOUS movie that i have ever seen. I didn't believe any of the characters even for a second. Seriously, nobody talks like that or act like that in real life. Because it had won so many awards, I expected better. Don't watch it. It is a total waste of money. I much prefer British mini series made in the 70's (for example, Upstairs Downstairs). <br />
B00009L1UP|4.0|this is more popular and has more hits, but it is not as well arranged and has a few iffy tunes (the first song bugs me alot for some reason)  that said, it is still really good and is a good cd to have if you liked the concept album that made them famous called operation:mindcrime.  this one has one hit called \\"silent lucidity,\\" which is kind of slow and a little cheesy, but the rest of the album really rocks hard, especially the title track and the closing song \\"anybody listening,\\" which is one of the best metal songs of the 80's.  Overall, you should get this one and the aforementioned album if you are interested in this band.  they are a very underrated metal band, and they are a lot more intelligent than most other bands out there (especially from the 80's)
B000002O5L|4.0|Full Moon Fever is a fantastic album. <br />Freefallin' is no doubt one of the best songs ever, let along by TP (amazing it wasn't the opening single), and is well supported by the strong singles 'Running Down a Dream,' 'Won't Back Down' and 'Yer so Bad.' <br /> <br />However I don't really think the rest of the tracks are stand-out enough to warrant this album being so universally praised as the best Tom Petty release. <br />'A Mind (with a heart of it's own)' is the only one that is as good as the previusly mentioned singles. <br />I've never liked 'A Face in the Crowd.' <br /> <br />My favourite Tom Petty album is the follow-up to to this: 'Into the Great Wide Open,' which recieves comparitively little attention. <br />It has the same fantastic production of Jeff Lynne's, but it sounds fresher and the album is much more consistent. <br /> <br />Yep, 'Full Moon Fever' is a real pleasure, but don't forget the other stuff Tom Petty has to offer - I wonder how many reviewers here have bought 'Let Me Up (i've had enough)?'
B000000WJZ|5.0|I am in agreeance with other reviewers that the Pumpkins were a very special band.  I realize that Billy Corgan pretty much played every intrument on here (except drums/ percussion) but that adds to the interest of this cd.  There is beautiful music and classic arrangements all over the place, with moving lyrics courtesy of Billy's incomperable voice  (high and moving, with stirring touches).  Overall their best cd and most consistent (especially compared to Mellon Collie).  If you don't have any SP cd's, get this one.  It is really, really good, beautiful, and highly enjoyable.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|this is another good album by d12, even tho its not theyre best, its a little more commercial but that dont make it bad, they tried out alot more on this album, which sum of it works and sum dont, still great and really fun to listen to. even better if u got da dvd with it (i did haha.) <br /> <br />trax: most trax r average to good except leave dat boy alone, which was just to corny.
B0000027RL|5.0|I like nirvana a lot and I like Pearl Jam a lot, and I think trying to put one above the other is stupid.  Its just music, for crying out loud!  I think Kurt was an idiot for dumping on this band all of the time, they are really good, and they at least never went into the self pity idiot angst he put himself into.   <br />anyways it is HEAVY and hard, and flows well and is well arranged.  This is  <br /> <br />the music that all those NUmetal bands try to copy all the time.  It is extremely enjoyable, comments on society a lot, and is sometimes stirring in a heavy way.  For some reason I never listened to their other cd's they made after this, I will have to check those out.  However if you are at all interested in Pearl Jam, than start by getting this cd.  I know there are a lot of intense fans that will recommend other cd's they made later, but I don't think that other stuff will work to make you a fan.  Get TEN.
B00004T9UF|5.0|what can i say that hasnt already been said? pick this up along wit sumthin by his crews d12 and da outsidaz (his 2nd crew.)  <br /> <br /> <br />just dont get encore thats sum garbage rite there.
B00006LWSF|2.0|the ONLY reason i gave this album 2 stars instead of 1 is the respect is have for rakim and gang starr(although they both made much better songs). and to the \\"If u want real good rap, get any tupac or 50 cent cd, and itll blow this one away.  <br /> <br />~Peace playaz\\" guy, who calles rakim \\"Retarted And Korny Irregular Monkeysock\\", don't believe the hype.. 50 cent is so much whacker than rakim.. just check out \\"Paid In Full\\" by eric b and rakim (dropped almost 20 years ago and still a classic), to get an example of some \\"real good rap\\"...    <br />
1892005034|5.0|Hi!  I have been using NVC for over five years.  I have taught the information in this book multiple times and each time I learn a little more about the NVC model.  I find that the book is written clearly with examples that bring the model to life.  I have a great deal of gratitude for Marshall Rosenberg's willingness to (and adeptness at) sharing this material with others.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in a new way to use language to meet their needs. <br /> <br />***I caution the prospective reader if they are looking for a tool that will \\"solve all their problems.\\"  Texts offering solutions are located in another place. NVC is a communication model that has helped me channel my intention to show love to ourselves and others.  If we choose to direct our intention toward only our own gain and away from benefitting self AND others, the model will creaet more words in a sea of words.  If we intend to honor both our own and other's needs, NVC may help us dive into that sea of words wildly and discover treasures of compassion :)
0060005688|4.0|This book is a semi-scholarly look at the effect of our increasing array of choices on our well-being.  Barry Schwartz carefully lays out the argument that the number of choices we have today (from flexibility in where to live to how many types of jeans there are to the dizzying array of crackers in the supermarket) detracts from our enjoyment of the decision we actually make, for many reasons. <br /> <br />Many assertions made in the book are supported by well-regarded studies.  And we learn interesting concepts about types of decision-makers (maximizers versus satisficers -- those who must have the best versus those who know their criteria and stop their search when something meets those criteria), effects of making decisions (for example, the novelty of what we decide to do or get wears off, so the longer we took to make the choice, the more we're likely to regret it), and the effects of the number of choices presented to us on how, or even whether, we make a choice.  Everything is presented in a more or less easy-to-read style. <br /> <br />After a while, however, it seemed that I was reading the same thesis presented over and over, but in a slightly different context.  I was glad that he cut the manuscript down from the original (as he stated in the acknowledgements), because to me it still seemed unnecessarily long. <br /> <br />And then he makes kind of a blanket statement that our overabundance of choices is the root cause of our growing dissatisfaction with our lives.  While he admits that this is merely what he thinks, based on his review of studies on the subject, and while the thesis does make some sense, I think it's a little simplistic to lay the blame for all the malaise in our society at the feet of overchoice. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, it's an interesting concept that reinforces the old notion that you should want what you have rather than have what you want.
B0008ISM40|4.0|I am a long-time listener to NIN, and while I maintain that \\"The Fragile\\" is his best work, this is some very good music. Particularly, the last four tracks are pure gold, and each one deserves serious consideration. The cataclysmic ending to \\"Beside You In Time\\" (which, interestingly, is a line from \\"The Mothman Prophecies,\\" if anyone remembers) sends chills through my body, and it is this kind of power that Trent has been able to harnass for some twenty years now, ever since the release of \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" which, while seemingly immature, when re-listened to now in light of this album, seems to make a lot more sense to me. I especially like the more raw sound this album has, compared to some earlier music. I disagree, however, with the claim that this is a return to his earliest work. Rather, this is the evolution of it; \\"PHM\\" is a solid piece of 80s industrial music, whereas \\"WT\\" carries with it the sadness and anger of the 90s and early 21st century. Way to go Trent!
B000929AJQ|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing must have CD!  Compared to everything else out there, this music totally holds its own and outshines everything currently on the radio by far.  \\"With Teeth\\" will no doubt bring in a lot of new fans, as well as resurrect the old.  It has a little hint of Trent's past work in it, but for the most part, it is totally new and different.  I really believe this will be the CD to bring NIN back into the limelight.  It's just that good and that innovative!  Oh, and there is a DualDisc version that is also available.  Below are short reviews of each track:<br /><br />ALL THE LOVE IN THE WORLD 9.5/10<br /><br />An unexpected beginning to the CD.  Normally Trent opens with guns blazing (see Somewhat Damaged, Mr. Self Destruct, and Head Like a Hole).  However, this time he opens with a beautiful popish song that ends in a cacophony of him singing \\"Why do you get all the love in the world?\\"  Can't wait to hear this one in 5.1 Surround Sound.<br /><br />YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE 9.5/10<br /><br />This time, it's the second song that hits with guns blazing!  It ranks right up there with Wish and Head Like a Hole with its in-your-face attitude.  Before you know it, you'll be chanting the explicit chorus along with Trent.<br /><br />THE COLLECTOR 9/10<br /><br />This is a classic NIN song that has Trent's vocals taking center stage.  As one other person said, this has the feel of the Pretty Hate Machine era being reworked for 2005.<br /><br />THE HAND THAT FEEDS 9/10<br /><br />The first single and possibly the catchiest, radio friendly NIN song ever.<br /><br />LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH 10/10<br /><br />A dark song that is reminiscent of The Downward Spiral.  Gotta love that chorus!<br /><br />EVERY DAY IS EXACTLY THE SAME 10/10<br /><br />I read a review of this track where the person said, \\"Epic but powerful.  Recalls Reznor's talent for creating subtly lethal beauty in his music while still punching out a hypnotic rhythm.\\"  I couldn't have said it better myself.  One of the best that should be a future single!<br /><br />WITH TEETH 9/10<br /><br />For some reason, this one reminds me of an evil tribal song.  The drums, bass, and guitar are amazing and so are Trent's lyrics.  However, the piano solo in the middle is a huge change of pace and is completely unexpected.  Then, when you least expect it, the music kicks back in with full force.  Of course, I made the mistake of turning the music way up during the piano solo while listening to this track on my iPod.  When the music kicked back in I thought my head was going to explode!  Yeah, my ears are still hurting; thanks for asking.<br /><br />ONLY  10/10<br /><br />A very VERY unique song.  After I listened to this the first time, I had to go back and listen again just to make sure I had heard it right.  Reminds me a little of \\"Down In It\\" and Trent even makes reference to the \\"little dot\\".  Super great original song.<br /><br />GETTING SMALLER 8/10<br /><br />Rock all the way!  Heavily guitar driven that has catchy riffs during the verses.  Weakest song on the CD, but still pretty good.<br /><br />SUNSPOTS 9/10<br /><br />A dark and sexy song that may have to grow on you.  I liked it on first listen, but now that I've heard it a bunch, I love it.  It`s a pretty demanding song that again puts Trent's vocals at center stage...and he's never sounded better!  It also has a sound in it that is no doubt a synth, but sounds a lot like a power drill.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you hear it.<br /><br />THE LINE BEGINS TO BLUR 9.5/10<br /><br />Probably the closest relative to the Fragile era.  The verses are heavy vocally with Trent shouting, but the chorus is light and has a \\"Great Below\\" \\"And All That Could Have Been\\" feel to it.  (I'm referring to the song \\"And All That Could Have Been\\" off the Still CD, NOT the live disc by the same name).<br /><br />BESIDE YOU IN TIME 10/10<br /><br />I can't wait to hear this one in 5.1 Surround Sound as well.  It's a very tough song to describe.  It is musically outstanding and has an ending that will leave your jaw on the floor.  The beat will literally play with your head and cause you to become immersed in the song.  This was the track featured on the short teaser for the album at nin.com.  Also, it has a popping noise in it that sounds similar to when you press the volume key on a Mac.  Pretty cool!<br /><br />RIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS 10/10<br /><br />This song challenges \\"Hurt\\" lyrically.  Heavily influenced by Still and is a perfect close to a wonderful album.<br /><br />In short summery, this album is Trent at the top of his game!  He should feel really proud knowing that he has created another masterpiece that will be frequently visited on my iPod and ran continuously in my car CD player.  I don't even remember the last time I got a CD where I loved every track on the album the way I love these.  Way to go Trent!

B000003BDJ|5.0|Obviously, Hot Rocks is not for the Stones fanatic.  The fanatical fan should acquire all of the Stones' early releases.    Those of you who like the Stones and don't want more than just the same old Stones you hear on the radio for your collection, you'll will probably be satified with Forty Licks    However, a fan who wants more than the radio songs, doesn't need 40 Licks, he needs more.    That fan should instead buy: \\"Hot Rocks: 1964 - 1971,\\" \\"More Hot Rocks,\\" \\"Jump Back: The Best of the Rolling Stones 1971 - 1993,\\" and then download these song:      1. Happy  2. Shattered  3. Anybody Seen My Baby?  4. Hang Fire  5. \\"Play With Fire,\\"  6. The Girl with the Faraway Eyes  7. \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\\"  8. When the Whip Comes Down  9. Love is Strong  10. Saint of Me       That fan will be Satisfied (so to speak).
038551123X|4.0|I read this book for a report in my College English Class and let me say that I couldn't have picked a better read!  This book tickled my fancy. . some might not like Lindsey's writing but I found it refreshing.  Despite the subject matter, I found myself chuckling aloud in several parts in response to Dexter's dark humor. <br /> <br />I'll say it now: This book isn't for everyone.  The descriptions of gore can get fairly graphic, and some scenes are downright disturbing.  BUT if you can appreciate dark, poetic styles of writing and a twisted storyline, then you'll have no problem getting through this book.   <br /> <br />Lindsey has a very firm grip on his characters and never makes them do things that are unbelievable or poorly directed.  Dexter's sister is, admittedly, annoying. . but one has to remember that in real life, some people ARE annoying.  A few have complained that the book portrays women in a steriotypical and unflattering light. . but I'm a woman and was not in any way offended by the portrayl of the characters.  I think a person would only be offended if they were strongly feminist. <br /> <br />Several people have brought up the ending, saying that it was too 'farfetched' and 'dissapointing', but I didn't think so.  Farfetched, maybe. . but not dissapointing.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Absolutely brilliant spoof of zombie movies, while at the same time being pretty scary...and EXTREMELY gory in some parts, as any good zombie movie should be. <br /> <br />Some of the dialogue was a bit hard to understand for my American ears (British accents and all), but not enough to detract from the overall experience.  Great movie, excellent DVD extras.  Highly recommended!
B00008S2VG|2.0|The album is not too adventurous and is ok to dance too. But it's not easy to stomach the rapping. Madonna has also transformed herself into a Muscleman of late, Physically(Why?), and that's too bad.  <br />Grade--C+
B0007XT87G|4.0|I'll keep this short but sweet, there are already a lot of excellent reviews of this album.  I've been listening to PT since Stupid Dream and have since purchased every previous release, and purchased new releases the day they have come out. <br /> <br />I've read reviews where they say that the album doesn't sound like PT and the next line reads that a certain sound is just like off Moonloop or something.  I think that speaks volumes to what I believe this album really is,  an all encompassing album of their styles from past to present.  It has everything, the hard edge of In Absentia to the psychedelic yearnings of the sky moves sideways and everything in-between.  Plus, the piano on some of these songs is totally new, and a welcome addition. <br /> <br />I find it somewhat of a small joke that they put shesmovedon as the hidden track - it fits so nicely into this album as it did on Lightbulb Sun. (which by the way is probably my favorite album so far). <br /> <br />To sum it up, you definatly have to buy this album if your a fan of everything PT has done.  Is it their best?  Not in my opinion, but again, I believe it to be better than In Absentia. <br /> <br />
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album definately kicks ass! I just found out that NIN was coming out with another album a couple months ago. Usually I find out sooner with my favorite bands. It kinda came to me by surprise.  Anyway, this album is amazing and NIN has always amazed me with their great music throughout the years. It sure was a long wait, but with this album I think it was well worth it.  Don't try to compare this album to any of NIN's earlier works of art. Just look at it as another excellent cd by NIN. This album has the most amazing bass I've ever heard on a rock album. My favorite songs are Getting Smaller, You Know What You Are, Hand That Feeds, Only, and Sunspots.  Getting Smaller would have to be my #1 fav on this cd. Make sure you buy this album and tell all your friends to buy it even if they are not a fan of NIN.  <br /> <br />
0140277447|3.0|Authors did very good jobs. Japanese should read this book. And also American have to read her another book, \\"The Chinese in America: A Narrative History\\".  Chinese are the most tragic people in the world. Both Japanese and American should feel apologetic for their brutal behavior to Chinese.
B000002UAX|5.0|I was outrageously impressed with other Beatles albums when I first listened to this album, and so I was disappointed with what I heard.  It's nothing like the previous or latter music that they made.  Many of the songs have an outtake quality to them.  I thought at the time that only 5 or so songs were top notch.  But on repeated hearings I have grown to appreciate this album.  I would agree with another reviewer that this album, along with Abbey Road, did not have as much immediate appeal but soon grows on you.<br />For instance, I didn't like 'Helter Skelter' for a long time.  Now I consider it a really electrifying performance.  At first, I never really noticed 'I'm So Tired'.  Now the bass guitar accompaniment and the vocal lethargy comes across as brilliant.<br />Many of the songs have beautiful melodies and harmonies.<br />'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' demonstrates how great the Beatles functioned as a composing team.  The original, as heard on the Anthology, is pretty boring to my ear.  Although George had a great melody to act as a backbone for this song, and his/Clapton's guitar melodies are wonderful, listen to McCartney's intro and contributions from the others to make this a real masterwork. (George Harrison himself credited the intro to McCartney, by the way.  Don't think that McCartney was a non-participant in those songs that weren't his).<br />This is a fantastic album.
0385510454|2.0|\\"The Broker\\" is an unusual novel for John Grisham. It lacks the page-turning adrenaline of early thrillers that made his name (\\"The Firm\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\", and \\"A Time to Kill\\"), but also is void of the depth and intricacy of some of his more recent work, like \\"The Last Juror.\\" \\"The Broker\\" is, at best, mediocre spy fiction - kind of a cross between OJ Simpson's low-speed chase through LA and a travelogue for Bologna, Italy. The story of Washington, DC, power broker Joel Backman, the beneficiary of a Presidential pardon, is thin, but enough to hold interest for a while on the strength of Grisham's prose and storytelling skill. It felt for a while like Grisham was taking the first two hundred and fifty pages to set up an explosive and memorable climax, but regrettably, any strength in this story is found in the first half, as the end spins into a meaningless and ambiguous close. It feels as if Grisham was onto what could have been an interesting story, lost interest along the way, and just couldn't figure out how to wrap it up. Too bad - the vintage Grisham is one of my favorite writers of popular fiction - but \\"The Broker\\" is as pedestrian as a walk through Bologna's portico-covered sidewalks.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|I was anxious to see this DVD, having seen the production on Broadway.  It did not disappoint as a movie.  However, the sound reproduction is very poor.  I have home theatre and it still amazes me, when I watch movies, how much the sound/music elevates the experience.  Since \\"Phantom\\" is a movie of a musical, I had high expectations of the 5.1 surround orchestration and vocals.  There is very little sound separation among the 5 channels during the musical segments, and even very little during dialogue/sound effects.  I actually had to stop the movie about 15 minutes into it to make sure I didn't have it in Stereo mode on the Menu.  The sound levels also go from very quiet in speaking parts, causing one to turn up the volume, to sudden high-decibel music, shaking the room and causing my 7 year old to have to cover her ears.  This is not uncommon in movies, but this one seems to be particularly faulty in that regard. <br />I have DVD Audio discs of classical music and they are an amazing format to listen to.  I certainly didn't think I would be disappointed with the audio in this movie, but was.  I also have a DVD of the movie \\"Chicago\\", and the sound on it is incredible, layered, and lively.  \\"The Phantom\\" would have benefitted greatly from a similar mix.
B000063S6Z|3.0|Does anyone know if the song \\"Extreme Ways\\" has an instrumental version? I love this song from \\"The Bourne Identity\\"'s credits. I prefer not to have the actual singing since the tune itself is awesome.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I watched a total of 20 minutes of this movie before I had to turn it off.  I rented it because I've seen many movies with Portman and Law and liked them both.  I don't know if it was the dialog or what, but NONE of the characters seemed believable to me at all.  Portman just didn't cut it as an ex-stripper (not to mention the badly dyed hair in the beginning).  And Julia Roberts as a photographer...<br /><br />I just didn't see any of them as being their characters, maybe I was expecting more out of Portman and Law.  If you liked any of their older movies, and are seeing this because of them, skip this one.  You'll most likely be disappointed like I was
B000929AJQ|4.0|This album is very good, i mean i think it is a mix between all his work, it sounds like broken,fragile,and downward spiral and a lil bit of phm, but that is the problem, being a musician, the fragile was flawless, i mean the amount of detail and work put into the songs was unbelievable, these songs are very simplistic compared to the fragile,that is my fave nin cd, and i wish i could have heard more in it from them, saying all this gets me to expecting much much more from them(or him i guess) all the songs are typical song structure and there are not any beautiful instrumentals like the fragile (la mer). I loved the fragile and i still do, i just wish he put more songs on the cd. Everyone waited for nin to come back in 99' and he came back big time w/ a double disc journey and an awesome tour. ^ years in the making and this is all he has? So do We have to wait another 6 yrs for the next? All im saying is there should have been more songs on with teeth, all the songs on the other hand are awesome. Keep on rockin trent, just add a lil more songs next time :-)

B00001QEE9|1.0|if you honestly, seriously, loved your kid, and wanted him to be safe and not expose him to innappropriate stuff, this should not be shown to him. This DVD/VHS is chock full of useless stupid nonsense that I never liked. I think that if you wanted to watch something educational, watch some presidential speech.. or rugrats.. none of these new age cartoons or old age cartoons such as this. \\" i want to be a real boy \\". Well, for one you can't talk in real life, and, nobody loves you enough for oyu to be real. This video was never one of my favorites, but instead i've always hated it in heart. If I could put a penny on every stupid line said in this movie, I would be richer than mr.gates. This thing has horrible acting, unbelievable bad singing, and it hurts me to watch it.. knowing that people actually encourage kids to watch this. I for one think if blood and groteskness is innappropriate for their kids, this is much much worse. This and the little mermaid.. basically really all the older disney films. If you other people can recall, on the old L.M. VHS box, there was a ..Long... golden.. figure in the background of the castle. Remember? That just shows how uncalled for this is, and how all this money thats being made is going tot he wrong people..... over at disney.. <br /> <br />Avoid this film, and L.M. at all costs! <br /> <br />Sincerely from the heart of, <br />Me.Alex.
B000929AJQ|3.0|how can he go from the fragile to this... this was on of my most anticipated albums ever and i am highly dissapointed. Nine Inch Nails is my favorite band and i love every release, but this one is just sub par there is nothing amazing liek every other cd and just ok stuff, like on all the love in the world i cringed when he tried to hit those high notes, this cd reminds me of broken and the fragile which is good but is just bland and gets boring easily. hopefully the next album (due out in a year or two) will be good enough to be mentioned with the fragile broken the downward spiral and pretty hate machine which are all five star albums
0060920084|3.0|Subtract 20 or 30 points from Mark Twain's IQ and you have Bill Bryson's \\"Lost Continent.\\"  It's funny at times, clever, vindictive, and mean-spirited in others, but it lacks the unique, eye-popping insights of a great comedy writer. Anybody with a sharp tongue and a sarcastic attitude could have written this book.  (Why, says the reviewer jealously, didn't I write this book and make a lot of money?)    \\"Lost Continent\\" is Bryson's description of his automobile journey of nearly 14,000 miles in a rented Chevette to 38 states and innumerable small towns. He missed a few important states -- Texas and Florida, for example, but he describes towns like Tupelo, Mississippi -- birthplace of you-know-who -- and gives it a bit of a thumbs-up for the quality of its strip mall. There's a few other positive moments in the book, but most of the time Bryson appears to be having a wretched time, pouring out his spite at endless waitresses in cheap roadside cafes which don't measure up to his standards of refinement and cuisine. This is irritating.  Bryson is an Iowan, for heaven's sake, and he should know that uppity behavior is looked down upon in middle America -- even if you live in England and write books. His description of his father and growing up in Iowa borders on being cruel.         Fortunately, Bryson seems to be honest about his own limitations and prejudices and that saves the book from being a elitist diatribe about the failings of the United States.  His positive experiences in a few places -- Savannah, the Grand Canyon, and Storm Lake, Iowa leavens the negative sufficiently to make the book readable and he ends on a high note.  You can zip through it in an hour or two while waiting for an airplane or a dentist.                                   Smallchief

B00005JKNF|5.0|Director Robert Altman serves up an atypical drama/whodunit, set on an English country estate, the \\"Gosford Park\\" of the title, during a weekend of pheasant hunting. The superb ensemble cast gives outstanding performances, and an in-depth glimpse of the British class system. Multiple plots and subplots are woven together seamlessly to provide taut suspense, fascinating character studies, and various suspects and motives for the murder of a man killed twice. We are also given more than a glimpse of lives led both Upstairs and Downstairs, and the snobbery and pecking order which exist on all levels.<br /><br />Set in the early 1930's, Sir William McCordle, (Michael Gambon), and his wife, the much younger, acrimonious Lady Sylvia, (Kristin Scott Thomas), entertain a group of aristocrats, and non-titled social climbers, for a shooting party. The guests arrive with their servants in tow. Lady Sylvia despises her husband for his lack of blue blood, love of money and lecherous ways. She takes her pleasure elsewhere. Intrigue, rivalry, venomous feelings, envy, and sexual escapades abound on all floors of the manse, and gossip is rampant and delicious. Maggie Smith is wonderful as the Countess of Trentham, who peers through her lorgnette and tosses-off barbed comments at one and all - except the man who holds the purse strings. She is dependent on Sir William for her allowance, which he threatens to put a halt to. Ivor Novello, (Jeremy Northam), is a Hollywood movie star and English matinee idol. A distant relation of the McCordles, he was invited on the condition that he entertain the other guests with music and song. He accepts in order to wangle an invitation for his colleague, American movie producer, Morris Weissman, (Bob Balaban). Weissman, who spends most of the movie on the telephone, talking long distance with honchos in Hollywood, is researching the lives of the rich and infamous for an upcoming film, ''Charlie Chan in London.\\"<br /><br />Below stairs, head housemaid Elsie, (Emily Watson), spontaneously outs herself as Sir William's lover. Helen Mirren gives an exceptional performance as the head housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, \\"the perfect servant. The seemingly naive Mary Macearchran, (Kelly Macdonald), is the Countess' lady's maid.

Amazingly, Altman was 76 years-old when he made the film.  JANA
B00005JLWN|5.0|This -- writer-director Kurt Wimmer's sci-fi paean to freedom-fighters everywhere -- was the best movie nobody saw in 2002. Mixing a smart dystopian story with extraordinary action sequences, it's become an underground libertarian classic. And the promotional slogan on the box is irresistable: \\"In a Future Where Freedom Is Outlawed, Outlaws Will Become Heroes.\\"
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Most things about this movie are absolutely, stunningly perfect.  Emmy Rossum does a great job attempting to fill Sarah Brightman's shoes.  She's no Sarah, but then again, no one else is.  Carlotta is great, and the managers are most entertaining.  The special effects and the composition of all the visual images are great.  I loved the adaptation of certain elements from play to movie and hoped it would win in Oscar in that category.  Prima Donna was better in than the original in that respect.  But one aspect that was lacking was the performance of Gerard Butler as the Phantom.  There are parts of the movie that I have not seen because I can't uncringe my face to see the screen.  He's fine later in the movie, possibly because I'm used to his horrid performance by then.  But for Music of the Night I was downright appalled.  He does't even begin to hit the correct notes.  Let alone make them eerily sexy the way Michael Crawford does.  I'm no huge Michael Crawford fan or anything like that.  But come on, at least cast someone who can sing.  Unfortunately the bad casting call was for the lead character.  Whoever heard of an angel of music that can't sing?  It's ridiculous.  It manages to make Christine seem like a weak minded twit rather than someone who is hypnotized by an amazing voice.   <br /> <br />Aside from the bad casting call, the absolute only other complaint that I have is just the fact that some lines that are supposed to be sung are spoken.  It's just silly.  If they had reworded it, they probably would have been fine.  But to keep the same sing songy rhyming lyrics was annoying at best.  Accept that it's a musical people and sing the freaking lines!!!  I've read some things that claim that's the studio's fault, so I can't fault Weber or anyone else specifically for that.  But again, come on people, it's a musical.  Whoever decided to make a musical then got all pissy over the fact that there's too much singing just needs to be shot.   <br /> <br />Overall, I'll definately recommend this movie.  It has enough good points to detract even from the glaringly large mistake in the casting.  And it's still the closest alternative to actually sitting in the audience of a good performance.  However it doesn't do the story justice.  As part of a phan addiction, it's great.  In combination with the original cast cd, the original novel by Gaston Leroux, and the romantic interpretation by Susan Kay, it brings everything in and is an amazing piece of work.  But as a single piece of work by which to judge the entire story, or even just Weber's musical aspects, there's much more to it than this.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This c.d. has such a variety of music. There is hardcore screamo, (\\"Thank you for the venom, The Jetset life is going to kill you...etc) softer, calmer tunes (Cemetary Drive, The Ghost of you) and of course the poppy punk title tracks (I'm not o.k. (I promise), and Helena) overall this album comes together though, it's the perfect album to get you psyched or to calm you down. Once you listen MCR I promise-you'll be a fan for life.
068987474X|3.0|This book is good for it's common sense purposes. I think the average clear thinking individual pretty much knows if someone is \\"into them\\" or doesn't like them at all. This applies to frienships as well, not just relationships. I agree with the parts of the book that state that women shouldn't pursue or throw themselves over a man, it makes her look pathetic and desperate. I think anybody (including men) should respect themselves enough to have some dignity and not allow any human being to walk all over them and mistreat them...because if you do, then you deserve it. You are in control of how you want to be treated, and if someone is treating you like your not important, just avoid them and cut them out of your life - men (and women) are easily replaceable. Now, the reason why I gave this book 3 stars is because I think the book is sort of \\"gimmicky\\". Every year, there's a new relationship book that comes out and tells people what they are doing wrong, what they should do right...etc. Is it really that complicated? Secondly, the author comes across as arrogant (I would never date him, lol)and writes as if he almost takes joy at talking about how men like to mess w/women's emotions. I feel like these books like to make men and women feel bad about themselves.
B000929AJQ|4.0|The majority of this cd was done with a band, and most notably a live drummer opposed to the traditional electronic beats.  That drummer is actually Dave Grohl, who does an excellent job.  The drums are almost like the old electronic ones, except... real.     anyway, at first I was kind of disappointed with this cd.  After hearing it a few times, I've completely changed my mind about it and i absolutely LOVE it.  For anyone bitching about it, Trent HAS in fact, taken his project in a new direction.  Those who have heard the absolutely amazing -- and in my opinion it's the best Trent has done-- \\"still\\" disc that came with the delux live album in 2002 will know that a somewhat more \\"stripped down\\" sound is what NIN has been moving toward.  And by \\"stripped down\\" I don't mean minimalist in any way.  Still was basically just Trent on his keyboard alone. The songs all slowly build and other band members enter slowly, It mostly stays quiet and laid back, but most importantly is the fact that it's extremely beautiful over all.     (...)    anyway, with teeth is wonderful.  its a fairly good mix of \\"still\\" and \\"broken.\\"  and for anyone complaining about how long it took, i've heard from an actual friend of Trent's that he's got enough extra material to release another cd soon.  the song \\"right where it belongs\\" is almost reason enough to buy with teeth on its own.

B0007KTBIU|5.0|Even with its minor flaws, this film still stands, in my opinion, as one of Disney's greatest achievements.  Following the phenomenal success of \\"The Lion King\\" the previous year, \\"Pocahontas\\" was considered a dismal failure in 1995, as it barely made over 100 million at the box office.  True, there was no room for hyenas marching in lockstep or lusting French candlelabras, but what the Disney artists accomplished was that necessary next step in the art of animation.  Also true is the lack of historic accuracy to what little is known of Pocahontas and John Smith, and the fact there is no proof they were ever romantically linked.  But if historic accuracy was the most important criteria in filmmaking, \\"Pocahontas\\" would have been nothing more than an animated documentary.    Some viewers may be missing the point if they try to compare this movie with other Disney gems like \\"Snow White\\" or \\"Cinderella\\".  Pocahontas is portrayed here as a grown woman, and not a teen or \\"Little Mermaid\\".  Her romance with Smith is a strong lesson that love levels all barriers, even racial ones.  To me, this film was Disney's first attempt at an animated film with more adult values, a concept that should make both adults and children happy (and I always thought \\"Pocahontas\\" was a great \\"date\\" movie).  The Disney Studio should be commended in their efforts in this regard.    The discs we have here are not as well filled as that of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" or \\"The Lion King\\", although Disney correctly included the half hour documentary, hosted by Irene Bedard (the speaking voice of Pocahontas), that was televised on the Disney Channel when the film was originally released.  Also included is a film commentary by the producer and the two co-directors of the film.    The big selling point in this release is the inclusion of the  song, \\"If I Never Knew You\\", that was cut from the theatrical version (which also reappears as a reprise in the final scene).  Artistically, the song is necessary to solidly reinforce how much Pocahontas and Smith mean to each other (besides being a most beautiful composition).  But the viewer may decide its inclusion is unacceptable.  So Disney has given viewers two film choices, with the added song seamlessly inserted in the anniversary edition.    The film has undergone some amazing remastering, with far brighter colors and sharper lines than before.  Heavy film grain was a major distraction at the theater, on the VHS tape, and the original DVD, with flat areas appearing to dance about like ants.  But now, the image is smooth and beautiful.  Clearly \\"Pocahontas\\" is now close to the perfection it never was in the past.  The sound has a bit more gusto when heard in surround sound (thanks to THX), but the new remastering is barely noticable when heard on the TV alone.  Compared with the original DVD, the video difference is stunning.  Characters' movements seem more fluid this time around, and the sharpness of the outlines emphasize facial expression better.    The previous DVD listed the aspect ratio as 1.66:1, which was incorrect - it was actually closer to 1.50:1.  For the new DVD, we are given the ratio of 1.66:1, allowing more image left and right, but neither DVD has presented the film in the theatrical release ratio of 1.85:1.    For anyone who already has the previous DVD of \\"Pocahontas\\", an additional purchase may not be deemed necessary.  But for everyone else, this immaculate new presentation is a must have.
1400032717|5.0|I didn't realize there was anything wrong with Christopher until first part in novel. I just thought that he had a special talent. Sometimes I have been seeing some children did like Christopher. Sometimes they behaved like Christopher when they were angry and were not good feeling. It is very difficult to exactly divide between normal and abnormal. <br />    It was very interesting to me while I reading this book. I really couldn't expect like this story development. This book made more understand to me about autism people.  <br />   <br />
B0007OCG56|3.0|Not Adams best movie, but not his worst either. The one thing <br />in this movie I thought was really stupid was, hiring someone <br />to take care of your family, that speaks absolutely no english! <br />How the hell are you supposed to communicate with each other! <br />It starts off very slow, but picks up after the first half hour. <br />Don't expect to see a classic film, but it's not that bad. <br />
B000002UWE|5.0|This outstanding British art-pop band, led by singer/songwriter Mark Hollis, released five studio albums between 1982 and 1991. \\"Natural History\\" is a Best-Of collection that covers the first four Talk Talk albums, and I can most certainly guarantee that if you enjoy this disc, you'll definitely want to seek out the band's whole catalog. They only had one Top 40 hit in the States, \\"It's My Life\\" (recently covered by No Doubt), but there's a lot more intelligent, sophisticated tunes where that classic song came from. Talk Talk made GREAT music, with a grace and power in the way they used keyboards and piano, the big thumping of the drums, the cleverness of the songwriting & arrangements, the way their music could instantly grab you and hold your attention, and, of course, the distinctive, rich voice of Mark Hollis. \\"Talk Talk,\\" \\"Such A Shame,\\" \\"It's My Life,\\" \\"Life Is What You Make It,\\" \\"Living In Another World,\\" \\"Desire\\"....simply wonderful songs. Thanks to \\"Natural History,\\" I'm an instant fan, and I'm already seeking out the rest of the group's stuff. They never got the huge success that they so rightfully deserved, but Talk Talk was and IS a band to treasure. \\"Natural History\\" is a marvelous introduction.

Kurt Cobain is probably rolling in his grave because Trent stole his drafts of suicide letters and transformed them into a poetic ragefull midlife crisis theme. And everyone who falls under the category of rock is taking notes. Those of us who listened to the Downward Spiral by ourselves as teenagers on a Friday night- your atheist prayers have been answered, NIN is back in it's full glory. Twixters  stuck in your crappy jobs and relationships, \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" and \\"ONLY\\" are our live's background music.

B00003CXXP|3.0|There is a phrase that has been used throughout time and is very fitting in one sense here: there are too many cooks in the kitchen.  Normally, you can see this problem when a screenplay is written and rewritten by different people because it ends up distorting the story.  You have one person thinking the story should go one way, another thinking it should go the opposite and then the third person thinks they are both wrong and it needs to go his way.  When that happens, disaster usually follows.   <br /> <br />I use this example to help explain my problems with this film.  It originated as a Stanley Kubrick film that he had been wanting to do for years.  He had been waiting for technology to catch up so he could create what could have been his magnum opus had he not passed away.  He and Spielberg were friends and Spielberg took up directing and finishing Kubrick's film from the notes, story boards etc that Kubrick had created.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, what happened was that Kubrick's usually bleak and often satiric look at society became a sappy story with a weird, semi-oedipal ending.  It started as a film in which Kubrick wanted to examine the fairy tale story of Pinnochio and show how society can fool itself into wanting what we can never have.  The pursuit of the Blue Fairy becomes a pursuit for something that doesn't exist and can lead to our devastation.  That was a story that seemed interesting, if bleak and depressing.   <br /> <br />In fact, 2/3 of the movie seemed to be heading in that direction.  And then came the sappy ending that Spielberg decided to end on.  It wasn't the ending Kubrick would have ended with.  Instead, it tied everything up in a nice knot, albeit a weird and kind of disturbing one that seemed incredibly out of place with the themes and tone of the previous 2/3s.   <br /> <br />If Kubrick had been alive to create his magnum opus, the movie would have been quite different and, in my opinion, much better.  Instead of relying on themaudlin ending that gave even the robot a second chance at love, he wouldn't have compromised what his story was really about.  Love it or hate it, the story was originally supposed to be about the disillusion of the Pinnochio story.  That's not what we got.  The first 2/3s of the movie is verging on 5 stars.  The last 1/3 is a 1 star, trite and maudlin effort.  Overall, I'm sad to say it's 3 stars for me.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Here is the setting: An idealistic young teacher arrives at a well respected private school with the intention of making a difference in the lives and education of the students.  This teacher soon runs up against a tradition bound administration as well as some tradition bound students.  Soon enough the teacher begins to win over the students who are inspired by the teacher, but the administration is not so pleased by the radical new ideas and teaching methods used by this idealistic young teacher.  What movie is this?<br /><br />While I was talking about \\"Dead Poets Society\\", the above description can be used without any changes about 2003's \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\".  Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) is a young art history teacher from California newly arrived at the prestigious Wellesley College.  She has definite ideas about the role of women in the 1950's, but Wellesley seems to be nothing more than an excellent school to prepare the young women to be a good wife and mother.  While the academic standards are rigorous, the goal isn't for the woman to aspire to be somebody herself, but to help her husband be somebody.  Watson is appalled by this and by the resistance she meets from the administration and even by some of the brightest students.<br /><br />We are also introduced to some of the students, though we never get too much into their minds or lives.  There is Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst).  Betty is something of a snitch and seems to consider herself the purity police and is too full of herself.  Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles) is the student whom Katherine holds the most hope for.  In Joan, Katherine sees a little bit of herself.  Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is introduced only as the girl who, gasp, may have loose morals regarding men.  Finally Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the slightly dumpy girl who just hopes to find a man.<br /><br />This is really the Katherine Watson story and her influence on the girls, such as it is, and her frustration with Wellesley.  If we changed the all girls college to an all boys high school and traded Julia Roberts for Robin Williams, we'd have \\"Dead Poets Society\\".  But \\"Dead Poets Society\\" is a far better movie.  It may not be fair to compare the two movies, but when \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is so clearly modeled on \\"Dead Poets Society\\" how can the comparison not be made?  The main problem with \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is that it portrays 1950's Wellesley where the women are not expected to have minds after graduation nor are the expected to use them.  It is difficult to see how the issues raised in \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" are relevant today.  \\"Dead Poets Society\\" dealt with academic pressure and the ability to think for oneself.  \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" touches upon the same issues, but does so in such a way that the problems just don't feel as important.  This is all the more so because fifty years later the expectations on women in education are far different.  \\"Dead Poets Society\\" is much more universal.<br /><br />A minor issue, to place the movie in a historical context, is that I have read reviews questioning the accuracy of the portrayal of Wellesley in the 50's, and that the college was not the backwards wasteland which only expected women to marry and have children.  I can't say whether or not that is the case, but it is worth noting that the filmmakers may have twisted what facts were available to make a lesser movie.<br /><br />Grade: C+<br /><br />-Joe Sherryth Wellesley.

0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock is a legendary director and we get nothing less from him in Psycho.  The history of the film is nearly as interesting as the storyline itself.  When first released, Hitchcock insisted that no one be seated after the start of the film, making audiences assume that a major plotline occurs within the beginning of the story, and in fact a murder occurs within the first third of the film. <br /> Psycho is the grandfather of horror films; it made way for slasher, suspense films for decades to come.  The plotline of Psycho, however, is very simplistic.  A woman, Marion Crane, is given the task of depositing $40,000 into the bank.  She decides to steal it, however, and goes on the road with it.  On her road trip, she becomes tired and stops at the Bates Motel to rest for the night.  We are introduced to the young and handsome caretaker of the Bates Motel, Norman Bates.  We are taken into Normans world and take on the character's voyeurism as we watch Marion undress through a peephole in the wall.  It is here that the infamous shower scene occurs in which the heroine of the film is murdered.  The rest of the film is devoted to finding out what happened to Marion, as well as showing a more personal side to the murderer. <br /> Psycho delves into \\"the nightmarish, disturbing themes of corruptibility, confused identities, voyeurism, human vulnerabilities and victimization, and the deadly effects of money.\\" <br /> One of Psycho's greatest accomplishments is the ability to entice the audience.  At first, the audience is sympathetic towards Marion and her situation, until Hitchcock pulls the rug out from under us and kills the main character.  We then despise the murderer, Norman Bates, who we eventually become sympathetic towards him and his situation.  <br /> There are many great camera techniques that make this film so incredible.  First, Hitchcock insisted the movie be filmed in black and white because it would be too gory in color.  The use of black and whiteversus color adds to the ambience of the film. <br /> The greatest feature on this dvd are the special features.  A newsreel footage surrounding the making and release of the movie as well as posters and advertising materials for the movie's William Castle-like publicity campaign (No One Will Be Seated After the Feature Begins!); an archive of production stills; the special trailer in which Hitchcock (acting as one of the original Universal Studio tour guides) himself leads viewers around the Bates place; credit designer Saul Bass's original \\"shower scene\\" story boards; and a 90-minute documentary on the making of the film.  But above all, the most interesting special feature is the showing of the infamous shower scene with and without the music.  What a difference!

B000002UJQ|5.0|See title of review. <br /> <br />This is what I truly thought about Radiohead for many MANY years.  This album was released when I was in highschool and I remember almost noone I knew liking it.  I mean, is was boring crap, it was nothing compared to Pantera or Slayer d00d!  I looked past Radiohead ever since, I had written them off. <br /> <br />*sigh* <br /> <br />How blind I was.  I recently found myself hating all new music.  Well, not ALL new music, but the overwhelming majority of the new stuff being played on the radio was just...well...garbage. So I went to an internet message board I frequent and asked people there to \\"Help!\\", I needed something to listen to that didn't just drip with commericalized immaturity *coughlimpbisquitcough* for the sake of record sales.  Alot of people suggested alot of different things but there were two suggestions that stood out above all others and were mentioned the most: Tool and Radiohead.  Now, I've been a huge Tool fan for many many years so this wasn't new to me, but Radiohead?  Were these people serious?  That's a bunch of boring crap! <br /> <br />I argued with myself for a while but then decided \\"what the heck, it's just 11 bucks, if it sucks I'll give it away.\\"  So I bought OK Computer. <br /> <br />On my first listen, I wasn't really all that impressed.  But, I didn't just automatically write it off as \\"boring crap\\" like I first did when I was 16.  So I gave it another whirl, I let it play through itself a few times in my car CD player over the next few days.  Then something happened... <br /> <br />On what was maybe my third time through the CD, the song \\"Let Down\\" played, and it just hit me.  It washed over me and I suddenly found myself wanting more and more.  This is what I had been looking for!  I hadn't had any new (to me) music give me the \\"chills\\" in so long I was going through withdrawl.  Then this happened. <br /> <br />The funny thing about this for me was that every time I've ever gotten the \\"chills\\" from a song, it has always always happened the first time I heard it.  But for some reason, somehow, this \\"boring crap\\" gave me the chills, but only after the third of fourth time I heard it.  I still am not exactly sure how that happened, but it did. <br /> <br />I then went on the listen to the album a few hundred more times looking for more \\"chills\\", and I found they were in plentiful supply all over the place, they just weren't obvious like most music is.  Very subtle.  In fact, if I had to describe this album in one word it would be \\"subtle\\".   <br /> <br />This was just a few months ago (November 04).  Now-a-days, when I am rifling through my CD carrier in my car, I often find myself stopping at OK Computer, looking at the CD, smiling, and putting it in the player. <br /> <br />It took some doing on my part, but this album went from \\"boring crap\\" the first time I heard it to one of my biggest treasures in my music collection after I gave it a chance.  5 well deserved stars.

B0000033OT|5.0|Listening to this disc reminds me of why I love music - Donny Hathaway is gone too soon from this world.  I wish he could have gotten the help he needed to deal with his inner demons but his musical legacy definitely helps ME get through my own Tryin Times and battle my own demons and for that, I am forever greatful.<br /><br />This entire album is exquisitely excellent, there's not one bad track but there are some that stand out to me:<br /><br />Voices Inside (Everything is Everything) - great musical production!! 10/10<br /><br />Je Vous Aime (I Love You) - so soulful, such a beautiful love song.  10/10<br /><br />Misty - excellent remake 10/10<br /><br />Tryin Times - timeless song expressing commentary about what was going on then but also speaks to what is going on in today's times  10/10<br /><br />Thank You Master For My Soul - excellent soulful gospel song that doesn't overpower  10/10<br /><br />The Ghetto - although I prefer the live versions of this song, it's pretty damn close to a masterpiece & just as powerful as any song on Marvin Gaye's 'What's Goin On'  10/10<br /><br />To Be Young, Gifted & Black - one of my favorite Donny tracks, picks up my spirits every single time I hear it  100/10<br /><br />A Dream - words can't suffice for how much I love this song - the arrangement and Donny's phrasing throughout...make this song heaven for me.  100/10

B000929AJQ|3.0|I've been listening to NIN's ever since Trent was hanging upside down in recording tape in the \\"Head like a hole\\" video.  The one thing I know for a fact is that you need to listen to a NIN album quite a number of times before you can get a feel for it.  So give this album a chance before passing judgement on it and tucking it away with the rest of the crap you don't listen to.  \\"With Teeth\\" may be a different case because Trent himself said this album is more a compilation of singles as opposed to a theme album.  So its possible that what you hear now is what you get...man I hope not. <br /> <br />The first single is by far one of the worst NIN songs ever.  This is not a bold statement because I really can't name off more than a couple bad songs.  So don't judge the album from its first single..the single blows.  Why it was even released it beyond me. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is ok at best.  There is not one song on it that would go into my \\"best of\\" collection.  One serious problem I have is that there really isn't one song that jumps out and bites me in the ass.  I would hope with a title like \\"With Teeth\\", you would have at least on song that was something along the lines of \\"Happiness in Slavery\\".  I am also not feeling one club hit here.  You would think with the flashback to PHM techno, that there would be a least on legit dance song.  \\"Closer\\" is of course by far one of the best get your grind on club songs ever to be made...and I mean EVER.   <br /> <br />The slow songs are classic NIN's, very nice, but without \\"Teeth\\" completely.  I don't need yelling and hatred from NIN's to like it, but I would expect something MUCH harder with a title like \\"With Teeth\\". <br /> <br />I do like track 1...nice start, great baseline. Sounds a lot like a song from the Fragile...can't place my finger on it right now. <br /> <br />I like song 2 also, but it starts out as \\"Big Man With a Gun\\" and turns into \\"Bulls on Parade\\". <br /> <br />Song 3 is really nice, but itsounds like \\"Burn\\". <br /> <br />You get what I am saying?  I think I have heard half this stuff before.  I get the feeling this may be a \\"best of sounds\\" for NINs, not a really a new album. <br /> <br />Fair warning..song 8 is bad too...bad throw back to PHM.   <br /> <br />Song 9 could be a Foo Fighters song.  I like \\"what's his name\\", but has his drumming made this album better?   <br /> <br />Song 11 is good.  Song 13 is a \\"Hurt\\" remix. <br /> <br />It will grow on me.  I know it will, but I will still have to hit the skip button when listening to it.  Something I haven't done to a NIN CD since I was looking for the hidden tracks on Broken. <br /> <br />
0446525537|1.0|Perhaps I'm too jaded, too stupid or too old to enjoy this novel, or perhaps this novel is vacuous, insipid, formulaic and fatuous.  DOES THE LARGE PRINT REALLY FOOL THE READER THAT THIS IS A NOVEL AND NOT GENERIC, DIME-STORE FICTION? I'm sorry, but I will never read another novel by this author since he apparently has no compunctions about churning out this drivel, one after the other, while glaringly omitting meaning, purpose, originality, intellectual challenge, fire or inspiration.  Perhaps I am mistaken and this work is specifically intended for the very young, for those learning English as a second language, or for the mentally infirm.  \\"Pop\\" fiction.
B000268QB2|5.0|With Hopes and Fears, Keane has proven to be the best progressive rock band ever, far superior even to Coldplay, who are also amazing. Keane has made a bold move, forming a band with a piano/keyboard player and no guitars at all. Even without guitars in the band, they have a very full, rich sound, which is rare in such a new band. The pianist provides solid accompaniment to the solid voice of the singer. Tom's voice drives their overall sound, and the songs are moved with sharp melodies. <br /> <br />\\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" which opens the album is their best-known song. The piano part is clever, although simple and is backed up by the nice, but not overpowering drumbeat. The melody is good, although not their best in my opinion. <br /> <br />\\"This is the Last Time\\" has one of the best melodies on the album. It moves at a similar pace and tempo to \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" giving another chance for the listener to hear the sound of a big hit by Keane. \\"Everybody's Changing\\" is all the same, but even better. <br /> <br />\\"Bend and Break\\" is their best song that was never released as a single. Its style is similar to the previous two songs. <br /> <br />\\"We Might as Well be Strangers\\" is the first change in style on the album. It moves to a slower tempo and more melancholy style and lyrics.  <br /> <br />\\"Your Eyes Open\\" is a little lighter than the singles and has a bright, clean melody. <br /> <br />\\"She Has no Time\\" is the least dynamic song on the album. This is where you can really hear Tom soar to the heights of his falsetto voice. It's not my personal favorite song, but it provides a nice contrast to the rest of the album with the most melancholy sound and style and the highest notes. \\"Sunshine\\" is similar, but the tone is less melancholy and everything is more moderate. <br /> <br />\\"Can't Stop Now\\" is reminiscent of \\"Your Eyes Open,\\" but Tom's voice doesn't seem as pure as on the other songs. Many of the consonant sounds are too hard and sound a bit pushed.<br /> <br />\\"Untitled 1\\" is very unusual. It's much more synthetic than the other songs, using keyboard effects in the background along with the drumbeat. The vocal part is simple and seems to be as much of a background as the keyboard effects rather than driving the song.  <br /> <br />\\"Bedshaped\\" is slow, but very dynamic. Every time it crescendos into the chorus, I seem to get a chill. It's really a great song. <br /> <br />\\"On a Day Like Today\\" is only available on the British version of the album, but it is downloadable on itunes. It repeats itself over and over again for about five minutes, but what's great about it is not so much the melody as the musical crescendo. The song opens with just a soft piano sound and vocals and builds up a louder, fuller sound with additional parts added, including well-written backup vocals. I recommend downloading it. <br /> <br />I hope this review helped people who are not familiar with Keane or Hopes and Fears. Keane has become one of my favorite bands and I'm eagerly awaiting a follow-up album. I highly recommend Hopes and Fears.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I bought this CD not expecting much after seeing a couple of user reviews on the internet. When I put it in my CD player in my car and started sampling tracks, I was completely shocked!  <br /> <br />This Nine Inch Nails Album is Trent Reznor's best work in my opinion. \\"With Teeth\\" is more emotional and stronger than any of the other NIN albums. \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"The Fragile\\" are masterpieces, don't get me wrong, but this album is just astonishing.  <br /> <br />The songs on this album sound a lot more complete and less diverse. Some NIN songs from the other albums have a lot of music that just repeats simple beats and soft sounds without any vocals. This album is just the opposite. Reznor is a lot more vocal and his voice sounds stronger and more confident than ever. His singing and screaming fits perfectly along to the beats and music.  <br /> <br />Tracks like \\"You Know Who You Are?\\" and \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" really show how NIN has evolved. The beats and sounds are a lot more catchy and complete on this album. I honestly didn't expect NIN could ever make an album that is better than \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or \\"The Fragile\\", but I'm glad they did. The fact that \\"With Teeth\\" is so hard, just makes it even better. This album is a Nine Inch Nails fan's dream come true.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|My husband took me to see Phantom of the Opera on stage twice.  I loved each performance, enjoying the different interpretations of the Phantom, Christina, the Count, Carlotta, etc.  When I received the movie version I was very excited.  And after seeing it I knew that I'd watch it over and over and over again.  It's a gem.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most is the close-ups.  Being able to see the emotions as well as to hearing them.  I couldn't help but think--the Count is the calm in Christina's life, and the Phantom is the storm.  Then, I thought of the Phantom and how much more in control he was when he wore the mask--the way he walked, how tall he stood, how commanding he appeared and sounded.  Carlotta was fun to watch and hear.  I know I've not mentioned any of the actors names in this review but I don't feel it's necessary.  They were all magnificent and I applaud them!  A movie not to be missed.
B00003CX96|4.0|This is a truly touching story about a young man from a working-class background growing up in a college town.  Most of the townspeople (called \\"cutters\\" by the college students who look down upon them) work or worked in the nearby rock quarry, managing at most a modest middle-class status.  This story is primarily about this friction between social classes, and one young man's successful ascent out of his own social class and into college.  And it is about more than that.  The method by which he succeeds inspires the whole town to be proud of their solid, working class roots, and affirms the fact that in America we need not be bound by our social class, and indeed with brains, ability, talent, and yes, guts, a person can achieve anything.<br /><br />The protagonist is an amateur bicyclist, and the struggle is initially about his attempt to break into the ranks of amateur bicycling.  This theme is woven into the social class divisions of the town, which are an obstacle to his dreams.  In the end, (no spoiler here) he succeeds in a dramatic way.  This film succeeds in being both significant and very funny.<br /><br />A fine film that the whole family can enjoy together.
B000002HGD|5.0|\\"HYMN\\", AND \\"GOD MOVING OVER THE FACE OF THE WATERS\\" ALONE MAKE THIS ALBUM AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ANY ELECTRONIC / AMBIENT MUSIC FAN...BOTH ARE TIMELESS PIECES OF BRILLIANCE, LIFE-AFFIRMING MELANCHOLIC EMOTION THRUST UPON THE LISTENER LEAVING YOU IN A TRANCE OF DEEP THOUGHTS AND CONTEMPLATION... THE UPTEMPO TRACKS ARE DATED BY TODAYS STANDARDS OF SYNTH MANIPULATION AND SOUND COUNSTRUCTION, BUT THEN AGAIN, THE BEAUTY OF ITS AMBIENT AND DOWNTEMPO MOMENTS ARE WHAT YOU ARE REALLY BUYING THIS ALBUM FOR ANYWAY...A MUST-HAVE...
B0007YMUZW|4.0|It is very likely as I listen to this album more I will change my rating from 4 stars to 5.  So far, only Heartbreaker is worthy of a 5 start rating (from his solo catalogue; Whiskeytown's Pneumonia also deserves 5), but even Heartbreaker took a few listens before I loved every song.   <br />There are some immediate greats on Cold Roses, such as \\"If I Am A Stranger\\", \\"When Will You Come Back Home,\\" \\"Beautiful Sorta\\" (with an opening reminiscent of Heartbreaker's \\"Argument With David Rawlings\\"), \\"Dance All Night\\" (the return of the Harmonica) and the first single \\"Let It Ride.\\"  Cold Roses could actually be the missing link between Pneumonia and Heartbreaker, with the personal lyrics of solo Adams and the diverse instrumental backing of a band. <br />If your favorite work of Ryan is Heartbreaker or before, you will be glad to have this album.  If you are more a fan of Gold or even Demolition (are there many of those people?), you will still enjoy Ryan Adams at top songwriting capactiy.  Rock N Roll this is not, nor is it the gloom of Love Is Hell (which was underrated, but certainly very dark). <br />This is Ryan Adams back to his roots and exploring how beautiful those can be.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Its amazing how so many critics and differerent kinds of people have their say about music that is so personal.Especially now.When the dark world view and psychological pain is not a part of  larger music scene.There is no more Nirvana.There is no more Pumpkins.There is no more Rage Against the Machine. <br /> <br />And unlike say the excellent new Eels cd,these shut-in anthems of not fitting in society and hating thous that do,are  for the mainstream rock masses.They are catchy and melodic enough so that people who cant relate will sing along to \\"Every Day is Exactly The Same\\" without having a clue what it means. <br /> <br />I really dont understand reviews that say that Trent's heart is not in it.His heart has never been in it more.Especially with the lyrics and his beautiful singing.Much more direct then on past albums. <br /> <br />with that,here is my review of all 13 songs. <br /> <br />All The Love in The World <br /> <br />just a stunning, beautiful opener where Trent's singing reaches new heights. <br />Over dark and moody drum-and bass,Trent sings about \\"hiding in the crowd I'm all alone\\" <br />Then as the keyboard comes in for the crashing chorus, \\"sometimes i get so lonely I could die\\" And \\"why do you get all the love in the world ?\\".From the first listen,this song really moved me. <br /> <br />You Know What You Are? <br /> <br />from the sad and beautiful to industrial rock at its most brutal.Super-fast drums and dark distorted guitars.Trent's voice turning downright scary in its anger.\\"Dont You F___ know who you are\\" is certainly the cachiest NIN battle cry since \\"Head Like A  Hole Black As Your Soul\\" . <br /> <br />The Collector <br /> <br />another track that rocks like hell.Over heavy bass and a killer beat,Trent sings about being the Collector,but \\"there are so many of them its hard to breath\\".The jazzy piano that comes in near the end is a nice touch. <br /> <br /> <br />The Hand That Feeds <br /> <br />its nice to hear the beginning without somedj talking over it.Another anthemic,angry song with a political feel. <br /> <br />Love Is Not Enough <br /> <br />mid-tempo song with very creepy and loud beat that is joined by chainsaw guitars.The lyrics also dark and great. <br /> <br />Every Day Is Exactly the Same <br /> <br />my favorite song on the cd,and one of my all time favorite NIN songs.Not only because I relate to the lyrics about isolation and tiring of life's daily routines so much.But also because the music is so anthemic and catchy, and the chorus so addictively memorable \\"Everyday exactly the same/There is no love here and there is no pain\\".)The part when he sings \\"I cant remember how this got started,but I can tell you exactly how this will end\\" gives me chills. <br /> <br />With Teeth <br /> <br />reminds me a little of \\"Reptile'.Very strange but has a nice <br />memorable chorus. <br /> <br />Only <br /> <br />my second most favorite track.Anyone who grew up in the 80's will love the odd retro synths and drums.And especially the playful spoken word.The words seem to be about battling one's self-made demons. <br /> <br />Getting Smaller <br /> <br />after the two odd but great tracks,its back to more brutal but very catchy and anthemic industrial rock.The \\"Flip Flop Flip\\" lyric in the beginning might be a clue as to what Trent is raging <br />against. <br /> <br />Sunspots <br /> <br />Pure Pretty Hate Machine era NIN! <br /> <br /> <br />The Line Begins to Blur <br /> <br />pure anger in the verse gives way to sadness in the chorus. <br />\\" I always knew what side to be on.Now i'm not so sure. <br />The Line begins to blur\\". <br /> <br />Beside You In Time  <br /> <br />reminds me of \\"Something I Can Never Have\\" but without the keyboards.Very pretty. <br /> <br />Right Where It Belongs  <br /> <br />in the tradition of sad NIN closers,Right Where It Belongs is a really sad lullabye-suicidal ballad of hopelessness and depression.The lonely keyboard,the haunting atmospherics and Trent's voice filled with pain. \\"what if the whole world is inside your head,just creations of your own,the devils and the gods,the living and the dead,and you are really all alone.You can live in this illusion,you can chose to believe.you keep looking but you cant find the words,now your hiding in a dream...if you look at your reflections are you all you wanted to be?\\".If you love \\"Hurt\\" then you will love this. <br /> <br />again,With Teeth is an amazing heartfelt,powerful album.The problem with an \\"alternative\\" band having a big hit is that people who will never \\"get it\\" start jumping on the bandwagon <br />but they are too low level in intelegents to actually \\"get it\\". <br />Thous people would be better served by the new Limp Bizkit cd.For which thinking is not required!
B0007O38XU|3.0|The movie itself is pure Mel Brooks. I really enjoy how Mel brings hilarious havoc to the sci-fi genre, spoofing movies from Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers to Star Trek and Star Wars.  I am surprised that MPAA had originally given this movie a PG rating instead of a PG-13 rating since the movie is heavy on adult humor, language, and sexual innuendos - not exactly what I would call a flick for the whole family.  Enough about the movie; this review is about the newly released Collector's Edition (CE), especially the bonus material.<br /><br />The Dolby 5.1 sound quality has been enhanced compared to the original 2000 DVD release, but I will need to confirm this.  I'm glad MGM offers a DTS track on disc 1.  I have not yet compared Mel's commentary on the CE to the original release.  I did make some limited comparisons of the picture quality: The colors are more vibrant (perhaps too much on the red?) and the picture is clearer to my eyes; the skin tones look correct to me. Since the video presentation is not THX quality, you will see some specks and film blemishes. The aspect ratio on the CE (1.85:1 for 16x9) is the same as the original 2000 release, but on my Sony monitor (4:3) the CE widescreen version is \\"slightly\\" zoomed in more than the 2000 widescreen released version.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the Special Features. Why? For one reason, it does not include Rick Moranis.  He is mentioned but is not interviewed at all - how can Mel not include Dark Helmet!  In addition, you will not find any behind-the-scenes coverage (other than still photos) such as those found on the 2000 DVD release. Mel did not include any deleted scenes or bloopers (no, the film flubs don't count).  However, there is a well-produced 29 minute documentary that includes the other main actors and crew members. You will learn that the actors and crew members had more laughs making this movie than the audience had watching it.  If this is true, Mel should have included some of those comical moments in the Special Features.  Also missing on this CE is a featurette about special-effects.  The conversation between Mel and co-writer Thomas Meehan is rather boring, but the tribute to comical genius John Candy is commendable, touching, and about time.<br /><br />The CE is a 2-disc DVD set.  It is a shame that MGM and Mel could not/would not include more about this classic comedy.  Overall I give the CE version a 3/5. The movie gets 4/5!ial Features.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have been a huge fan of this musical for close to twenty years.  I used to tell people that I felt sorry for anyone whose first theatre experience was \\"Phantom\\" because nothing else could ever measure up to its opulence and grandeur, and other great works would suffer by comparison.      I had high hopes for the movie, and although I enjoyed it immensely, deep down I felt that the vocal performances of the three leads left just a little to be desired.  Nevertheless, the film was stunning with its lush production values, and as I sat in the theatre, I knew I was just exactly where I wanted to be.  It was great to really see the expressions on the faces of the actors, and just that luxury alone made the movie a whole new worthwhile \\"Phantom\\" experience.    I received my DVD today, and looked at the extras first.  They were enormously entertaining, and worth the price of the DVD by themselves.  Then, I started to watch the feature, but, on a whim, turned on the French audio track.  I had never heard \\"Phantom\\" in French before, but since the setting of the piece is Paris, I thought French might add a flair of authenticity to this wonderful romantic tale.  I was blown away...just who are these French and/or French Canadian actors/singers who did the dubbing for this DVD release???  I wish they were credited.      The French musicals \\"Notre Dame de Paris,\\" \\"Romeo et Juliette,\\" and \\"Autant En Emporte Le Vent,\\" along with many others, owe their very existence to Andrew Lloyd Webber and his theatrical visions.  Now, \\"Phantom\\" may be the greatest French musical of them all..these performances are chilling.    It was terrific to once again experience \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\" in yet a third and even more brilliant light.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Im sick of hearing people whine about this album not sounding like the Downward Spiral - anyone who's listened to all of Reznor's previous albums would realize that you have to respect none of them have yet to sound alike.  He cant have that teen angst/aggression sound forever, and for people to dismiss a new work of art because its not the same as your favorite makes for a very closed minded individual.  Im thankful that we at least still have an artist around who doesnt want regurgitate what somebody else wrote and dance around on a stage because that's what their record label tells them to do - this is not the definition of a musician, its the definition of a puppet. <br /> <br />Now that ive said my piece...on to the review...   <br /> <br />I feel this album could have slid in nicely after Pretty Hate Machine era in terms of sound...it has a lot of synth pop mixed with some of the elements of the Broken EP.  A true NIN fan will enjoy this as it is Trent doing what he does best - demonstrating emotion through his music.  Only difference is this time around you get to hear it in his words more so than the music - a welcomed change for me as I dont always want to hear the sonic intensity of the spiral (even though I love that album, too).  I have enjoyed watching Reznor grow as an artist and am happy to add this one to the collection.  While I realize NIN isnt everyone's cup of tea (and I wouldnt recommend it to just anyone) I just want to point out that you can always buy it, try it out, and if you hate it, take it to a used cd store for a credit.  If youve liked the past albums and arent put off to him evolving, you will like this.   <br /> <br />Happy Listening, <br />Azure
B000002U82|5.0|It's no mystery why 'Dark Side of The Moon' has remained on the charts for so long: it's great music.  This is not the greatest album of all time or even Pink Floyd's greatest album, however.  It's not even that accessible.  When I first got it, I remember I only really liked the song \\"Money\\" and the rest was kind of strange.  \\"Why do they wait so long to start singing?  and what's with the clashing synthesizers?\\" I thought.  The truth is that most people buy this CD because they've heard _of_ it, or because their friend told them it was great.  To hear this CD once, and then be in love with it is something that's not possible unless you're a big fan of the band, and in which case you should already have this.  Why am I talking about all this?  To give a little perspective.  Although it's commonly placed under the now vague subheading of ROCK/POP in music stores, don't expect a rock record or a pop record.  The songs \\"Money\\" and \\"Time\\" are rock songs to be sure, but this music it far wider in its scope and far grander in its effects than your run of the mill rock record.  One must have an open mind to appreciate 'Dark Side of The Moon.'  Like I said earlier, you can't have a fixed idea of when they should start singing, or how long is too long for a vocal solo.  To even start to appreciate this CD, you need to forget everything you ever knew about music, just sit back, and relax.  It's a great record. <br /> <br />If you like this, you might also like: <br />Animals - Pink Floyd <br />Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd <br />The Wall - Pink Floyd <br />Meddle - Pink Floyd <br />To Our Children's Children's Children - The Moody Blues <br />A Passion Play - Jethro Tull <br />In The Court of The Crimson King - King Crimson <br />Demons and Wizards - Uriah Heep
B0008ISM40|5.0|Nine Inch Nails are back with their fourth effort \\"With Teeth,\\" and once again Trent Reznor has made an outstanding album.<br /><br />Although the album has a sense of urgency, \\"With Teeth\\" is not as angry or intense as \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" (1989) or \\"The Downward Spiral\\" (1994). Overall, I think the actual songs on \\"With Teeth\\" sound most similar to those on \\"The Fragile\\" (1999). Unlike \\"The Fragile,\\" however, there are not any instrumentals. \\"With Teeth\\" gets more to-the-point. Although I personally loved the long instrumentals on \\"The Fragile,\\" fans who thought the album was too self-indulgent or long, may be more pleased with the format of \\"With Teeth.\\"<br /><br />One additional difference between \\"The Fragile\\" and \\"With Teeth\\" is the welcome addition of drummer Dave Grohl on several of the tracks. His playing gives the album more of a live, organic feel, and gives the sound a shot in the arm. Unfortunately, what tracks he plays on are not listed on the CD case and there is no booklet. However, you'll know when you hear him.<br /><br />I liked \\"With Teeth\\" after the first listen. However, much like \\"The Fragile\\" this is definitely an album that grows on you with repeated plays. There's a lot going on in all of the songs-subtle things, solos, guitars and keyboards-things that you might not pick up on the first couple times. It definitely gets better with repeated plays. Like all Nine Inch Nails albums, each song is meticulously and painstakingly crafted, there is no filler.<br /><br />The themes of \\"With Teeth\\" are similar to those on past NIN albums-loneliness, rage, fear, nihilism-but Reznor sounds less bleak, more confident, if only slightly so.<br /><br />The album starts out with the rather sluggish \\"All the Love in the World,\\" which has an almost claustrophobic feel. It sort of grinds itself along, and gives way to a satisfying buildup and  sublime finale when the piano kicks in towards the end.<br /><br />\\"You Know What You Are?\\" sounds frantic, and is intensified by the pounding drums.<br /><br />\\"The Collector\\" has a really cool, almost funky bass line. It has a great groove and the chorus is really melodic. It's very infectious.<br /><br />\\"The Hand that Feeds\\" was a good pick as the first single, as it is pretty representative of the album as a whole. This mid-tempo industrial rocker is very catchy.<br /><br />The slow-paced \\"Love is Not Enough\\" is one of the album's more rock orientated songs, when the guitars kick in. The verse sort of rolls along, and then explodes into the chorus. The keyboard solo toward the end is a nice touch.<br /><br />I think \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\" would be a good choice for the next single. It has a very cool, low-key industrial background. It reminds me somewhat of \\"That's What I Get\\" from \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\" The song is especially beautiful when the piano kicks in.<br /><br />The album's title track \\"With Teeth\\" takes a few listens to get into. It starts out rather sluggish and claustrophobic...and then...you can hardly hear anything, as Trent Reznor whispers the words over a faint piano...it's very melancholy...and then it gets back to where it started, only now it is more intense.<br /><br />\\"Only\\" has a bit of retro feel; it sort of sounds like something Gary Numan or Devo might do. It has a lot of synths going on and is very interesting. It's really catchy and I think a potential single.<br /><br />The fast paced \\"Getting Smaller\\" is effective and keeps up the momentum.<br /><br />The pacing of \\"Sunspots\\" is what makes the song really work. It starts out slow, builds up, intensifies, slows down again, builds up, intensifies, it keeps the listener intrigued. The keyboards and guitars are subtly added in and sort of creep up on you-it's a cool effect.<br /><br />The distorted \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" is mid-paced, but intense. It transforms and becomes hauntingly melodic. The guitar solo, while not technically brilliant, is really catchy and part of the song's highlight.<br /><br />\\"Beside You in Time\\" keeps going on-and-off, like when you turn a radio off-and-on-this creates a really cool throbbing effect. The song actually sounds like it's throbbing. The throbbing gets more and more intense as the song rolls along.<br /><br />The closing \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" is beautifully eerie. The piano and the underwhelming vocals really give the song a nice effect. The song builds up and gets more intense; but the song, and the album, go out with a whimper rather than a bang (not that that's a bad thing).<br /><br />Again, this album takes a few listens to really appreciate. It gets better and better with successive plays. \\"With Teeth\\" is an album to be relished with repeated listens.<br /><br />If you've never liked Nine Inch Nails, this album probably won't win you over. If you disliked \\"The Fragile,\\" you also probably won't like this album. If you disliked \\"The Fragile\\" because of its long instrumentals, but liked the actual songs, you will probably like this to. Most NIN fans in general should be pleased with \\"With Teeth.\\"really cool throbbing effect. The song actually sounds like it's throbbing.

B00003CWL6|5.0|Namely, there was no reason to show Mena Suvari's breasts-a comment made by another reviewer that I hadn't thought about until I read that particular review.  Also, are we to think that Kevin Spacey's character WOULD have had sex with an underage girl had he NOT found out she was a virgin???  This point is completely ignored and, upon reflection, takes some of the movie's luster away.  However, I found the movie to be great nonetheless.  So much of it rang true, even amongst the cliches, that it made a lasting impression.  Given the passion that this film has created, I suggest renting it first, though I think most will end up buying it.

Unlike \\"The Fragile,\\" however, there are not any instrumentals. \\"With Teeth\\" gets more to-the-point. Although I personally loved the long instrumentals on \\"The Fragile,\\" fans who thought the album was too self-indulgent or long, may be more pleased with the format of \\"With Teeth.\\"<br /><br />One additional difference between \\"The Fragile\\" and \\"With Teeth\\" is the welcome addition of drummer Dave Grohl on several of the tracks. His playing gives the album more of a live, organic feel, and gives the sound a shot in the arm. Unfortunately, what tracks he plays on are not listed on the CD case and there is no booklet. However, you'll know when you hear him.<br /><br />I liked \\"With Teeth\\" after the first listen. However, much like \\"The Fragile\\" this is definitely an album that grows on you with repeated plays. There's a lot going on in all of the songs-subtle things, solos, guitars and keyboards-things that you might not pick up on the first couple times. It definitely gets better with repeated plays. Like all Nine Inch Nails albums, each song is meticulously and painstakingly crafted, there is no filler.<br /><br />The themes of \\"With Teeth\\" are similar to those on past NIN albums-loneliness, rage, fear, nihilism-but Reznor sounds less bleak, more confident, if only slightly so.<br /><br />The album starts out with the rather sluggish \\"All the Love in the World,\\" which has an almost claustrophobic feel. It sort of grinds itself along, and gives way to a satisfying buildup and  sublime finale when the piano kicks in towards the end.<br /><br />\\"You Know What You Are?\\" sounds frantic, and is intensified by the pounding drums.<br /><br />\\"The Collector\\" has a really cool, almost funky bass line. It has a great groove and the chorus is really melodic. It's very infectious.<br /><br />\\"The Hand that Feeds\\" was a good pick as the first single, as it is pretty representative of the album as a whole. This mid-tempo industrial rocker is very catchy.<br /><br />The slow-paced \\"Love is Not Enough\\" is one of the album's more rock orientated songs, when the guitars kick in. The verse sort of rolls along, and then explodes into the chorus. The keyboard solo toward the end is a nice touch.<br /><br />I think \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\" would be a good choice for the next single. It has a very cool, low-key industrial background. It reminds me somewhat of \\"That's What I Get\\" from \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\" The song is especially beautiful when the piano kicks in.<br /><br />The album's title track \\"With Teeth\\" takes a few listens to get into. It starts out rather sluggish and claustrophobic...and then...you can hardly hear anything, as Trent Reznor whispers the words over a faint piano...it's very melancholy...and then it gets back to where it started, only now it is more intense.<br /><br />\\"Only\\" has a bit of retro feel; it sort of sounds like something Gary Numan or Devo might do. It has a lot of synths going on and is very interesting. It's really catchy and I think a potential single.<br /><br />The fast paced \\"Getting Smaller\\" is effective and keeps up the momentum.<br /><br />The pacing of \\"Sunspots\\" is what makes the song really work. It starts out slow, builds up, intensifies, slows down again, builds up, intensifies, it keeps the listener intrigued. The keyboards and guitars are subtly added in and sort of creep up on you-it's a cool effect.<br /><br />The distorted \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" is mid-paced, but intense. It transforms and becomes hauntingly melodic. The guitar solo, while not technically brilliant, is really catchy and part of the song's highlight.<br /><br />\\"Beside You in Time\\" keeps going on-and-off, like when you turn a radio off-and-on-this creates a really cool throbbing effect. The song actually sounds like it's throbbing. The throbbing gets more and more intense as the song rolls along.<br /><br />The closing \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" is beautifully eerie. The piano and the underwhelming vocals really give the song a nice effect. The song builds up and gets more intense; but the song, and the album, go out with a whimper rather than a bang (not that that's a bad thing).<br /><br />Again, this album takes a few listens to really appreciate. It gets better and better with successive plays. \\"With Teeth\\" is an album to be relished with repeated listens.<br /><br />If you've never liked Nine Inch Nails, this album probably won't win you over. If you disliked \\"The Fragile,\\" you also probably won't like this album. If you disliked \\"The Fragile\\" because of its long instrumentals, but liked the actual songs, you will probably like this to. Most NIN fans in general should be pleased with \\"With Teeth.\\"a really cool throbbing effect. The song actually sounds like it's throbbing. The throbbing gets more and more intense as the song rolls along.     The closing \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" is beautifully eerie.

B000929AJQ|4.0|When I first put the record in and heard the jazzy and smooth All The Love In The World, I was stoked. After listening to 6 songs, I was livid with rage. \\"What is this crap?\\" I was asking myself. Trent, you have 7 more songs to redeem yourself, I thought. Well, there weren't any brilliant flashes and aside from The Line Begins to Blur I wasn't hearing the texture I was so desperately seeking. By this time I was screaming at the computer and looking at my receipt to find a return policy. But  I managed to somehow gather my wits, and I started it back on track one with a new attitude. As I was pleased to find, the texture was there, it was just so refined that it had lost that choppy, cold and mechanicalness. We had moved from \\"industrial\\" to electro noise pop. I started to smile, looking past the typical reznor lyrics to the warmth of this album, then it hit me. This is probably the most rock and roll piece of work the man has ever done. It's probably the second funkiest, possibly tied with Pretty Hate Machine. This album REQUIRES repeated play to take it in, especially for the hardcore Broken NIN fans. Give it a chance and just relax, it's not that it's gone soft, it's just that it's now found SOUL. It's practicly Motown.
0743454537|5.0|What a storyline...a child conceived to save the life of a sibling.  It hooked me, then Picoult's style reeled me in.   When she described how and when Kate was diagnosed with cancer, my heard just ached.  It's been a long time since a book actually made me cry as I read, but this one did it.  Her description of the chemo and other medical treatments and procedures made me think she has to have lived through this in order to be so detailed.  The chapters are told in first person point of view, but the author switches between characters.  So, one chapter will be told from the mother's point of view, the next from the daughter, the next from the father, or the brother, etc.  I enjoy getting to know all of the characters so intimately. I will certainly search out other books by Picoult.  My Sister's Keeper has deeply affected me...and it has reminded me to be thankful for my healthy children.
6305126062|1.0|\\"The Horse Whisperer\\" is for garage sale addicts who get rained out some weekend. Much of the character development, sub-themes, plot sequence and even dialogue is thinly disguised rehash of Redford's earlier movie \\"The Electric Horseman\\". \\"TEH\\" was good, or at least Fun, because it was fresh. But repackaging a lot of it to make \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" turned it into refried beans. \\"Whisperer\\" is even worse because quite a bit of the main plot simply defies all credibility. The supposed epiphaney of the unconvincing \\"family' is so hokey and disingenious it should have somehow been filmed in crayon, not Technicolor. It did as well as it did at the box office for only four reasons. It had a large promotional budget, it had Redford's name attached, it had the word \\"horse\\" in the title, and there are plenty of garage sale addicts here. Get \\"City Slickers\\" instead. The theme is about the same, the characters are more interesting and it has some funny parts.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Picking up where Reznor left off, where real music lies, this album proves no less.  Just as THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL was an advanced version of PRETTY HATE MACHINE, WITH_TEETH takes you past the era of THE FRAGILE with a new sound that reflects the old in a modern manner (listen to ONLY, then dig through your vinyls and listen to DOWN IN IT).  Reznor doesn't disappoint as he touches on all emphases of sound.  While WITH_TEETH is straight to the point with little time to spare the only downfall is the lack of instrumentals and synth sounds we are all used to. However, I wouldn't have this album any other way, and it was worth the six year wait.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album stands as my second favorite offering from Reznor (next to The Fragile). As some other reviews have said, this album doesn't take any risks, just goes straight for a rock-n-roll song based album. Plenty of catchy, powerful hooks mixed with that classic Reznor sound, I just love rockin this album in my car...

B00004Y6O9|5.0|I was 16 years old in early 1978, when a friend of mine played \\"Eruption\\" and \\"You Really Got Me\\" from this album, and I was hooked.  I bought the record, and played it so much that I eventually bought another copy because I kind of fried the first copy.  This is a \\"must have\\" for anybody who wants the best of hard rock from that era, or any era.  Every song is great, the production stellar (the one-channel guitar sound is pretty cool), and I still love this album today.<br /><br />Van Halen, with David Lee Roth, was the best rock band of their time.  This album is their masterpiece.
B000002AVF|5.0|\\"Daydream\\" is by far the best of Mariah Carey's performance as a vocalist. This albumn is a heavy-packed collection of wonderful songs. I can't even think of one song that highlights the albumn because each one of them is just as beautiful as the next one. Each song flawlessly shows off Mariah Carey's enpowering and beautiful voice. It's truly a shame that Mariah is taking on a more hip-popish career path now. All the pop <br />songs that she sings now are just so bland in terms of vocal range, she really has no freedom to show off her voice. I hope that she can one day realize what she's doing and return back to produce more of her Gospel/R&B tracks. But nonetheless, this albumn is really great. If you want to see hear Mariah Carey is like at the peak of her career, don't miss out on this albumn. <br /> <br />
B0008ISM40|5.0|This is specifically in response to the problem of loading With Teeth on your ITunes if you have a Dualdisc. I had the same problem, but try running it in your computer's CD drive a couple of times, by the third time my IMac recognized the disc and I was able to import the CD into ITunes. It is definitely a pain, but it should eventually be able to import. Good luck! <br /> <br />Oh, and I think the album is fantastic.......
B0002XDODU|5.0|This cd is awesome strays from their normal cds but 5 star cd hands down
B0007XT87G|5.0|THIS MAY NOT BE ONE OF THE BEST CD'S BUT IT STILL ROCKS.DON'T BE AFRAID TO BY THIS CD BECAUSE OF WHAT NEGATIVE JUNK YOU READ.I ALMOST DIDN'T BUY THIS BECAUSE OF 1 (ONE)REVIEW.I'M GLAD I BOUGHT THIS CD ANYWAY.ITS PORCUPINE TREE!WILSON B.D.(WHITE MAN)PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW GOOD MUSIC IF IT FELL OUT OF THE SKY AND LANDED ON HIS FACE..JUST BUY THIS CD......................................
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Another great cd from Ryan.  He has got to be about the most consistently good cd artist in the world at this point.  This cd has a country feel to it.  It reminds me of Whiskeytown's Stranger's Almanac.  The packaging is great.  It feels like a miniature double album: the cd case is a fold-out cardboard sleeve (like old double albums) and the cds themselves have a graphic so they look like miniature albums, with grooves and all that.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|I'd give this one a 4.5. 5 stars for being great road music (or BBQin' music). It gets .5 off for the second CD.    <br /> <br />If you're going to get a \\"best of\\" ZZ Top, this is by far the best one... the first CD alone covers a lot of favorites and is a 5 star.   <br /> <br />The second CD continues with the classics, and then goes into the well-known MTV favorites, but kind of fills it up with unneccessary 12\\" remixes and one live cut towards the end instead of getting their more recent songs from the RCA era (even though not big sellers, they do showcase Gibbons' guitar playing that \\"Eliminator\\", \\"Afterburner\\" and \\"Recycler\\" drifted from) or deep cuts like \\"Precious and Grace\\", \\"Leila\\" or \\"I Got the Six\\".  <br /> <br />But what's frustrating is that they have yet to put a full-length CD or DVD out from their live shows. Seeing ZZ Top live then was an event (whether it was the buffalo on stage, the \\"Legs\\" girls, or the props but keeping the music intact), or seeing them now as a great power trio where they sound as good as ever. The only live album is \\"Fandango\\", which is a good CD, but should extend the live part to a full length concert or a DVD of performances from over the years.  <br /> <br />If you like this one and want to get into their catalog, get the first album, \\"Rio Grande Mud\\", and \\"Tres Hombres\\", all of which are bona fide classics. \\"Deguello\\" and \\"Eliminator\\" next. \\"El Loco\\" and \\"Tejas\\" after that. Then the RCA releases which are underrated. Then \\"Afterburner\\", \\"Recycler\\" and \\"Fandango\\" not because they're bad but because they're the \\"MTV era\\" songs that got a little too clinical for the people who love the \\"traditional\\" ZZ Top sound.   <br /> <br />\\"Fandango\\" has a lot of great songs on it like \\"Tush\\" and \\"Blue Jean Blues\\" and showcases them live, but getting this one last makes sense. \\"Chrome Smoke and BBQ\\" is a very good box set that covers more territory but for most people might be a little too steep-priced. This is more or less a \\"sampler\\"of the box set, yet has a healthy selection of their songs that has everything the casual fan needs and then some.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|Even worse than the first, 2f2f showing us that it is not Paul Walker that is making these movies watchable.<br /><br />Tyrese is no better, with more brawn than brains, who teams up with Walker to get back on the good side of the law and bring down a drug lord.<br /><br />So far we have our basic plot, and Rob Cohan does nothing to change the formula except in changing cars and girls. So much for Paul Walker's proclamations of love for Vin's sister.<br /><br />So our to intrepid heroe's are given really hot cars and are sent out on their mission with a pat on the back, and a warning in their ear on not to try anything funny. Tyrese, our hothead, is a macho man who tries to step over the boundries everytime, and often gets into really stupid situations because of his defience. Situations that really don't cause them physical harm which makes them even more macho and sure of them selves in the long run.<br /><br />The cars here aren't as cool, being bulky and loud, plus, the two cars given to Tyrese and Walker give the need to laugh heartily over the green and purple paint jobs on their cars, and wonder what candy shop the pair happened to swipe them at. The driving also leaves some to be desired, what happened to the cool stunts in the first one, where they defied death by swinging in and out under trucks, and racing past speeding trains?<br /><br />Not here, thats for sure, the only suicidiel stunt is in the end where Walker pilots the car off a ramp and onto the fleeing speed boat.<br /><br />How convenient.<br /><br />Overall, this movie did not impress me, but i'm certan that guys will find this to their liking as the girls are plenty, and the cars even more so.
0446608955|5.0|I RATE THIS BOOK AS A PERFECT 5 STAR RATING BECAUSE I LIKE BOOKS THAT ARE BASED ON ROMANTIC SETTINGS AND LIFE CHANGING EXPERIECES. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IS LANDON CARTER. HE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL BULLY WITH ALL THE GIRLS FLAUNTING OVER HIM. BUT HE HAS A CHANGE OF HEART WHEN THE PREIST'S DAUGHTER JAMIE SULLIVAN HELPS HIM IN THE SCHOL PLAY. HE FINDS HIMSELF FALLING FOR A GIRL WHO IS A LONER AND COMPLETE OPPOSITE FROM HIM.YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYIONG OPPOSITES ATTRACT. THIS BOOK IS A REAL TEAR JERKER AND I THINK EVERY GIRL WOULD ENJOY THIS BOOK AND SHOULD READ IT. TRUE LOVE AND PASSION DOES EXSIT. THIS BOOK IS FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY BY LUJAN.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Pearl Harbor is more about two mens romance over one woman than about the war and that one eventful day.<br /><br />Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett make an incredible billing, but their performances just don't hold up as they try stumbling their way through. Then comes your usuall love triangle that hollywood seems to thrilled to be throwing out at us.<br /><br />Besides, do we really believe it was almost soley two men who saved Pearl Harbor that day?<br /><br />Cuba Gooding Jr. was wonderful in his short but beautiful scenes, he's just a natural, stealing every part from under the others and bringing more to the film than Affleck or Hartnett<br /><br />Oh, and the music is good, but if a true World War Two flick is what you crave, go watch Enemy at the Gates or the great Escape, don't bother with this one.
0060001941|5.0|I juts finished reading this book for the first time, and I can tell it is going to be re-read and re-read again and again! The development of the characters and the nuances of the plot make for a brilliant novel, and because this book was originally written in memoir form, the story and characters are completely real and believable. The book unfolds slowly, but never at a boring pace. Everything that happens is fascinating, because it is just the way life really is. This is a MUST-READ for everyone! Possibly the best book I have ever read!
B0008ISM40|2.0|My impression of this album after listening and relistening to the songs over the past several weeks has been one of blank disappointment. Trent has been my favourite artist for a few years now and I had been awaiting this album religiously. The end result however, has been very depressing. <br /> <br />The album begins rather well with the honest, introspective monologue at the beginning of All the Love in the World. Upon hearing this I was drawn in and had high expectations. It doesn't take long before the album heads downhill, however. After the first couple of minutes, the song heads into a drawn out repitition of the chorus (and it's a very poor chorus). It could have been redeemed from this grey area, but instead Trent heads off into a lighthearted, high-pitched chant of the chorus that sounds like it would be better suited for a lame feel-good movie, rather than the latest NIN album. As traumatic as the ending of All the Love in the World is, I was able to shrug it off and move on to the next track. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, tracks 2-5 are all skippable, monotonous trash. We begin with You Know What You Are. The majority of the track is dominated by Trent's Donald Duck-like altered voice screaming \\"DON'T YOU F***ING KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?\\" No Trent, I don't, why don't you tell me? He doesn't provide us with an answer however. Other than a slightly interesting interlude, the song is musically irritating, and the rhetorical nature of the lyrics just leaves the listener scratching their head. Next is The Collector, which I believe may in fact be the most bland rock song I've heard in my entire life. The lyrics seem to be some kind of metaphor about carrying around feelings (perhaps bad ones), but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Either way, the song itself is so poor that I wouldn't even want to listen to it if the lyrics were incredible. Like pouring raw sewage on an open wound, it leads right into The Hand That Feeds. Just when you thought the music couldn't get anymore plain and and uninventive... I'll save myself the trouble of even describing this track, because if you've heard it then you should have an idea of what I'm talking about (crappy U2 leftovers anyone?). Love Is Not Enough comes next. What can I say about this track? The tempo is pretty dull; it just sort of drags on slowly without anything interesting. The lyrics sound worthy of Nickleback. Next! <br /> <br />Every Day is Exactly the Same starts out really well. After the preceding pile of crap, the beginning of this song sounds like a musical oasis. Unfortunately, it takes a turn for the worst after the chorus kicks in. One thing that I've noticed about this album is that some of the chrouses just don't fit very well. This song epitomizes this problem, as we go from a brooding industrial tempo to an Elton John piano chant. The chorus isn't *that* bad, but it just doesn't do the song justice and the result is that it doesn't have a very good flow. In spite of its lackluster nature, this song is perhaps my favourite on the album--and trust me, that says more about the rest of the album than about this song, because this song still isn't very good... <br /> <br />Next is With Teeth. Either it's about a drug addiction or him having a hard-on for some girl; I sure can't tell, and either way I can't relate very much. Musically, the song is another boring one. It drags on monotonously with him repeatedly shouting A-WITH-A-TEETH-A, and the interlude (like many, many other aspects of the album) is terribly underproduced and comes across a bit too quiet and muffled. <br /> <br />Then we have Only. Admittedly, I thought it was pretty cool the first time I heard it, but it's so dancey and the second verse (re: Down In It) is so lame and juvenile that it just began to annoy me after a number of listens. I can see why it was chosen as the second single. It's hardly a classic NIN track though. <br /> <br />Err Getting Smaller... you heard it here first, folks:he's got his arms in flip flop. Kill me now. This track is so obnoxious (and reminiscent of Foo Fighters or Queens of the Stone Age) that I can hardly stand it. I suppose this is a groundbreaking track, because although there's been some NIN songs where I can't necessarily relate to what he's saying, this may in fact be the first scenario in which I completely *disagree* with what he's saying. There's \\"some great thing that we could achieve\\"? What the hell is that supposed to mean? For the sake of the review I'll stop my antagonistic babbling and just reiterate that this is a terribly obnxious song with piss por lyrics. <br /> <br />There's only so much complaining that I can do at once, and at this point I've already tired myself out, so I'll have to try and keep the rest short.  <br /> <br />Sunspots: Better than the majority of the album (again, this is not saying much), but the chorus sounds like a really bad Fine Young Cannibals song. His \\"nothing can stop my now\\" reference seems a little lame, but whatever floats your boat... <br /> <br />The Line Begins to Blur: Sounds pretty good. It's certainly not a great song in terms of his former standards, but I have no complaints other than the theme of succumbing to jadedness being pretty uninspiring. <br /> <br />Beside You In Time: It's alright. Sort of a monotonous interlude style track, but the ending is kind of cool. <br /> <br />Right Where it Belongs: Some people love it. I think it's a cheesy ending with a lot of rhetorical, dreamy lyrics that go nowhere. (Not that I have anything against lyrics having a dreamy quality--I actually enjoy it sometimes--but in this case you get the feeling that he's trying to convey some kind of life lesson to the listener that even he doesn't know). To top this off, it's very, very underproduced and the song is essentially drowned in fuzz until the last chorus when his voice rises in a quick and unrealistic fashion. <br /> <br />So that's my take on the album. I've given it 2 stars, as I think it could have been worse, but more importantly, it could have--and should have--been much, much better. All this album has really done is taught me that I'm not always going to like Trent's music, which is a hard lesson learned, but I figured I was going to have to learn it sooner or later. <br />
B000929AJQ|4.0|Hey i just bought with teeth and the dual disc at the same time. I have every NIN cd so i do collect I think this cd is a great one but it still will never come close to Trents old work. Also I believe for the time spent on it, it could have been alot better (as in more songs possibly)
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I have to say that this movie is totally amazing!  I enjoy all kinds of music...though, I only love about 1/3 of Metallica's songs...I knew I had to see this film and my gut was right, this movie ROCKS in all sorts of ways!!  Take it from me...doesn't matter if you love, like or hate them...this outstanding documentary is raw, emotional, shocking and the closest thing to the \\"reality\\" genre I've seen in a long time and I'm old! You will want to watch it over and over again...bravo boys...you made me a loyal fan!
B0008ISM40|5.0|Hearing this in 5.1 is abosolutly amazing i bought both the original and dual and what a differnece so if you can get the dual disc. espicially for making love to that special gal woooo woooo! DB+HR
B00003CXCT|4.0|I love these movies. I saw them when the opened in the theater. And am happy that this set is a Widescreen release. These are a must see. I enjoyed the bonus features. Enhanced graphics and sound editing was done to clean up and extend the movies.     Now the reason I gave the movies a 4 star instead of 5. The box says Star Wars Trilogy. I thought I was buying them as they were released in the theater. Do not get me wrong, these are good movies. But it is not what I thought I was buying. These go beyond just the added scenes Mr. Lucas added in the earlier extended versions he released. He has actually created new scenes that never existed and added them. As well as re-wrote some dialogue. Yes I may sound like a purest, but I am not. I just think that the set should have been marked appropriately. Now that you know, you can make an informed decision on whether or not to purchase. But you must see these regardless.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Every NIN album has a different mood.  Pretty Hate Machine was Trent's big hello.  Downward spiral was a dark, sad, twisted dive into oblivion, and to this day remains a classic album.  The Fragile is a very mysterious epic opus, in which it needs to be listened to all the way through, definatly one of MY personal favs period.  With Teeth is a different animal altogether.  Gone is the sadness, gone is the darkness.  This album focuses on the ups and downs of love, and it shows through his tracks.  Lets face it, Trent is probably close to 40 years old by now.  How many years can he do the same old song and dance?  His music reflects what he's going through in his life.  First he was angry, then he was sad, then he was enigmatic...Now he's in Love.  I'm a huge NIN fan and always have been, and I believe this is a great way to introduce his music to younger fans, who will then go deeper into his library.  And for us lifelong fans, hey, it's more NIN, and thats always a good thing.  People here can say he's gone soft, or its new wave anger-rock...whatever.  Trent still knows how to make an awesome rock song, and put a little darkness in it.  This album is a breath of fresh air considering all the CRAP out there right now.  Rock has become glam again with turd like good charlotte and My chemical romance...NIN puts BALLS out there.  He's the Man until somebody proves to be better, and almost 20 years after Hate Machine...nobody's better.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Is a very good compilation of the songs featured in the movie. Sadly, I was looking for two things:  <br />1. The version of All you need is love they played in the film... completely different and much better than the studio version of the CD (really boring, nothing special). <br />2. The original motion picture soundtrack that you will be able to listen better in the DVD menus. Is extremely beautiful!!! But in the CD you will listen only the Glasgow theme. What about the rest? I have like 100 original movie scores and this is a worth having piece of art... Where is it? What can we do to buy it? Maybe not on a CD, but what about on i-tunes or something?
B000089RVX|4.0|This is one album you will listen to again and again, just for the beauty of the lyrics. It really evokes a sense of longing, hope and sometimes sadness.  Listen to it on a rainy day or early in the morning... it will really make you cry. <br /> <br />The first 6 songs are the best, in my opinion.  I just didn't give it 5 stars because I think they can come up with a still better album, and I expect that I will give it 5 stars. <br /> <br />Buy it. Today.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|I am not a music expert, or a critic, just a regular person who loves music but gets bummed when I shell out for an album and it ends up that I don't like most of it, and I'm disappointed.  I have all of Ryan Adams' previous albums, and I love and treasure them all, but there's always been one of two songs on all of them I haven't really liked, but that is not the case with Cold Roses.  I rate it 5-stars because I think every single song, from beginning to end is great.  The melodies, the harmony, the lyrics, everything.  A lot of them sounds really personal too, like Heartbreaker, and it seems like every song is perfect.  I saw an interview Ryan did on Much Music and he said \\"I know I'm not the greatest song writer in the world and I'm never going to be- but I really love doing it, and it doesn't hurt anybody\\".  After this, I could argue many he is one of the great ones!  I hope everyone who buys this album enjoys it as much as me. Thank you for reading this.
B00005B58Y|5.0|Don't get me wrong, Bill Evans and Jimmy Cobb are great musicians and I am a fan of both, but to me The Miles Davis Quintet, and later Sextet were most inspired when Red Garland on piano and Philly Joe Jones on drums were along with Miles on trumpet, John Coltrane on tenor, Cannonball Adderly on alto, and Paul Chambers on bass.  <br /> <br />Red Garland left during the recording of this album, and Philly Joe Jones was let go short there after, making this 1958 date, the last great Davis Sextet album.  <br /> <br />As usual Miles is running through a mix  of popular and jazz standards. The album opens up with one of the sickest tunes by altoist Jackie Mclean. Dr Jackle, not Jeckle is up-tempo, fast, furious and grooving. Miles's solos at high speeds were always great. Listening to his phrasing. It's wonderful. Especially when Miles and Philly Joe are trading solos, the tune is really hot. <br /> <br />The next piece, Sid's Ahead is a 12 minute medium tempo blues piece. Some nice improvisations all around. The tune that Philly Joe was showcased on, the year before, on Sonny Clark's Trio album, is here also. A John Lewis original, Two Bass Hit, is any drummer's ideal suite.  <br /> <br />The title track, Milestones has become a jazz classic. Note Philly Joe's cross-stick pattern, and as it changes during the bridge.  <br /> <br />Ah, the greatest trio cut in the history of jazz. Red Garland, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones do, Billy Boy. Garland used to love this piece. He did it on several of his trio albums. The three do it here well. One of my favorite trio cuts my ears have heard. <br /> <br />The album ends with Monk's classic Straight No Chaser. It swings, not one of my favorite verions, but its Miles. What else can you say. <br /> <br />Obviously the sextet recorded Kind Of Blue which is arguably the greatest jazz album of all time, but as far as a group effort, Milestones wins hands down. Unlike the Quintet albums, (the last four albums for Prestige) his Columbia cuts were more polished. This album is a classic. Any young generation kid or someone just getting into jazz should start within the lines of this disk. <br /> <br />Legendary..
B00000K0DT|5.0|This is a thriller with a twist. I've always liked movies that leave you in the dark until the last possible moment and this movie is a prime example.     Kevin Spacey stars in this deceptive film about five high-ranking conmen and their last major job before they are all killed in an attempt to blow up a boat with an inordinate amount of cocaine. The payoff: $91 million. To the dismay (or demise i should say) of the five \\"usual suspects\\" the objective doesn't seem to be there. But somehow the money is.     Anyone who likes this kind of convoluted suspense will definitely appreciate this flick. It really makes you realize how smart and shady the filmmakers are in the sense that they show you that the audiences' expectations can really be used against them. After watching this movie you will constantly be thinking the name Kaiser Soze and how you can't trust cripples anymore.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This is Manson's best album.  I'm a long time fan who's been following them since 1995 and to me this album sums up what Marilyn Manson is all about.  They were a band doing what they want to do and not caring about anything else.   On here it's all about the music and less about the image.  And it's actually still a band, rather than just all about Manson himself.  The musicianship of Daisy and Gidget really shines through.  The songs are unique and original and the entire band seems to have that hunger to really do something special.  And there are no attempts at writing some cheesy bland radio friendly song about being a teenage outcast (holywood).  I'm still a Manson fan today, but I am a bit alienated by Mansons constant attempts at catering to the mainstream on recent albums.  If you want a great rock album that truely stands on its own as an original piece of work, then get this album.  I bought this album 10 years ago and to this day it remains my all time favorite album.  Kill the chicken!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Really I recommend this album for any of Mimi's Fan...<br /><br />I love most of the songs on the albums...<br /><br />It's Like that: Really cool dancing song<br /><br />We belong together: one of best classical music in the album<br /><br />Cirlces: classical music(great one)<br /><br />Get your number: I love this dancing song really cool<br /><br />To the floor: cute dancing song<br /><br />Joy Ride: for me its number 2 in the classical music for this album<br /><br />Fly like a bird: the strong voice for Mimi
B00005QEO1|2.0|This is a noisy album, with Steven Tyler's annoying screams from beginning to end. There are no riffs, everything is covered by a wall of noise, distortion. The songs by themselves are no bog deal, and there is absolutely NOTHING here that can be compared with TOYS IN THE ATTIC and ROCKS.
B0007YMUZW|1.0|unorginial. Ryan Adams needs to find his own sound before he fades.
B00005UOXL|4.0|This debut by Idol is very strong. The arrangements are simple, the sound is a kind of dance / pop / rock. But the important thing is here: the band is good, and the songs flow effortlessly, with energy and sentiment at the right proportion.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Best album in many years.  I listen to Charmbracelet back to back  with the new album and what a difference.  Honestly there was barely a good song on Charmbracelet and Glitter. She really sounds like she has her grove back here, not just better songs but great vocal delivery (almost sounding like her earlier albums).  My only complaint is the switching from ballads to R&B.  I never cared so much for her modern R&B, it doesnt sound genuine.  Although I liked her earlier R&B songs (80's and early 90's albums).  Had she stuck with mostly ballads here, it would have been a potential Grammy award in my opinion.  But never the less, this is a great CD and YES it is a comeback!  Mariah was almost dead commercially (2 bad CDs) and now the new CD GOLD in 2 weeks, pretty impressive!  I hope she doesnt go road shy again, would love to hear it all live!!
B0002OERI0|4.0|Their best album since DOOKIE, there's no doubt about that. The album is very, very strong. It's a journey, a concept punk album (whou could have imagined that?!!). The album has a lot of different moments, most of them extremely pleasant and well crafted, be it the harder or the more melodic songs! COngratulations, Green Day! That stupid prize called Grammy at least went to some good artist this time!
6305181810|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.<br /><br />Read the book if you want the backstory since the screenplay starts at the half point. It's entertaining and that's why we see movies in the first place, right? Matt Damon is just so darn likeable, you get drawn into his narration right off the bat. The screenplay was very well done. It IS a Coppola film, after all...he does work with some talented people. It was very nice to see Theresa Wright in this film, as well.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|First of all, this review is based on the assumption that this US edition is from the very same master as the version that recently came out in the UK.   <br /> <br />'Burn' is my all-time favorite album - it went a very long way towards shaping my own drumming style and overall musical tastes.  Previous CD issues of this album were lack-luster at best, with distracting amounts of hiss and digital graininess.  As many times as I've listened closely to the album and old CDs, I am now able to hear things very clearly that I've never noticed before. <br /> <br />I always thought a good way to describe this music is 'blues from the future'.  There's something very special about this particular blend of Blackmore's funky playing with Jon Lord's swirling organ and David Coverdale's and Glenn Hughes' excellent vocals.  Ian Paice nearly steals the show, however, with his blazing drumming throughout.  The extensive liner notes on the UK import edition provided interesting insight into some of the reasons for the extra-aggressive drums on the title track.  I'm not sure whether this US edition includes the same liner notes.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended for anyone who loves hard rock played with authority, dexterity, and taste.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Song by song review. <br /> <br />1.- All the love in the world - A slow song that sets the mood but in a quite slow way. At first it seems like a forgettable song but it develops into a very solid rock tune mixing distorted guitars and piano while Trent, in his singular voice, ask \\"Why you get all the love in the world?\\" <br /> <br />2.- You know what you are? - A fast, action filled song that reminds us of Starf*ckers or the Pretty Hate Machine era. Definitively a NIN song that its going to become a classic, specially the loud chorus \\"Do you f*cking know what you are?\\" that are carried along a distortion and a very effective keyboard. AWESOME. <br /> <br />3.- The Collector - A very irregular song. But its not a bad song at all. The initial beat reminds me of the Downward Spiral era, the choruses are a weird combination between NIN and... Sonic Youth with Smashing Pumpkins. All those points sound great but they don't quite finish getting around together but don't disappoint either. <br /> <br />4.- The Hand that feeds - The best NIN industrial-pop song ever. Very danceable, very effective. \\"Will you bite the hands that feeds you? Will you stay down on your knees?\\" asks Reznor. <br /> <br />5.- Love is not enough - Another odd song. Trent surely did a lot of experimentations with his own sound. Unfortunately this song its forgettable. Not bad, but not good. This is the song to skip in the album. <br /> <br />6.- Everyday is exactly the same - AWESOME! One of the best songs in the album. A very moody song that starts with a great synth background. The choruses, while a little repetitive, get along with the song smoothly. The song finishes with a great range of musical layers. <br /> <br />7.- With teeth - The title song is also the oddest one. A great tune overall. It starts with a classical NIN beat that suddenly \\"crashes\\" into a piano interlude that explodes again suddenly into a heavy industrial closure. <br /> <br />8.- Only - At first I tho' this song was goingto suck. But it developed into a very experimental and original song. Executed in spoken word with an 80's-ish beat. The choruses \\"There is no you, there is only me\\" Are very danceable. This song made me want to be in a bar. Reminds me about Talking Heads. <br /> <br />9.- Getting Smaller. Straight to the point rock that reminds of Queen of the Stone Age but better. The guitar work in this song it's very catchy and effective. <br /> <br />10.- Sunspots - A great beat that reminds a lot the Downward Spiral days. Again a very nice synth work. <br /> <br />11.- The line begins to blur - A difficult song, but after few listens it has grown on me. Great tune. <br /> <br />12.- Besides you in time - Another weird song. It develops VERY SLOWLY, at first it seems like Trent singing over a loop, but then it explodes into a very nice guitar + synth solo, great song. It feels epic. The end it's AWESOME. <br /> <br />13.- Right where it belongs - Years ago Hurt was for me one of the best melancholic songs in music history. Then Trent released Still that had a little song called \\"And all that could have been\\" that replaced Hurt in my musical world. Now, in this album, Trent give us this little tune that don't tops \\"And all that could have been\\" but its still a lot better than Hurt. A very simplistic Piano tune with Trent singing. In the middle of the song Trent's voice becomes clearer and you can just feel the real power of this tune. Excellent closer. Also, its one of the best lyrics by Reznor to date. I felt chills in my spine the first time I heard the line \\"if you look at your reflection, is that all you want to be?\\" <br /> <br />Overall, and awesome, odd, experimental, different album. It feel lighter, but not commercial, it feels like NIN, but at the same time it doesn't. I still need to listen it a few times. But right now I'm giving this album a 9.5/10 and you know how picky I am about music. Too bad about \\"Love is not enough\\". One of the most boring NIN songs made surrounded by great tunes.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I became a NIN fan two years after The Fragile was released.  This means I had to patiently wait 4 years in order to hear a new NIN record.  The wait, I will admit was tough, but the end result made it worth it.  With Teeth is a very unique and original step for Trent to take.  The production is probably the most amazing thing about the CD.   <br /> <br />It is raw and stripped back.  He is able to create an industrial sound by using guitars, real drums, bass, etc. as the main focus instead of sythns, drum machines and computers.  I find this amazing.  There is a lot of subtle effects being created by these instruments to create this overall sound.  Granted it is still a NIN so there are a good deal of programmed stuff, but it is not as apparent as it is on the last few NIN CDs.  <br /> <br />Now for the overall musical direction of the CD.  Trent decided to focus more on the vocals and lyrics than anything else on the CD, and it shows.  The vocals are stronger than ever.  He even brings back some motifs throughout the album with his vocal lines.  The songs this time around are a lot simpler than other releases.  Most of them are verse/chorus based making it easier to absorb on the surface.  Even though the music is fairly simple the big picture is still complex and will not make sense after the first listen.  The music direction is really dirverse and varied throughout the CD.  It has some real moody pieces such as \\"All the Love in the World\\", \\"Beside you in Time\\" and \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" that sound like they could have come from The Fragile.  When I say it sounds like it could have been on The Fragile I don't mean that it sounds like anything off of the Fragile it just sounds like it fits in with that style.  The CD also contains songs like \\"You know What you are?\\" and \\"Getting Smaller\\" which could be argued to be some of the heaviest and most aggressive material that Trent has done in some time.  Lastly, the CD contains a lot of groovey straight ahead rockerslike \\"The Collector\\", \\"The Hand that Feeds\\", \\"Sunspots\\" and \\"Only\\".  This CD has everything for a fan of Trent and NIN.  If you have liked everything NIN has done to this point there is no doubt that you will dig it.   <br /> <br />Like most NIN CDs it takes time to get into and understand what Trent is trying to do.  If the CD doesn't grab you after the first listen don't worry because it will probably take some time to grow.  I would also recomend this CD for people who aren't too familiar with NIN because it is more live band oriented and it has a good balance of stuff they have accomplished to this point.  This CD was worth the wait and it sounds like a CD that will sound even better live.  To clear one thing up, if you are looking for a Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, Downward Spiral, or The Fragile 2 you will most likely be turned off.  Eventhough I make comparisons to other albums it doesn't mean it sounds like them.  With Teeth is a completely original approach to the ever evolving sound of NIN.

B000063DI9|5.0|What is there to say that has not already been said about Iron Maiden... These guys are just pure, epic, metal pioneers. The Evil That Men Do, Can I Play With Madness, The Clairvoyant and Infinite Dreams are those inspiring songs that make this a work of art as well as a milestone in metal history. I know that Maiden is an older band, however talent never dies, and I know we will still be enjoying Iron Maiden decades from now! It's not as though they've died, they'll actually be playing Ozzfest this year along with Black Sabbath, In Flames, Black Label Society, Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage and many more! So be ready for Maiden and the rest of the Ozzfest crew rock your world!

1400032717|4.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is one of the mystery fictions which is written by Mark Haddon. This book has some different and unique styles in comparison with any other novels. First, it has the form that Christopher himself, the speaker, is main character of the novel. And you will run into some chapters to beat around the bush such as mathematical formulas, astronomical problems and Sherlock Holmes's novels so forth. In someone these may very be annoying and embarrassing, but don't be nervous and you may skip those. Those are included to explain the unique Christopher's characteristics.  <br />This story is begined from the death of Mrs. Shears's dog, Wellington, near Christopher's house. Many things happen while Christopher is finding the suspect, but eventually that the author would like to tell is for us to need to reflect ourselves in respect of autism through Christopher who is afflicted himself with it. I think that even though the level of it is different per person, everyone has a little Asperger's syndrome. This book provides us the chances to think something different with existings. In fact I was nervous and irritating at first because of the unusual formation style, but I was absorbed in the story and interesting for this story more and more. Try to enjoy this book! You will have many pleasures to read and extraordinary experiences to think.  <br />
B0007OCG4W|4.0|This is not a movie about love. It's a movie mostly about messed up people. This movie is based on a theater play and you can see that clearly because it's so focused on the dialogues and the characters (instead of cars exploding all the time). The actors go very well (except maybe Julia Roberts and her silicon lips). I love how the movie explores in a very honest way what the different characters want from their relationships and essentially it's not love. It is also very interesthing to see that different characters (and in real life real people) understand better than others who they are and what they want.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This is a different Nine Inch Nails indeed at first you may be disapointed I know i was but it grew on me i started to realize the sheer beauty of the songs A great Cd and it proves that Reznor can still pack a punch
B0008ISM40|5.0|\\"Sonically driven perfection\\" is what comes to mind first. More fluid and accessible than other releases. Don't get me wrong, all the earlier material was right for that moment in time and aesthetically pleasing to that era, and this also projects that same ambience. This \\"release\\" couldn't come any earlier or later. It fits \\"our\\" space like stitches on a healing wound. With many weak releases filling the airwaves over the past 5 years, Trent finally returns to save us all. I don't want to mention any favorite tracks, since WITH_TEETH is a whole, just as the other releases had thier own body. Listen....listen... our ears and minds needed this redemption. Thanks Trent.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Rarely does a film portray real life without maudlin sadness or giddy saccharine dialogue. \\"Finding Neverland\\" is just what the titles suggests - a `neverland'. J.M. Barrie (a splendidly underplayed Johnny Depp) is a man that escapes his unsatisfying married life by fantasy (he is a playwright). Helping him create his best play happens when he befriends four boys who's Mother is the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (an adorable Kate Winslet). To complicate matters, Sylvia's Mother (Julie Christy at her coldest role yet), intervenes suggesting that a grown man should not be interested in young boys and Sylvia should not be interested in a married man. The friendships develop with a turn of face by every character by the stories end. Freddie Highmore plays a young boy who steals every scene he is in. This is a light-hearted story threatening to be undermined by the stuffy British society who is viewed as the `evil adult world'. Slight scenes of fantasy are cleverly interspersed throughout the film and the epiphany that each character captures is brilliantly scripted. Peter Pan never looked so good.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I had a preconceived notion this was going to be a 4 star album.  \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" was really growing on me through consistant radio play, but it was still no \\"Closer\\" and Trent Reznor promised WITH TEETH would be a more accessable(commercial) album.  I had confidence it wouldn't be a terrible album, just not one I would repeat over and over until it wouldn't play anymore like previous NIN efforts. Times, music and myself have all changed since the 90's. \\"All The Love In The World\\" opens the album with a down tempo track that's not one of the best NIN slow songs I've heard.  But then \\"You Know What You Are?\\" comes in with Dave Grohl hammering the drums and it only gets better as the album progresses.  I always liked NIN using drum machines in large part as an alternative to live drums to fit their sound, but the live drums (especially with Dave) are a perfect progression for them and essential for making this a great album.  The CD is full of distorted disco/funk grooves trading out with melancholy piano riffs that are classic NIN.  After listening and listening again I think WITH TEETH is exactly what it should be, not rehash DOWNWARD SPIRAL or THE FRAGILE but still very distinct NIN worth playing over and over again.    P.S. Serious lovers of rock/metal and even other genres of music owe it to themselves to check out Fair To Midland.  Go to their website at [...]
B0008ISM40|5.0|Trent Reznor has outdone himself again. Those who've complained about the album not being up to par need to remind themselves who Trent Reznor is. Reznor's gone through a lot of growing up in the past years, and his new album reflects this. <br /> <br />I recommend getting the DualDisc... but only if you have a good surround sound stereo system and a good DVD player. Trust me, you'll want both of those if you get the DualDisc... the Surround Playlist is beyond exceptional, and with a good surround sound system, you'll get the full effect of the music. <br /> <br />For fans, With Teeth is a must have.
B00001ZWTT|5.0|Why does everyone hate this movie so much? Not that my two cents matters any, but I think this is an action/comedy/Western that surpasses films like Star Wars and Count Of Monte Cristo in swashbuckling entertainment value. Will Smith plays Jim West, a gunslinging, black-cowboy-hat-wearing action hero. Kevin Kline plays Artemus Gordon, the inventor and government agent who teams up with Smith's character to stop a madman bent on destroying the United States! Packed with explosive action, comedy, and great special effects, Wild Wild West is a fun, entertaining popcorn movie that you will love!
B0007O38F8|4.0|Even thought In hate the guy personally I believe he has made a nice album. It has nice beats and he has gotten better on the Mic even thought he is still only average. There is nothing wrong with Get Rich or Die Tryin 2 just look at Mobb Deep and Hell on Earth which was The Infamous 2 but it was still dope none the less. I am probally the person with the Most Beef against the guy plus his battles are childish with the likes of his group mate The Game(Best Rap album of 05) to his never ending quarels with Ja Rule and other beefs with Jadakiss and Fat Joe. If Big L were alive he would probally kill 50 Cent because Joe was in his crew plus 50 wants to be Big L.I don't get his beef with Nas. Nas will shut out 50 Cent. I want to see if he goes after KRS-One next. Maybe we can have some comic relief after KRS-One lights him on Fire lyrically. His beefs and him are stupid but the album is not. 4 Mics
1592400876|4.0|I love this book. It is direct and full of fun examples. The author admits that she is a stickler and a bit on the obsessive-compulsive side when it comes to grammar. Humorous antecdotes fill the book. I think that one must really love language to find this book funny and helpful. However, it is a must for English majors. The book serves as a \\"Chilton's\\" manual of sorts for those of us obsessed with the correct use of punctuation. It is a great reference guide to add to my collection. I compare the direct nature of the book with E.B.White's \\"Elements of Style.\\" I think that the book is an engaging tool to re-examine grammar rules and provide humor with it.
B000021YQV|5.0|I find that System of a Down, through all three of their albums released to date, are an amazing band. This one stands out interestingly amongst the other two, as well, as it actually sounds different. Granted, their self-titled debut and Steal This Album are amazing, and both deserve 5 star ratings on their own. However, Toxicity oddly has its own sounds to it that, although System, sound as if it were something dreamed up by a completely different group of artists from the Middle East, and then given a hard-rock edge. <br /> <br />And please, this message is to all reviewers: I'm somewhat sick and tired of people trying to compare S.O.A.D. to bands like Led Zeppelin. Each are spectacular, but in completely seperate ways. Serj's screams and chants aren't nonsensical, and they are trash. They're politically charged and rightfully angry. So if you are going to trash an album, that's fine, but try to make a real argument. \\"They suck, they scream too much, and go listen to some band from the '60s\\" is not a particularly valid argument.
B000929AJQ|1.0|I know lots of people dont want to hear me say this cause they cant  accept the truth.  But this album is so boring, I figured after wasting money to get the Fragile i would have learned my lesson.  But Trent has squeezed me for another $15, and what a major disappointment.  I have one question, do musicians actually go outside their circle of friends to ask normal people how their music sounds? People are calling this album a through back to the old NIN sound. What old sound, this album should of just been called The Fragile 2.  Stop whinning and make some music worth breaking something to. Broken and Pretty Hate Machine are trent's 2 best pieces of work to date.  But with teeth doesn't even compare.  Ive heard elevator music with more emotion.  Oh well 7 more years before the next album...
B00005JKZ3|4.0|When this long-awaited sequel to 1997's Men In Black was released in July 2002, it was not very well recieved by critics or audiences. But it managed to make 190 million US dollars at the box office. While that was not up to par with the 250 million of Men In Black I, it was still a good profit. Frankly, I think this is just as good as the first. The FX are better, along with one or two more action sequences then the first. I like this movie, but it seems everyone else hates it. But if you haven't seen this movie yet, don't pay attention to all those one and two-star reviews. This is one heckuva movie!
B0007YMUZW|5.0|First, to get something off my chest just because it's tarnishing my enjoyment of this CD:<br /><br />Most Ryan Adams reviews can be divided into two camps: those who deride him as an egomaniacal poseur and those who herald him as a genius.  We toss about \\"our generation's Dylan\\" for any twenty-something singer/songwriter (e.g. Conor Oberst), until they gain too much success; then we label them a sell out and complain that they mimic all the great bands we once compared them to. It's become as trendy to hate Ryan Adams as it is to like him. So, enough with ragging on him because he acts like a rock star and please, for the love of god, stop comparing him to Dylan.  He's fantastic, but there will never be another Dylan and you only set yourself up for derision when you make that comparison.<br /><br />Critiques of his music often center on one of three points: 1) he's \\"copying\\" off of other (presumably better) musicians; 2) there are many other more \\"innovative\\" artists out there (followed by a list of said artists); and 3) his lyrics are trite/full of cliches.<br /><br />My response to those critics is:<br /><br />1) since when did emulating the sound of other artists (particularly those that we like) become some sort of sin?  I appreciate the fact that Ryan Adams' albums have a touch of the \\"Byrds and Tom Petty\\" (to quote another review for this album).  According to these critics, music is supposed to be life-changing and, when it happens to influence another musician, they are supposed to forget the influence music has had on them.  I don't get it.<br /><br />2) \\"Innovation\\" is highly overrated (e.g. the Fiery Furnaces).  I didn't anticipate the release of Cold Roses wondering what magic Adams was going to create using only a Fisher Price xylophone and a hubcap.  And seriously, how much innovation can we really have?  We're reaching a critical moment wherein everything's been said and every note has been matched up with every other note and the only way to be \\"innovative\\" will be to be nonsensical and out of tune (e.g. the Fiery Furnaces). (That being said, I do like Rilo Kiley and the Decemberists, although I would argue that there's a distinction to be made between \\"original\\" and \\"innovative\\", or at least in the way they are bandied about by music critics.)<br /><br />3) I don't look to lyrics for some sort of life-affirmation or lesson.  It's nice if it happens, but it's not something I demand of a CD. Occasionally, something happens in my life and I happen to listen to a particular song and the song clicks with me.  Sometimes it just makes good driving music.  If every song was filled with huge, heavy lyrics, all I would do is sit in my car and cry.  As appealing as that sounds, I have things to do and places to go.  And I will be listening to Cold Roses as I go about my merry way.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant, but now on to the review:<br /><br />After Rock N Roll (which I hated), I was concerned that he'd fallen over his own ego.  Whether or not he's the monster people make him out to be, the new album is great.  The Cardinals are a fantastic band, as spectacular on the album as they are live.  I would agree with the reviewer who said the album's a mix of Pneumonia and Heartbreaker.  If you liked either of those albums, you'll probably like this one.  I haven't listened to it enough to say it's my favorite, but it is full of great tunes.  If I was forced to put three songs on repeat for the rest of the day, I'd pick \\"When Will You Come Back Home\\", \\"Easy Plateau\\" and \\"Dance All Night.\\"  I've omitted \\"Let It Ride\\" only because I've already listened to it 1,000 times in the last few weeks.<br /><br />Listen to it.  If you like it, buy it.  If not, buy something else.  There's hardly any excuse these days to accidentally buy something that you think sucks.y to be \\"innovative\\" will be to be nonsensical and out of tune (e.g. the Fiery Furnaces).

B000929AJQ|5.0|Though this album is no Fragile, which is my favourite NIN album, it's a brilliant follow up. The best tracks are Beside You in Time, Right Where it Belongs, With Teeth, All the Love in the World and Every Day is Exactly the Same. Worst track the Collector.
B000002J09|5.0|I have read quite a bit about the supposed Satanic messages in Stairway to Heaven when played backwards, and would like to inform you all.  It was entirely coincidence.  Someone who researched this topic sang and recorded that part of the song himself, and found that he too created the same message.    Oh, and yes, Led Zeppelin is the best.  I don't think I need to expound upon this statement, due to there being 578 other people here who have already done that for me.    edit:  Are there actually people out there who listen to songs backwards?
1400032717|4.0|The curious incident of the dog in the night-time <br />      <br />     The curious incident of the night-time is one of the <br />mystery books which was written by Mark Haddon.  This book <br />starts the story about a dog that was killed by someone.  <br />We can enjoy the mystery and also think about human mind <br />and behavior those are related with autism and asperger <br />syndrome.  The main character of this book is Christopher <br />who has an unusual thinking and abilities.  The boy found <br />the dead dog and starts detecting.  The writing style of <br />this book is a story style.  Sometimes, Christopher talks <br />about math and science, so the story goes somewhere else <br />from the main mystery story.  If you are interested in <br />math and science, it is very interesting for you.  <br />However, I am not interesting in math and science, so I <br />did not like those parts, and those were difficult for me. <br /> Therefore, when those parts were difficult for me, I just <br />skipped those parts because we do not have to worry about <br />them.  Even though I skipped those parts, I could <br />understand the main story.  While I was reading this book, <br />I could find many mysteries, so the story became more <br />interesting.  I can learn the mind and behavior of the <br />person who is autism.  I also can enjoy the mystery, so I <br />recommend this book.  Especially, I want to recommend to <br />the person who likes reading mystery and the person who is <br />interesting in autism or wants to study autism.
B00004U8JV|2.0|While the first Jurassic Park will always be among my favorite movies, this one is just plain bad. One, too much of the movie is just talking and talking. It takes forever for the dinosaurs to get in it, and even then theyr'e not as terrifying and cool-looking as the other movie. Just skip this one. It's bad. However, Jurassic Park III is a very good movie and I reccomend it.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I just got the album and have listened to it about 3 times now.  The songs are so great.  I keep hearing ppl complain that it isnt like TDS. Well you think that it would be obvious.  You can't keep feeding the same stuff.  Reznor has obviously matured and same with his sound and music.  IF i was to compare it to anything, I would probably compare it to the fragile or broken.  It has a great sound and has established itself as another great NIN album.  The band has taken a step in a good direction
B00006CJOY|3.0|some songs are really good but most is just boring babble that I could have skipped but you will probally be drunk when you listen to it so whatever but for me the few kick ass songs got me all syked to listen to a totally good album but it can really really REALLY suck somtimes so I gave it a star for each good song I heard and (the last star was probally just a couple songs ran together that in total made an additinal good song so its even)
B0008ISM40|4.0|The music is still sinking into me. Reznor's music has always needed many multiple listenings to truly comprehend it (at least to me). But I like it. I must admit that I am a fan of The Fragile and this is a move away from that, but it is as good as anything he has released.     No NIN cd has exactly the same sound (not counting the many singles and remixes)  It is changes of direction that make an artist interesting, and many \\"musicians\\" won't break away from the sound that made them famous and eventually their releases just sound overworked, kind of like a painting that just gets repainted over and over.    I think his song reviews have been adequately covered by others, and I think if you are even a casual NIN fan, you will enjoy his latest work.    My only complaints are the PACKAGING seemed kind of SKIMPY. There's no booklet with lyrics or anything, just a website for complete information. NIN's packaging is usually a work of art in itself and I was looking forward to flipping through a booklet and reading the lyrics off the page (i'm kind of old fashioned like that).    The DVD part seemed a waste too although I wasn't paying too much extra for the dual-disc anyway. You get the tracks playable on surround-sound and stereo, the \\"Hand That Feeds\\" video (which you could already see on the internet), and a discography of HALO's 1-Current, with selected samples of songs from almost all of the releases. I felt like I paid the extra money for him to advertise his earlier stuff.    It's Ironic that the completist fans are going to be the ones to shell out the money for the bonus stuff, just to find out that it's ADVERTISING FOR STUFF THAT THEY ALREADY OWN.    But while they are lengthy gripes, they are minor. The music is the real reason the cd was bought, and it is good     (BTW, i've gone to nin.com and reznor explains about the lack of a booklet: changing times-already sacrificed space with small cd case format, and fairness for people who buy their music digitally) i also downloaded the text and although i still don't agree with the skimping on the packaging, reading the lyrics the way he set it up is a unique experience, and i am glad he is bold enough to go for something different)

B000001EYW|4.0|The Bee Gees albums are typicall known for containing 2 elements: lush ballads and funky, uptempo numbers.  While the lush ballads have always been a personal favorite, the Brothers Gibb have also recorded some great dance/pop songs like: \\"Jive Talkin'\\", \\"Nights on Broadway\\", \\"You Should be Dancing\\", \\"Stayin' Alive\\", \\"Night Fever\\", \\"Tragedy\\", \\"Love You Inside Out\\", \\"He's a Liar\\", \\"The Woman in You\\", \\"You Win Again\\", \\"One\\", and \\"Paying the Price of Love\\". <br /> <br />This CD however lacks any of the percussive beats that have driven some of the Bee Gees best tunes.  The closest the brothers get to anything resembling a beat are the hit single \\"Alone\\", the follow-up \\"Still Waters Run Deep\\", and album cuts \\"With my Eyes Closed\\" and \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\". All of the songs are sung in the whispered, hushed voices that they used on classic songs like \\"How Deep is Your Love\\" and \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\\".   <br /> <br />Besides the 2 singles, some of the other good cuts include \\"Miracles Happen\\", \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\", \\"I Surrender\\", \\"My Lovers Prayer\\", and \\"Closer Than Close\\".  My only problem with this CD is that there is nothing here to get you up on your feet and dance.  Sure, \\"Alone\\" is a great song to sing along to in the car, but there is nothing really fun and energetic about these tracks. <br /> <br />If you like the melodic, lush ballad side of the Bee Gees, then you will enjoy this CD.  If you like the funky, dance side of the Bee Gees, there is not much here for you.  However, I still recommend this CD for some great Bee Gees melodies.
B000929AJQ|2.0|Six years on since the release of \\"The Fragile\\", its followup, \\"With Teeth\\", finally arrived.  After the experimental \\"The Fragile\\", Reznor took a few less chances this time around and produced an album that is song-oriented.  The drawback to this is that the record is a lot less risk taking, and while some of the material is great, most of it lacks an edge to me.  Now mind you, I approach this from a different context than most folks, my interest musically tends to be in change-- if an artist stands still and produces something very similar to a previous record, I rarely am interested in it (something about revisiting old ideas to me results in a lack of urgency and edge to the music).  Truth to be told, if you though \\"The Fragile\\" was weak because it lacked many of the hooks of the earlier albums, you'll probably love this one. <br /> <br />Over the past sixteen years, Reznor has really created a vocabulary built of pop sensibilities meets industrial, and we see a bunch of songs that could have easily been lifted from earlier records-- the sort of merciless industrial of \\"Broken\\" (\\"You Know What You Are?\\", \\"Getting Smaller\\"), the thrashy synth pop sounds of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" (\\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\", \\"Love is Not Enough\\"), the sludgy industrial rhythms and dark pop of \\"The Downward Spiral\\" (\\"The Line Begins to Blur\\", \\"Right Where It Belongs\\").  Truth is, this album sounds more like a successor to those than it does to \\"The Fragile\\".  There's also a couple downright irritating moments (the chorus to \\"With Teeth\\" and the endless panning to the otherwise decent \\"Beside You in Time\\"). <br /> <br />But intermingled throughout this is hints at a new sound, a sort of funk sensibility that begins to creep into Reznor's music-- opener \\"All the Love In the World\\" illustrates this well, with its voice over bass and drum, but its really the incredible \\"Sunspots\\" that is totally unique and best illustrates this-- it has no precedent in Reznor's music and works well, musically and lyrically. <br /> <br />Overall, I found the album pretty much a disappointment because of its lack of freshness is direction.  I've heard it before.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Great package design inside and out. The two bonus tracks are \\"studio run throughs\\" and both are well worth the listening as they reveal a more barebones version of the final cuts...a bit like peaking into the creative process. Great price too.
B00005JNQ8|4.0|What is it about 2005s The Interpreter, directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn that has sent audiences around the globe into a not so eloquent verbal and critical frenzy?  Its semi predictable ending perhaps?  Honestly, I don't think Sydney Pollack was out to shock the masses with a twisted and unexpected ending, or even to make a film rife with explosions and action sequences.  It's deeper than that, and thank god.  If there's one director to make a political thriller, it's Pollack, just take a look at 2003s The Quiet American, in all its haunting and heartbreaking glory.   Maybe if the hundreds of eyes in the theatre actually looked into the film rather than skimmed its surface, they might be able to comprehend its incredibly accurate and important message, particularly in our lives today.  If this were the case, then maybe the ending would still be up in the air, leaving you breathless, maybe a little shocked to have seen the incredible lengths that people will go to in order to defend their culture, their lifestyles, their lives.  How appropriate this theme is in a time of unsettled American and international conflict. (Spoiler alert). Sure, maybe you figured out that Nicole Kidman took the job as a U.N interpreter in search of the opportunity to get close to the man who gave her and her country everything and then stripped it away, an opportunity to carry out her vengeance, (and if that's the case, bravo to you), but beneath that is her incredibly powerful performance, supported by a witty, wry and exceptionally well written screenplay by Martin Stellman and Brian Ward.  Admittedly, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman are an unexpected duo, but the energy they both exude (particularly Kidman) lights up the screen in performances equally worthy of praise.  It's an electrifying film, one that will pierce deep into your core if you let it, and leave you thinking about so much more than whether or not Nicole Kidman's accent was accurate. (By the way, the African languages were fictional, made up for the film, so that excuse bears no merit here on whether or not this film is worth seeing.) Cheers, folks.
B00080Z53O|5.0|I was fortunate enough to acquire an overseas DVD version of the film. Thought provoking and emotionally riveting. Javier Bardem does a great job of portraying a man not only gravitating towards the right to die but also struggling with the logic of making such a decision. I won't give it away but the climatic scene where he questions his own proclivity (in an emotionally verbal outrage) as to WHY he wants to die, made my jaw drop, forcing to direct the question at myself. Don't miss this film!! <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|Okay, well i am a musician, and i am going to Berklee College of Music next year as a vocal major. My boyfriend also is for guitar. we purchased this cd last year, and have been blown away by the talent, and we feel as if Mars Volta is going to be around forever as a living legend. Last night i saw them in concert, and i am still like trying to snap back into reality. i have never been so moved by anything in the entire world. i just feel like they are really gonna be come this huge phenomenon, and i'm just real lucky that i got to see them. seriously, if you haven't purchased this cd, you are missing out on not only some good tunes, but an experience from beginning to end. ITS SO RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING!!! they are like the new Led Zeppelin. My whole world has changed because of this band, and i mean- i listen to bands like The Roots, and i am still obsessing over The Mars Volta. Seriously, there were people from 12 to 70 years old at the concert last night just rockin out and having an amazing time. After the show, the whole crowd was left speechless and sweaty. it was like a work out for your mind. it litterally blew me away. GET THIS CD IF ITS THE LAST THING YOU DO!
B000002U6E|2.0|When Michel Cretu launched his enigmatic Enigma project in 1990 the group were literally in a class by themselves. Numerous soundalike acts cropped up during the 3 year wait bewteen debut and follow-up albums with only one single from the motion picture \\"Sliver\\" to hold fans over. The wait really raised expectations for something truly phenomenal which may be part of the reason why I count this album as the weakest of Enigma's first 4 studio albums.<br /><br />The album opens strongly with \\"Second Chapter\\" as the familiar horn opening welcomes us back to the world of Enigma and the music suddenly changes and becomes darker before flowing into the \\"The eyes of truth.\\"  \\"The eyes of truth\\" is to me the stand out track on this album but it is also the one that sounds most like the work done on MCMXC ad. With its heavy orchestral sample from Anne Dudley's \\"Songs from the Victorious city\\" and mix of Eastern/ Indian sound it is truly a  amazing if not ominous sounding tracks.<br /><br />The album then segues into the worlwide hit \\"return to innoncence\\" which features lots of Enigma's signature sounds combined with Taiwanese chanting. The video clip to this song helped propel it to the tops of many music charts with its images of everything going backwards.<br /><br />The album from this point starts to get a bit choppy. \\"i love you..I'll kill you\\" while a fan favorite reminds me of many Enigma clone acts who made music that could have fit into any low budget B-movie's soft porn scene. It does have some interesting beats but the Lyrics just seem at times ridiculous.<br /><br />\\"Silent Warrior\\" begins and with the sound of farwaway crickets and soft music getting louder. Musically the track wonderful with heavy percussion and some nice keyboard work and tribal samples.

Cretu again takes lead vocals but they work here as the song has a \\"rockier\\" sound than \\"silent warrior.\\" The video clip is one of Enigma's best featuring a knight who goes to an abandoned underwater castle and the painting's come to life. I am still baffled as to why this clip was left off their greatest hits DVD.<br /><br />Finally the album closes with \\"cross of changes\\" which features a few spoken lines by Sandra before closing out in the true Enigma fashion with the horn closing.<br /><br />\\"Cross of Changes\\" overall isnt a very cohesive album compared to MCMXC ad.

B00000K3D4|5.0|Nearly twenty years complete with a computer-effects \\"revolution\\" in film have passed since Jim Henson's Labyrinth hit theatres, but no visual advancements could ever capture the charisma of this pop rock fairy tale. Henson's Creature Shop not only designed a spectacular fantasy world born from the depths of every child's imagination, they put it together completely with practical effects and the magic of puppetry.  If you're looking for the pleasantly simple shapes and colors of The Muppets, you won't find them here; Labyrinth's puppets blend seamlessly into the background in order to make this universe spring to life. <br /> <br />The story begins in a charming East Coast-esque neighborhood park where a teenage girl dressed in a ball room gown performs a soliloquy to no audience other than her dog.  The town clock chimes and it begins to pour; Sarah (Academy Award-winner Jennifer Connelly as a teen) pulls out of her reverie, a princess no more, and realizes that she has stayed out too long. At home, she confronts her \\"wicked\\" stepmother who has been waiting for Sarah to return in order to watch her new baby brother, Toby, while her father and stepmother spend the night out. Although it's never stated, it's clear from the way in which Sarah admires the portrait of her mother on her bedroom mirror that her mother, an actress in a play called The Labyrinth, has passed away and that is the reason that Sarah loves the play with such devotion. The way in which she derides her half-brother, angry that he has played with one of her own childhood stuffed animals and annoyed with his fits of crying, demonstrates very quickly the tension between the newly formed family and Sarah's resistance to the life that she has had to face since her mother's death. When Sarah repeats the lines of her favorite play, calling forth a \\"Goblin King\\" to kidnap Toby and free her of his annoyances, she doesn't imagine that her own improvised echo of \\"I wish that the goblins would come and takeyou away... right now,\\" would in fact be magic words that bring forth a Goblin King, Jareth (British rock star David Bowie). Jareth takes Toby and offers Sarah a life of fantasy, liberated from harsh reality. But Sarah, feeling guilty, asks for Toby back instead; however, Jareth refuses, and in order to free Toby from Jareth's control, Sarah must make her way through the trials of a mystical labyrinth within thirteen hours. <br /> <br />Sarah's choice to face the labyrinth and the lessons she learns thanks to the friends she meets along the way help the introverted teen to mature and realize that even when surrounded by a life of the fantastic, she can never escape completely from reality.  This basic journey mirrors the mythic quest archetype of many legends and stories, but the change in the expected protagonist to that of a young girl and the mix of contemporary and fantasy settings offers something to the genre that hasn't quite been seen before or since. Bowie composed most of the songs in the film, which range from the fun and effervescent \\"Dance Magic Dance\\" to his character's poignant take on unrequited love in \\"As the World Falls Down\\" and \\"Within You.\\" The title track (\\"Underground\\") especially will stay with you, even long after you've last watched the film.
B00006CXSS|4.0|For me this was a story about leadership. The story was excellent, the acting was excellent. I have only one complaint, they used the \\"F\\" word about a hundred times and that ruined the movie for me. Even Dick Winters himself complained about that in his book. Other than that the movie was excellent.
B00003CWPL|5.0|One thing that everyone who has seen Eraserhead will agree upon is that it certainly isn't for everyone. However, those who are bold enough to watch this confusing, slow, and uncomfortable film will be treated to one of the most memorable (and disturbing) movies ever made. Go into this one with an open mind, and don't spend too much time trying to figure out its ultimate meaning. Watch it alone in the dark for the ultimate experience.<br /><br />The remastered DVD offered at David Lynch's website is wonderful, if a bit on the expensive side. My advice is to save up for the box set that also includes David Lynch's short films. That way you'll have a good weekend worth of bizarre film entertainment that you'll never forget!
B000929AJQ|5.0|If you are looking for a new direction or something incredible and new then you will be dissapointed.  If however you are looking for the same old NIN you know and love then you will be very pleased.  One of my favorite is track 13.  This album isn't as heavy or hard hitting as some of the previous ones.  It's alot more easy listening.  I think thats a great thing.  The other thing I like is that alot of the songs are not opened or drawn out with some annoying riffs or noises like \\"fragile.\\"  This album is more like \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" where every song just kicks right in.
1586211676|3.0|For all those who are still brainwashed and hopelessly continue to buy into the American Dream that has basically raped this planet of future sustainability - this is essential listening.  <br /> <br />It thoroughly covers how the system has managed to oppress the working man and force him alone to mainly carry the burden of taxes, while business owners and investors have cleverly invented policies to protect the rich man from such tomfoolery as paying taxes. Therefore, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer - it's freaking ingenious - kudos to the puppet masters. <br /> <br />For those of us who recognize the illusion of money for what it really is - a stored energy credit, that has inevitably replaced energy, and has left a hand-me-down world to a generation of ignorant youth to clean up a century of plundering - this is the quickest way to know your enemy.   <br />
1552095258|5.0|Great Book for making Canoe paddles also on making anything out of wood. I found the easy to read and how much depth it had. You could take a brief look at this book and come <br />out with  enough information to make a good paddle.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I understand why some people don't like \\"Pet Sounds.\\"  It's kind of the \\"Citizen Kane\\" of albums.  People hear the rep -- that this is one of the greatest records ever -- and they put it on expecting the direct propulsive creativity of, say, something like \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or \\"Good Vibrations.\\"  And what they get is something milder, something innocent, something strangely muted.  Then when it's over they think, \\"THAT'S one of the greatest albums ever???\\"     To an extent, I was one of those people.  I got \\"Pet Sounds\\" when it first hit CD, when I was just about 20, and I'd heard all the hype and I definitely liked it... but at the time I also felt I wanted something more, something that grabbed me by the collar and shook me.      But this is not an album that will shake you, at least not violently. An old girlfriend of mine once came into my house while I was listening to this and actually got angry at it: \\"This is lullaby music, this is like Sesame Street. Why are you listening to this?\\"     I couldn't explain it to her anymore than I could explain it to myself but this is an album that almost has to grow on you.  The more you listen, the more you learn, the more you live, the better it gets.      There is a clutch of albums that I have a tendency to drag out on dark nights of the soul -- Nick Drake's \\"Five Leaves Left,\\" \\"Beatles for Sale,\\" John Coltrane's \\"Soultrane,\\" \\"Thelonious Monk Plays Duke Ellington,\\" \\"Astral Weeks,\\" \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Imperial Bedroom,\\" \\"The Band\\" and a few others.  But this is the one I put on when I just want to sit alone and stare out the window or drive around dark, snowy neighborhoods at night.    Anyway, I would never tell anyone, \\"Like this album or you are WRONG!\\"  But for people who think it's a sham, I'd recommend they listen to some key moments and reflect on what they're hearing:    ** The bells and harmonies of \\"You Still Believe In Me,\\" and particularly the line, \\"I wanna cry,\\" in which the word cry is given something like 15 lilting syllables.      ** The cellos of \\"Don't Talk\\" and \\"I'm Waiting for the Day,\\" particularly the strings that kick in at the 2:21 mark (followed by rumbling kettle drums that would make Phil Spector tremble).    ** All of \\"God Only Knows.\\"    ** The flickering texture of the bass guitar in \\"Here Today.\\"    ** The closing refrain of \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times.\\"    ** The weird, kitschy sound of the title track.    ** Brian's truly beautiful lead vocal on \\"Caroline, No,\\" followed by train sounds and vocals by his dogs, Banana and Louie -- maybe the greatest, saddest, most wistful ending of any album ever made.
0780628551|4.0|I normally don't like sci/fi but this one was an exception.  First Charlize Theron is just gorgeous to watch.  Johnny Dep, though usually a very good actor, was miscast as an evil replication of her husband.  The character of Jillian was smart and resourcefull. She was the fiber in this tale that made it suspenceful, thoughtful, and enjoyable.  The fact that she worked her way out of a situation supposedly created by aliens, was both commendable and believable.  She's a great actress.  Other reviews here cite \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", don't accept that. Not even close.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Blow-up is a wonderful film, filled with images of swinging 60s London. The story is engrossing: a photographer inadvertently captures a crime on film while following a couple in a park. He gradually becomes immersed in a series of bizarre events beginning with a visit from the subject of his filmic foray. When he develops the negatives and blows them up, an entirely hidden reality unravels before his eyes.<br /><br />Apart from all of the above reasons to see this cinema classic, there is another recommendation. There is a brief scene where the photographer (David Hemmings) goes into a London rock and roll club. The band onstage? None other than the legendary Yardbirds...at the peak of their creativity! Even more fascinating is the fact that this was filmed during the period when the band featured two immortal lead guitar icons: Jeff Beck AND Jimmy Page! The brevity of this sequence is sad, but the few moments of wild guitar interplay is worth the price of the DVD. Especially when you can view the Yardbirds segment over and over without damaging the disc. (Try this with the VHS!) A classic rock and roll snapshot from the glory years.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|\\"The Phantom Of The Opera\\" is impressive! Gerard Butler is impressive as the Phantom. Emmy Rossum is equally impressive as Christine Daae. Patrick Wilson is also impressive as Vicomte de Chagny, aka Raoul. The music is magnificent. The directing by Joel Schumacher is excellent. The screenplay by Schumacher & Andrew Lloyd Webber (on whose play that the movie is based on) is excellent. The visual design of the movie is beautiful.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This album was my first introduction to the band.  <br /> <br />To say that the album is great is to say nothing. I still can hardly believe that something this good was issued in the year 2005 and not thirty years back. Yes, in 1970s, with Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin and AC/DC and numerous others churning out classics on a yearly basis, the album would have become \\"just another masterpiece\\" but today a record of this magnitude is extremely unusual to say the least. <br /> <br />Mind you, it could not be mistaken for a 70s record: the sound is distinctly modern and very good at that. Also, this is not elite, obscure music: it is very accessible, with songs that will appeal to a whole range of music fans, from Pink Floyd to Metallica to Radiohead. Some said it was a sellout; well it's as much a sellout as Led Zeppelin IV or Dark Side Of The Moon were. <br /> <br />I shouldn't say anything else about the album - as has been rightly noted here, words cannot do it justice. I'm just curious whether it will find its way to the top of the charts and will be sad if it won't, because it deserves it far, far more than any other record out there.
B000084T18|5.0|As long as you dont sit and write reviews all day about how much a cd sucks on an upcoming artist due to your (male anatomy) envy... You'll love 50 Cents \\"Get rich or Die Tryin'\\" With hard hitting bass lines, chilling lyrics and an in-your-face approach this cd is nothing short of the years best album. Fifteen bucks well spent.. if you purchase music :P
B00006AW2J|5.0|After a year or so of psychedelic hooha, the Dirty London Five returned to their blues roots with this record. Brian, disenchanted with the boys a bit, plays a bit less here, especially since he was all over Their Satanic Majesties Request. Obviously, his days with them are numbered. The album is a big turning point in their career. The early blues days of 12x5 and Now! are gone. They ahve their own sound now, rather than much of the same as The Yardbirds and such, playing the black man's blues without much of their own originality. They play the blues THEIR way here. And they do a damn fine job. Of all their records, I'd say this is their crowing achievement. <br />Good Stuff: <br />Sympathy For The Devil: Samba rhythm, crazy Keef Rick guitar, and Satanic Mick. Whoa! This is one dark song. The lyrics are great. By the way: the devil is mankind in the story. <br />Street Fighting Man: ROCK AND ROLL! Actually, the bass is the only electric instrument, everything else is just heaily distorted acoustic stuff! But Charlie pounds away and Brian evens throws in some sitar amongst the acoustic napal,. How cool is that? <br />Stray Cat Blues: Little girls and hard guitars. Okay! <br />Factory Girl: A folk number that somehow channels English working class as well as drunken Americans. And it has some fiddle and groovy percussion. Classic unsober Mick also. <br />The Salt Of The Earth: An ode to the \\"hard workin' people,\\" those lower class men and women who live the simp;e life. Chalrie drums loud, Mick sings his heart out and everything just soudns great. Soul choir comes in the add extra flavor and it all ends with an upward speed change that would be repeated in \\"You Can't Alway Get What You Want.\\" Possibly their best song.
B00005JKES|5.0|There's obviously no need to say anything about the quality of Twin Peaks, as over 300 people before me have said enough. <br />But for all those waiting for Season 2 I wanted to update the information concerning the release schedule. It is now pretty certain that Paramount will do a worldwide release at the end of 2005 or the beginning of 2006 - a lot of bonus material has already been compiled, but they still have to do a video transfer and a 5.1 audio remastering of the episodes (which takes time...). If you want more info, go to: [...] <br />Can't wait to see Season 2 in all its glory returning to my TV!
B000002I27|5.0|And I thought their first one was on the dark side of the psychedelic spectrum.This one beats it on that. With all the exotic guitar and creepshow organ, you wonder if this is The Doors or some obscure California acid rockers alongside them. It's gotta be their most sinister album, though it never reaches the chills of \\"The End.\\" It's still a classic, just not as good as the first one. <br /> <br />\\"Strange Days\\": Groovy organ opening. Jim's voice has a cool Moog synth effect. You'd have to listen to see what I mean. <br />\\"You're Lost Little Girl\\": Really dark song. Gives me chills. Haunting guitar solo. <br />\\"Love Me Two Times\\": Groovy harpsichord and all over class. A real classic. <br />\\"Unhappy Girl\\": Tack piano gives this a different feel. It s a bit short and minor key. But nice! Jim is said to have sung it hile his woman Pam Coursan gave him oral enjoyment in the lower region. ! <br />\\"Horse Latitudes\\": Some poem Jim wrote in high school with soudn effets. Okay...runs right into... <br />\\"Moonlight Drive\\": Positively groovy. Spacey guitar solo and cool lyrics with a knockout wild ending. One of teh few happy songs/ <br />\\"People Are Strange\\": Sure are. More tack piano. Considered a classic, but I'm less happy with it, though it is pretty damn good. <br />\\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\": Pumpin' bass, more tack, rockin guitar! <br />\\"I Can See Your Face In My Mind\\": Marimba be Ray. Cool little minor key groove. Oh yeah. <br />\\"When The Music's Over\\": Another long epic (10:56), but unlike \\"The End\\" in every way. Wailing guitar. Rockin \\"We Want to world\\" part and wild lyrics. Classic organ groove also. I swear Jim yells \\"f*** your dad\\" at the beginning of the guitar solo!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've been a big Whedon fan since Buffy, so I figured that I might enjoy this series. I ordered the box set, and, man, was I glad that I did. I really enjoyed the story. Since watching the complete season, I've recommended it to several friends. Every one of them feel the same way about the series, and, now, we can't wait for Joss' movie, \\"Serenity\\", to come out in September.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I think I can safely say this is the greatest musical of this generation, so far. The music in this CD is amazing! Once you see the play it means so much more. Every song is amazing and although the track \\"The Wicked Witch of the East\\" didn't make the album (even though the CD is only 71 minutes, it would've fit) it's still stands high as one of my top 25 favorite albums ever! I can listen to every song without skipping. The greatest tracks include the Fiyero/Scarecrow spell-bound song \\"No Good Deed,\\" a personal favorite of mine, \\"Dancing Through Life\\" and \\"Popular,\\" the most vibrant tracks on the album and most pop-friendly, and a little song just before intermission called \\"Defying Gravity.\\"    Let me take a minute to reflect on the perfection that is \\"Defying Gravity.\\" There's a reason why the song's title is the slogan of the damn play. The power in that song is enough to trample any army, any being (other than God), any mountain. Speaking of God, the song, in it's own, it's a religious experience. I can say it's the greatest song of all time (at least to me and that means something). Idina is truly flawless in this song. When the bridge hits (\\"so if you care to find me...\\") you feel a sensation you might never have felt before. The message in the song is also a major point in how great the song is. You can take it as the play offers it or apply it to yourself. The song is about personal strength and overcoming ANY obstacle no matter how big it may be. Giving the people who try to break you or make you compromise your own values the big \\"F*** YOU!\\" Elphaba shows that she's MUCH more powerful than any obstacle because she believes in herself. And that's worth all the money in the world.    So watch the play if you have the means because it sure helps make the album so much more special & actually more understandable. But if you're just looking for great music from an outstanding musical that encompasses all forms of emotion (sadness, revenge, excitement, regret,anger, hate and love) this album is a definite must-own.    Top 5 songs on the album:   (11/10) \\"Defying Gravity\\"   (10/10) \\"The Wizard And I\\"   (10/10) \\"Dancing Through Life\\"   (10/10) \\"One Short Day\\"  (10/10) \\"For Good\\"
0375815252|5.0|This book was very funny.  And the kids too!  I liked it when Grandma Josephine took 4 wonkavite pills and she turned into a minus.  And when she ate the vita-wonk!  Read this book you'll find that it is very funny.
6305095442|3.0|...I can still understand why it is a classic. The \\"comedy\\" of Evil Dead 2 really is of a certain style, it made me laugh a couple of times -in fact; I found myself laughing more often than I jumped in my seat. It is far overrated as a horror-movie, it's not scary at all -perhaps for its' time though, but compared to the Asian-horror-movies ruling this genre today it is not even to be compared to the \\"impact\\" of those. <br /> <br />The acting by Bruce Campbell, well, I don't think anyone else cold have been more fit for this character. He has a suitable face, with all the various expressions for all the kinds of crazy happenings taking part of the story behind Evil Dead 2. The other actors, well, they were just there -and that was probably the purpose of their contribution. <br /> <br />The effects; good for its' time? I don't know? Looking fake today anyway, but I understand this was a low-budget-movie. And the bad effects somehow becomes a part of the humour. <br /> <br />That being said; Another movie far overrated in my opininon, but indeed watchable. I don't know how many more times I'll watch it, but it feels ok to have added it to my movie-collection.
B0007XT87G|5.0|DEADWING a winner.  I read the sparse negative reviews too, but think they are way off base.  As many have emphasized, this is an album that bears repeated listening to fully appreciate.  It may not completely grab your the first few listens, but will be be hooked sooner than later.  EDIT:  After 2 years of listening it is still not a top fave from PT, but a fine, enjoyable album nonetheless.<br /><br />I bought my album from the PT website and it is a special dual disc deluxe edition with  70+ page booklet  and 2nd DVD audio version of the album in 5.1.  This IS the way to hear this album!  Steve has worked his aural magic once again, even more so than his 5.1 remastering of In Absentia.  It is truly audio bliss.  Any self respecting fan with the right equipment NEEDS to own this version!<br /><br />Since this album has been so well coverd by others, let me just say, if you are a fan, you probably already own this or should.  If you are new to the group, get Lightbulb Sun first if you like the lighter stuff, or In Absentia if you like your music a little heavier.  Being a long-time fan, it is hard to imagine starting out with Deadwing, but newcomers to PT could do a lot worse.<br /><br />All in all a worthy addition to the PT canon and 5 big stars for the best album I've heard yet this year.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Finally Univeral is giving us the full 2 hour documentary, the mono transfer for film purists, although the DTS rocks on my system. Can you remember a film that actually touched a nerve with the public? Beaches were full, but the water was vacant in the summer of 1975, filmgoers stretched for blocks, and Jaws mania was on. Yeah the shark looks phony in a few scenes, but they didn't have cgi computer effects then, and my opinion, the shark,(Bruce),looks a heck of alot better then the ones in Deep Blue Sea.\\" Without inflation and years gone by,I guarantee Jaws would still be in the top 5 all time grossing films. I remember tickets for $1.25 then. This Dvd is a must own, if you have the 25th anniv. edition and don't care for extras, save your money. But come on, you can always sell it and shell out 16 bucks for this. Just wish they had the original poster art on the cover, hey, it worked then, why not now. Purchase this classic thrill a min. and enjoy the reason people escape into movies............Just picked it up tonight, new deleted scenes, new bloopers, full documentary, 60 page booklett,nice packaging, 15 bucks, Walmart, cheaper then taking a date to see a cheesy movie like Hope Floats. I've been to the Vineyard twice, met people in the film and can gladly say I'm a Finatic. People, quit your bitching, if your pissed, DON'T BUY IT, watch a rerun of \\"Happy Days\\", when Fonz jumped the shark. Get over it, 15 bucks? You people must be on food stamps.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Hmmm....I must admit this album was not quite what I was hoping for, but still, I'm not entirely disappointed. I was not entirely unprepared for this, as I would imagine many of us weren't. \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" really surprised me the 1st time I heard it on the radio. I recognized his voice immediately and got very excited because I didn't even know about this album coming out. However, the song seemed lame to me mostly because of the 80's synth beat. But, I did begin to enjoy listening to it when it came on the radio after a few days. Plus, it gave me a 1st look at the direction he was going. I have been a NIN fan/album collector since \\"Wish\\" first played on Mtv way back when they still played music (anyone remember the good 'ole days). I suppose that the idea of Trent I will always have is from when I saw him during The Downward Spiral tour, which it seems is an idea widespread here. Obviously, Trent's music has changed over the years just as we have grown, matured, lost, gained, etc. No one ever spends their entire life feeling exactly the same way about everything. Otherwise he would have run out of things to write a song about a long time ago. I had a similar experience in the transition from TDS to The Fragile. There were songs that caught me right away but I felt disappointed overall at first. But to my surprise, years later several songs from The Fragile are still some of my favorite NIN songs. I almost didn't give it a chance in the beginning. The thought occured to me as I listened to him struggle through \\"All The Love In The World\\", it reminded me of being at a karioke bar listening to a drunk tone-deaf singer ruin a song you love and wanting to BOO them out of the building for such an offense except it was his own song so maybe more like seeing a band REALLY suck live and mutilate the melody of a song that sounded great on a CD) that I wished I could return the album or that I had just waited and downloaded the MP3s but all I could do was turn it down alot since I had cranked it up loud enough for people on the next block to hear, but then I had some changes of heart as I continued to listen and this is why. #1 - I appriciated the fact that it was actually him coming thru, not a studio mixer hiding his vocals, I'm sure that was the idea he had as well. #2 - I think Trent is a genius in his own right, he could sing about dog poop and I would still listen just to hear his ideas on the subject. #3 - The CD is not unbearable to listen just not the NIN we have been waiting over 10 years to hear again. #4 - Maybe this is exactly the CD he wanted to create at this point in his life, maybe not, maybe it was just a hold-me-over until his next one is released and maybe that one will be exactly what everyone who feels let down by this one was looking for in the 1st place. Either way, if my buying this CD does my small part to ensure that there will be another CD worth listening to still to come from him then it was worth it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|What can I say about one of the greatest trilogys of all movie history? Not much but I'll try...... <br />This is the original, the one that started it all! I got the 1997 release on video, and I loved all the new things they added. They have 'em in the dvd too, so the it's the best of both worlds. I can't count how many times I've seen the special features, especially the preview of  Star Wars III: THE RETURN OF DARTH VADER(original title of film), or as we know it, REVENGE OF THE SITH; I can't wait until it comes out this month!  <br />All in all, this is a great addition to your DVD collection.
0195170776|5.0|This is a review of the second edition of the dictionary.  Naturally, it has been revised substantially by adding or updating entries and usage notes.  This is well described by the publisher and other reviews. <br /> <br />A key new feature called \\"The Right Word\\" are valuable synonym study boxes discussing subtle differences in meaning, e.g., \\"definite\\" vs. \\"definitive\\". <br /> <br />The typography has been completely overhauled.  The change is definitely for the better, although this may sound surprising given the richness and complexity in the first edition.  Word functions, usage levels, examples, etc., are again set in distinct fonts, yet they harmonize here much better than before.  I especially like the new italic face frequently seen in the numerous and illuminating examples.  Phrases are explicitly set off from the main entry yet at equal weight.  Etymologies and derivatives follow tightly at the very end but are still clearly recognizable. <br /> <br />The appendix has also received some attention and is now much more appropriate for a dictionary.  The various \\"Hall of Fame\\" lists from the first edition have rightly been dropped in favor of informative and relevant language aids covering grammar, style, spelling, capitalization and punctuation.  This part also includes several interesting lists of commonly mis-spelled words, clichs to avoid, and redundant expressions. <br /> <br />This is the best desk dictionary of contemporary American English.
B000023VR6|5.0|I would like to adress a few things in this review <br /> <br />1. Eminem is a great rapper hands down.  I hate to say it, but it is racist to decide that Dre ruined rap by signing Eminem, he is one of the most talented rappers ever known and Dre used him because of his talent.  Of course Eminem later made \\"Encore\\" which may be the worst album ever made in rap, but he was good on this album, and if no one knew his skin color, everyone would think he is increadable  <br /> <br />2.  The lyrics on this album are all true, and strong as well.  Dr. Dre is not a gangsta, he never was in a gang, he never did get in trouble with the law, but he did help to create gangsta rap.  When he was with NWA all he did was lie, but he made good music.  And he made Gangsta rap, so i think he should be allowed to talk about being a gangsta  <br /> <br />3.  Dr. Dre has alway used his albums as a way to get young artists noticed.  Snoop was a nobody before the chronic, and look where he is now.  That is because Dre uses his albums to spread young rappers.  And thats what he does on 2001, effectively.  He knows anything he makes will sell, so why not help others sell as well. <br /> <br />4.  This is the best album made by any rapper in my opinion.  It has the best beats ever made on an album, and some of the best lyrics.  The skits can get on your nerves, but it is still an amazing album.  Buy it, youll like it.  If anyone knows of a better album. email me the name, cuz id like to know it.  Wpjones@guerincatholic.org <br /> <br />Buy this album, you will love it <br />

0060594888|5.0|It's almost impossible not to like this book-- it's direct, pulls no punches, and is all about taking control of your life.  Even if you get one gem of an idea every 30 pages, you're still going to come out ahead.  If everyone read the first 2-3 chapters about taking responsibilty and quitting the blame-game, we as a society in general would vastly improve!<br /><br />As Mart Spitz  said, \\"Everyone wants to win an Olympic gold medal, but how many people want to train every day?\\"-- this book is going to teach you HOW to train, but you still have to do the work.  I look at Jack Canfield and think-- when I'm as successful as he is, maybe then I can dismiss the principles. Until then, why not give it a shot?<br /><br />My copy is a library book, but is certainly worth buying-- I'd even pay full cover price!<br /><br />(This book is much much MUCH better than The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness by Stephen Covey.)
6304936362|5.0|It is said that this moview incorporates all of the shameless propaganda that ever went into a flyboy movie. Maybe so. So what? It is a good one and all the better for being THE WAY IT WAS.  <br /> <br />My uncle fought on these beasts. He said they got this one right and I am inclined to believe him. I also look at him with awe when I think about it. <br /> <br />One of my lasting impressions is how young the aircrews were. That is much different that my military experience but that too is the way it was at that time. <br /> <br />The story is of a bomber crew that has to make one more mission before they get rotated back home. They were expecting a milk run and got a horror mission instead. This is the story of how they got through it and the things that happened to them on the way there and back again. <br /> <br />It brings to life the multiplicity of different type people who made up the crews. They came from different backgrounds and places. They get hacked off with each other. They also pull together when the time comes for them to do so. <br /> <br />Forget the cliches. Get this one to remind you about the Greatest Generation!
B0008JFMEC|5.0|Actually there are two subtitles, full english captioning and just the translated subtitles, the modes are Subtitle Off, Engligh 1, and English 2. <br /> <br />And the aspect ratio is actually letterboxed in 2.35:1 instead of the standard PSP widescreen, so I don't know what is being misprepresented. I've heard more people complain that it is in its original widescreen and not formatted to fill the PSP screen (Spider-Man 2 for example actually was cropped from 2.35:1 down to the PSP's screen size). <br /> <br />This is a great UMD, it has great looking animated menus, it actually HAS a scene selection menu, and it has extras too, a Making Of video and music videos. Compared to the rest of the UMD pack this disc is a feature packed jewel.
B0007NMKB2|5.0|Definitely the best album from one of greatest bends in 80's (Together with Pixies, Sonic youth and Husker Du). <br /> <br />This album is classic in so many ways. If you are in this kind of music, make sure you have it. <br />
B000002AS3|1.0|Loved \\"whats the story..\\" so recently 4/05 got this CD. I cant believe its the same band. DM is boring and whiny and I can hardly listen to it all the way through. \\"whats the story..\\" is so much more inspired and less nasaly. Im glad I didnt hear it first or I never would have gotten the 2nd one. Music isnt that good either
B000002B2T|4.0|Starting off with that slow bass intro, you know that this isn't gonna be an AiC like band. Layne Staleys little side project with some guys from Pearl Jam sounds like the two bands mixed in with a little Temple of the Dog. Consisting mostly of slow-rockers, this is an awesome CD for whenever you are feeling down. They had a minor hit with \\"River of Deceit\\" and I sometimes hear \\"I Don't Know Anything\\" on the radio, which is my personal favorite song on here. Everything on here sounds great. You'd think that Layne would sound out of place not playing with the guys from AiC but he sounds like he belongs in this band just as much. You can tell these guys had an influence on Godsmacks slower stuff, especially \\"Long Gone Day\\" which to me sounds a lot like Voodoo to me. \\"Lifeless Dead\\" and \\"I Don't Know Anything\\" are the only really metally souding tracks on here. The instrumental \\"November Hotel\\" is pretty cool and actually doesn't get annoying after 7 minutes. The standouts include \\"River of Deceit,\\" \\"I'm Above,\\" and \\"I Don't Know Anything.\\"
B0008ISM40|5.0|I just have to rant. It obvious that whomever listened to this album and then wrote the review has no musical sense nor knowledge, TEEN BEAT???? Overtly commercial rave-ups???? Dude or Dudette, Trent Reznor/NIN is classified only under one genre, and that is Industrial..I N D R U S T R I A L. And here is the \\"TRICK\\", Techno and any music pertaining to raves did not exist before Industrial music, Industrial had Techno beat by at least ten years. Using hard synth in music is an I N D U S T R I A L concept that techno and its cousins learned from the grand pappy of Synth, Industrial. SO before you critque, know what it is your critiquing, INDUSTRIAL. Got it now? (Or should I spell it out for you?)
B000929AJQ|5.0|First of all, this is an incredible album...the creativity that Trent has in creating an album is not lacking in this one. Although somewhat different than we're used to, the entire album is a welcome distraction from the music being produced today. But is this a tell-all look into Trent's soul? Listen to the lyrics and you'll see that the majority of the album has Trent revealing the emptiness of his mind, and the loss of control over himself. Anyone who has listened to Pink Floyd in the Syd Barrett days can attest to a parallel between this album and Syd's writings before he lost complete control. Will this be Trent's final album? Will he soon be forever lost within his own mind? Only time will tell. Buy the album.
6305537321|4.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is the story of a wandering eccentric called Holly Golightly whose actions slowly lead her to the man she loves.<br /><br />Holly is a strange one. She calms herself from the \\"mean reds,\\" different than the blues, by breakfasting at Tiffany's, the jewelry store. She is frequently given $50 by rich men to go to the powder room and although they're terrible bores, Holly consistently surrounds herself with them. She makes her living by visiting an ex-mobster in Sing Sing and giving him the weather report. She grew up as Loula Mae on a farm with her brother Fred who she loves dearly. When she escaped, she came to New York to lead her eccentric life with her feline alter ego she simply calls \\"cat\\" so that they do not belong to each other.<br /><br />The character of Holly is a composite of many personalities of the era including the tempestuous Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />Paul Varjak is a writer/gigolo who slowly falls in love with Holly. He is straight forward, quite the opposite of Holly who randomly enters his room in the night for a short visit and calls him Fred after her brother.<br /><br />The cat is used as a symbol of Holly's true self. She often accepts and rejects the cat in the film during appropriate times during her life.<br /><br />The song Moon River is used throughout the film highly effectively. Audrey Hepburn sings the song beautifully and illustrates a melancholy mood that hovers over the film.<br /><br />The one fault of the movie is the slow pace. Because of Holly's flightiness, the story progresses with jolts and sputters. It truly follows her life and not necessarily one looming important event as many movies do.<br /><br />Overall, it is an excellent film with an exceptional cast.
B0001906O0|5.0|Robert Smith has expressed his appreciation for well conceived B-Sides.  He has said that he respects bands whose catalogue of B-Sides offer a rare glimpse, a different side, that is just as incredible as the A-side songs.  I could not agree with Robert Smith more.  B-Sides from respectable musicians are never the left over, mediocre \\"filler\\" songs that didn't make it on an album - they are a necessary shadow to a given album.    When you hear the B-Sides that The Cure produced, it is apparent that Robert Smith took his B-Side work very seriously.  If you had been a Cure fan and not heard the majority of B-Sides before, it was once acceptable, considering it once took some effort to get hold of most - but now, with the release of Join the Dots, there is no longer an excuse.  Having these B-Sides is crucial to rounding out any collection of the Cure's music, to get a complete and accurate portrayal of their incredible legacy.      Analogy time:  If the Cure's music were a movie, not having the B-Sides would be like watching 3/4 of the movie screen.  Some of the very best moments take place on that 1/4 of the screen that you are missing.      These B-Sides are that crucial.  If you are a cure fan and have not heard them, go get this box set and step through the looking glass.  Although there will be some songs that dont make the grade, you will gain a whole new appreciation.  Enjoy.
B0000714BP|5.0|I love this movie. I don't think of it as JUST a drag movie but a movie about people and how they react with one another. I kept seeing people I knew in charaters in the movie. Carolann(Stockard Channing) reminded me of other girls I knew who used to get beat up by their men. And I thought \\"man I've been through this also.\\" I've been the one who wants to help them. And just having other gay friends who think only of themselves which is what Wesley Snipes character does. And i have been in the one to fall in love with a guy who is unattainable, like Chi Chi's character. And i usually have to give them up or leave them behind. So i can really identifiy with these characters. I am glad I got it and really got to understand it too. The only thing is I don't look that good in Drag ha ha ha! Maybe I'll get the hang of it after I watch this a few times. <br />I also love seeing RuPaul in here very cool. And the music is to DIE for. The reunion of Labelle, along with Chaka Khan, Crystal Waters, Tom Jones, The Commodores, and many others. Will have you DANCING all night!
B0008ISM40|4.0|This the the album for those NIN fans that couldn't force themselves to like The Fragile. It has some Fragile-like sounds, but it is mainly the old school NIN we grew up loving. I'm liking it more every time I listen.
B000929AJQ|5.0|With Teeth is definatelly a step in a new direction for Trent and Co.  Some have voiced complaints that this alblum did not live up to their expectations, or that Nine Inch Nails has \\"sold out\\" because the sound of this record is much catchier and accessible than previous Nine Inch Nails records; however, the majority of these people were waiting for another Downward Spiral and probably would not have been happy with anything Trent released. Elements from prior works are still evident, but there are several new elements such as an emphasis on live drumming and increased usage of piano.  I own and enjoy all of Nine Inch Nails' releases and while this one is not my favorite( the fragile is) With Teeth definately stands up to any of his other records.  I feel that change is a good thing for Nine Inch Nails, and has ultimately aided in the longevity of the project.  The easy thing to do would have been for Trent to create a rehash of his other records, but he instead chose to take a risk.  Overall this is a great record and is definately worth the price.
B00005JNTV|5.0|The task, or the responsibility, of a director to take on a project involving the adaptation of a comic book is crucial.  It is crucial in respects of getting the job done.  It is critical for the director to capture the spirit of the story, characters and setting.  If this is not achieved, then the project fails.  This is why most comic book, or in this case graphic novel, adaptation to film does not achieve the superiority that Sin City surpasses. <br /> <br />This is the best comic book or graphic novel film ever made.  Frank Miller's Sin City is a creation beyond the imaginative nightmare.  It has style with fashion, affection and hate.  It chills your bones, makes you squirm forcing a smile out of you where you can't help but feel the adrenaline-charged images on the screen as if you were experiencing them.  Robert Rodriguez has ingeniously redefined \\"reproduction\\" in a new postmodern experience.  The replica on the screen is incredibly audacious and it achieves itself as a visual masterpiece, exploring our subconscious of colors and graphic images with characters we love to hate and hate to love. <br /> <br />Done on a scale of almost all computer generation with no real sets, the film captures the reality of the environment the characters are situated in that we do not feel in the CGI that we are exposed to, or see, in films like Troy (2004).  For most films, computer generation does not work because actors do not act real to the environment.  In Sin City we have a story and setting that fits the medium that Rodriguez and Miller create. <br /> <br />Sin City has three intertwining stories told at separate time periods involving us much like Pulp Fiction (1994).  These stories follow Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Dwight (Clive Owen).  They work within a framing device that opens and closes the door on us in the world of Sin City.  Hartigan is an almost sixty year old cop trying to catch a pedophile (Nick Stahl) that has kidnap a young girlnamed Nancy.  He is beat, broken down and worn out, but understands his duty and will cross the line to get it done.  Marv is about two or three times the size of a defensive lineman who is out to seek justice for the murderer of Goldie (Jaime King), a hooker with a \\"heart of gold.\\"  He loves her and will stop at nothing, no matter what the consequence, to seek equity in his eyes.  Dwight wants to protect his girl, Shellie (Brittany Murphy), from Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro).  He is a cool clever guy that accidentally gets involved in a war.  This is the story where Tarantino puts his signature as the guest director.  The stories each start our engines with interest with Hartigan cracking down on the pedophile, Marv waking up next to a dead Goldie, and Dwight in a jam with Jackie Boy and his girl.  The film follows these three stories but involves us in many others with vividly fresh characters played by Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett and numerous others. <br /> <br />The film recreates the film noir of the golden days where the characters on the screen acted as gods of cinema.  This film is visually stunning and the characters are just as extreme as the stories.  Sam Spade couldn't even survive this town.  Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino give Sin City a touch of elegance and a bath of brilliance.
B00005N5S5|3.0|I just bought the DVD. Sorry to ask, but I don't find any special features apart from the trailer and the DVD Rom. Can anybody tell me where I can find all that stuff?
B000929AJQ|5.0|I find it funny when some people will buy an album and immediately call it crap, when they don't even give it time to sink in.  This is a ridiculous way to determine whether or not an album is good or bad. I mean, I had the same reaction to The Fragile when I first heard it, I was all gung ho about Downward Spiral, and out comes Fragile a completely different trip.  But once I listened enough, I couldn't take it out of my cd player, each song was as brilliant as the next.  I awoke to a new creative formula. <br /> <br />With Teeth is yet another great album by NIN.  People really need to start listening to this subtle masterpiece, think deeply about what Trent is saying, find a connection.  I know it can be tough, but once you do, you'll see this album is yet another masterpiece.
B0008ISM40|4.0|I waited until the official release of the album in order to experience it as a whole and in its purest form.(album was leaked)  It is worth the money.  I purchased the Dual-Disc Format, it was 14.99.  I have yet to listen to this album in 5.1 SACD format, i do have the technology at my house to do so though.  I gave the album 4 stars out of 5 because it felt right, my biggest issue was the lack of art inside the case but Trent Reznor cleared up this issue on his web site and explained why he chose to exclude such vital components to a cd. In the end though its all about the music.  The album is a work of art.  Other people have reviewed this album song by song and I will not because each song when experienced by one, at least in my mind, should be without any other persons thoughts or opinions.  If you are a long time fan or someone who just stumbled upon NIN recently this album is well worth the wait and your money.  thank you for reading this diatribe.
B000006MV8|5.0|Excellent album.  Excellent band.  I especially liked \\"It's Over\\" (by Tom Evans), but all are excellent, and this is an album you can listen to over and over.  (Now I can't get the songs out of my head.)  --Why don't radio stations play great stuff like this?  There are probably so many (unpublished) songs written by these guys (esp. Pete Ham & Tom Evans) that could shine with the right producer.  I just finished reading \\"Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger\\".  Very, very Sad.  A textbook example of man's inhumanity to man.
0440237688|5.0|This is an excellent Newbery Award winning novel. I thought the different levels of thinking involved in this book are wonderful. It was a quick read because I couldn't stand to put it down.  <br /> This book could pose thoughts and make people thankful for the way that things are. Jonas is a normal kid whose life gets turned upside down when he learns the truths about the community that he has been living in. It has a little bit of the White Mountains book feel in that the world they live in is over simplified and the way that we live is looked at badly. It is so thought provoking and heart felt though that Jonas finally takes the \\"newchild\\", Gabe, and tries to leave and give the memories to the whole community to try to save it. That would be a huge undertaking. The idea that they are always watching them and how they reprimand them is so odd to think about. Also the idea of applying for a wife and children is very strange. Ms. Lowry is an excellent writer and wholly deserves the award for this book.  <br />
B0008ISM40|4.0|This is nothing short of Trent-like status and an overall amazing album. The production value as with all NIN releases is worth the cost just for headphone kicks and intense surround sound pleasure. I'll let everyone else slobber over all the album details and how Trent is their Messiah, I'm writing mainly because of the \\"Dual Disc\\" feature. <br /> <br />It will not work in my computer therefore my i-Tunes program and i-Pod will be without \\"With Teeth\\". This is a major disadvantage for me and people like me. My entire library is in my Pod and I use my Pod exclusively for listening be it in the truck, running at Memorial Park or working out. I don't use a cd for anything anymore except for a shelf trophy. The disclaimer is inside the package and it mentions nothing about it on the outside wrapper when you buy it, that it might not work in \\"some players\\". \\"Some Players\\" is my whole means of listening to music. Does anyone have a cure or suggestion? <br /> <br />The features on the \\"Dual Disc\\" are good and worth the extra couple of bones I payed for it. If you are not living in 2005 and don't have an i-Pod or do not listen to music via your computer at home or at work or on a plane than the complaints I have won't affect you. If you are like me though you really should get the \\"regular disc\\" because you can't load it into or play it on your com or mp3 device.
B000255LIY|5.0|I dunno what's wrong with the other reviewers, but perhaps they're stuck in some sort of time warp--seems they can't see the remake's merits because they're too entwined with the original. <br /> <br />I, for one, absolutely LOVED the Close/Stewart remake. I thought it well-acted, well-directed, and well-produced. Close's deadpan, \\"Of course he has a knife. We all have knives. It's 1183 and we're BARBARIANS!\\" was right on the money, while Stewart's Henry seemed to have genuine affection for Alais. I found John's whininess so surreal that I almost had the urge to slap my own younger brother! LOL <br /> <br />I give this one five stars, and I highly reccomend seeing it--without disdain for its departure from the original. After all, who'd want to see a clone, anyway?
B0008ISM40|4.0|All tracks are superb, and Reznor-esque.  However, track one of the CD starts like Sting.  From there, it's heavy drums, heavy guitar... it's more instrumental (as oppossed to overly-synthesized and mixed)and more lyrical than anything NIN has done to date. <br />If you are a true NIN fan (i.e. since Halo 1) it may take a few spins through the CD palyer to get used to a newer sound, with SOME familiarity (The Hand That Feeds is VERY \\"Head Like a Hole\\"ish.)  However, I believe the wait was worth it as Trent has put out the typical well-thought and arranged music his fans have come to know, love, and respect.  Not quite \\"The Downward Spiral\\", but then again, what is??? <br />
B00006F83Y|5.0|This is one of the best albums i have ever heard. It rocks hard the whole way through. the only bad song is six shooter. So orginal. This is a MUST buy it really its that damn good. Classic
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am tired of all the outcries over this boxset, so I'm going to give you all a bit of insight to what went on behind the curtain.    First of all, let me explain why Lucas released this set. Demand was very high, and DVDs were going to be phased out in the near future. He wanted to please the fans, and give them something to tide over with until the BD/HD-DVD set hits stores in 2007.    Long story short, we had a lot to do and a very short period of time to do it in. Most of our resources were busy with Episode III (both the release and the DVD for the film). We were strained to begin with. Add putting the entire star wars trilogy on DVD with only a little bit over a year to restore and master it, and you have a race against time.    We would have liked to re-color the lightsabers, re-color Jabba, spend more time on the audio/picture, and everything else we wanted to do, but WE HAD NO TIME TO DO IT.    In addition, we only had time to work on one version of the film. We had to choose: the originals, or the special editions. Lucas chose the SE. Lucas didn't want to shell out the millions, and divert time and resources to them when they would be released in 2007.    Yes everyone, the originals are coming to BD/HD-DVD. Seeing all this moaning and groaning makes us wonder if anything will please you guys. The film team is curious if this High-Def set will fill you with joy, or make you all whine further. Why? Because we are already having to make alterations to the film. The restoration is screwing with some key elements, so we are having to go back and manually insert some things. For example, the lightsabers. Yes, they will look like the ones from Episodes I-III, because the High-Def conversion/restoration downgraded the appearence. We had to fix it, and couldn't give it that \\"70's look\\" so we were forced to make the sabers look like the more modern ones seen in the prequels.    I'm sorry for all the pain this DVD set has caused some of you. Had we had more time, things would have been different. Now we have a substantial amount of time to work with. With this additional production time, we can now include everything (such as deleted scenes) in the BD/HD-DVD set that we could not include here. You will have your original films (HAN SHOOTS FIRST) and a new directors cut (with more changes) in High Def very soon. Please be patient with us. We hope you can enjoy this set while we work to blow you away with our finished product in 2007. Thank You.    EDIT: It seems some people are paying no attention to my words, but thats ok...    Continue to make an outcry over the set if you want. It will convince Lucas further that the originals will sell (he feels everyone will prefer the DX over the originals). So go ahead and bash us if you want, but try to be somewhat respectful about it? Thanks again.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|catchy, orginal, and good. It is definatly hard to follow songs for the deaf and i like the fact where they changed this album. Good tracks are: this lullaby, medication, tangled up in plaid,in my head, little sister, thats a killer scene there. My favorite tracks are: everybody knows that youre insane, Burn the witch, and my absolute favorite someones in the wolf.   IT IS A GREAT album but i only gave it 3 stars which it should actully get 4 stars but whatever it is good.
0553208845|5.0|There are many books out there considered \\"school books\\", the books one is forced to read during their academic days for school. Novels such as Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Lord of the Flies, and many others suit this description. Another novel that commonly falls into this category is Siddhartha. The novel, about a man named Siddhartha, is all about the journey that one takes on their way to their spiritual enlightenment.<br /><br /> My recommendation for you would be to put all pre-conceived notions of this novel behind you, and to actually give it a second chance. The novel may seem bland when it is forced upon you, however reading it for a second time around gives it a whole new purpose, and you will be able to see the book in a new light. Personally, I loved the fact that the book helped me with my own spiritual journey, and I believe that it can do the same for anyone. It's a story in which all of us can relate to, and one where we can learn a lot about ourselves.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|The Phantom of the Opera DVD is quite simply put, bad. How bad you ask? Ummm, nails on a chalk board and nasty papercut bad. I will elaborate...from the beginning. <br /> <br />Though I was looking forward to this film, I was doing so very cautiously. I have yet to see an ALW musical that translated well on screen...and I was hoping that this time, things would be different. After all, the dashingly handsome and talented Patrick Wilson was cast as our hero, Raoul Vicomte de Chagny. Ok, so I admit, for me, that was the only thing the film had going for it.  Sir Andrew (Lloyd Webber) was producing and had full creative control over his project, but still...something told me to remain cautious.  <br /> <br />Clue #1: Joel Schumacher <br />Clue #2: And I cringe as I type this out, only because he is terribly hot and seemingly the nicest guy, but...Gerry Butler. Let me just mention that when he was cast, I had never heard of him before. Wasn't sure if an \\"unknown\\" without any real professional vocal training/experience could pull off a role that was vocally heavy. <br />Clue #3: This was a film that nobody ever thought would be produced. Casting rumors had been swirling for YEARS teasing people with the idea that the film was coming to fruition. <br /> <br />Cut to...November something or another. I went with a friend to see an advanced screening where the entire cast, director and Sir Andrew would perform a Q&A following the screening. As the lights dimmed and the music began to swell, I sat anxiously in my seat only hoping that the film would on some level make me as happy as the stage version had for so many years. Despite my initial suspicions, I did have to admit that the trailer looked AMAZING. It was dramatic, stunning, colorful, exciting...all good things...or so I thought because the trailer ended up being the only good thing about the film. <br /> <br />The opening sequence was great, I got chills from being so excited. Then, I got chills throughout the rest ofthe film because it was so horrid. How do I describe the film...cheesy, disjointed, ugly, badly directed, bad pacing, bad cinematography...did I mention cheesy? The actors in the Andre and Fermin roles were trying too hard resulting in unbelievable characters that you didn't mind not liking. Then came the Masquerade scene...it was dull, boring and very GOLD. Yes, GOLD and they were VOGUE-ING (a la Madonna). I won't even bother elaborating. <br /> <br />As for the main characters...Emmy Rossum exceeded my expectations and I thought was well cast as Christine. I knew of her, but wasn't very familiar with her body of work.  Patrick was a fine Raoul, however I didn't think it showcased the breadth or depth of his talent. It was a great experience for him I'm sure, and he did a fine job in the role. Patrick 's  voice far outshined the rest of the cast (and I'm not just saying that because he is a two-time Tony Award nominee in musical theatre). My only real criticism for him is indirect as it is due to whoever thought that Raoul should have long hair. It might have worked on some actors in the role, but not Patrick. Shorter hair to match the period of the film, yes...but long hair? It just made him look gay and like a wimpy Raoul. Sorry Patrick. <br /> <br />Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the Phantom supposed to have some horrific disfigured face? Well, ...Gerry was hardly disfiugred and barely horrifically freakish. He had a droopy, lazy right eye and perfect skin on his left side. Oh yeah, and a bad wig. How then is he scary when he's too pretty? Maybe it was his singing that was most frightening to Emmy's Christine? Not sure, but if any of the creative PTB were going for scary and disfigured Gerry/Phantom I've gotta say, \\"Sorry folks, you failed because he was much to pretty.\\" <br /> <br />I almost forgot to mention Minnie Driver's performance...again, weary when I heard she was cast as Carlotta, a Bel Canto (as she would say) operatic singer, butshe was really great. She didn't exactly do her own singing (except for the end-credits) but she pulled off the over-the-top diva-esque Carlotta perfectly.  <br /> <br />Ok, so after all that (and trust me, this is all an abbreviated \\"review\\" of sorts), cut to today, May 3, 2005. It is a big day in the world of CD and DVD releases for me. To start, today was the day Spamalot -- the hottest ticket on Broadway -- was being released as was Little Women -- the best show I saw on my last trip to New York. In addition, I was waiting for the DVD of POTO because of all the special features. Though I wasn't sure what would be on it, I figured it had to be somewhat informative. Big mistake -- is anyone seeing a trend with me in regard to this film? Hey, you figure, 2-disc DVD, that second disc has gotta be something! WRONG. Said second disc has 3 features. To the average viewer, they can ooh and ahh at the \\"Behind the Mask\\"/\\"Behind the Scenes\\" BS...but I've already heard this story before! Give me something else, right? WRONG. Give me \\"interesting\\" interviews or unique behind the scenes...give me (at the very least) a freaking commentary track from Sir Andrew and any member (or 2, or 3, or 4) of the cast. Again, my bad as I assumed.  <br /> <br />Said DVD left me with a bad taste in my mouth as did my opinon of the film (which ironically is playing in the background as I type. One can call it \\"inspiration\\"). I admit, my expectations might have been too high...I was a faithful Phantom Phan for years, particularly during it's long run here in LA, but with Sir Andrew  involved, legit theatre people cast in key roles, you'd think it would be decent...sadly, not so much. <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I absolutely loved this beautiful well done movie.  The magic of this production was the sheer beauty of the music, the cast, and the story.  Excellent direction and a fantasyland of wonderment.  Shades of Nelson Eddy & Jeanette McDonald.  Emmy Rossum was superlative and a living joy.  Kudos to all and to hell with the critics.
B000002GQL|4.0|Great as they were, the Moody Blues record of great albums is quite spotty. Most of the albums of their classic period contain a few memorable songs with the rest being quite ordinary. In my opinion, the band can be deemed great only when the sum of their classic period seven albums is considered. And Seventh Sojourn stands as the best of those seven. <br />I really like the Moody Blues, but unless you are musically living in the past, you have to admit that much of what they did sounds quaint and dated today. But in their time, they were in the vanguard, and offered their fans a largely idealistic worldview. <br />Here's what I like best about Seventh Sojourn: <br />1)The obligatory \\"statement\\" song, Lost in A Lost World. What the statement is, is open to interpretation. <br />2)New Horizons, a quintessential Moody Blues tune. The sound speaks the band's name. <br />3)For My Lady, a very courtly romantic ditty. One can almost picture it being a popular medieval dance song. <br />4)The dreamy Isn't Life Strange? <br />and <br />5)I'm Just A Singer (in a Rock-and-Roll Band), the Moodies' best rock song, and another \\"message\\" song which can also be interpreted in different ways. <br />The \\"best\\" Moody Blues songs are not currently available together on any \\"best of\\" compilation, so if you want to have all of their best, you'll just have to buy all seven of the classic period albums. Seventh Sojourn is a recommended starting point. Its far and away my favorite, and yes, it outshines the better known and overplayed Days of Future Past.
6305311463|1.0|I find it truly amazing anyone could give this film anything more than 1 star (the lowest, unfortunately, Amazon allows).  It really is a ZERO star flick.  There is NOTHING about this film, in my opinion, that is good.  Nothing!<br /><br />Michael Bay's \\"technique\\" is so totally awful.  Not just this, ALL of his films.  The fact this guy is \\"allowed\\" to make films at all in Hollyweird just goes to show ya that \\"talent\\" and \\"creativity\\" have little to do with whether films get to the big screen or not.  Michael Bay is a HORRIBLE \\"director.\\"  Simply horrible.  I haven't seen (thank the Lord, whatever you may conceive him/her to be) all of his films), but if you catch \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" another of his horrors, you'll notice that this guy is IN LUST with close ups, shaky camera, shaky camera close ups, fast TV commercial-like cuts and editing, and more and more and more and more of the same.  Is all of this supposed to add up to enjoyable film entertainment?  I think not, unless you're all crystal-methed up or something.<br /><br />The story and characters are so cardboard cut-out, and all of it is so annoying, one hardly knows where to begin to diss this mess.  But I won't even try.  And do you know why?<br /><br />It's because this is LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR filmmaking.  And lots of folks will love this crap, not knowing any better (Forgive them Lord, for they know not...).  The basic idea here could've been something special, but Michael Bay and whomever his Hollywood co-horts and associates are, turned this into ONE OF THE WORST BIG BUDGET HOLLYWOOD FILMS EVER!<br /><br />Besides the crappy, by-the-numbers characters and plot, besides the \\"patriotic\\" nonsense (the rest of the world also threatened by Armageddon basically doesn't exist, or simply doesn't matter), virtually every shot, every scene, is so choppy, mostly extreme close ups (even when action scenes demand something else), and so cornball, that I wonder how anyone with half a brain could sit through this and actually find value in it.  And \\"science?\\"  Forgettabout it.  This film's scientific value is non-existent.  Even the special effects add up to zilch.<br /><br />As I write this, I even find I'm wasting my time.  Why waste time at all on pure filmic garbage?  Hollywood and the \\"studios\\" have offered us a helluva lot of great films, despite obvious limitations and compromises.  In my heart, I'd like to believe that in times of deep reflection and honesty, Michael Bay himself would even admit that this film is pure crap.  But this is not a movie I have any \\"heart\\" for except for total contempt and the first time I saw it was enough.  Further excerpts caught on replays on TV have only confirmed my original thoughts.<br /><br />This movie makes \\"Independence Day,\\" another pretty bad movie, look like a masterpiece.  This is a 4 Tylenol special, and have on hand plenty of eye drops.  Michael Bay should be banned from making any more films.  There may be worse \\"filmmakers\\" out there, but none of them are making any money, and are probably working at your neighborhood 7-11.<br /><br />A total mess...paint your wall and watch it dry.

B000929AJQ|5.0|Wow.  Where do I start?  When I first heard this album was at one of the listening parties before the album's actual release.  Unfortunately I walked away rather unimpressed, probably because the club had turned up the bass WAY too high.  Later I got my hands on an advance copy and liked some of the songs, but wasn't all that impressed.  BUT, my opinion changed soon after. <br /> <br />I think why I didn't really like it at first was that it was different from The Fragile, which is by far my favorite NIN album.  However, I listened to it a few more times and my opinion changed.  Overall, this is an awesome album.  The only song I don't like is \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same,\\" and that's just because the chorus is way too repetitive.  I highly recommend this album to any NIN fan.  I also recommend checking out the bonus tracks from the Japanese version.  \\"Home\\" is awesome, and the strictly-piano version of \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" is beautiful.  Now go!  Buy it now! :)
B00005OWEG|3.0|When I think about it sometimes, I'd like to give this 1 star, just to somehow LOWER if by some small percentage, the overall rating of this film on Amazon.  But I just can't.  Obviously, even with the TOTALLY CRAPPY AND UNNECESSARY added footage, this is STILL a good movie, maybe even a very good one.  But unfortunately, unlike the ORIGINAL, it is no longer GREAT in my view, no longer MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME, and no longer a sure-fire FIVE-STAR.  In other words, Coppola blew it BIG TIME with this re-edit/re-release.<br /><br />Why, Mr. Coppola, WHY???!!!<br /><br />The ORIGINAL (theatrical release) \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was, and will forever remain, my FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!  The ORIGINAL!  The one I saw back in 1979 in the theater, third row center, the images and power and perfect editing and sound and fury and music making me PAY in theaters a couple dozen times at least to see.  How far we have come from that.<br /><br />I purchased the original VHS version of this a few years after the theatrical version, only to find that the original ending of fire and explosions over the final credits to be edited OUT.  This itself was awful, as I found that the original theatrical release with the final credits put to explosive fire and bombing was just so cool and appropriate to the film experience as a whole.  But this I could, somewhat, overlook.<br /><br />Fast forward many years however, and when I first became aware that there was a re-edited, re-edited version of the film coming out, I first thought, how can one improve on almost total film perfection?  I finally saw this version, THIS VERSION, and was highly hopeful.  But this is/was an almost total letdown.<br /><br />Not only is the original's fire-bombing ending eliminated (as it was with the VHS tape I still own and enjoy from time to time), but eeeee-Gawd, Sir Coppola chose to make further revisions, and almost NONE of them good.<br /><br />All in all, after viewing the original (and my VHS tape, which eliminated the theatrical ending), as this was the best film I'd ever seen, I was most interested in seeing this \\"Redux\\" version.  Sadly, unfortunately, this \\"Redux\\" version makes the greatest film of all time (in my opinion), much, much worse.<br /><br />The original and \\"Redux\\" versions and comparisons and reviews have been written about a lot, so I won't waste much time in comparing the two (basic) ones.  Needless to say however, THIS \\"Redux\\" version, according to moi, has basically reduced the original film greatly.<br /><br />For one thing, while there are a few interesting additions here, such as the stealing of Colonel Killgore's surfboard, and a few different camera-angles and explanations of murky moments left unexplained in the original versions, none of the changes here really work.  For example, when Killgore says at the end of a scene, \\"Someday this war's gonna end,\\" this was a PERFECT (like most of the rest of the original film) cut.  In the \\"Redux\\" version, this is followed by a short but totally unnecessary scene where Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) and his boat-mates steal Killgore's prized surfboard.  While interesting to watch editing room footage like this, it almost totally destroys Willard's coldness (Martin Sheen is suddenly seen as \\"one of the boyz\\" not the cold-hearted killer he really is).  Therefore, it detracts considerably from his overall character.<br /><br />And while there are other trivial additions (like Marlon Brando reading from Time magazine on the \\"smell\\" of the Vietnam war) which are okay, these are NOT the main problems with this version.  The main problems (and faults) are the two extended scenes, namely, the French Plantation scene, and the Playboy Bunny in the helicopter scene.<br /><br />While I could live with and accept the minor changes as mentioned above, and while they are pretty cool to see, the TWO MAIN extended scenes mentioned above, simply do NOT WORK.  They are BORING (unlike almost every single shot of the original film) and they add NOTHING to the film as a whole.  In fact, they in large part, DETRACT greatly from the overall experience of this film, they slow the movie down, divert the storyline and pace, and stick out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />I really think the original film (or as close to it as one can get, and buy) is the way to go here.  The two added extended scenes in \\"Redux\\" really detract greatly from the overall experience of what I still consider the best film of all time.  The two main extended scenes add little to the story, abruptly change the almost perfect flow of the original movie, alter the characters in a negative and inconsistent manner, and are/were totally and obviously and rightfully so editing floor fluff.<br /><br />The original \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is still, in my warped view, the greatest movie the Hollywood studio system ever came up with.  The \\"Redux\\" version interrupts the flow and virtually perfect, shot by shot, scene by scene excellence, and anyone searching for the best and certainly most excellent version of this film will reject \\"Redux\\" and go for the original.<br /><br />The original version of this film is a SIX-star masterpiece.  The Redux version is a misguided attempt at trying to improve an almost perfect film.  I could only hope Coppola, with all of his industry power and influence, will someday admit (for whatever reasons), that this Redux version was a real misfire.<br /><br />I'd even hope that somehow, someway, he could someday pull this Redux version off the shelves completely, and give us all the original version, and just admit that it was a film so almost perfect that it was almost a sin in itself to try to tamper with or improve upon it.  And hey Francis, put back the fire and bombs at the end pleeeeeeeeeeeeze.<br /><br />Forget \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" and buy whatever version of the original pre-Redux version you are able to.gle shot of the original film) and they add NOTHING to the film as a whole.

B00005JKG7|5.0|I think I'm stuck in the late 70's and early 80's. Today's horror flicks never seem, to me anyway, to capture the imagination and show creativity the way they did back then. Seems all directors are interested now adays is filling up the screen with CG effects and throwing in a loud shriek or bang during the so called \\"scary\\" parts of a movie. What these movies lack now adays is imagination. With the exception of a few of todays horror films such as \\"The Ring\\" it's hard to find one that hasn't stolen ideas from a past horror film.    With that being said, John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" is my favorite movie and I absolutely loved \\"The Thing\\", but \\"The Fog\\", to me has to be ranked right up there with the best horror movies of it's time. It's atmospheric, eerie and entertaining. I love Carpenter's eye for detail, his grand use of widescreen which is beautifully transferred on this DVD, and his electronic musical score. The cast is pretty good here with many of the names you saw in \\"Halloween\\" including Jamie Lee Curtis, Charles Cyphers, and Nancy Loomis. It also stars Tom Atkins who we'd later see in Carpenter's \\"Halloween III\\", Hal Holbrook and Adrienne Barbeau (who ironically are husband and wife in \\"Creepshow\\" a few years later)    The ghost story at the beginning really sets up the story very well. This movie understands the appeal of summer camp ghost stories, and weaves quite an eerie tale of ghost pirates and the supernatural fog that brings them ashore to seek vengence. The movie also has some effective creepy bits like the haunted drift wood that foreshadows the townsfolk's fate, and great use of the lighthouse location for more than one great scene. Younger viewers brought up on teenage slasher flicks like \\"Scream\\" and \\"Urban Legend\\" are not likely to enjoy this, since it is short on gore, and takes its time to tell it's tale. For those more intrigued by good story, this is a truly overlooked masterpiece that deserves more recognition. A fantastic movie!
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens has a great voice, but Angel Of Retribution is the Judas Priest we've been missing out on for so long; the Downing-Halford-Tipton song writing team delivering the classic Judas Priest metal we all love.  These guys have been main contributors when it comes to writing the book of metal and although some believe that the book was written long ago, with Angel Of Retribution Priest show us they still have something to say, and it is well worth hearing!<br /><br />The bands enthusiasm and excitement at their reunion shines through, but it is the song writing on this album that stands out and makes it a cut above both Ripper-era albums (with one exception that I'll mention last).  It is an instantly likeable album that contains elements of music recognisable from all through Priest's past albums, and has several references to albums and songs here and there in the lyrics.  This does not mean that the music sounds dated.  They combine their classic sound with just the right mix of modern sound.  This mix satisfies both fans of old and fans of their more recent albums, which is no doubt what they intended - to make all their fans happy.<br /><br />The first track \\"Judas Rising\\" is extremely intense and a perfect album opener.  \\"Deal With The Devil\\" follows it and ups the pace a bit.  This is one of my favorites.<br /><br />Track 3 \\"Revolution\\" didn't impress me as much upon the first few listens as it has bit more modern sound to it, however it quickly grew on me as there are parts of this song that sound totally Priest and now I really like it.<br /><br />Track 4 \\"Worth Fighting For\\" is another instantly likeable song, being less heavy and more radio friendly (not that anyone plays this type of music much on the radio!), but it still has punch.<br /><br />\\"Demonizer\\" is the next song and again this is a song high on intensity, sounding more like tracks from their Ripper era albums, and it has the high pitched Halford scream wailing away.<br /><br />\\"Wheels Of Fire\\" is classic Priest of old in sound again, that driving guitar and headbanging pace.<br /><br />\\"Angel\\" starts off mellow, with acoustic guitars and Halford showcasing his more mellow vocals, however it builds and the big guitars later kick in.  Yet again, this song sounds like the classic Priest of old and is another of my favorites.<br /><br />\\"Hellrider\\" is awesome.  It has the perfect mix of new and old sound, aggression, screams, riffs, another of my favorites, perhaps THE favorite.<br /><br />\\"Eulogy\\" is another mellower track and is quite short in duration.  I like it and wish it was a bit longer.  Priest have always been able to get the balance right with great mellow songs like this one and \\"Angel\\" which were sorely missing from the Ripper era albums.<br /><br />\\"Lochness\\".  Well...what can I say that hasn't been said already by other reviwers and critics?  The song is pretty bad.  You have to wonder what they were thinking when they included this one.  The lyrics are boring, the music is ok but the song just plods along and is in fact just plain tedious.  This song was a big disappointment after such an excellent first nine songs, as I was expecting a big finish.  This song just doesn't deliver it, which is quite a shame because it detracts from the album as a whole (hence 4 not 5 stars).  A good final track would probably have meant that we have a Priest album as good as or if not better than their classics from the past, instead of a very good album with a very bad song to end it.  I stop the disc after \\"Eulogy\\" as this is a good track to end the album on.  In fact, the album as a whole would have sounded better and probably got better reviews from the critics had it just been nine tracks on an album of about 40 minutes.<br /><br />The only other thing I would have liked on this album is more of the high pitched vocals from Halford.  It is there in parts, but I love it when he gets that high wail going and he doesn't do it enough for my likingon Angel Of Retribution.<br /><br />Some say this is a \\"safe\\" album for Priest, and yes it is.  It does not break any new ground, but nor does it leave you wondering why they don't play what we all love and want.  On this album Priest do deliver what we want except for Lochness but let's overlook that one.  After delivering us such great metal that we love for many years in the past we can forgive them for one \\"dud\\", especially when there is now so much promise for the future from the true Metal Gods.<br /><br />The bonus dvd is great value for the fans at about 40 minutes duration and wets the appetite to see them live.r />Some say this is a \\"safe\\" album for Priest, and yes it is.

B00005ASOI|4.0|If I were to teach class on Italian giallo I would include Dario Argento's \\"Suspiria\\" as a required viewing. Visually this film is magnificent. I saw this movie many years ago maybe 1987 or 1988. At the time I found the movie to be dull and confusing because I really didn't understand the Italian giallo, but more interested in seeing an Evil Dead or Friday the 13th kind of flick (don't get me wrong I still love those flicks). Years later, I gave Suspiria another look after seeing \\"Tenebre\\" and \\"Deep Red\\" and learning more about Argento and his style, needless to say I was very impressed. Now I am a huge Italian horror fan. The way Argento uses extreme color lighting to give scenes an almost surreal kind of look is outstanding.     This is a giallo, an Italian slasher movie. If you have never been exposed to the Italian horror films check it out. However, go in with an open mind. If all you are seeking is a teenage slice and dice bloodbath look elswhere; stick with the American films. Otherwise, I suggest you check out \\"Suspiria\\" as well as other fantastic Argento works such as \\"Deep Red\\" \\"Tenebre\\" and \\"Bird With the Crystal Plumage\\" plus many many more. Easily showing why he was dubbed \\"The Italian Hitchcock\\"
B00005A46T|5.0|This album is Slipknot's most controversial album considering the changes they did with their sound. Iowa shows head on Slipknot's anger; also their guitar strength in terms of how heavy they can be. This is not their most creative effort, but it's hosnestly, the most heaviest metal I've ever heard in my life; and, the most angry. Iowa is an album that soars with metallic riffs and dark sounds.    The intro (515), prepares you for the aggrevation and darkness up ahead.    (...)Is a metal frenzy against all of society and shows Slipknot at full fury. This is a song that shows Slipknot at their best and is my personal favorite.    Disasterpiece, probably their most creative song on the album, gives horrific screams from Corey Taylor and lots of drums from Joey Jordison. Overall a great track to listen to.    My Plague, one of their singles, is a catchy song with a great chorus. However, just to point out, the soundtrack version from Resident Evil has vocals that are completely different. Also they cut out about thrity seconds of it to avoid the parental advisory warning. This album version is definitely much better to have. A great song and one of the best on this album.    Everything Ends, another angry, agitated track that is just, heavy. A great track to listen to whenever your angry at someone.    The Heretic Anthem, an anthem that defines the metal genre, has one of the best choruses on the album, \\"If your 555, them i'm 666.\\" A song that is definitely to remember. One of the best songs on Iowa.    Gently, is one of the more mellow tracks of the album. It might seem uninteresting at first, but if you wait for it, you'll find some of the best riffs Slipknot has ever made.    Left Behind, another track that shows Slipknot at full force. Incredible heavy riffs, screams of agony, and fast drumming. One of the standout tracks on Iowa.    The Shape, a decent song, the chorus is really good. I really like how Corey screams \\"Suffering!\\"    I Am Hated, the only song whereCorey raps, well...sort of. A good, short, fast song.    New Abortion, fast and heavy. Enough said.    Metabolic, one of the weaker songs of the album. Overall not bad, has some nice effects and sounds.    Iowa, the longest song on the album. My least favorite song overall, mainly because its very repetitive.    So, if your into rock and don't have a problem with screaming vocals and hammering guitars, this is an album for you. Iowa is an album that redefines heavy....and anger.
B00069YDXU|4.0|This DVD should be owned by any music fan. I guess some people would rather have 6th generation bootlegs with bad sound than official product. Some complain without ELP DVD's or they will complain when they get them. I showed a casual fan this show and he could not understand how anyone could put this DVD down. The band gives an incredible performance! I stood up and cheered and wished this band was still around. I guess I did not get to see them live, however they blow away any band I have ever seen.I own several DVD's from ELP as well as \\"others\\" and early Seventies or late Nineties this is one great band. The sound is Great and sure the camera could be more selective on it's angles but, I would have to say when watching Hoedown, Fanfare or Knife-Edge is worth the cheap price alone. I would have easily paid 30.00 for it. But I guess some would rather pay 30.00 for a crappy boot!?! ELP Essential DVD
B00003CXGG|5.0|To me this movie was a very great one. I luved Jet Li and Aaliyah in this movie. I searched all over the net to find this movie and luckily I found it. YAY!
0393324818|4.0|When I first looked at this book, I wasn't too interested in it.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to take a chance.  The book had a few central themes.  First and foremost, it is about how statistics, when used properly, can make an organization more efficent.  Secondly, the book deals with how traditional baseball has resisted the use of statistics to make teams more efficent.  Finally, the book is a quasi-biography of how Billy Beane attempted to implement all the above.  While this may not sound too interesting, I can assure you, this book was quite entertaining and it hasn't been a bestseller for nothing.  I would recommend this book to baseball fans and non-fans alike.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Lucky for us, Trent is extremely tallented.  Results of which are a very enjoyable and listenable album.  Now I know 50 gazillian people will groan when I say the following, but I don't care about you:  Where's the next Downward Spiral?  Don't get me wrong... this album's great, but it's nothing creative, at least for NIN standards.  It could easily be the 3rd disc in The Fragile.  TR seems content with where he's at.  No more pushing the envelope.  This formula has worked, so chug chug chug here ya go.  Would I have been happier if this album sucked?  Maybe, because at least Trent would be trying.  Excellent album to listen to.  Enjoyable.  Thought provoking? Controversial?  Maybe Trent says something in these songs, but he doesn't say it in a way where I care.  Hi Trent.  Thank you for a great Pop Album.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis was definately one of the founders of rock 'n' roll. The talent in his versitility and determination makes me happy. The songs touch my heart and it makes me want to dance (which you don't want to see, I'm a pathetic dancer). I say we go into every house in America, rip out any music that isn't rock and put in this Elvis album. If we did this, everyone would realize that this is the greatest music there ever was. All music started going down hill when rap started becming popular. Rock never died, it just hid for a while, I say we need more rock bands, but it may not happen. So until that happens buy this CD and others of music like this and it may someday happen.
0684808323|5.0|I found this book to be a good read since I like reading about mob history. I always find it interesting to read about the different money making oppurtunities that they create, and in Vegas boy did they find a jackpot! Because I have read other mob books I was familiar with some of the names mentioned in the book and their backgrounds. The movie Casino has been around for 10 yrs. and I refused to watch it until I had read the book, well I rented it as soon as I finised the book and was very pleased with how the movie followed the book. It was good to have all the inside info that the book gave me as watched the movie. If you're into mob stuff I have to believe you will like this book.
B0007P3582|1.0|I waish that I could burn all rap. It's crap. To hell with it. If you like this damn stuff you're out of your mind. This is crap. There is no reason for it. They speak really fast, there's no talent required. The songs are sll about sex and getting drunk. They talk about a girl's ass and that's it. Listen to me and stay away from this and other rap CDs.
B0002J54JG|5.0|It has been thirty years since \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" was released and of all of the albums recorded by Bob Dylan it is the one that has most increased in stature simply because every album produced since then has failed to rise to this level. I think the reason for this is mainly because it was born in a creative burst of pointed lyricisim as his marriage to Sara Lowndes collapsed, with all the songs written in two months in the middle of 1974. I would no more expect any personal turmoil to provide similar inspiration any more than I would have expected any of the songs on this album to rise to the level of social rhetoric found in his greatest songs of the Sixties.<br /><br />In \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" Dylan also turned his back on his greatest backing band, returning to his artistic routes on an album that is largely acoustic-based. The songs run the emotional gamut from sorrow and regret to bitterness and pain. At the same time, despite the obvious point of origin for most of these songs, this is not an openly confessional album (cf. Courtney Love's \\"America's Sweetheart\\"). After all, we are talking the lyrics of Bob Dylan, which means cryptic riddles and allegories abound all laid out in ten classic tracks:<br /><br />\\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" is the best song on the album and the ambguity about the characters and relationships Dylan sings about has only increased over the years with the shifting lyrics in various performances. The cover version by the Indigo Girls remains my favorite Dylan cover.<br /><br />\\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" is another great four-word phrase in a song that represents the most overtly personal song on the album. The stark instrumentation only serves to highlight the heartbreak of the existentialist lyrics and the mournful sound of the vocals.<br /><br />\\"You're A Big Girl Now\\" is a ballad on the end of a relationship and a sort of benediction in that clearly the woman is right to move on, but Dylan is still haunted by their physical encounters. You would think that this would have been the logical final track for the album, but it is not.<br /><br />\\"Idiot Wind\\" is song on the album that most reminds me of an earlier Dylan composition, namely \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" the pair being a set of put-down songs. The difference is that while both song lash out in lots of directions, this one keeps coming back to a certain \\"babe.\\" This is another song that has changed over the year for various reasons that could well inspire a doctoral dissertation.<br /><br />\\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" is a rather upbeat track, despite the descending chord progressions, and is usually considered a song hopeful of reconciliation rather than one eulogizing the breakup.<br /><br />\\"Meet Me in the Morning\\" stands out musically as the most blues oriented track that always struck me as cleansing the palatte for what was coming next on the album.<br /><br />\\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" is a 8:50 story song that basically wears down the listener's insistence that this is a biographical album. It also has a line that Dylan seems to sing with nic epitch and without affection, to wit, \\"and Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.\\" Pay attention next time through to that one phrase.<br /><br />\\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\" probably represents the emotional low point of the album, with lyrics reflecting a singer who is crushed and embittered by the end of the relationship, turning his anger in on himself.<br /><br />\\"Shelter from the Storm\\" is a song of simple beauty, based on three chords and a simple melody, underscoring a profound sense of loss. The song provides an avalanche of symbols and metaphors, but actually seems to end on an optimstic note.<br /><br />\\"Buckets of Rain\\" provides a fitting finale, suitably depressing lyrics against a rather upbeat melody as irony once again abounds. After this song there is no where left to go.<br /><br />\\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is listed by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazineas the #16 record on the list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, between #15 \\"Are You Experienced?\\" by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and #17 \\"Nevermind\\" by Nirvana.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This album made me think of how much work The Beatles really did. The songs are fantastic and make you think. John Lennon's songs on here are probably some of the most thought provoking songs of all time. It's like poetry set to music. The words flow and give a distinct sense that they will be around forever. I wasn't alive when John Lennon died but I fell in love with his music. The Beatles became my favorite band of all time. If people don't buy this, they are insane.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I just recently bought this box set, and so far, I think that it's awesome.  It's nice to have the movies in widescreen, and the picture and sound transfer is amazing.  The movies really don't like they were released over twenty years ago at all, it's sweet.  As for the changes made to the movies themselves, who cares?  Sure, they aren't THE original movies, but I'm not going to whine about it like so many devoted hardcore fans of the movies have been since this set was released.  Besides, this is exactly how Lucas wanted the movies to be, so if they were really such devoted fans, they would be happy about that.  Regardless, I think the Star Wars DVD set is definitely worth buying, and the changes made to the movies aren't a big deal, so just get over them and buy it already, because it's sweet!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I've been a Green Day fan since the release of 1039 smoothed out slappy hours and I'm pleased with this latest Green Day album.  No, it's not like Dookie or Insomniac and maybe a disapointment for young fans who have just discovered Green Day and want more of what they have been recording for the past 15 years.  But for anyone to say that this album is anything less than beautiful is deaf.  Honesty is just what american music has been missing and just what Green day is spot on in reminding us of.  We are alone, we are together, we feel with one heart, we are individuals.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and GET THIS CD!!!  You'll be glad you did.
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver is an intense portrayal of a man slowly being driven mad by his isolation and loneliness.  Although Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) lives in NY, the largest city in the world, his inability to construct and maintain relationships with other people has led to insomnia and progressively towards violent insanity.  He seems to have only one friend, the Wizard (Peter Boyle), a fellow taxi driver with whom he maintains an awkwardly trusting relationship, but even that contact with another person is largely superficial and deeply flawed.  On his downward spiral, he meets Betsy (Cybill Shepard), a woman whose company gives him hope to become \\"like other people\\".  Ultimately, though, his warped personality drives her away and sends him deeper into his own personal hell. <br /> <br />Now grasping for an outlet for his violent nature, we see two sides to his personality.  On the one hand, he's a vengeful jilted man and makes an abortive attempt to strike back at Betsy by assassinating the political candidate that she works for.  On the other, he's a justice seeking vigilante who commits himself to cleaning up the sewer the city has become.  He finds Iris (Jodie Foster), a 12 year-old prostitute and acquires the weaponry to free her from \\"Sport\\" (Harvey Keitel), the man who sells her body for $15/15 minutes.  The final melee is one of the grittiest shootouts ever on film. <br /> <br />DeNiro and Scorsese have created a masterful picture.  I was completely drawn into Travis Bickle's life and his desperate sense of lonliness.  His hope of emerging from his seclusion and desperation at being unable to do so are carried in every frame.  This is a movie that will stay with you for years.
0393324818|5.0|Lewis, who previously wrote some of the best books on Wall Street's go-go '80s (Liar's Poker) and Silicon Valley's go-go '90s (The New New Thing), here turns his attention to professional baseball. Now, I should preface this by saying that I used to love baseball and these days it doesn't interest me much at all. There was a time when I was a total stats geek, I bought all the Bill James abstracts, played tabletop games, etc., but a combination of playing in college and the escalating money completely turned me off to the game. I knew this was supposed to be a good book but had no intention of reading it until Nick Hornby's rave review in his column in The Believer. I figured if one of my favorite British novelists liked the book, there must be something to it. I picked it up and within ten pages I was totally hooked.<br /><br />The basis for the book is the question of how the Oakland A's, one of baseball's poorest teams as measured by payroll, managed to win so many games in the first few years of the new millennium. Lewis's potentially boring answer revolves around inefficiencies in the market for players, but he weaves this story around the A's General Manager, Billy Beane. Now, if you have some axe to grind with Beane, you might as well not read the book, 'cause Lewis tends to be rather fawning in many places. Still, Beane's own background and mediocre career form the perfect framework upon which to build this story about evaluating baseball talent. Beane was a hugely athletic, \\"can't miss\\" prospect, who turned down a joint football/baseball scholarship from Stanford to sign with the New York Mets out of high school. His pro career turned out to be utterly undistinguished, and this disconnect is what drove him to seek new methods of scouting and evaluating baseball talent. It also helped matters that the A's new owners refused to spend any excess money, and demanded that the team be treated as a business. Beane jettisoned conventional scouting wisdom (and to a certain extent, methods), to focus on statistical indicators not widely followed inside baseball. Here, the book takes a detour into the realm of \\"sabremetrics\\" (the statistical analysis of baseball), and various attempts to arrive at more meaningful ways to calculating a player's offensive value.<br /><br />The result of developing a criteria of player valuation that was radically at odds with the prevailing wisdom of the market was that Beane was able to get the players he liked for very cheap. The rest of the book is devoted to detailing this process. Chapter 5 is probably the best, detailing how the A's orchestrated the 2002 amateur draft so that they got an inordinate amount of players they coveted for below market value. Chapters 6 and 7 discuss the loss of their three star players after the 2001 season and how managed to compensate for this. To show the Beane methodology in action during the season, the reader is taken inside several trades and roster moves. This includes a chapter on the mid-season trade for relief pitcher Ricardo Rincon, bracketed by chapters detailing Beane's pursuit of certain players who were not considered major-league material (Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford). The book ends on a valedictory note, as the A's set a record by winning 20 games in a row and other teams start to buy in to their methods.<br /><br />It should be noted that the book is far from perfect. Lewis has an unfortunately tendency for repetition when it comes to important points and themes, hammering them home, again and again. And although he does point out many of Beane's logical inconsistencies and emotional flaws, Lewis does often come across as more of an enamored fan than a strict journalist. Some critics feel that the A's success detailed in the book was based on several star players obtained the old-fashioned way, thus disproving the whole premise. However, it has to be understood that the practices detailed in the book can't really be proven to work one wayor another for another decade or so. Still the insights into challenging conventional thinking and searching for alternative data or data patterns will likely appeal to readers of Lewis' other works and are applicable far beyond baseball. And while the jury is still out, several other teams have since hired general managers with the same basic philosophy as Beane. Ultimately, it's an interesting story, and one that Lewis tells very well -- even for non baseball fans.ne way or another for another decade or so.

B00008O0WN|2.0|I liked the really dark horrible look of some of this but I was not entertained by the story or anything. It was one of the worst Star Trek movies. Too bad. Everyone seemed tired of it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Anyone that saw the play will love this DVD Version.  It's difficult to really say anything that has not already been said.  Forgive me for one subtle critique. <br /> <br />The scene where Christine first unmasks the Phantom.  The OG fails to demonstrate both the anger and the devastation at the perceived slight that I would have imagined. <br /> <br />Have to say that Carlotta was magnificent in her role.   <br /> <br />And of course, dear Christine was terrific!
B000929AJQ|3.0|First of all, I will say that it is hard to top genius.  Trent has managed to produce so many great songs in the past albiet the simplicity of some, and I respect him for his ability to truly bring awesome music into our ears.  Thank you for Hurt, March of the Pigs, the fragile, into the void, perfect drug, wish, and so much more. <br /> <br />I tried to review this album without any bias from his previous albums, but i just couldn't do it.  I seriously felt robbed.  The only decent songs that i managed to move my head to were All the Love in the World, Everyday is Exactly the Same, and Hand that Feeds.  The biggest problem with this album is that it lacked that distinct NIN edge that used to scare the hell out of the masses.  Sure the screaming is in there and the distorted guitar riffs, but the melodies and loops aren't as catchy as they were in previous albums.  Sure there are attempts to recreate some great works such as March of the Pigs, but they're not \\"making me feel better.\\"  This album is just average, even when i remove the high standards that reznor established. <br /> <br />Like I said, it was probably near impossible to beat Pretty Hate Machine, Fragile, or Downward Spiral.  But 5 years man...come on.  I have a feeling that the remix of this album (there HAS to be one) will kick so much more a$$...hopefully.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|You've got to be atleast a bit skeptical when an artist says he has enough material to put out four albums in one year.  I in fact, was skeptical.  So I purchased his first double-disk album of the year of the four to be released and have listened to it through and through and boy am I impressed.  I personally feel that there are no bad songs on this album and is best to be listened to from song one of disk one to song nine of disk two, straight through with no pauses or skips.  It's a very good album in which I'd recommend to any Ryan Adam's fan.
B00000FCBC|4.0|When i got his album, i thought it was gonna b alrite but it is actually very good, on disc 2. Disc 2 rocks. I know this isnt as good as there old stuff but hey, its pretty awesome. I mean give these guys a break. The've gone through alot and its hard to write new riffs and songs every year. Once in awhile u gotta go back to where u started. These guys didnt take this album too seriously and either shud u. Its still worth buying if u r a metallica fan. Well im out.
B000005DQR|4.0|I will keep this short, I'm into ambient, electro-jazz, trance with rich beats... basically Amon Tobin's Permutation is my all time favorite. I find this album very interesting and unique, I love free-style music and I would definitely recommend this album to anyone open-minded (even if you don't like hiphop). I would give this album 5 stars if it wasn't repetitive at certain moments and noisy in two or three of the songs. Very unique overall.
B0008ISM40|4.0|NIN-With Teeth (Halo 19) <br />Released May 3 2005 <br />Interscope Records <br /> <br />Rating: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br />The journey into despair that's name is Trent Reznor. This is what one always expects when they open the newest release from this band. Trent has always been a man of emotion that ranges from heavy hatred; to I am going to cut myself with a plastic knife. We got lucky on this long awaited project from NIN. \\"With Teeth\\" the name of the CD/DVD sums it up. Trent is back... and he is pissed. From the opening track entitled \\"All the love in the world\\" something feels better this time. Lacking in the heavy piano ballads of the previous several releases trying to recreate \\"Hurt\\" the song made even more famous as the swan song of ailing Jhonny Cash who took the song to #1 on country and rock charts all over the globe before passing away shortly after. This CD rocks!!! Sure there are occasional relapses here and there but as a whole a pissed off Trent is exactly what we needed. Keep up the therapy Trent... and we will keep buying the music.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It sadden me that some people don't know how to use the rating system, people give this album 1 star with the argument that it makes them sleep, well guess what, maybe it's supposed to make you sleep, maybe that's the kind of album this is, someone that doesn't like rap shouldn't rate a rap album low with the argument \\"I don't like rap\\". If you don't like Nora Jones for whatever the reason, it makes you sleep, you can't handle her powerful voice, your mom doesn't like it, leave it alone, why did you buy it in the first place? I bet the people that rated it low didn't even listen to this album thoroughly. <br /> <br />Nora Jones is best at what she does, her voice is absolutely superb, unique, I can't put it in words, if you're open minded about sentimental music go for it, do yourself a favor and buy this album you won't regret it, if you like Joni Mitchell I recommend this album, if you like any type of jazz you have to buy this album.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is probably the best stage musical that is an adaptation of a silent horror film starring Lon Chaney ever created, bar none!
068987474X|4.0|This was great.  It was a fun read and I think every woman should read this book.  This novel will give you the ability to look in the mirror and know that you are worth more then you ever thought you were.  I loved this book and I loved Whispers of the wicked saints.  You should read them both.
B0008ISM40|5.0|While I hesitate to say that this is Trent's BEST work, I will say that this album is one of the best releases in recent memory.<br /><br /> The reason why this album works is because it is Nine Inch Nails: Evolved. Reznor has seamlessly mixed the dark mood of The Fragile and The Downward Spiral with the more aggressive, fast paced Pretty Hate Machine. It's not so such a return to his roots as it is a revisit to the last 16 years of music Trent has put out.<br /><br />On this album you'll find Trent's pop-driven industrial side, which gave us `Only,' `The Hand that Feeds,' `All the Love in the World,\\" and `The Collector.' The darker, moody Nine Inch Nails shows through in `You Know What you Are?,' `Everyday is Exactly the Same,\\" `Getting Smaller,' `The Line Begins to blur,' `Beside you in Time,' and the album's title track `With Teeth.'<br /><br /> This is great album, and I give it my highest recommendation to old fans and new-comers.
B000006TRV|5.0|I was not much of a Pink Floyd until I listened to this record. A total work of art! The story is about a man who goes through so many problems in his life that messes him up little by little but slowly his mind starts to barricade his feelings and emotions within a wall that starts to drive the man insane. I would highly recomend this CD to others and also get it for your self. BUY IT!! Don't hesitate!
B00005MP58|5.0|I never loved an adaptation of Jane Osteen's more, actually it was my first & it made me want to see all of her work that has been done, I thing that these novels have better fill to them when there done in England, its not the same when it's a Hollywood production, its just not the same . <br />A delightful story & the cast couldn't be more perfect I can't picture Mr. Darce any other then Colin Firth, It's put so eloquently. <br /> if you love a hate love type of relationship its perfect for you, the story sins to drift on you, calmly as the developments are so subtle yet very intriguing & tingly & all. <br />Delight to watch, shouldn't be missed. <br />
B000679N96|4.0|This is the first in a series of double-disk reissues of the Cure's  Fiction/Elektra catalog by Rhino.  As is becoming a common practice with Rhino reissues, the second disk of bonus cuts includes non-LP B-sides, demos, live versions, or alternate takes of the original album.  I own the previous US edition known as Boys Don't Cry and was glad to finally see the Cure's debut album released here as it was intended to be.  The songs are not the mopy doom and gloom that the Cure's cultish fan base has embraced, but rather a collection of punk pop songs, none of which totally jumps out and screams \\"I'm a classic!\\"  In fact, the overall impression is a bit derivative of Siouxsie and other punk and post-punk bands of the same era.  I would think many of the Goths who worship at the shrine of Robert Smith would be shocked that this is the same band.  Of course, the twist here is  that it is not.  Smith has been the only constant in an ever-shifting roster of side players.  Only since the 1990's has there been a more-or-less regular membership.  It is interesting to note how the sound of the Cure has evolved from these early recordings.  My only quibble with this reissue is the omission of the controversial single, \\"Killing An Arab.\\" <br /> <br />For a record company who prides itself on reissuing past catalog albums with more-or-less complete bonus tracks, the absence of this track (recorded and released during the same period) stands out like a big flashing light.  Smith himself has gone on record defending the song that it was not meant as an anti-Arab sentiment, but rather an interpretation of an Albert Camus novel.  The track was on the US Boys Don't Cry version of the album, and is still available on the Staring at the Sea Singles Collection.  I wonder if the current state of political correctness and issues over Arabic discrimination has resulted in this omission.  It's never been one of my favorite Cure songs, but again, from a historical standpoint, the omission nowseems like censorship. <br /> <br />All of that aside, if you're a fan of the Cure, you will probably like this reissue (even with that missing track).  If you haven't yet discovered the Cure and are feeling a bit adventurous, this is the place to start and then purchase the series in order as the reissues are released (I've purchased those also as they came out at the end of April 2005). This would show the evolution of the Cure as recording artists.  If you've already got the original CD release, this would be a completist's dream.  Don't forget, the old CD releases were rush jobs to get the product in the store and the sound on them is horrible.  The sound quality here is much better than those Elektra CD's. <br /> <br />One other note: the next 3 reissues contain lyric sheets (at least for the original album tracks, but not the bonus tracks).  Three Imaginary Boys has a booklet with liner notes but no lyrics to these songs.  Perhaps they're available at the Cure's website.  Again a minor blemish to a nice reissue.
B000929AJQ|2.0|I miss old NIN. This is the first time I've actually been ashamed to blast a NIN album. Somewhere between Trent's high-pitched chanting and obnoxious dance beats I decided that NIN just wasn't hitting the spot anymore.

B000002LQR|4.0|I first got into the Chili Peppers when I heard Californication on my friends cd player when I was maybe 11 or 12. It was right when it came out. I thought, this is pretty cool. <br /> <br />About a year later, I owned all of their CDs, two shirts, and a sticker for my bass, which I had started after buying this album. My addiction to the Peppers flamed out about a year and a half ago, when I saw them live with three of my best friends, all of whom also loved these guys. <br /> <br />After I started listening to other types of music, I listened less and less to the Chili Peppers. I still have a giant amount of respect for them, and they are a great band, but from my standpoint, this albums a little long, and gets a little tiresome after the first 11 songs. You should definitely buy this album, it is true that it demonstrates the Chili Peppers at their most \\"unique\\" stage. I only wish it was a little shorter.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|If you don't have the sophistication to enjoy Andrew Lloyd Webber's amazing musical masterpiece or if you are so pretentious that you have to over-analyze every note sung by the cast, or if you are expecting to hear filthy language, see gratuitous sex or gory violence, then this film is not for you and don't bother to review it.  If you are willing to open up your mind and take it for what it is - a classic tale of love and betrayal with a gothic influence, than you won't be disappointed.   <br /> <br />  Yes it's kitchy in parts, but that's part of its nuance and makes it more interesting. Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler are not Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in their singing abilities, but they can carry a tune (and very well- I love the movie soundtrack CD) and they have the on-screen chemistry that is required to hold a movie audiences' attention.   <br /> <br />  I saw this movie 5 times in the theater and I can't decide if I kept going back because of the breathtakingly beautiful music, the powerful love story between Christine and The Phantom (Erik as he is called in the book), or because I am so intrigued by Butler and his performance. (And his looks may I add.) This man can display more emotion with just his eyes and has more acting ability with half his face hidden behind a mask, than most Hollywood actors of today can perform with their entire bodies.  He's truly remarkable and unfortunately under-rated at this point. So what that he's a \\"young and good looking\\" Phantom, as some people criticize?  That fact certainly held a lot of appeal for me.  It's because he's so young and attractive that he's a credible love interest for Christine and why I felt the movie was even more tragic in the end than the stage production. <br /> <br />  I notice that the DVD is the number 1 top seller here at Amazon this week.  The public truly appreciates a good film when they see it - the professional critics are boneheads.  My entire family loves this movie and we can't wait to get our DVD so we can enjoy it for years to come.

0316666343|5.0|What if, after your death, you could watch people on earth? Could you handle seeing your loved ones and what they are going through and see their lives go on without you? Could you just sit there and do nothing or tell no one about your killer? If you could customize your very own heaven, what would be like?  <br /> <br />For Susie Salmon, she had to be able to handle all of this, watching her family go on without her, watch her killer, and her boyfriend. Susie's heaven is like the high school she imagined going into the next year. The air in her heaven smells faintly of earth and skunk, and every evening, friendly people and dogs sign her to sleep with beautiful music. When she wants to look back down to earth, she peers over the edge of a gazebo. From here she watches her family, her friends, and her killer.  <br /> <br />Alice Sebold's, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" tells the story of the rape and murder of a fourteen year old girl. This dramatic story is told in the victim's voice, both from heaven and earth, her life's sudden end is merely the beginning of her new experience.  <br /> <br />Through Susie, Sebold has created a way to express the past, present and future, and also in a way to view life from r. both the living and the dead. I was amazed of how quickly i was drawn in to the book. This is toucheing novel to readm especially if you like suspence, drama, love, and a little bit of sadness.  <br /> <br />During the quest of Susie, she witnesses her mother wish to travel back in time to a life free of marriage and children, she watches her father struggle to maintain and hold the family together. She sees her younger sister, Lindsey live with the label, \\"the dead girl's sister\\" and experience all the feelings she has, including watching her have a boyfriend. She watches her three year old brother not realize what \\"dead\\" really means, and him stick to his fathers side no matter what. She laughs while her crazy grandmother, attempts to cheer the family with her. Susiealso watches her used-to-be boyfriend, with whom she shared only a single kiss. And last, the killer. She watches him, too, while he tries to cover up any evidence he might have left behind. <br /> <br />This novel may should depressing as of right now, but the depressing subject matter has a twist by Susie's once-in-a-life-time ability to \\"jump into\\" a girls soul and feel how she feels. She feels joy when she is remembered fondly, and she gets to feel every butterfly and tingle when her sister falls in love. Susie sometimes is seen on earth through small objects by her family and friends. <br /> <br />I would recommend, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" to anyone. The characters range from young to old, from good to evil and from heaven and earth.
B00068NVI4|5.0|This is a joke!  It's now been delayed again until August!  How about a statement from the band regarding these delays?  There aren't many of us longtime supporters of this band left..  please treat us with some respect.  If Yes and their management had any PR savvy, there would be some apology on their site, or something to appease the longtime fans who are going to buy this DVD anyway...  Just check out the track list of the upcoming live CD set, and you'll see that they've lost touch with us.  I was at the MSG show two nights before the Tsongas show, and I'm going to buy this DVD whenever it finally comes out, and I'm going to buy the live CD, and 9012Live when it's released, etc...  and all I ask in return is for the band and their management not to take my support for granted!
B000929AJQ|5.0|There will be a small but vocal group of NIN fans who will remain unhappy with this album, perhaps because Trent refuses to be as repetitively self-indulgent, wallowing in his near-suicidal darkness, as they are accustomed to. <br /> <br />To them, I offer my condolences since they will be unable to hear a great new album.  Let them stick with the old stuff and complain about their man `selling out', or encourage him to get back on addictive substances.  Trent Reznor has moved on.   <br /> <br />He has taken all of the audio experimentation, the textures, and the varied tools of his craft that he developed in the 1990s back to the strong, efficient songwriter who broke on the musical world with 1989's \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\"   <br /> <br />So this listener (for one) could not be more pleased.  Because no matter how extreme or abrasive Reznor makes himself sound, his real strength is in good songcraft--and \\"With Teeth\\" is comprised of 13 high-energy tracks, with no fat, and the kind of range in material that makes a great album experience.   From the danceability and self-deprecation of \\"Only\\" to the brutality of \\"Don't You Know What You Are?\\" he is firing on all cylinders. <br /> <br />Reznor is enough of an artist to have both an original voice and be accessible at the same time.  And when I say accessible, I >don't&lt; mean there are not parts on \\"With Teeth\\" that won't get a listener's blood pumping or put their nerves on high.  I mean accessible in the best sense--strong melodies and lyrics, and yet with enough depth to reward repeat listens. <br /> <br />It is no mistake that the last track here is \\"Right Where It Belongs\\"--while hardly a happy song, it is a definite sign that Trent Reznor has new horizons to explore, that Nine Inch Nails is evolving, and that a major talent is still major in 2005.
B0008ISM40|5.0|This album is ridiculous. I have never heard anything as cool as hearing this in 5.1. My god! The album was slithering from my speakers across my living room! Every speaker doing something different. What an accomplishment! How much do you think it will me to wire a home theatre system in my jeep? Does anyone have the number for 'Pimp my Ride'?  <br /> <br />I've only listened to the album maybe five times through so far, so I think it's premature to rate the songs compared to each other. But I think it's safe to compare the last song to every song that has ever been written. It's up there with 'Hey Jude'. A classic... <br /> <br />Trent, please come back to Jacksonville. We have a new arena that doesn't suck. We'll sell it out, I promise.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I have bought all the tune in tuesdays this year and so far  the best one is Emma Bunton - Free Me. Former Baby Spice From The Spice Girls. Now If Emma Did a Better job than 50 Cent than he's got a Problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Haha all these people saying this album was disapointing its boring blah blah blah, as you can see these people arent true fans and dont know what they are talking about i guess they would rather listen to stuff like x-factor or something. Anyways i think this album was a great comeback for iron maiden being as Bruce and Adrian came back for this one. I can listen to this cd over and over and it still does not bore me so all of you who say this album was boring can go to hell.
B000929AJQ|2.0|(I previously posted a review that focused too much on the musican and less on the actual music. This a re-write of the review that tries to focus more on the album at hand. In retrospect, I also would probably give With Teeth a 3.5 as opposed to the 2 I originaly gave it.)<br /><br />Even though With Teeth took about 6 years to complete, it is much shorter than the Fragile; which is both good and bad on all counts. It does not feature the ability to explore and allow the listener to appreciate a new sound, but it does allow the listener to enjoy an album for just being an album. Moreover, With Teeth is just an album, it is not a gargantuan creature or masterpiece like what The Fragile was. Its sound is focused in one direction. This sound is also diffidently one specific sound: Rock. Although there are some points where With Teeth tries to dive back into the world of electronic music, it quickly jumps back into the old guitar/drum combo.<br /><br />As previously mentioned, With Teeth is a short disk as opposed to 1999's The Fragile. With as much time as it took, one would have expected With Teeth to be longer... but you have to take what you can get sometimes (and as stated, Reznor had a lot left over from the recording sessions, so the next NIN album will probably not be too far off... but that is getting off subject). There are songs individually that bring the album down (as one would expect). \\"You Know What You Are?\\" comes off as almost too abrasive, as well as slightly immature with the swearword trodden chorus... hampering the value of the song. The Collector, despite it's possibly interesting concept does not seem to go anywhere and seems to fade off into the category of filler/mediocrity. Beside you in Time could obviously had more to it than a simple synthesizer line with Reznor's words layered over it, as it grows monotonous until it's eventual change up (which is sadly far towards the end of the song.) And Right Where it Belongs seems to try too hard to be Reznor's own take on John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" with it's particular usage of the lyrics. It's placement on the album also gives it a much too predictable air about it, almost trying to make itself \\"Hurt 2.0\\"... something it should not be.<br /><br />And while speaking of individual songs, let's move onto the ones that actually do make With Teeth worth listening to. The intro track \\"All the Love in the World\\" tends to sound like it might not be going anywhere at first, but as the listener hangs on, the drum beat grows to an amazing mixture of breaks, ala Piggy. The Hand That Feeds needs no description, as many listeners have already had the chance to get hooked on it's pop-rock drum beat, guitar strings and vocal chants. The title track With Teeth has a catchy industrial clench to it, as well as one of NIN's newest (and most humorous) catch phrases (\\"A-With-Teeth-Ah\\"). Only, despite it's blatant new wave sound has a certain undeniable tension to it that brings back many fond memories of past NIN. Getting Smaller allows the listener to explore NIN as it goes grunge. Sunspots (arguably the best song on the album) climbs to an epic finale as Trent uses the now signature phrase \\"Nothing can Stop Me Now\\". And \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" explores a moment that can almost be traced back to both The Fragile and Broken, taking advantage of a very heavy industrial synth along with swirling Fragile-esque guitars.<br /><br />Yes, With Teeth is simplistic, but that is probably what there is to enjoy about it. It does not go out of its way to make itself known, and it isn't as thick as a dictionary either, so you don't have to go too far to sink your fangs into it. It could have stood to be more dynamic for NIN fans hungering for a more perplexing experience, but for the most part, it is a commercial success... and a hopeful sign that NIN will stick around a little longer this time.take on John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" with it's particular usage of the lyrics.

B000929AJQ|4.0|First off let me say I think that by itself this album is nothing short of excellent. Let me also say that each NIN album has been very different and pushed the envelope in different ways, ways that often alienate hardened NIN fans AT FIRST. I honestly think this stands up (if not surpasses) all of Trent Reznor's earlier work.<br /><br />I could go on all day about what things I liked, what I didn't like, what I would have seen more of if I could, etc. But at the end we will still have this album, which is very good, listenable all the way through, and has several moments that blew me away.<br /><br />Unfortunately, or fortunately, NIN and Trent Reznor have a solid enough fanbase that every fan will purchase a copy. This means, presumably, that those fans eagerly await a new music dropping knowing that it will be an enigma to unfurl. It also means that NIN isn't actively seeking to grow or expand its fanbase in any major way.<br /><br />This record is the work of a man who is comfortable with himself, his place in the world, has nothing to prove any longer, and is happy to experiment.<br /><br />Is it worth a 5 year wait, or more appropriately does it reflect 5 years of hard work? Nope. Neither did the Fragile in my opinion, but it was nonetheless a good album.<br /><br />In short, this is a good album and a good addition to NIN's discography, but in order fir seasoned fans to enjoy it they should discard any pre-concieved notions or expectations about it and attempt to listen to it with fresh ears.
B000929AJQ|4.0|if any of you know anything about artists, they dont make their art to please you. they make it to release their feelings and express themselves. and to elaborate on what some reviewers said about this cd not being ground-breaking; have you ever seen a painter use a brush for one painting and than switch to painting with their (...). just because trent isn't doing changing his motifs, doesnt mean this isnt an intricate and wonderful cd.     now for the actual review...this is an excellent cd, i have to admit, im not a die-hard NIN fan, but i do appreciate great music. Trent is an amazing composer and this cd proves it. the songs are great, as well as the production. while your opinion may differ from mine, this does not mean it isnt a good cd. if its not your cup of tea, just leave it at that. dont bash the artist who spent 6 YEARS OF HIS LIFE recovering and putting out this music. most of these reviews just criticize the cd without even giving an explanation. thanks for reading this long review, and hopefully u understand what im trying to get across.
B000929AJQ|2.0|I've been listening to this album on leak for over a month and while there are some catchy synth/pop songs, there is nothing new here From Trent and Co. After the Downard Spiral and The Fragile \\"With Teeth\\" seems like a filler album. Much like the last Deftones album seemed just like a collection of singles mashed together, so does this record feel like there is no common theme or bond bewteen songs unless you count the traditional synth/industrial light sound of NIN. Suprisingly, Dave Grohl adds nothing to the record, unlike his turn with QOTSA. In fact \\"the hand that feeds\\" is probably his biggest contribution and its only in the sense that NIN have started writing lame rehashes like Grohl has. <br /> <br />\\"All the Love in The world\\" starts off and is a familiar track that we have heard before, but it still has a very good beat to it. The main problem is Reznor isnt breaking new ground musically or lyrically. I hate to say he is out of ideas, but this album isnt much to go by and seems like something someone could pound out in 8 weeks, much less 5 years. Even Pink Floyd didnt take 5 years to make an album and their work was 10x more complex.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|The lost highway troubadour is back with another great set of tunes, ranging from rock to folk and alt.country. It is difficult to understand how someone can be this prolific (he apparently has another two sets ready to go) and still find such engaging and tuneful ways to talk about love and life. Magnolia Mountain is an instant classic and Let It Ride is quite amazing.  <br /> <br />I don't buy this assertion that Ryan is striking back against Conor Oberst's two releases. I say forget the media hyperbole; just sit back and enjoy an artist who is quietly amassing one hell of a body of work.
0790729652|4.0|This review refers to the Warner Bros. DVD edition of the film.<br /><br />THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough, Jack Palance, Jerry Hall, Tracey Walter. Based Upon Characters Appearing in Magazines Published By DC Comics, Inc. Casting By Marion Dougherty. Score Composed By Danny Elfman. Songs Written and Performed By Prince. Based on Batman Characters Created By Bob Kane. Co-Produced By Jon Peters. Co-Produced By Peter Guber. Directed By Tim Burton. (PG-13) For Violence and Very Mild Profanity; 126m.; 1989.<br /><br />WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Latter day superhero movies (\\"Spider-Man\\", \\"Hulk\\", etc.) all owe a debt of gratitude to the one film which brought them back into the spotlight. \\"DC Comics\\" megastar Batman arrived on the silver screen with more cinematic glory than any action hero since the original Superman adventure. Director Tim Burton imbues the Dark Knight's revival with flashy fight scenes and grand comic one-liners but never avoids dealing with the heart of the matter. Both Batman and his arch-nemesis the Joker have their origins adequately explored and the viewer has the distinct feeling that they can understand where both sides are coming from. The Joker's tortured insanity is deeply rooted in the betrayal he suffered as Jack Napier while Batman's quiet suffering and need for vengeance stems from the death of his parents when he was a mere child. The two are destined to fight mano-a-mano to see whether good or evil will prevail, but it's really not their final confrontation that matters in this film. It's how we get there that counts. Along the way, we are treated to a bountiful barrage of toys from both combatants. The Joker has a few nifty items including an acid-spewing posy, a telescopic revolver, a gang of hyperbolic goons that seem to pop out of thin air and a noxious gas that leaves people smiling...whether they want to or not. Batman, on the other hand, has his Batmobile, Batwing and a few other notable BatToys to play with. We also bear witness as the BatSignal is used for the very first time. Both of the lead actors deliver key performances. Michael Keaton's droll, acerbic portrayal of Batman offsets Jack Nicholson's disturbed, slightly manic Joker perfectly. Burton also gives Jack Palance a chance to chew the scenery as mob boss Carl Grissom, and the fleshed out supporting cast benefits heavily from veteran actors Michael Gough and Pat Hingle (who would both be stalwarts of the series long after Keaton and Burton had departed). However, not all of the cast members deserve such high praise. Kim Basinger seems out of place in her role as Vicki Vale, even slightly confused about what emotional directions she should be taking her character in. At least she tries her best, unfortunately Billy Dee Williams remains unequivocally miscast as District Attorney Harvey Dent. Mercifully, Williams screen time is limited to a bare minimum. Overall, the movie has the effect of outweighing the sum of its parts, a trait that Burton's sequel (\\"Batman Returns\\") would remedy when it employed a better cast and much more stylized set pieces.<br /><br />THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: We start off this DVD with a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation which looks like it has been transferred from an old VHS copy of the film. The movie sometimes appears worn and faded while annoying spots of grain appear at regular intervals. The darkest moments of the film are the most realistic in appearance. Where this disc really shines is in its audio. A Dolby 5.1 surround sound track has been added which brings a thunderous, all encompassing buffet to the viewer's sense of sound. The car crash outside of the Monarch theater is particularly memorable as well as the Batmobile's charge through Axis Chemicals. Explosions are bright and resonate through the spine of the viewer as if they were standing right next to them. There's also a French Dolby 2.0 surround sound alongside English, French and Spanish subtitles. The subtitles are presented within the borders of the film and are clear and easy to read. Sadly, the rest of this DVD does not live up to the sparkling audio. The package itself features an emblazoned, gold and black \\"Batman\\" symbol on its front cover with a surprisingly lackluster back cover which looks absolutely terrible when compared to later entries in the \\"Batman\\" series. The inside of this atypical Warner Bros. paper case features a much better photograph from the film and also gives the thirty-one chapter stops for this two hour plus presentation. Regrettably, this is a flip disc with the widescreen version on one side and a horribly chopped pan-and-scan 1.33:1 full screen version on the other side. The paltry special features on the disc itself add up to nothing more than a few insignificant blurbs and icons. There's an extraordinarily brief section on cast and crew information. There's an informative, although not very imaginative, series of production notes. There's a \\"Film Flash\\" section which is nothing more than video covers for other films Warner Bros. recommends. All of it adds up to a tiresome affair that features none of the inventiveness of the movie itself. There's not even an original theatrical trailer to supplement the film. Granted the trailer was a meager affair, but it would still have been worthwhile to include it on such a lightweight DVD as this.<br /><br />THE YOLK'S ON YOU: As with most early release Warner Bros. DVDs, there are no hidden easter eggs. Not unless they hid them better than Bruce Wayne hides his Batcave.<br /><br />THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Please. Kim Basinger is the only form of sex appeal featured in this movie and she often times looks frumpy and unattractive. Even when she tries her best to be the sex kitten she was during her more adventurous movies, she falls miserably flat. She comes off more as a giggling schoolgirl than a sensual photo journalist.<br /><br />THE GORE REPORT: At one point during this film, the Joker spits out a pair of chattering teeth which is accompanied by some fairly lifelike blood. There's also a sequence where a mob goon becomes a little \\"hot under the collar\\" when the Joker fries him with a handheld joy buzzer. That's as close as this movie franchise will ever come to having bloodshed.<br /><br />SAY AGAIN: \\"Winged freak terrorizes. Wait'll they get a load of me.\\" - The Joker (Jack Nicholson)<br /><br />THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. Begrudgingly, I have to admit that this slight affair is worthwhile for fans of the film. While the video quality is sometimes shifty to say the least, the audio more than makes up for it. Even without special features of any worth, the DVD is still essential because the movie is such a wonderful event. There's also no new version slated for release, which makes this Warner Bros. DVD the only digital version currently available.<br /><br />PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM: \\"The Future\\" Performed By Prince. \\"Vicki Waiting\\" Performed By Prince. \\"Electric Chair\\" Performed by Prince. \\"Partyman\\" Performed By Prince. \\"Trust\\" Performed By Prince. \\"Scandalous\\" Performed By Prince. \\"Theme From a Summer Place\\" Performed By Percy Faith and His Orchestra. \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" Performed By Hill Bowen & Orchestra.

B00007AJF8|4.0|I love surrealism so I liked this movie.  It's freaky, it's wierd, people don't look like themselves and there are unexplained pieces all over it.  Puzzling bits.  Unanswered pieces. Even the puppets add weirdness.<br /><br />Craig (Cusack) is a brilliant, unrecognised puppeteer, who lives with his animal collecting wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  I have to say right off that her hair was *hideous* and gave her character a waif-like incompetent look.  She urges Craig to get a job after he gets hit by an offended dad while he's performing on the street in front of her shop.  He goes to work as a file clerk, inexplicably in offices that take up only 1/2 floor, populated by  employees who are just, well, odd- some are lechers, some think the whole world has a speech impediment and others are just wierd.<br /><br />Craig discovers a \\"tunnel\\" and follows it into John Malkovich's brain and he and his freaky co-worker Maxine (Keener) decide this provides a fantastic opportunity to make extra cash.  Like the good puppeteer he is, he needs to go further than just visiting Malkovich.  Lotte, OTOH, finds the experience overpowering and overwhelming, with some interesting side effects in her relationship with the freaky Maxine.<br /><br />I was uncomfortable with the scenes when Craig put Lotte in the cage- other people who are appalled by domestic violence will find that unamusing as well.  Of course, people appalled by same sex couples will have issues with the evolution of Maxine and Lotte's relationship.<br /><br />As and actor, John Malkovich has always fascinated me.  Some other reviewers- who didn't like the movie- wondered why he would \\"lower\\" himself to the level of this movie.  I, OTOH, would see it as a wonderful opportunity.  How many actors get the opportunity to play themselves, yet, not really themselves?  To be in a scene where every single character is *themself*?  eeek!  Hard to imagine what that would be like!<br /><br />The whole entering-through-the-portal-and-living-forever aspect was left largely unexplored- or unexplained.  We, the mere viewers, will just have to wonder about all those people who went into the tube and congregated together- for how long?  and how many people were in each of *them*?  *shudder*<br /><br />The puppetry is amazing.  Anyone interested in puppets needs to see this movie- they need to *buy* it to support the art of puppetry.<br /><br />The interview with Spike Jonze is priceless but raises more questions than it answers.  ***evil laugh***ft largely unexplored- or unexplained.

B000002G26|5.0|I'll always enjoy listening to this album. It's got everything Bryan Adams had to offer; great fun-loving Pop/Rock. I love the guitars; amazing solos, memorable chords, and Bryan Adams' awesome voice; music that expresses love and just love.
0394827996|4.0|An email friend used the term \\"self consensus\\" to describe the process by which we start with a known person- ourselves- and move in small steps away from that to construct our image of another person we know via email.  This book is a good illustration of that idea.<br /><br />The story is about a minnow and a tadpole.  They look alike, so they must be alike, right?  The frog wakes up to having grown legs and the fish is astounded- this cannot be!  They are both fish!  Time goes on and the fish grows into a larger fish and the tadpole into a frog.  Finally the frog is able to leave the pond, but eventually he returns to tell his old friend about the world.  The fish pictures the birds as colorful fish with wings, the cow as a hilarious furry fish with horns and udders and the people as fish in clothing with hair.  Of course the fish wants to see these amazing things so he jumps out, only to discover that he really needs to be in his cool, watery element to survive.<br /><br />The illustrations are fairly simple colored pencil drawings- at least until we get to the creatures outside the pond.  My children found the \\"birds\\" interesting, but the cow and the humans had them in stitches.  They found those critters to be some of the funniest things they can imagine- and my 8 yo was able to understand and articulate that we base our assumptions on what we already know and understand.  A pretty good lesson for kids to learn, IMO, as well as a sweet story of friendship between two very different creatures.
B0000062GK|5.0|I don't quite recall how I got introduced to Joe Satriani's music, but I do know that the music from this album was the first music I heard from him. If you want to introduce someone to the wizardry that is Joe Satriana, I think this is the album to start them off with. It's accessible, with nary a weak track of the bunch (except maybe Z.Z's Song, but I don't like that one because when I listen to this album, I wanna rock and not chill). My fave songs are Ceremony, Up in the Sky and the title track.
B000062XGD|5.0|Oddly enough, I had to get over the hump of thinking \\"a guy is on an island by himself with a vollyball.  How interesting can that be?\\" before I could watch \\"Cast Away\\".  Yes, I knew it was a silly thought - after all, it was Tom Hanks playing that guy, and being alone on an island for years is rarely a holiday.<br /><br />At the beginning, Chuck (Tom Hanks) is a very motivated FedEx systems manager who is very invested in making sure the international offices are up to speed on the philosophy of the company.  He travels often, in a cargo plane,  but is very dedicated to his PhD candidate girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) back in Memphis, the FedEx hub.  Around Christmas he returns from Russia and joins Kelly's family for a close, friendly Christmas dinner, but then gets called to a location past the South Pacific.  Immediately before boarding that flight he gives Kelly a box which we assume has an engagement ring and he tells her, \\"I'll be right back\\".<br /><br />Then they hit a storm, head off course and the plane has an explosion.  To my claustrophobic eye, the plane crash is horrific and Chuck almost doesn't make it away from the sinking plane on his lifeboat.  *shudder*  Luckily, he and his lifeboat, nothing else, wash ashore on a tiny island just shortly after, sparing us scenes of desperate survival on the open sea before he hits land.<br /><br />Chuck manages to figure out how to get water, crack coconuts, make fire, spearfish and devise a buddy, Wilson.  He has next to nothing- just the raft, his clothes, the contents of the very few FedEx boxes that float ashore, and an heirloom pocketwatch given him by Kelly for Christmas, with her picture inside.  Four years- (FOUR years!) later, he is lean, with toughened feet and a longstanding relationship with Wilson, a hunk of a porta-potty wall washes ashore and he has what he needs to make his escape.  He and Wilson build a raft and set off to wherever the wind takes them.<br /><br />Other reviewers have included a spoiler on his relationship with Kelly- skip this if you don't know about that yet-  Of course Craig has high hopes for seeing Kelly since she is how he kept himself alive during his isolation.  But four years is a long time when others are trying to convince you someone is dead, and she eventually caved in and married their dentist.  It's quickly apparent that she still loves him, but he believes she needs to let go of him then- he says he is \\"happy she was with him on the island\\" and acknowledges her picture and memory were important to his survival.  He contemplates that he doesn't know what the tide might drag in- a reference to his porta-potty sail- and he feels it's important to move on with his life.  I'm not sure I agree, but at the same time, I can understand why someone would be unwilling to cause of breaking up Kelly's family.<br /><br />The commentary on the second disk is interesting- the directors and screenwriters hired experts in stone age living and one of them spent some time living alone on the Baja where he made shelter, learned to catch food, learned to make fire, etc, in order to authentically write the the script for Chuck's survival.  The idea for \\"Wilson\\" came from that experience and it was their belief that a figure like that would be crucial to keeping a person sane during a solitary trial.

This film can provide lots of good food for thought on sleepless nights, but preferably not on the over the water portion of international flights.included a spoiler on his relationship with Kelly- skip this if you don't know about that yet-  Of course Craig has high hopes for seeing Kelly since she is how he kept himself alive during his isolation.  But four years is a long time when others are trying to convince you someone is dead, and she eventually caved in and married their dentist.  It's quickly apparent that she still loves him, but he believes she needs to let go of him then- he says he is \\"happy she was with him on the island\\" and acknowledges her picture and memory were important to his survival.   He contemplates that he doesn't know what the tide might drag in- a reference to his porta-potty sail- and he feels it's important to move on with his life.  I'm not sure I agree, but at the same time, I can understand why someone would be unwilling to cause of breaking up Kelly's family. <br /> <br />The commentary on the second disk is interesting- the directors and screenwriters hired experts in stone age living and one of them spent some time living alone on the Baja where he made shelter, learned to catch food, learned to make fire, etc, in order to authentically write the the script for Chuck's survival.  The idea for \\"Wilson\\" came from that experience and it was their belief that a figure like that would be crucial to keeping a person sane during a solitary trial.  I haven't decided if that would be true for me though. <br /> <br />It's fascinating to contemplate how we would do in a situation like that.

B000929AJQ|3.0|It seems that as Trent Reznor spent the past 4+ years working on this album to make a new sound, others have beaten him to the punch. With the first single being \\"The Hands That Feeds\\" sounding more like the new \\"disco rock pop\\" sound of that known from other bands like The Killers and The Bravery. Thankfully, it is the only track that has that vibe to it. <br /> <br />With regards to the other tracks, it seems that Trent, for the passed couple of years, has been listening to Massive Attack, Unkle, Portishead all on one side of his headphone and Skinny Puppy, Ohgr, Minsitry on the other side. He tries to combine the genres, but seems to fall flat with the songs not mixing as well as they should. Think about it, Pretty Hate Machine is a great example of Alt-Pop rock of the late 80's, Broken is a great anti-Grunge album due to him being more pissed off than any of the others can be, The Downward Spiral is a great example of modern industrial and The Fragile is a great concept album that got over shadowed by Radiohead. All the other albums have one thing in common, all the tracks seemed to go with each other. <br /> <br />With Teeth is more disconjointed than anything else. As I said before, some tracks have a great down-tempo/trip hop feel, while others feel a true industrial. This album would have been great if Reznor choose a genre and stuck to it. Funny enough, the down-tempo/trip hop stuff sounds and feels a lot better than the other tracks, with the stand out tracks being \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" \\"All the Love in the World\\" \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" and \\"Besides You in Time.\\"  <br /> <br />One final note, it seems that Reznor also listend to the tribute albums because \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" has a very similar piano riff to \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\" off of one of the tribute tracks.
B0000009SG|5.0|This is definally a album potheads will enjoy. Very weird, but funny lyrics. Is this his best album? No way but it still is a must have for the Frank Zappa fan. He attacks commercialism with 'I'm The Slime' He's talking about some girl he 'you know' in Dinah-Moe Humm. Raising Dental floss in 'Montana' I like how he used a typical rock signer in Fifty-Fifty and made fun of the signing style. The most famous and successful song off this album is definally Dirty Love which is a good song I think. The title alone explains what it is about. <br />   People will complain the songs don't make sence, but the weirdness of the subject matter is what makes it great. <br />    Again, the clips alone cannot give you a true sence of the album. Make a gamble and get the album. <br />
0375703764|3.0|This is a good book, but I got bogged down. I enjoyed all the stories within the story, especially the letters by the narrator's mother. I just needed to take a break from it once in awhile, to come back to it after reading some other things.
B000002HRE|2.0|Probably what the album should of been called. The last decent album was the Black Album, Load was alright. This one was a dud. Only a couple of songs that really showed any origionality. They go for the classic rock feel, which is fine, but they suck at it. The one thing I will give them is trying to be different, but there doing it in a mainstream way, which is not different. When this album came out I kissed goodbye to the Master of Puppets days. <br />   Kirt Hammet's solos have always been uninspiring, but there even uninspiring to fans of metallica on this album, which is alot to say. Hetfield grabs E F E F by the throat and really doesn't come up with but a couple of new interesting riffs. Lars, is, well, hitting the drum as he always had. The bass player is alright, but no Cliff Burton is he.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Six years have passed since the last `proper' Nine Inch Nails album and now Trent Reznor returns with a new album `With Teeth'. Reznor had said before the album's release that it would be a collection of individual songs rather than a set based on a concurrent theme and on listening to `With Teeth' that certainly seems to be the case. A good or bad thing? In my opinion I prefer the approach taken to `The Downward Spiral' and `The Fragile' but that's not to say that this offering is in any way unworthy of being placed alongside any of NIN's other works. <br /> <br />After the massive [occasionally overblown] `The Fragile' Reznor has seriously stripped down the new NIN sound for `With Teeth'. The guitar sounds haven't changed much and the drumming on `With Teeth' is all live [courtesy of Jerome Dillon and Dave Grohl]; it's the extensive use of analogue keyboards that is the biggest change in the current NIN sound. For the most part the new approach works but occasionally [`Only'] it makes NIN sound like a bazillion other electro acts. <br /> <br />With the exception of `Pretty Hate Machine', `With Teeth' is more commercial than any of NIN's previous releases. It is more accessible than either of the last two albums [not counting `Still'] but that's not to say it is a totally mainstream release. The single `The Hand That Feeds' is certainly very radio-friendly and the same could be said of `Every Day Is Exactly The Same', `Sunspots' and the next single, `Only' - but are they any more commercial than `Head Like A Hole', or indeed anything from `Pretty Hate Machine'? While some may bemoan the accessibility of those tracks there is also stuff like `The Collector', `You Know What You Are?' and the magnificent `The Line Begins To Blur' [my personal favourite track] which can sit comfortably alongside past NIN material. The opening track `All The Love In The World' is also excellent and sounds a lot like Radiohead during their `Kid A' phase [a good or bad thing depending onhow much you like Radiohead!] until it's almost joyous outro. Overall the actual tunes on `With Teeth' are excellent and are proof that Trent Reznor hasn't lost the ability to write great music. <br /> <br />But no album is perfect and `With Teeth' certainly has it's problems - mostly lyrically. It does sound like Trent has struggled with some of the lyrics this time round and has re-used a lot of lines and themes. `Nothing can stop me now' and `a tiny little duck' re-surface here and themes such as `fading away' and `getting to the other side' are very reminiscent of older NIN material. Also the rhymes in certain songs seem very forced - the title track [the worst song on the album] being a good example. There's also a direct rip-off of a lyric from Pere Ubu's `Navvy' on `Getting Smaller' [`I've got these arms flip-flop-flip']. Reznor has mentioned liking Pere Ubu so maybe this was meant as homage. <br /> <br />The lyrical niggles do not detract from what is great return from Trent Reznor. `With Teeth' is as different to `The Fragile' as that album was to `The Downward Spiral'. The Nine Inch Nails sound is constantly evolving with every album without losing NIN's identity which can only be a good thing.  Now for the Zenith de Paris...
B00002Z88D|3.0|I can't totally diss this cd, because the orchestra was very good. great musicians. The only musicians that weren't good were these 4 guys I need not mention there name. <br />    They had alright stuff in the past but why bring mediocre musicians to talented, berekley trained musicians. If there is one good thing about this album it shows how much greater there music vocabulary is than Metallica's. I think they should  of quit after the black album, so this is a dud. <br />   A couple of the songs were ok, but the clashing of two different styles did not go well. It literally sounds like a bunch of noise when you add two genres together. It might of work if metaliica was made up of talented musicians, not egomaniacs.
B0008ISM40|5.0|<br />I will come back and edit this review later to be more comprehensive, right now I'm too busy enjoying listening to it!  <br /> <br />Go out and grab this album - it's got everything...amazing piano melodies, dance beats, great drumming, guitar assaults and all the emotion NIN has come to be known for!  <br /> <br />It's a great time all around - best tracks:  <br />All The Love In The World, Everyday Is Exactly The Same, Only, Sunspots, Beside You In Time, Right Where It Belongs
B0000009SI|4.0|Not that there is anything wrong with this album, but besides a greatest hits type of thing this is what would be good for a person who wants to check out Zappa. It's only a skim but it will let you know if your interested in his other cd's or not. <br />   Another thing, many will critizize him and saying he's over rated, he's a shi**** songwriter, etc. However, there is a depth to it and he's very much a cult act. Definally not commerical. <br />   People with deep music appriciation (and a sence of humor) should appriciate the album. His most famous hit, 'Don't eat that Yellow Snow' is on this cd. This probably is one of his best selling works. <br />  I must warn you the sound clips certainly are not enough to get a true sence of the album.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|Can I just say that \\"Look what you've done\\" rips off the lyrics of the Beatles' \\"Sexy Sadie\\" and the melody and style of Oasis' \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" and Fastball's \\"Out Of My Head.\\"  This band is fake.
B00003CXB6|1.0|There's a lot I could say about this film, but I'll try to be brief. \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" basically copies the same exact formula that made the first one a hit, except it takes place on a much larger scale. The film is about a league of scientists that are sent on another expedition through Jurrasic Park to only confront more dangerous dinosaurs and poachers hunting the prehistoric reptiles. This film is just drenched in cliches and bad character development. However, the film does cover another aspect that wasn't covered that well in the last film. It covers the possibility of how mankind's greed, over the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, can ultimately lead to doom and death for the human race.
B00000K3CM|5.0|I own all of the Home Alone movies on dvd, and the 2nd is by far the best. #1 is not funny enough, and #3 doesn't have Macaulay Culkin in it. The scene where we see the bandits for the first time is my favorite. I wonder, how could the \\"Fish\\" scene be done without everybody laughing their heads off? In all, it's the best in the series.
B0009H1CKG|5.0|It's about time that we P-Funkheads, maggots & Funk-ah-tears <br />get a real dvd from Georgie & the p-funkmob. <br />This is the BOMB yo...~!
B00003CXBH|5.0|Thanks Mr. Lannig for allow us class time to view this amazing movie. It has great moral meaning, lessons taught by this film are innumerable. \\"Forgiveness\\"...Well all and all this was a great movie highly recommened for jsut about anyone.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Maybe I feel that way because this was the first time I had read a Potter book before actually seeing the movie, but I feel it strayed a bit too far from the written material.<br /><br />First & foremost, WHY has the character of Ronald Weasley been reduced to comic relief?? Rupert Grint seems to be growing quite well as an actor, yet he was hardly given anything to do in this movie other than make funny faces & spout one-liners from time to time.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue was so outright BAD it's almost laughable. That whole \\"Like trying to catch smoke\\" (or whatever) line given by the quite bad child actor for instance. The scene where Harry's crying after finding out about Sirius \\"betraying\\" his parents was just as bad. Daniel Radcliffe should NOT fake crying again, he sounded like a squeaking mouse. Also, Draco calling Hermione a mudblood again....we know he's a bad guy, no need to rehash stuff that wasn't even in the book.<br /><br />I also have to express my disappointment in Emma Watson....she's just not a good actress. Ever since the first movie I felt almost everyone else stood head & shoulders above her. Her delivery can get a bit monotone at times, or she can over act to extremes (Yelling at Lupin about being a werewolf, for instance). It seems like she hasn't been able to find the right balance to her acting. One can only hope she tries a bit harder in the next film.<br /><br />And WHY wasn't the scene where Snape went completely bananas over Black escaping put into the movie???? Do the filmmakers realize how enjoyable it would've been to see this ice-cold, fairly non-emotional character pitch the mother of all temper tantrums?<br /><br />Then there's the absolute biggest mistake-leaving out the origins of the Marauder's Map and the backstory of the friendship between the Marauders while at Hogwarts. That piece of information isn't just something you can toss aside and think nobody will notice, it's critical to the storyline! For instance, Lupin obviously knew the it was the map he took from Harry when he got caught by Snape. So why didn't he ask Lupin how he knew it was a map & knew how to work it? Leaving out what was a HUGE reveal in the book took much of the heart away from the film.<br /><br />On the DVD there's an interview w/JK Rowling & Alfonso Cuaron in which she says she believes the book and the director were made for each other this time out. With all due respect, I have to disagree completely. POA was a huge step backwards from the first two films. One can only hope that if GOF is indeed the last movie that gets made, it'll leave a better taste behind than this mess.ook from Harry when he got caught by Snape.

6305558167|4.0|I've long been an Arthur fan - enjoying his many incarnations thru-out literature and film - except for \\"First Knight\\" some crappy movie Farrah Fawlcetts and to some degree the recent \\"King Arthur\\".<br /><br />Boorman really captures the spirit of Arthur as he was depicted at the height of the Middle Ages rather than the Celtic warlord he might have really been.<br /><br />The acting is welldone particulary with Merlin and Arthur. The soundtrack was superb. Too often films including fantasy or sci-fi rely on modern soundtracks and horribly date a film - anybody cringe when they hear the soundtrack to \\"Lady Hawk?\\"<br /><br />I've seen this film a dozen times and could easily watch it again.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I know a fair bit about Greek mythology and literature, and have an affection for it, but I still enjoyed this film, even though it took extreme liberties with the story AND characters.  The story the filmmakers chose to tell was exciting and the fight scenes were very good.  The sight of 1000 ships nearing Troy was terrific.<br /><br />Pros:  Brad Pitt and Eric Bana were terrific as Achilles and Hector, and they lead an extremely talented cast.  The cablecam shots were very well done, and I enjoyed the music a lot.<br /><br />Cons:  Orlando Bloom and the actress who played Helen were the weak links.  I never felt a chemistry between them, let alone a passion that would justify all those people dying, and Helen did not have a face that would launch a thousand ships.<br /><br />Extras include a Gallery of the Gods, about the Greek gods (though they were eliminated from the film), and three featurettes about special effects, battle sequences and sets.<br /><br />Worth seeing unless you're a purist -- then it would make you crazy.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I have been a fan since day one. I've listened to the reviews out there that have bashed past NIN albums. The only thing I can say is Trent Reznor is a genius. He has managed to work thru the industry changes though out time and in my eyes has produced some of the most moving and inspiring music of our time. This album is nothing short of perfection. I love anything Trent puts his hands on but will be the first to say if it is good or flawed. This latest album was put together after a 6 year silence and shows that it has been time well spent. It is so well written and produced. Trent has proven again that our declining music industry can be jump started with the wonderful NIN sound. Please buy this album and enjoy every single second of it. All the past NIN albums are great in their own ways and this is one to add to the collection. Please Trent keep producing the most inspiring music out there. When I listen to NIN music I can't help but tear up with emotion. Sincerly your #1 fan!! <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|4.0|I got this movie on PPV but it would of been great at the cinema or HDTV.<br /><br />It has a great story! The Disators are the best you will see in a movie before 2004. The twisters are better then the ones in Twister. The tidel wave in New York will blow you away!<br /><br />The politics of it are off because of the vice-president. Other then that the movie is great!
0380778556|5.0|yippee!!<br /><br />I loved this book.. a pageturner thru and thru..<br /><br />the mystery of Rebecca and the mystery of Manderlay are tantalizing to say the least..<br /><br />that's all I'm going to say... because I want you to experience it as I did... as a virgin
B000929AJQ|5.0|For the reigning king of industrial (and perhaps the last one in the whole kingdom) I really didn't expect such a listenable album.  This one does remind me more than a little of Pretty Hate Machine and this is good for the most part.  Near bouncy in execution (only, love is not enough).<br /><br />I like Trent's attempt to write self-contained songs rather than long winded droning concept pieces that irritated me with parts of Fragile (much beloved by his fans, but really could have been reduced to one great CD).<br /><br />The real people playing drums adds much to these pieces.<br /><br />His lyrics border on parody though and don't really ring as honestly twisted as they used to and then when his last song has some derivative of \\"What if this is all a dream?\\" you just sort of smirk and nod.  Right, Trent.<br /><br />But Trent's a survivor, you gotta give him credit for that (but then again, what kind of message is that for screwed-up fourteen year olds who feel alone and angry at the world as they plug their IPODS into their laptops in the solitude of their rooms?)
B000929AJQ|5.0|One thing always hits me when reading reviews. . .people constantly compare new albums to old albums.  I don't know whether it's my ADD or an inability to give creedence to the rehashing of the same sound over and over again, but I crave innovation and evolution.   <br /> <br />Not a second is wasted on this album.  In fact this is the only new album I have purchased recently, besides The Mars Volta's \\"Francis The Mute\\", that I have been able to put in and play continuously from beginning to end. <br /> <br />Finally, \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" is the perfect closer and quite possibly one of the best NIN songs. <br /> <br />Peace, I'm out.
B0008ISM40|2.0|Hi. My name is Ben Dugan and I loved \\"The Fragile\\". <br />Phew, there I got that outta way. So let's talk about the five and a half years in the making \\"With Teeth\\". <br />Let's be perfectly honest with each other, no lies or any false hopes or any of that hogwash: \\"With Teeth\\" isn't very good. I'm saying this with a geavy heart because there was nothing more I wanted then to this be a great record, the next stage of evolution from one of the few bands I still listen to after the crumbling of the ninties. Sadly, this was not the case. <br />Now I am not saying that \\"With Teeth\\" is unrepentingly awful. There are a handful of good songs, the Gary Numen-esque \\"Only\\", the lead off track \\"All The Love In this World\\", the first single \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" and the great final track \\"Right Where It Belongs\\". <br />But the problem here is that these songs just feel lazy, and when Reznor sneaks up on what seems to be a good song, most notably on the title track \\"With Teeth\\", he ruins it. Tracks like \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" and \\"The Collector\\" are buried underneath layers of sludge that do to little to help distinguish the songs(this is a big problem with the middle section of the C.D.: every song sounds just alike.) <br />Another problem is the lyrics. I've never believed Reznor to be a poet, but the lyrics usually went along with music just right so you really didn't care what he was saying, but how he was saying it. But this time around he just sounds dumb. The guy is nearly forty but still writes about the same things he did when he twenty five, except now there is little to no conviction in his words, and I found it hard not to 1)roll my eyes, and 2)laugh hysterically at certain parts. <br />Now I'm not telling you that \\"With Teeth\\" is a bad record. The Cure's \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" was a bad record. \\"With Teeth\\" just isn't a very good record. It's dull and tiring, monotonous and for a good five to six song stretch boring. It doesn't live up to any of Reznor's previous catalog, or really doesn't even belong in the same ballpark. <br />Oh well, at least I got the back catalog, right? <br />NOTE: The DualDisc content is really quite worthless. The record quality sounds pretty good in the DVD surround, but the record itself still isn't great. The video for \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" looks no better than it does on MTV and the interactive discography is pretty worthless for any semi-NIN fan, so I would just recommend that you still with the standard C.D.
B00005JNRB|2.0|This film is combination Raiders of the Lost Ark meets Outbreak. I really believed the Raider's storyline was really more interesting than the Outbreak storyline; however, most of the film deals with the epidemic of industrial pollution occurring in Africa and leaves the ironclad storyline for fluff and filler.    The movie features Matthew McConaughey (Dirk Pitt) and Steve Zahn (Al Giordino) as a couple of ex-navy seals turned fortune hunters working for William H. Macy, who we can only assume was their former commander (Admiral Jim Sandecker). Thrown into the mix are Penlope Cruz (Eva Rojas) and Glynn Turman (Dr. Frank Hopper) as a couple World Health Organization (WHO) medical doctors.    Dirk Pitt has been in search of an elusive ironclad, which supposedly transverse the Atlantic Ocean some 150 years prior, at the time of the Civil War. Every time Pitt's endeavors bring him to Africa, it rekindles his desire to find this monumental discovery.     While traveling up the Euphrates, Dirk and Al are met with opposition; and immediately Dirk determines it's because they were traveling with the two WHO doctors. Equipped with only a camel and his trusty cohort AL, Dirk Pitt changes his desires of finding his intangible watercraft to locating, helping, and rescuing the medical team.    Again, of the two storylines, the search for the Civil War ship seemed much more intriguing; however, the solar powered waste disposal plant was interesting to look at. This was not a great film by any means, but it was moderately appeasing. Worth the price of a video rental; however, not a penny more.    (...)
1400032717|5.0|This book the curious incident of the dog in the night-time about Christopher, autistic fifteen year old, decides to investigate the murder of a neighbor's dog and uncovers secret information about his mother.  The book is fiction story written by Mark Haddon.   <br /> <br />People have different way to live their life.  When you read this book you will know what is unusual and unique of thinking.  The story is Christopher's family that what happened to them.  The family brake up because of Christopher.  But later they realize how much they love Christopher.  The most I liked that Christopher's the way of thinking.  There are some difficult part which is math and science.  It was too detail explains but if you like that you can enjoy or you can skip that part.  It's easy to read from children to adult.  It's very clear and simple sentences because written by fifteen year old boy.  I believe you will enjoy the book.    <br />
B0008ISM40|4.0|I've only listened to the album about... 4 times all the way through. <br /> <br />Interscope's official NIN myspace page had the album up for listening about a week before release, so some of us had the chance to check it out early. <br /> <br />Let me just say right now, you definately need the DualDisc version. Make sure you've got a well-tuned 5.1 surround system and let 'er rip! I'm listening to it in my computer room right now, and let me tell you, *this* is how music was meant to be heard. <br /> <br />Anyways, the album: <br />This definately sounds like a progression from The Fragile. It's got that \\"live\\" feel to it, despite the presence of drum loops, etc. When I first heard \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" on the radio, I got really worried that Reznor had stopped experimenting, as THTF was a very by-the-book industrial song with about 4 lines of lyrics and nothing particularly stand-out-ish about it. <br /> <br />I'm glad to say that even that song sounds *much* better in context on the album. The only song I really haven't liked is Track 2, You Know What You Are? It just seems to be noise, which, coming from NIN seems to be expected, but the thing about NIN's noise was... it always had a heavy hook to it. Listen to Broken's Wish, or Downward Spiral's Big Man With A Gun. This one seems to be directionless. But then again, one of my friends likes the song for that exact reason. So, I guess it's in the ear of the beholder. <br /> <br />Two notes: <br />1) As I said, you DEFINATELY want the DualDisc version <br />2) There's no content inside the case. None. No booklet, nothing. For booklet info and whatnot, go to [...] <br /> <br />It'll be interesting to hear what the remix album that I'm sure they will release will sound like. Hope there's a DualDisc of that too.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw this on stage and simply fell in love with Phantom.  I loved everything from the music, the acting, the sadness that the storyline envelopes you in.  I really did not expect a movie to do this wonderful masterpiece by Andrew Lloyd Webber justice.  I was wrong.  The acting, the sound, the music, the orchestra, the stage, the lighting...everything was like I was watching from my seat in the theater.<br /><br />If you are a Phantom phan..you will love fall in love with this adaptation.  Get your Kleenex box handy...you are going to need it.
B000929AJQ|5.0|disapionted at first but after a couple of listens it grew in me now i like it but i thought Trent could have don it better <br /> <br />anyways my fave track has to be Everyday Is Exactly the same <br />great tune <br /> <br />NIN!
0553260111|4.0|I read this book because I really liked the movie, only to be completely blown away!  This book only slightly resembles the movie in that the main charachter (Jason Bourne) had amnesia, met Marie St. Jaques and there is a top secret government project, and he is considered a lethal mistake.  He must be killed. <br /> <br />It is abot a man that looses all his memory and through the help of a slightly insaine and drunk doctor learns enough to embark into the world knowing only that he is an expert with firearms, and has had plastic surgery. <br /> <br />This action packed book leads the reader through the adventure of finding out who Jason bourne is.  It involves assasins, top secret US government plots and international conspiracies.  Overall a very exciting read.  Anyone that liked this movie would probably like this book better.  One of the better books I have read.
1400032717|4.0|The curious incident of the dog in the night-time<br /><br />  \\"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" by Mark Haddon is a wonderful novel I have ever read.  I think this book tells us what is the important things for each person's life, so I consider what is a happiness in my life through this book.<br /><br />  The book starts from the dead dog which is killed by someone with a garden fork and Christopher who is a main character in this book tries to detect \\"Who killed the dog?\\"  The writing style in this book is very unique because Christopher is writing a murder mystery novel about this dead dog in it.  So We can see his thinking, what he likes and dislikes and what he is interested in or not in his novel.  It is a very interesting part, because his thinking and interests are very different way from other people and I feel like I could peep his mind through Christopher's novel.  He has an uncommonly math skills and he likes numbers, computer, and Galaxy etc...This part makes me confused because he wrote about his interests over 2 or 3 pages and it doesn't connect with main story sometimes.  But his expression is very funny .  He describes exactly a thing people don't care about it. He describes his age like \\"I'm 15 years and 3 months and 2 days old.\\".  This is the way he expresses about numbers.<br /><br />  When I read the beginning of this book, I thought  this book is a mystery novel about only the dead dog.  But it's also a human drama about people surrounding Christopher.  So I could consider to put myself in their place.  It is a very good things people can think about other person's situation.  My favorite part is Christopher tries to do many things which he doesn't like and he gets confidence more than before.  I could feel Christopher grew up mentally the end of this book and I could get a power from Christopher .  And I also learn many things from him.<br /><br />  I recommend this book for everyone  and I think I would like to read this book one more time.

1400032717|4.0|Review of \\"The Curious Incident of The Dog in the Night-Time\\"  <br /> <br />\\"The Curious Incident of The Dog in The Night-Time\\"is the first English book I've ever read through. <br />I'd tried to read some English books before but I couldn't finish them, because it was hard to read until I would be interested in the story. However I was interested in this book just after reading the first 7 pages, and whenever I read more pages, it fascinated me more and more. <br />This book was written by Mark Haddon. <br />He pretends Christopher in this book, who is the main character of this book. <br />So, when you start reading this book, you'll know that it was written by Christopher who is 15 years old very unique person. <br />One day Christopher found that his favorite dog having lived in neighbor's killed cruelly. He started to investigate the murder and decided to write a book about   this incident with the advice from one of his few reliable person. Actually, he doesn't trust people easily. <br />Who killed the dog?  <br />Soon, you are going to fall into the Christopher's world.  His idea and view are very unique and those are very far from other people's. <br />This is a fiction, however I feel it to be realistic, because it's not a very happy-ending nor sad-ending story. That helps us to think about the people who are like Christopher in the real world. I absolutely like happy-ending story though, I like to read this book. Because we can imagine or make the Christopher's future with our imaginations after finishing this book, which is more interesting.  <br />Sadly to say, humans are so clever that we tend to criticize, deny or destroy the other's sense of value. <br />Everybody has it's own happiness, some people hope to have similar happiness or dream but others are not. As long as it doesn't trouble or hurt other people, we don't have any right to take that away from other people or destroy them. <br />After reading this book, I realized that it's difficult but tolerance is very important in the human society. <br />I recommend this book to the people who like the movie \\"Rainman\\", and the people who like to know and accept the different view from yours. <br />I'd like you to enjoy this book and Christopher's world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000047D5|5.0|There is no point in criticizing an album for being what it is not, apparently, intended to be. When Oscar Peterson and his bandmates did their take on West Side Story, it was serious work. Part of it I liked, part of it I didn't, but at least he was thinking about how to put those songs in a dramatically new light.  <br /> <br />We Get Requests, on the other hand, is mostly well-executed fluff. I can picture sixties exectives and their wives together in their penthouse apartments, putting on this album -- to show their exquisite taste, of course -- and ordering Jeeves to bring another round of martinis. Of course, they wouldn't really be listening to the music -- it would be a pleasant tinkling in the background, an element of the carefully planned atmosphere.  <br /> <br />Part of Oscar Peterson's problem was that he had such a command of technique that his improvising was often annoyingly glib -- though very sprightly and superficially fun. It sounds as if he let his fingers do the walking, but I don't think he made much effort here to work into the guts of these songs.  <br /> <br />From my exposure to a half dozen Oscar Peterson albums, I conclude that he was usually best as a backup player for other soloists, when he had to listen hard and work around what the main voice was playing or singing -- with healthy doses of subdued chording and quiet support for the band as a whole. This imposed on him a restraint and discipline that he found hard to apply when he was the main soloist. As examples I would cite his Very Tall album with Milt Jackson or his work on Fred Astaire's The Astaire Story sessions.   <br /> <br />On We Get Requests, the trio weaves its happy way through several of the big hit songs of that era (People, Days of Wine and Roses), completely misses the bossa nova groove on two Jobim tunes (Corcovado, Girl from Ipanema), and generally seems to be having a grand time -- we're told in the liner notes that most Oscar Peterson sessions were pleasant affairs, with jokes and smiles all around. The result was the highest-class elevator music ever recorded. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It all depends on what you're looking for, and what mood you are in. Five stars!
1932100385|5.0|The China Study was a HUGE study that went on for 30 years; it resulted in over 8,000 statistically significant correlations between diet and disease.  It surveyed a vast range of diseases and diet and lifestyle factors in rural China, and more recently, in Taiwan.    A monumental nationwide survey was conducted in China in the 1970s on cancer death rates from twelve different types of cancer. More than 2,400 Chinese counties and 880 million citizens were involved. This resulted in a color-coded atlas showing where certain types of cancer were high, and where they were non-existent. This provided information on over four dozen different kinds of disease, including cancers, heart diseases, and infectious diseases.    The China Study was a grand design; it gathered data on 367 variables, and compared each variable to the others. They went into 65 counties across China and administered blood tests and questionnaires to 6,500 adults. They took urine samples, and directly measured everything families ate over a three day period. And they analyzed food samples from markets across the country.    When they were done, they had an unmatched comprehensive study. They then compared these findings with animal experiments. But Dr. Campbell's  conclusions did not rest on the findings of his animal studies, and the studies of China; he sought out the findings of other researchers and clinicians, and included dozens and dozens of studies.    Dr. Campbell and his colleagues received a total of 74 grant-years of funding, and did 74 years of study in less than 35 years.  From this research, he authored or co-authored over 350 scientific articles, from which he received may awards. Dr. Campbell did not start with any preconceived notions about the worthiness of any particular diet. His conclusions are largely empirical, based upon observation and measurement, and not from hypothesis or anecdote. The results from all the studies were consistent.    What is so convincing is the breadth of the evidence from so many studies. Hundreds, even thousands of studies show the benefits of a plant-based diet. His conclusion can be summed up as follows:    \\"Eat a whole foods, plant-based diet, while minimizing the consumption of refined foods, added salt and added fats.\\" Eliminate all animal-based products, but don't obsess over it. If a dish contains a small amount of meat, the quantity very likely will be nutritionally unimportant. Benefits were shown to increase as meat consumption decreased, even when the percentage declined from 10% to 0%.    Lessons from The China Study  1) Breast cancer is associated with consumption of animal fat (but not plant fat).  2) Heart disease is associated with animal protein consumption. Stop eating animal protein, and most heart disease will reverse.  3) Type 1 diabetes is associated with consumption of cows milk. Do not feed your children cows milk, at least until 2 years of age, and preferably never.  4) Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased fat intake.  5) Colon cancer is associated with meat consumption.  6) Multiple Sclerosis is associated with cows milk consumption.  7) Increased hip fractures from osteoporosis are associated with increased milk consumption.  8) Kidney stones are associated with animal protein intake.  9) Macular degeneration and cataracts, forms of eye disease, occur when we fail to eat enough highly colored fruits and vegetables. Both diseases are likely to be increased by animal based foods.  10) Cognitive impairment, memory loss, and Alzheimer's disease are associated with an animal-based diet.    A cautionary note: The China Study is based on the consumption of conventional food sources worldwide, whatever they may be. If those conventional sources happen to be toxic, then naturally by reducing their consumption you will see improved health. Consider the following examples:    The China Book suggests reducing the consumption of salt. We know that salt is an essential nutrient, and farmers keep their livestock healthy by allowing them free access to salt licks. Animals will chew fence posts etc. to get needed minerals (this is called pica). I would conclude that regular supermarket salt is toxic due to the additives and bleaching, and this is borne out by research that shows it to cause illness. However, sun dried (not kiln dried) sea salt, free of additives, is necessary for good health.    The China Book shows that the consumption of milk causes disease including osteoporosis. But this is the homogenized pasteurized version mass consumed and available in supermarkets. Pasteurized milk will putrefy; raw milk will not, but will sour, so there is a difference in properties. Pasteurized milk may cause osteoporosis, but I am told there is research that shows that raw milk does indeed build strong bones.    The China Book shows that consumption of meat causes problems, but this would no doubt be cooked meat. The consumption of raw meat appears to be very beneficial, but few in this culture would want to do that.    The China Book recommends minimally added fats, but this no doubt means the toxic versions that most people consume from market shelves. Udo Erasmus, in his book \\"Fats That Heal, Fats That Kill\\", suggests a diet of 15-20% of total calories consumed in fat, but of course, the non toxic versions. The toxic versions are the cause of diabetes [...].
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This record, while uneven, rocks.  It could have done without the slower stuff, Jet is at their best when plowing straight ahead.  I think it's pretty funny that a lot of people are bashing on Jet for being unoriginal, especially the people who say that Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinand, and the like are \\"better\\".  Sure, let's whine into a microphone and play gutless music to it and get MTV to back us!  That'll work great!   <br /> <br />Ridiculous. <br /> <br />The sound on this record does conjure up images of the Stones, AC/DC, and even Steppenwolf, but it's never simply rote copying.   This band would not come off as well as it does if these guys couldn't play.  And boy can they rock.  They might not be virtuoso musicians, but they know how to make a rock record stomp and they do it well.   <br /> <br />The main two problems I see people have with this record are 1) that it \\"is a rip off\\" (which if you actually LISTEN to the music you'll figure out isn't true, it's just the same style) and 2) that it isn't original like Modest Mouse or Franz Ferdinand.  I'll let you in on a little secret.  MM/FF is whining, moping, prattling, pretentious, self-important garbage.  They're not original, they're exactly what every other band has sounded like for the last seven years.  Jet, however, has got balls enough to rock hard and have FUN in their music, and people hate them for it.   Considering the 'woe is me I am whiny and sad' type junk being force-fed to the music listener these days, having fun with music is a pretty darn original idea. <br /> <br />If you hate rock n' roll and everything it used to stand for you'd better steer clear of this one.  But if you love rock and are tired of the crap people listen to nowadays give these boys a listen.  You won't regret it.
B00005B36H|3.0|The question that haunted every Tool fan as the years went by and the label disputes continued--how does one follow-up what is considered the best album of your career?      I'm sure Maynard wasn't worried about this dilemma, he doesn't seem the type of person that puts much thought into those sorts of things-- he is what some people might say is an artists artist.  That is--he is so much into the art that he has almost become a PART of that same art, seemingly a parody of himself, if one didn't know better.    We do.    So with the fateful day that Lateralus finally hit the shelves, I think most Tool fans were excited, nay, exhilarated with the very thought of buying the first Tool album to come out in over five years.  After hearing Lateralus on the radio for about a month before the disc came out, who wouldn't be excited?  It sounded like Tool--but with a slightly new direction and vision.  I was excited.    So I pop in the disc at home and take my first listen.  The wonderfully constructed instant classic \\"Grudge\\" comes on and I'm instantly left thinking,\\" This is it!  This is going to be what Aenima would have been if they had taken out the filler!\\"    Oh what thick wool was pulled over my eyes.     The next track is, to my chagrin, the classic \\"filler\\" track that I'm sure will now permeate every single Tool album from now on due to reviewers saying how \\"artistic\\" they are and how they make music for themselves and that's all that matters.  I'm all for artistic integrity but why do I need 4 (if I count the meandering Parabol prior to the monstrous Parabola as filler) tracks that add nothing to the MUSICAL spectrum that is Tool.  I suppose someone could make a case for the apparent senselessness of the last track on the album... but otherwise, why?    When writers get big they usually no longer require an editor from the publishing company.  Tool could still use a good editor.    The one major flaw I see with this album (aside from it being a little to \\"fat\\" onminutes) is that it shows Tool's lack of progression as musicians.  It feels like Tool has eschewed the raw creative sound they had on Aenima (recorded on 8-track) for a polished corporate sound, that while most people feel that the album is all about the art, it sounded to me like it was about the selling of art.  Instead of taking a step forward, so to speak, they took a step sideways and really, if you listen to Aenima, didn't change that much at all.      The album has some great songs on it, don't get me wrong!  \\"The Grudge\\", \\"Schism\\", \\"Parabola\\" (although it loses focus in the middle) and \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" (which has the same exact tone as something from Opiate minus that raw production quality that MADE that album so great)  are all good songs and should be recognized as such.  I just don't feel that the overall album holds together.  It loses something. The Tool sound, while there, feels like it's been watered down and spread out across 78mins of weird noises and spacey feel.      I personally don't see what's to love and maybe I should apologize for that?  I sometimes think I'm the only fan of Tool who thinks this album is their worst one but, so be it, I'll go down with the ship if I have to!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie, albeit low budget, was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  I think what makes it so funny is that it's so real.  Just a couple of nerds going through life.  Actually the nerds come out on top at the end and that made me happy.  I can't explain the affection I have for this movie, but apparently the majority of people who see it feel the same way.  A guy named Napolean Dynamite??? now that in itself is funny.  I don't usually like comedies - I prefer drama or action, but I watched this one with my teenage daughter and like it so much I watched it 3 times!!  Unheard of for me.  It is well worth the money to buy it.  It will become a cult classic!  p.s.  The man who plays Napolean in the movie is actually cute in real life - how did they make him look so nerdy?
B000002868|5.0|Jim Cantore is the best weather report guy I've ever seen. This band is the perfect showcase for his talent. There have been many great weathermen in my lifetime. There's the great Tommy Bevacqua, Jim Flowers, Doc Sanguinary, and Tim Simpson. Cantore is in his own class. This guy doesn't just cover the weather, he goes out of the way to find the worst weather in the country to laugh at it. That's why this CD works. Cantore reading weather bulletins while riding an F5 tornado is just flat entertaining because you know the tornado won't phase him. He goes surfing in hurricanes because it makes him a better surfer. Tom Bevacqua would never do things like that and you shouldn't expect him to, get off his case. Cantore is just a cut above like I am in regards to picking up women. You may be able to get a date, but I can get 3. That's the essence of Cantore, he's always a step ahead of you.
B00005B4GU|5.0|\\"Ice Age coming. Ice Age coming. Let me hear both sides; let me hear both sides...\\" <br />\\"Jumped into a river.  What did I see?  Black-eyed angels swam with me...\\" <br />\\"You can take us all; you can take us all--Holy Roman Empire...\\" <br /> <br />Choosing this selection is more of an irony than anything else.  I'll admit it.  I never cared for Radiohead's earlier work.  The track \\"Creep\\" seemed too polished, and the Album \\"The Bends\\" seemed too extravagant.  \\"OK Computer\\" changed my mind, though.  And, then \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" preserved the transformation from Radiohead scorner to Radiohead devotee.   <br /> <br />Overall, I think it's in the lyrics.  Granted, the dreamy and ambient electronic sound that Radiohead creates on this album is a comfort, but I'm rest assured that it's in the words somehow.  There's just something to be said about influencing people delicately.  Is it word choice?  Yes and No.  Is it determined by tone and temper?  Ah, Yes.  That's what I think it all comes down to, really.   <br /> <br />How do musicians express themselves?  Are they sophisticated like Thom Yorke of Radiohead?  Or, are they vulgar and heavy-handed like many of those other commercial fellows? <br />
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I got my copy of Phantom of the Opera yesterday.  I was lucky enough to see it when it first hit Chicago years ago, and adored the music, the sets, everything.  So, I was prepared to enjoy a different version.  I'm not quite sure why it got so many lukewarm or cold reviews.  The settings are far more complicated than they were on stage (duh!  More room, more money, etc.), and I really loved the minimalist stage dressing.  The stage version was darkly lit (boy, is that an oxymoron!), with little fairy lights, whereas the movie version used fire and other light to turn everything bright.  They portrayed the Phantom's (whom I always call by his given name, which was revealed in one of the non-musical film versions) interior darkness by associating red with him, and not using in many scenes for anything else.  The film used a rather limited color palette -black, white, gold, red, with splashes of other colors.  The tunnels were all gray with torches providing the illumination and green water.  Very cool.<br /><br />The singing was ... not quite up to Broadway/Opera.  The man playing Eric was very good, but the hero was so-so.  Christine's voice was very modern, wispy, almost ethereal, quite like many women who sing Celtic music, not really up to the operatic potential of Lloyd Weber's music, but it worked.  There were several new songs, which were welcome, since my memory of the stage version was that it had one melody used over and over.  The whole film felt much more operatic than it did on stage.  Minimal talking.  They minimized Eric's deformities by giving him mild neurofibromatosis -He actually looked pretty decent, and I think that it would be possible for him to go outside without too many stares and comments, certainly less than poor Richard Merrick had to endure.  They also created a backstory to show how his psyche had been broken as a child, making him all the more pitiable.<br /><br />All in all, a really good movie, no matter what the professional critics had to say.  Buy it.itics had to say.  Buy it. <br /> <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|This album brings back the soulful sounds of music that puts you in a state of relaxtion and makes you forget about all of your problems.  R&B has been in the ruts lately with their image of sex, money, and clubbing but this album drops all the marketing images and brings it back to the elements that make music what it is suppose to be. John Legend's album has an amazing vibe to it through the simple use of a piano, lyrics, and a voice.  Freshing indeed.....
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I've not stopped listening to this CD since early 2003.  The songs still strike me like lightening everytime I hear them.  Lena and Julia's voices pierce every emotion that I feel like a sweet screaming banshee.  It can be best described as if while they are singing they are taking me by the hand and literally running as fast as we can go through the drama of all the emotions, bitter, sweet, angry, elated.  Listening to these songs is like a religious experience.  They are sung with Brutally honest passion.  It is passion that keeps me hooked to Tatu.  I want to thank them for being there for me like a friend would as I go through the drama of life.  They sing to me and I am taken to another place and for 4 minutes everything is okay.  Tatu is my therapy.  I met a guy and knew that I could never have him and then listened to \\"maljik gay\\"...the words \\"handsome, tender soft, why do you look right through me? thinking-no I can't deny my feelings growing stronger..I keep believing dreaming on and everytime I see you I cry ..more I wanna be the object of your passion but it's hopeless\\".  Profound!  It made me feel as if I was not the only one feeling this way and it comforted me.  Thank you Julia and Lena.
B000069HK2|5.0|There is no possible way to decribe the greatness of this band.  They are so amazing... they are in a genre all their own.  Some people say that other bands are trying to copy them but... they are definitly not suceeding if they are.  I discovered them in 2002 at a festival.  i had never heard them before but after i saw them i had to have this cd.  Their sound is so full and stylistically untouchable and the vocals are so gutwrenchingly un believable... this cd is much different is much different than their second (In Love and Death - that one is awesome in a different way) so if you somehow dont like it then you will probably still like this one. <br />The most kick you in the face awesome songs are \\"maybe memories\\" \\"say days ago\\" \\"A Box Full of Sharp Objects\\" and the hidden song \\"choke me\\"  yes i relize none of the songs reach some peoples definition of 'kick you in the face' but what can i say this is not a punk band they do not claim to be.  their style is much better than all of the sensless jabbering the \\"true\\" punk bands do (but then who the hell knows what that is anymore ramones? misfits? sex pistols? casualties? it confuses me really)and they are not metal and again they do not claim to be they are simply beautiful chaos... <br />then on the other end of the spectrum \\"Blue and Yellow\\" and \\"On My Own\\" are the most beautiful yet still with the sameamazing sound... <br />I apologize that i can fully describe with words what i am thinking. <br />If you are looking for street punk this is not it if your looking for emo ... in my opinion this is not it but youll probably like it and some retards call them emo...  i hate the title scremo btw i reeeeeally dont think they fit that description either. this is not any sort of hard core.. this is.... i dunno its rock n roll thats for sure but past that i dunno.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I loved the show and now I can sing the songs anytime I want to. A must for any Buffy fan. My favorites are \\"I'll Never Tell\\" and \\"Rest in Peace\\". Both Anya and Spike have great voices. As does Tony Head who plays Giles and Tara. Very catchy!
B00069YE0W|5.0|Another great album by John Frusciante. This album is filled with sad and happy notes, that bring you to a higher level. Just put this CD in your discman, lay on the grass and look at the night sky while enjoying another great solo release from John.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I just watched the Anthology again, and I realize even more the vast extent of Paul's talent. I know, I know John Lennon was great, they all were.  John was always my favorite, and still is for some emotional reason which I still don't understand!  BUT there is no doubt that Paul McCartney just freaking oozes musical talent, he was the most musically talented Beatle.  The guy could sing great, write great music, great lyrics, plays bass better than anyone, plays great piano, also could play lead guitar (listen to him play \\"Blackbird\\" in the Anthology), excellent drums (\\"Ballad of John and Yoko\\"), and who knows what-all else.  All you people who think it's cool to put Paul down, you just don't know what you're talking about.  Plus, he's a great performer who loves to perform and loves his audience, a great family man, a loyal husband, always a positive outlook, PLUS not to mention he was about the best-looking guy in the world!  I love and admire Paul more and more as time goes on.
B0002YLC24|5.0|\\"Before Sunset\\" is a lovely piece of film making that feels like an 80-minute exercise in eavesdropping on a conversation between two real, knowable people--not actors on the silver screen. The movie is a rarity in this age of fifty-million dollar budgets, graphic sex, extravagant sets, and cheesy special effects (none of which I particularly mind; \\"Sunset\\" is just a nice departure from the latest multiplex thriller). It never feels contrived, the way most movie romances do; the (abundant) conversation that makes the movie work is flowing and genuine. The characters seem real, not like paid actors at all (attribute that to Hawke and Delpy's perfect on-screen chemistry). I never got the feeling that either were just reciting lines from a script someone else had written (the director and two lead actors are given full writing credit; thus, the feeling of authenticity). This sentiment of realism holds particularly true toward the end of the film, when Celine angrily shouts at Jesse that he ruined things for her, that their night together nine years ago was as good as it'll ever be, and now she's forced to unfavorably compare everything to that. How can anyone act that without feeling it? I wondered.<br /><br />As its prequel, \\"Before Sunrise,\\" was nicely set in Vienna, Paris is a lovely backdrop for \\"Before Sunset,\\" with (blissfully) nary a shot of the Eiffel Tower in sight and not a note of the typical \\"fall in love in Paris\\" accordion music. But the cafes, shops, cobblestone streets, and River Seine are all present in their authentic glory.<br /><br />I thought the ending, in fitting with the rest of the film, was perfect. What ultimately happens is settled in my mind, which may vary from another's interpretation. Isn't it nice to be able to decide the outcome instead of being force-fed the answers?  It will be a long time before I see another movie I enjoyed as much as \\"Before Sunset.\\"

B00009TB5G|5.0|Hmmmmm, I am a very big fan of extended versions because ultimately they present more content and more continuity of the feature. With respect to the cast & crew of LOTR: The Two Towers, this version is woth the buck! Let me elaborate, if you watched LOTR: The Two Towers the theatrical version, lots of things are missing here baby! Most noticeably is what happened to the rest of the Uruk-hai when the battle of Helms Deep was over as you didn't see lots of them in LOTR: The Return of the King. Now there's a good teaser, hehehe! Another one which was not in the theatrical version, was Faramir really surprised when he learned the death of Boromir? Now, don't get mad at me, here's another one, Denethor actually appeared on this extended version!<br /><br />The bottom line is there are at least 45 mins of added juice here and all of them have helped in making the movie even more interesting.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This movie was something that I did not expect very much from to be honest...but I was hooked right from the time that I pressed the play button on the DVD player!  Great story that acutally made you care about all of the characters!!  Loved the extras that came with the DVD too...great interviews with all involved!! <br />If you like football...even if you don't (like myself), you will not be dissapointed in this film!!! Rent or buy today!
0553260111|5.0|Who I am I and why can't I remember      As a student in high school I'm always looking for books that I can actually get interested in because, to be honest I don't like to read so I'm always on the look. Then my bother told me that the Born Identity books were really good and they were nothing like the movies. At first I was a little reluctant because again I don't read, but then my mom read them and she also said the same thing so I read it.    The main plot is that Jason Bourne has lost his memory and is trying to recover what he can't remember, plus he is now hunted by the police and assassins from an unknown source and everything points to Paris. The book starts off on a boat during a gun fight with an unknown man he gets shot and falls overboard, so the beginning pretty much will get you hooked and make you want to keep reading. He is floating out in the middle of the ocean unconscious when a fishing boat sees him picks him up and one of the fisher man just happens to be a doctor so he stitches the unknown man and saves his life and thus begins the story.    I like the fact that it is really nothing like the movie. In fact is a lot more detail in the first chapter than there is in the whole movie. It's like watching a whole different version of the movie.. I was surprised how different they really were. I would actually much rather read the book than watch the movie it is much more descriptive than the movie was and ever will be. For example Jason offered Marie money to take him to Paris but in the book he forcefully made her take him to Paris     For the most part I would have to say that this book is definitely a good book to read especially if you have seen the movie to see how different the two really are. It is a very good book especially if you like when there is a lot of action because that's the only way I'll even consider reading any books. So if you are looking for a good book I recommend reading this book. It is definitely worth the time. It was worth every second I spent reading it.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|Ashton Kutcher (A Lot Like Love, Guess Who) stars in this totally dull and empty thriller/drama about a boy who suffered from blackouts during his childhood and wrote when he did, he wrote them down in his journal. He left his hometown and now he's in college, that's Kutcher, and when Kutcher reads the journals of his past he is instantly transported back into child form so he can prevent bad things, examples are death of a mom and  her baby, falling in love with his friends sister who's dad, played by Eric Stoltz (Kicking and Screaming, Out Of Order) is a pedophile and video tapes. He soon changes it, but is this really the place he wanted to go as he tries to change it several more times, each with different outcomes and consequences. Also starring Amy Smart (Road Trip, Varsity Blues), William Lee Scott (Identity, October Sky), Elden Henson (Idle Hands, The Mighty), Ethan Suplee (Mallrats, Evolution) and Melora Walters (Magnolia, Desert Saints). Kutcher is not even close to being convincing in his role where he tries to show us another side of his acting but come on.....who really cares? A good supportive cast is wasted. Not much to look at...though it is an interesting premise but we coulf of had someone else besides Kutcher....litereally
B00005ASOI|4.0|OK, let's establish one thing up front: when you watch a Dario Argento film, you're not looking for a complex and gripping storyline or sophisticated dialogue. But the doesn't mean that \\"Suspiria\\" can't worm it's way into your bedtime stories and cause some pretty lingering nightmares for months to follow. <br /> <br />Let the visuals do the talking. They are some of the most ethereal and weird I've ever seen. You feel like you're walking through the grimmest of the Grimm fairy tales. Even the characters reinforce that-the naive and willowesque heroines and the uptight, authoritarian schoolmistresses put one in mind of Cinderella and her wicked step-mother.  <br /> <br />Story is painfully simple: Suzy (Jessica Harper) enrolls in a prestigous dance academy in the heart of the Black Forest (more Grimm for you) and immeadiately upon arrival is confronted by bizarre murders and general paranoia among her schoolmates. She sets out to solve the mystery of the school and vanquish the powers of evil. Or something like that.  <br /> <br />The first kill of the movie still gets me, and I've seen this thing at least four times. It's nearly awe-inspiring. I wanted to go back and watch it again and again. Not because I'm gruesomely fascinated by the poor girl's death, but because the entire scence is brilliantly executed (no pun intended) and remarkably well-shot. It's horrifying, heart-breaking and stomach churning all at once. <br /> <br />Goblin's musical score blares over Suspiria like a demented narrator. I don't think it's wrong to write that without it, this movie might not have been nearly as frightning. If anything, watch Suspiria just to hear it, and then tell me if you don't get goosebumps. It's used to perfection, highlighting each horror sequence with just the right amount of lull and climax. <br /> <br />The \\"in-between\\" scences are OK, but again, you're not watching this for character development or interaction. There is one clever use of a \\"riddle\\" which helps Suzy uncover the secret of the academy, but otherwise the dialogue is somewhat childish. (I understand that Argento originally wanted the students to be 12 to 14 year olds, which may explain why their conversations are juvenile.)  <br /> <br />Few horror directors are able to combain gore with style. Argento does masterfully in Suspiria, which is why I think it's one of the greatest horror classics.
0930289528|5.0|This comic was completely amazing!!! WAY Better than i expected. I dont read any comics either usually and i still loved this! I read the whole thing from right when i got it out of the box straight through the whole thing.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I was at the show in Philly that day.  For the reviewers who ask why the U.S. audience was so listless, here are some reasons: <br />1)  It was nearly 100 degrees out, with hazy sun, and 100 percent humidity.  Most of us were in the stadium from eight o'clock in the morning.  Absolutely no shade.  Only a few bathrooms.  We were baked. <br />2)  Very hard to get food and water.  Limited concessions, totally overwhelmed.  In the afternoon, about 30 of us began to hang off of one of the water pipes in the bathroom, finally breaking it for drinking water and a much needed shower. <br />3)  The field was covered in some sort of lime green cotton padding.  By early afternoon, it became soaked in sweat and other fluids, becoming a slimy slippery stinking mess.  Completely disgusting. <br />4) The absolutely best part of the show, we watched on a crappy big-screen TV, about 5 years before jumbotrons became a viable option.  The pixels were the size of spotlights. <br /> <br />By the time the sun began to fall and it cooled down a bit, we found new energy.  The highlight was when they showed the video of Mick Jagger and David Bowie doing \\"Dancing In The Streets\\", followed by Mick and Tina's set.  The whole place came alive!! <br /> <br />The music in both shows was remarkable and diverse.  No one at the show would say that they didn't get great value for a great cause.  I must say that that was the most exhausted I've ever been.   <br /> <br />Having the video to remember it is priceless!
068987474X|2.0|I read this book expecting to be enlightened.  I guess I have just lived through enough of these events already to know what they mean now.  I was not impressed with the book.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|This is without question the best CD, beginning to end, I have heard in the past two years, at least.  The rockers ROCK, the ballads are poignant, the white-boy reggae stuff is way cool, the production is great, and it has SOUL.  \\"Burnin' Streets\\" is underrated by other reviewers, I think--listening to it is like riding on a slow-moving but powerful locomotive.  There is not a bad cut on this CD, it is essential, buy it.
B0008ISM40|4.0|I have to say the first time I heard this album I wasnt impressed with it.  However that being said after a couple of listens it starts to grow on you, much in the way all his other albums have done to me.  This is a more optimistic album than most but it still is true to the NIN style of releasing a complete album where you have to listen to it as whole to get the full picture. <br /> <br />The only thing that I am truly disappointed about from this album is the lack of any purely instrumental tracks.   Trent is a great musician and some of his best work has been his purely or mostly instrumental songs.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain is one artist who has transcended the label of country music artist to attain more widespread popularity. As a fan of dance music, pop music and all other kinds of music I am anything but a fan of country - but I am a Shania Twain fan.<br /><br />So, picking up this Greatest Hits collection was a no-brainer. Equipped with a new CD player in my car, my 40-minute-plus work commute has been transformed from frustration searching through DC's radio stations to toe tapping, singing-along fun and more often than not it's Shania's greatest hits that are blasting out of my cars speakers.<br /><br />From \\"Forever and For Always\\" through \\"Up!\\" to \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" the compilation does a good job of mixing up her different styles. And whereas a number of even greatest hits CDs have me hitting the \\"Skip\\" button to go onto the next track, this is not an issue with this CD.<br /><br />Well recommended as a cure for those Beltway Blues.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I have been a huge NIN fan since I was 15. I think the new album With Teeth by NIN is fabulous. I admit it is definately a bit more mellow than the other albums, But music and bands evolve over time. I love the 80's influences too. I highly recommend the album.
B00007FOMP|5.0|The reviewer who thinks that the Lighthouse Family (of whom the lead singer marked Gaye as an influnce)is better than this doesn't know what he's talking about.He should stick to his Shakin Stevens and other rubbish like that.Back to this which has been a favorite of mine since 1987 and to say that they don't make music like this anymore is becoming an understatment.This is solid gold soul music worth anything than the likes of 50 Cent.I won't go to detail of this as the other 5 star reviews have done so.Except to say that many of the tracks have been covered by many artists over the years.It's one of the last great Motown recordings to come out of Detriot through their golden years (1963-1971).It's a still an all time classic 34 years on that brings out the best of Gaye,the Funk Brothers and especially one of the worlds greatest bass players, the late great James Jamerson.
B000929AJQ|5.0|It may take a little time to get used to the new sound. Honestly, I really wasn't too sure about this album the first couple of listens, it just has to grow on you. But once it does, well you'll see. You begin to notice sounds you didn't hear on the first go round. On first listen, it seems so empty, so minimal, but the more you listen to it, the more complex it gets. This is a serious change, but it still has all the aspects of a nine inch nails album. Trent definately made this, and he did a great job wether or not it sounds like the downward spiral, it wasn't supose to. Its better that bands expand, rather than go back and recreate. This to me, is the album that hes been trying to make since the downward spiral, the fragile was just the prelude. <br />Just hope that it doesn't take 6 years for the next one. <br />
0316168815|5.0|Do not ignore this book just because it's on all the book clubs' and bestsellers lists.  It is outstanding
B0000067L4|5.0|This swan song of Cream is truly one of the greats.  The group took blues improvisation to a higher art....blistering performances by Baker, Bruce,  and Clapton.  Huge sound,  great hall,  it will leave an impact. <br /> <br /> <br />     Truly one of the greats,  an absolute must for the rock n roll fan.  Get it!!!
0440180295|5.0|Obviously an amazing book...anything positive I say is understatement.  After reading this I ordered an arm load of other Vonnegut books, and spent hours online reading about the author.
0156027321|5.0|I LOVED this book. Yan has a complete command of the English language and has the talent of explaining the simplest experiences in words that translate very well into feelings. Every once in a while I go back and read some of the paragraphs that I have bookmarked like the paragraphs that describe Pi's fears and explain fear in general. This is a book that also makes you think, well after you have finished the book and at the end shouldn't that be what we expect of every book?
B00005JMJG|1.0|I saw Jim Carrey on the cover, so I assumed it was good.  I was wrong.  Sooooo boring.  I guess I'm not spacey enough to enjoy this movie.  Jim Carrey, you still rock.  Now...let's go watch Dumb and Dumber..
B0000AQS0F|5.0|<br />The premature cancellation of Firefly was, without a doubt, the biggest tragedy in network television history. They claimed the series was not \\"popular\\" enough. HOOEY.  <br />Ratings and popularity are relative, considering it had a built-in insanely loyal fan base, thanks to Wheadon's previous series. <br /> <br />The reasons it didn't get the (absurd) ratings FOX was demanding of it have NOTHING to do with the writing (which was excellent) the acting (nuanced and supurb), the directing (boundry-pushing and intriguging) or the storyline (absorbing). No. Instead, it had to do with FOX's *terrible* promotion (make it look incredibly juvinile...which isn't an easy thing to do) and placement in the Friday Night slot-of-death.  <br /> <br />The rapid sales of Firefly on DVD speak for themselves I think. <br /> <br />Buy this series! Watch it! Love it! Curse FOX network bitterly for their stupidity, and then eagerly await the movie coming out this September!  <br /> <br />As the theme song says: <br />~ \\"You can't take the sky from me\\" ~
B00005JL96|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! It was funny, it was sad, and it <br />sure was original. I liked it so much, I bought the dvd a couple <br />of years ago. Great for kids and adults,you'll really enjoy it!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|It doesn't matter if you're 7 or 70. This movie pleases everyone. It's got a great soundtrack (don't know if it's still available but I inherited my mom's old LP record!), great acting (anything with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke has to be good), and has some scenes where live action and animation are combined. This was all done without the technology of today, yet another reason to appreciate the work in this film. The remastered DVD editions are great. Not sure what extras come with the newest one but the one I saw in 2001 had a good section about the making of the film. <br /> <br />I recommend this to anyone, and it will come as a blessing if you're sick of the garbage that Hollywood is making today.
B000063COX|5.0|I listen to this album at least once a day; it's what gets the blood flowing!<br /><br />It turns out the band members hated (and still do hate) the production on this album, but the fans love it (and some say it's their best album, too!) Let's break it down, track by track:<br /><br />1. Prowler: a balls out, full on rocker (one of the best album openers ever) with a speed and aggression that put all punk bands of that era to shame... 10/10<br /><br />2. Sanctuary: already by the second song you realize that this band means business...10/10<br /><br />3. Remember Tomorrow: I love this song! It has everything you could ask for... a slow, mellow intro; an intense buildup to the chorus; out of nowhere they throw in a time change and a few solos before going back to mellow... 11/10<br /><br />4. Running Free: Maybe 3 or 4 out of all my friends listen to metal... but ALL my friends know and love this song... you just can't help but sing along! 10/10<br /><br />5. Phantom of the Opera: from the moment I heard the first few notes I fell in love with this song! The BEST song on the album (and one of Maidens best) this song will make you headbang, airguitar, or just go crazy... 100/10<br /><br />6. Transylvania: Best. Instrumental. Ever. 10/10<br /><br />7. Strange World: The mellow tune on the album... I'm led to believe it's about vampires(!)... the solos are absolutly beautiful; so much feeling and expression! 11/10<br /><br />8. Charlotte the Harlot: Another great rocker written by lead guitarist Dave Murray (he doesn't write many songs since his style of playing is improv, but when he does you know it's gonna be good) 11/10<br /><br />9. IRON MAIDEN: the title track... like Prowler it only has one verse... but sometimes it's better to keep things simple... and just like Prowler is as a strong opener, IRON MAIDEN is the perfect end to a PERFECT debut! 10/10<br /><br />Overall I gave it a 5 star rating (...only because 5 is the max) anyone who rates it less shouldn't be taken seriously.<br /><br />\m/ UP THE IRONS! \m/it less shouldn't be taken seriously. <br />  <br />\m/ UP THE IRONS! \m/
B000005RFQ|5.0|I can remember when this album came out back in 1983. I was a junior in high school and being a huge Sabbath fan all my life, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I feel, this is Sabbath's Darkest Album. It's quite disturbing...but that's what I like about it. It's like watching a horror flick and wanting to be scared!  <br /> <br />Talk about Sabbath's top notch vocalist! Dio and Martin are wonderful of course...and Ozz, well, he started it all. I saw Sabbath on this tour and let me tell you...the sound man had a hell of a time mixing Gillan cause he was so powerful! Here are my ratings per track <br /> <br />1. Trashed (5/5) Great opener...reminds one of Neon Knights from Heaven and Hell and Turn Up the Night from Mob Rules..both openers as well. And Iommi's lead.....is loud, twisted and penetrating...just the way us metalheads like it! <br /> <br />2. Stonehege (4/5) Mainly keyboards..mellow, a nice prelude for whats about to come next. <br /> <br />3. Disturbing The Priest (5/5) the first time I heard the intro with the riffs and Gillan's banshee screams...I thought I was in hell!!!! Just kidding, but you know what I am trying to say. Very different riff from Iommi. <br /> <br />4. The Dark (3/5) Nothing to say about this track...it's probably Geezer fooling around with his bass or keyboards while running through a bunch of effects...and the song fades into.... <br /> <br />5. Zero The Hero (5/5) the intro sounds like Jason is coming after you...or the \\"tall man\\" from Phantasm! Great riff...typical of Sabbath during this era. <br /> <br />6. Digital Bitch (5/5) Same Vibe as Trashed. Fast, energetic and again shows Gillan's ability to compete with the  80's metal scene with no strain whatsoever. <br /> <br />7. Born Again (4/5) The title track is my least favorite, but it's good. It shows a very different side to Sabbath's songwriting. It's an odd tune, but fits perfectly alongside the rest. <br /> <br />8. Hotline (5/5) Sounds alot like Smoke On The water fromDeep Purple (Gillan's original band for those of you not aware) also like Lady Evil from Heaven and Hell. Once again Iommi's offers a blistering twisted solo that will tear the tweeters in your speaker cabinet! <br /> <br />9. Keep It Warm (4/5) A good closure. After taking us on a hellride throught the album, this is a slower, lighter melodic side to Sabbath. It still rocks however. <br /> <br />Well, hope those of you that are as fond of this album as I am will agree with my ratings. This is an era that has long since gone, can even be considered obscure, but a sweet, sweet memory for those of us that were there.
B000002JS0|5.0|I love this album so much. AC/DC is the best band that has ever lived and I have all of their albums. T.N.T. is my favorite songs of their's because it's really creative and I love the lyrics. I would recommend this album if you are a die-hard AC/DC fan or someone who loves all kinds of music. AC/DC has been so influencial in my life with all their albums. Back In Black, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Highway To Hell, '74 Jailbreak. All of those records are awesome and they deserve five stars. AC/DC has made a lasting impression on everyone of their fans and every single fan is still listening to \\"T.N.T.,\\" \\"Back In Black,\\" \\"Highway To Hell,\\" \\"You Shook Me All Night Long,\\" \\"Big Balls.\\" So this album is so exception because this review is for all of their albums which are 100% perfect. Great job AC/DC!
B000002J09|4.0|first off, i'll say that you should get Early Days instead of this, basically everything good from this cd is on there.  But if you really want this blast from the past piece of work, be my guest.  on to the review: <br /> <br />this is a great album, remembered as the Zep's finest.  They have a lot of great songs from other albums however, so don't limit yourself to this one.  this cd has classics like \\"when the levee breaks,\\" which is probably the best song, and \\"black dog,\\" which swaggers around insanely.   <br /> <br />people talk a lot about \\"stairway to heaven,\\" which is a good song, but personally between you and me I think its overrated.  I really have no idea what they are talking about, it seems like just a bunch of mystical sounding lyrics put together with no real MESSAGE, you know what I mean?  it sounds really good, all the same, it just doesn't really communicate.  plus it gets played to death by amateur guitarists (including myself) which makes it tiresome.  oh well. <br /> <br />overall, it is a rock classic, not without its imperfections.  not all of the songs work that well, there are a couple filler tracks, but overall it is just good rock music, with all the silliness and limitations of its era.  still worthy of a place in your music collection, unless you hate Led Zep (which many people do).
B0007TKNL0|2.0|Special Effects?  Amazing!  Scenery, props, costuming... wonderful.<br /><br />I wish I had never seen it!!!<br /><br />The magic and mystery is killed as soon as the Phantom's mask is pulled of the first time, and it never recovers.  I cried with a broken heart after seeing the movie.  I am so in love with this play, but I cannot believe that the director chose youth over the neccesary maturity needed for the roles.  Emmy has a beautiful voice... she's just not old enough for the part.  Raoul is far too young.  It's a joke.  The Phantom needs to SING!  Gerald Butler... he's not good enough.<br /><br />I pray that I can forget the trapdoors shown in the movie, and return myself to the magic world in the stage show.  I feel like a child told that there is no Santa.<br /><br />I'm buying the DVD for one reason... the opening sequence, which I will watch over and over again.  I'll turn it off after that.
B000002KHH|5.0|all you fans of mtv crapola (though I must say Mtv rules's reviews are extremely funny, he's a guy who knows, man!) will hide and run when black sabbath come on!  this cd is so ill its not even funny, the guitar just kills you in every song.  Tony Iommi basically invented heavy metal with this extreme melodic blast.  darkly disturbing songs permeate this cd, songs like \\"war pigs\\" show that Black Sabbath was creating something that was countering the flower power of the time.  Another band that was doing this, and sounding a bit like Black Sabbath was King Crimson, a band remembered mostly for inventing prog rock.  But if you listen to the King Crimson song \\"21st century schizoid man\\" you will hear the similarity to Black Sabbath's bone crunching riffs and solos.  this band is extremely good.  throw out your Ashanti cds and buy this, especially if you really like good guitar music!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I fell in love with the music of &quot;Phantom&quot; when i bought my 1st Sarah  Brightman cassete many years ago. I have waited these many years for the play to make it to film and at long last it has.<BR>There will be many who grumple that &quot;Webber&quot; deliberatly delayed the making of this film to deny &quot;Brightman&quot; her film immortality in a movie adaptation of the greatest play and greatest music she has had or ever will have in her astonishing career. Maybe there is truth somewhere here a lingering bitterness of their failed marriage or what ever.  I too would have liked to have seen the original Broadway cast reprise their roles on the big screen, but for whatever reason that window was closed forever.<br />However, that being said it in no way lessens the visual &amp; audio impact of this new movie. Gerald Butler captures the essence of the troubled and lonely Phantom and his vocals of &quot;music of the Night&quot; and indeed throught out the movie leave nothing to be desired. Emmy Rossum is young , fresh and the perfect Christine. Her voice is true and crisp and she need never feel she failed to raise to the challange left her by Brightman, she met that challange head on and matched it beautifully. Her rendition of &quot;wishing you were here&quot; performed in the grey mist of a cemetary will reach down deep in anyone who loves good music well performed. Her duet with Patrick Wilson &quot;say you'll love me&quot; well it just dosen't get any better then that.<br />If you don't have your copy BUY IT you will never regret the purchase price. However, one cavet of advice buy it it &quot;wide screen&quot; NOT full screen for the sheer grandeur of the visual aspects of the film.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I bought this cd a few days ago and I cant stop listening to it.  Her voice is absolutely amazing, and I love the mix of R&B and hip hop and ballads.  I am so happy that Mariah is back I have been a fan since I was a little girl.  I am hoping that she goes on tour because I saw her at MSG back in 99' I think it was, and she was wonderful.  It is pretty amazing that she has a five octave range, and I am thrilled that she is showing it off with great new songs.  I have been raving about this cd all week and ordering my friends to purchase it.  Go and buy it it is GREAT!!!
B0000027RL|4.0|I am not a fan of pj as i liked only this album from them.I am more a fan of alice in chains and soundgarden from the grunge era.still this album has some nice tracks like alive,evenflow,black and jeremy and is worth having in your cd collection along with facelift and dirt from alice in chains.
0793518326|1.0|I recently got myself a second-hand copy for £10 (and I even grudge paying that much!) thinking that if I'm going to criticise something, it should at least be with some authority.<br /><br />This book is awful. I have yet to find one transcription which doesn't have at least one major error. Even the relatively simple earlier songs are badly transcribed. There are many wrong voicings of chords, capoed parts written without capos ('Nowhere Man', 'Michelle'), missed notes and missed parts.<br /><br />As for the later songs, the transcription of the piano part for 'Lady Madonna' is a joke and the other piano parts are well wide of the mark. Also, the fact that George Martin's groundbeaking orchestrations are reduced to single, cursory staves marked 'strings' or 'brass' is wholly inadequate.<br /><br />This is an expensive book which does not live up the claim on its cover. Anyone buying this book thinking it is a definitive work will be disappointed.
B00013RC8O|4.0|I can't really pinpoint what it is about this movie that makes me like it. There are no really spectacular stunts, the story is very vague, the acting low-key, it seems more like a series of short vignettes rather than one full story from beginning to end. Perhaps simply because it is a cult movie that a lot of people never heard of. I don't know. Anyway, everyone who buys the DVD in widescreen should know that in comparing it with the fullscreen VHS, it appears that Vanishing point was originally filmed in the 4:3 aspect ratio (the same as TV) and the film's top and bottom were matted to give the \\"Flat\\" aspect ratio of 1.85:1. So in other words, this is one of those rare instances where you actually see LESS of the picture in the widescreen version! The transfer on the DVD also does NOT look better that the VHS version, in fact, it looks worse! Rating is for the film itself, not the DVD version.
B00000J6AG|5.0|First of all, I've noticed in a lot of these reviews that you all think the song Honey goes \\"gunna gunny gum bag\\" or whatever. You must be deaf, the lyrics are obviously \\"When my Honey comes back\\" <br /> <br />I loved this album, It never fails to make me smile.  <br /> <br />Honey- Great beat, fun to dance to, and sing to if you aren't deaf and can understand the lyrics... <br /> <br />Find My Baby- It wasn't my favorite, but I definitely liked it <br /> <br />Porcelain- One of the first Moby songs I ever heard, I was in love immediately <br /> <br />South Side- I loved this song, It's my favorite one to sing to other than Honey <br /> <br />BodyRock- This one just made me want to stand up and dance immediately <br /> <br />Natural Blues- Loved this song, love the beat to it <br /> <br />Run On- My favorite one to sing to, after Honey and South Side <br /> <br />The other ones I liked, but I didn't find anything exceptional about them, but the songs I listed above made up for that...
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Well first and foremost it is a sad state in music today.  Most record companies only want a single to sell a cd that sucks except for one catchy jingle that lasts its entire 15 mins of fame and dwindles into obscurity.  So that leads me to this band on which I am writing this review on.  This cd is one of the best pieces of music I own.  I am a huge music freak and own hundreds of cds from rock to rap to jazz you name it.  Frances the Mute is listened to daily by myself and is such a musical experience it is hard to describe but I will give it my best efforts.   <br /> <br /> If you yearn for music andlooking for something new and original I implore you to pick up this disc along with Deloused in the Comatorium (their first full album.)  Everytime I listen to this album I am taken to a full trance as music should be in my opinion.  It is refreshing to know that there is talent left out in the world and the watered down record companies don't dilute everything. If you get to see these guys (they are on tour now I saw them in Houston it was awesome) don't hesitate to see the show you will not be disappointed.  <br /> <br /> As a fellow guitar player I was literally in awe of the dexterity and amount of talent Omar has (and his ridiculous amount of effects pedals he had on stage) don't get me wrong the whole band is exceptional but Mr. Rodriquez-Lopez has to be seen in the flesh to apreciate the skill.  Don't take my word for it though go buy the album and see for yourself.
B000063UR2|5.0|I have loved this movie since i was a small girl. I remember every sunday my family would come to my Grandma's house to eat lunch and then we'd all sit around and watch t.v., and this movie would seem to always be playing! How can you not enjoy Tom Cruise running around in leaves and Tim Curry as huge-horned devil persona. The special edition is wonderful because it comes with a wonderful selection of cast pictures and commentaries. It also has Brain Ferris's music video \\"Is your Love Strong Enough\\". Which i repeatedly watched. You also get the origional European release, which has a full-scale orchestra and almsot 30 minutes of additional scenes! Everyone should own this in their Video collection!  <br />This case is fantastic to look at as well!
0446343129|5.0|William Dufty was WAY ahead of his time, when he wrote this book.  I read \\"Sugar Blues\\" over 15 years ago, and the health community is only now falling in line with what the author had been preaching, decades earlier.<br /><br />This health classic is a MUST read for anyone who wants to get well, or just improve their health.  It is my opinion that it should be required reading, for anyone who goes grocery shopping. It's packed with convincing and interesting facts, examples and anecodtes.  It even touches upon some historical accounts concerning the consumption of sugar, and it's negative impact.<br /><br />Another excellent book is, \\"You Are All Sanpaku\\" by George Oshawa.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I do not recomend purchasing Team America World Police beause of all of the cuss words that were used. When my friend and I went to see it in a movie theatre in Reston,We were totally shocked by the vulgarity of it and we should have walked out on it.<br />This movie is NOT worth Wasting your hard earned money on.<br />I personally think that Team America World Police was the Worst movie ever made. The is honestly the turth, The whole Truth and (&) nothing but the truth. 8-2-05
1400043662|4.0|This book has pleasantly surprised me. Murakami's writing is original and entertaining : quality literature and certainly not the everyday thriller novel that you can find by the dozens. Reality and fiction constantly mix to create a style full of metaphors and illusions. I certainly recommend this book, but at the same time I am not really tempted to go and read all of Murakami's other novels.
B00008AWOG|5.0|DO we need these long reviews?!?! Life is too short-- all I have to say about this album is....simply....WOW!!!!
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I saw and fell in love with the play years ago.  And while I never saw Sarah Brightman or Michael Crawford perform, the lead actors in Toronto were very, very good.  It seems as if I've been waiting a lifetime to see Phantom of the Opera become a movie, so imagine my surprise when I saw trailers announcing its arrival.  Usually people count down the days until a movie is released, but I went straight to: \\"When will the DVD be released?\\"  Well, it has been and I love this movie!  From the signature Phantom theme to the gorgeous sets to the near perfect casting, this movie does not embarrass anyone.  The movie is a pretty faithful adaptation of the play, with the exception of a couple of extra scenes to flesh out certain plot points.  Still, these additions flowed into the original material seamlessly.  I loved Gerard Butler's Phantom; he exuded just the right amount of charm, danger and sexiness.  And his voice (while not in the league of Rossum's and Wilson's) is not unpleasant and more than up to the task. I've never liked Raoul and I still don't, but at least he wasn't the drip the character often seemed on stage thanks to Patrick Wilson.  Still, one must wonder what was Christine thinking to pass up a sexy and virile man like the Phantom for the Viscount.  Emmy Rossum is gorgeous as Christine and her voice is even better than she looks, which is quite the feat.  I must agree with the person who didn't like the Phantom losing a sword fight to Raoul.  Are they kidding?  The Phantom wouldn't lose anything.  When you get right down to it, he never really lost Christine either.  Go for this movie, especially the 2 disc set.  It's a keeper.
0553573403|4.0|If you are older than fourteen and love this genre, you have no choice but to read this book. Unfortunately, when you get to hover around twenty like I am you find these particular series (Robin Hobb, Tolkien, Freidman, and even WOT)to be the foundation of your expectations and you run out of options fast!!!<br /><br />That said, reader be warned. I've read every one of these books as fast as they come out and towards the end you find yourself very frustrated, thinking that the series NEVER ends and that it's all going to hell in a handbasket. Obviously, it hasn't ended yet so that may well be true- all the original characters you love in the begining have all either died or changed so much that you hate them by the end- but don't worry, there are plenty more you like to take their place.<br /><br />The writing is pretty good, but what still impresses me is the unique character of this book. You will never ever read another series quite like it. Trust me, I have been searching for one for AGES. Sarah Douglass and Mercedes Lackey just can't conjure up something as \\"mature\\" as this. You'll know what I mean when you read it, go ahead and spend the seven bucks.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This movie is a gift to mankind I would say. Freeman and Robbins have shared a plot that has honor for every character involved. A great story of irony of human society and its laws, and the people who lost their wild-side to the emotions of behavioral causes.~ <br /> <br />This movie spreads that magic of consistent effort of life to bounce-back at odd conditions and a phenomenon called friendship!~
B0007TKH66|2.0|A trekkie's log... Stardate: present day... Mission: To explore the Enterprise First Season DVD?  This IS an anomoly.  PROS: (1) Fine ships, make-up and set design make it fun to compare the evolution of the Star Trek timeline. (2) The use of the Universal Translator and Space Suits add a realistic touch.  (3) A dog on board. Puppies rule!  CONS: (1) the characters are \\"lost in space\\", for example, the captain is a peaceful explorer, then suddenly, a vengeful tyrant. The writers can't decide. (2) A vulcan with emotions and sexual needs is illogical. (3) The ranting crewman with a heavy country twang?  Get serious!  Someone please beam him up... and OUT! (4) Beware of the future season when there is a war with a council of aliens, like the insect race. Can anybody say Star Wars rip-off, a la Geonosis?  My advice is just get ST: Nex Gen which contains the smartest writing and best cast, faithful to Gene Roddenberry's legacy! Live long...
B000268QB2|5.0|It's nice to find a CD these days where every single song on it is incredible.  Vocals and melody are awesome.  I would say this CD represents rock music of the 21st century. Whether you grew up with Pink Floyd, loved the Nirvana years, or love hip hop, you'll enjoy this!
B000003TA4|4.0|First of all, music doesn't have to be difficult to play in order to sound good. So saying Nirvana was talentless because they put their songs together in the most simplistic way possible doesn't have any merit. Anyway, every art form has its minimalists and maximalists, and each style has its own pros and cons, and I'm not going to argue one over the other. Kurt Cobain was a good song writer. Not necessarily a great one, but hearing Smells Like Teen Spirit get radio play in the early nineties was at least a little refreshing. Still, I don't think MTV was the right place for Nirvana. Had they stayed underground they no doubt would have been recognized as one of the greatest indie rock bands of all time and at least have been able to retain some respect. Anyway, Smells Like Teen Spirit is, in my opinion, the greatest song of generation X, and it is also my opinion that Cobain's writing it was somewhat a fluke, as no other song by them even holds a candle to it. Still, there are some really good songs on this album if you're willing to put your technical listening aside and just hear the music as is.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD is great.  I love it.  I had stopped buying R&B cd's because I only liked the 2 singles that came on the radio. This CD has surpassed all others. I love, love this CD. Thank you Miriah, it was well worth the wait.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Even though it was released in 1978,to me it is one of the best 80's hard rock albums right up there with appetite for destuction and Back In Black. Heres what I think of each song.    1.Runnin With The Devil (5/5)- Great Riff, Classic song  2.Eruption (5/5)- Great solo, never gets old  3.You Really Got Me (5/5)- sure its a cover but Van Halen makes it there own  4.Aint Talkin Bout Love (5/5)- A Heavy pissed off ballad  5.Im The One (4.5/5)- highlight of the album, awesome guitar  6.Jamie's Crying (4/5)- Catchy song although im kinda sick of it  7.Atomic Punk (4/5)- cool intro, lyrics are kinda stupid  8.Feel Your Love Tonight (3.5/5)- total hair metal, but catchy   9.Little Dreamer (3/5)- Good song but I usually skip it  10.Ice Cream Man (4.5/5)- Another cover tune, awesome solo  11.On Fire (4/5)- Gets me in a headbanging mood     Anyways If you like Harder Rock music or just plain rock than buy it.If you like metal maybe listen to it first (more hardcore metal fans probably wont like it). If you wanna now what Van Halens all about dont listen too 1984, listen to this instead.    If you liked this album you might also enjoy:  Ozzy Osbourne-Blizzard Of Ozz  Def Leppard-Pyromania  Ratt- Out Of The Cellar  Scorpions-Blackout
B00005JNVS|5.0|I wonrk in a movie theatre and have been disappointed to see that barely anyone is coming to see this movie.  Not only is the score excellent, but the action is good and refreshinly void of wire-fighting.  This is definantly something worth seeing if you have not already.  Though I get to see the movies for free, I do not hesitate to say that I would pay to see this movie, and that should mean a lot coming from me, the miser.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|The Fan Favorite. There darkest heaviest album. Hugely underated. Heres What I think of the songs.    1.Mean Streets (5/5)- My favorite Van Halen song, Eddies sweetest solo ever  2.Dirty Movie's (4.5/5)- Funny Song about porn stars  3.Sinners Swing (3.5/5)- cool song  4.Hear About It Later (4/5)- good ballad song  5.Unchained (5/5)- Sweet Riff, listen for what dave has to say after the solo  6.When Push Comes Too Shove (3/5)- Disco like  7.So This Is Love (5/5)- A really catchy song, cool bassline  8.Sunday Afternoon In The Park (3/5)-Dark song done by synthesizers  9.One Foot Out The Door (4.5/5)- A pissed off song, sweet lyrics    If You liked this album youll probobly also like-  Ratt- Out Of The Cellar  The Scorpions- Love At first sting  Ozzy Osbourne-Diary Of A Madman
0920668372|1.0|We received this as a gift and I just broke it out recently at bedtime. It seemed sweet enough but when the mom continues to crawl across the room at night and take her teenager into her arms - I thought, huh?!? Then when she drives across town with a ladder to sneak into her grown son's room to do the same thing? I think this one will go into the donate pile unfortunately - it's just too weird for my taste.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|the Riffing in this album is more bleak than there previous album's but it makes up for it in heavyness. Heres what I think of the songs.    1.And The Cradle Will Rock (4.5/5)- The main riff in this song is actually done on keyboards.  2.Everybody Wants Some- (5/5)- Hard as hell, the whammy bar effects are awesome  3.Fools (4/5)- Awesome intro, starts of bluesy and then bursts in too a sweet tapping solo  4.Romeo Delight (4/5)- sweet lyrics, \\"Wanna see my I.D.? Try to clip my wings!Don't have to show you proof of anything.  I know the law friend.\\"  5.Tora! Tora! (4.5/5)- sweet intro track to loss of control  6.Loss Of Control (4/5)- A total Thrash Metal Song  7.Take your whiskey home (4/5)-   8.Could This Be Magic (2.5/5)- Experimental acoustic pop song, not very good but hey at least they tried  9.In A Simple Rhyme (3.5/5)- I didnt like it at first but it grew on me    If you liked this album you might also like:   The Scorpions-Animal Magnetism
B0000062S0|1.0|Its very hard to understand how two seasoned musicians of the calibre of Page and Plant could produce such a dud album.The production sounds like some cheap demo, but not in a good sense, just dull and flat. After Jimmys return to form on the Coverdale Page album, he sounds restrained and uninspired on this one. (much like he did on Zeps Inn through the Out Door) <br />And I dont care what Mr.Plant thinks, the vocal performance and the songs on this disc still arnt as good as any Whitesnake album.Rob hasnt sounded any good since Physical Graffiti anyway, but all of his post Zep work still craps on this effort.If your gonna bag Coverdale you have to do better than this! What a letdown.
1593974256|3.0|I would compare the Butlerian Jihad Dune prequels with some of the Harry Turtledove series like the World War and Great War Alternate Histories.  Lots of characters and subplots but only one or two that really matter.  Probably the entire trilogy could have been done in one book that concentrated on Vor, Serena, the Valiant Harkonnens, Erasmus, and Agamemnon.  The Guild, Bene Gesserit, and Fremen subplots didn't really work. <br /> <br />The end of \\"Battle of Corrin\\"  seems to be setting us up for yet another prequel trilogy documenting the birth of the Guild, the Landsraad, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and the Mentats.  I hope not, but I will probably read them anyway. <br /> <br />Its a shame that Herbert died before we could get his entire vision though these books aren't as hard to follow as those by Chris Tolkien.
6303477259|5.0|This is absolutely the best concert on video that I have ever witnessed. I originally had it on VHS, then got it on laser disc and eventually copied the laser disc version (145 minutes long) via an analog to digital converter onto my laptop where I was able to burn it to DVD. If you can get your hands on the VHS or any format, you will never regret the purchase. I have watched the concert many times and have yet to get tired of it. The music and performances are flawless and mezmorizing.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The voice is back.. Her much needed and well deserved break did her voice and career justice.  Finally an artist that has talent, without all the studio gadgets to help enhace her vocally.  She is amazing, this is why she is the best selling female artist of all time, no one has come close.  I love her and look forward to hearing more new music from her in the future.
B000056K04|2.0|This CD reflects what music was going through in 2001 when it was released.  Alternative had died out a few years earlier.  Jangle rock and boy bands were the rage.  The music was all being driven by certain producers, and not the artists.  Producers were creating bands or changing the direction of existing bands.  Artists were not creating.  Producers were continually reproducing the sound that had scored big.    This is a producer's album.  It was produced by Glen Ballard, who also co-wrote all of the songs.  He molded and guided Matthews in his own image.      Before this Ballard had produced for Barbara Striesand, Paula Abdul, Wilson Philips, the Corrs, Michael Jackson and Alanis Morrissette.  Ballard took that same formula on put it on this album.  What you end up with is the Dave Matthews Band trying to do pop.    I applaud bands for experimenting and trying new things.  But, it is the artists who must have the creative spark to change to be successful.  It is rare that an artist is successful when being driven to change by a producer, or trying to change according to the prevailing musical styles.      While Glen Ballard's pop style has worked with some artists, Dave Matthews is really not a pop star.  I think that this music emphasizes Matthews' weaknesses while rarely highlighting his strengths.    This CD starts out well, and the first two songs are very good.  But, after that, the songs just get tedious, boring, and in some cases sappy.  Space Between is just hard to get through.  Dreams of Our Fathers is somewhat better, but then ends with this horrible buzzing.  If you listen to it through headphones, it sounds like you have a fly in your ear.    The next four songs are fairly poor, but the CD does pick up again at the end.  Sleep to Dream Her and Everyday are fairly nice songs.  Mother Father is very good, poignant song, but it repeats to much and becomes draining in the first two minutes.  I aslo think that the guitar work at the end is too bombasticfor the material.  A slower, blues working of the song probably would have been more effective.    I think the period of 1997 to 2001 was a pretty dreary time for music.  I think a good  companion CD for this album would be U2's It's A Beautiful Day.  It is the same kind of popish-jangle rock style of music.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|A classic disney tale of the classic book.  A great film for the whole family to see of a little girl who goes into her own little fantasy world of white rabbits, a mad hatter, and the evil queen of Dimands.  A great way to spend time with the kids and entertaining enough to keep your attention throughout the whole movie.
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|Please, listen.  \\"An ordinary businessman finds a new meaning of life after jumping into the world of social dancing.\\"  That's the story of the original Japanese film 'Shall We Dance,' isn't it?  Mr. Everyman in suit transforms himself into something new, something he never dreamed of, right? <br /> <br />[RICHARD GERE???] So why casting Richard Gere as Mr. John Clark, the unlikely romantic hero of the Hollywood remake?  Ok, I like him, and I think he is underrated, but Richard Gere never, ever, looks like an ordinary businessman.  Period.  I'm not talking about his acting, which is very good here.  Gere's Mr. Clark, typical family man, opens the door of a dancing school (and he commutes everyday, looking up at the window of the school), and at first he even does not a single step.  Come on!  I still remember Richard Gere tap-dancing beautifully in 'Chicago.'  And incidentally, the US version 'Shall We Dance' is set in Chicago (though shot in Winnipeg). <br /> <br />Jennifer Lopez plays the dancing teacher Paulina, and Susan Sarandon wife of Mr. Clark, Beverly, suspecting her husband's having an affair.  The cast is not to be blamed for they are showing the best they could do, but I cannot help feeling that we are watching the photocopy of the original film.  You can spot the counterparts of the Japanese version in Stanley Tucci, Lisa Ann Walter, and Anita Gillette.  But maybe that is not the real reason if you feel that something is missing from this Peter Chelsom film. <br /> <br />Why is the original 'Shall We Dance' so charming?  I guess the reason is simple.  The image of Japanese.  You don't think Japanese, usually thought shy people, can be dancing in the ballroom (I'm a Japanese and can say we don't either), but the film shows its unlikely moments in such a funny and delightful way.  Gere's part was played in the original by Yakusho Koji, and his (stage) name 'Yakusho' means 'public office.'  And that's the point, for he is exactly the image of the ordinaryJapanese businessman.  But now the cultural background is gone, and the remaining story becomes a typical example of 'Lost in Translation.'   <br /> <br />For all its flaws, however, newer 'Shall We Dance' is not as bad as you might think.  It's a feel-good movie, and pleasant to see.  It's just -- 'Why did they remake this in the first place?'
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is a tale of America's culture from the 50s through almost the present day, and it is brilliantly done.  Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump is quite simply flawless as an idiot savant who comes into contact with most of the significant events and people of his day. I have always liked Hanks as an actor, and here he puts in an unusual and yes, a brilliant performance.<br /><br />But the real star of the movie is America of the 50s through the early 80s.  The portion of the film that dealt with the Vietnam conflict was unforgettable, as we see large numbers of ordinary American boys swept into a conflict that they little understood.  Gary Sinise puts in a very creditable performance as Lt. Dan, Forrest's platoon leader in Vietnam for whom the war is a personal tragedy.<br /><br />The film hilariously shows Forrest Gump navigate through many of the key events in history during the periods.  He meets Elvis and influences his style.  He meets President Kennedy. He has a ringside seat in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. He is caught up in the Vietnam War.  He meets President Nixon and inadvertantly triggers the Watergate scandal (this part is really a hoot).  The film's portrayal of the hippies and radicals of the 60s is particularly funny and in fact rings true.<br /><br />This is a film that almost everyone will like, and which will touch even the most hard-boiled viewer.  The DVD is a terrific value, and most viewers will enjoy watching this one many times.
0671027387|5.0|Dan Brown knows just how to keep you hanging on... to the point that I could not put this book down!  Every spare moment I had, I was digging in and trying to figure it out.  It keeps moving the whole time, full of action and moments when you are down right befuddled!  A true sign of an excellent writer, he elicits many emotions, some simultaneously!  What happens in just over 24 hours is amazing.  Long before the hit TV show \\"24\\", this author had 24 hours of action and adventure all figured out.
B000929AJQ|5.0|As any good Nails fan would, I've burned grooves into both sides of this disc from non-stop play (CD in the car and DVD at home/work).  <br /> <br />First, I'll say that if you have access to a surround sound setup, pop this in. It's so amazingly different than stereo that you'll want to install 5.1 everywhere and wish every disc you owned received the time & attention that was devoted to With Teeth. Now that my plug for King Nerd is out of the way... <br /> <br />There are already plenty of reviews saying what sucks, what's great, blah blah blah. Here's the down & dirty, my curious friends, from a hardcore Listener's perspective. <br /> <br />Trent is a ferret. He can't sit still, he can't leave (what you might think is) perfect alone, and he's always searching for new ways to look at things, to process them, and to present them to us. That being said, I don't like most albums on the first listen if they're done by an artist who is truly genius, as Trent has repeatedly proven he is. Yes is, not was. <br /> <br />So I never judge an album on the first listen. How arrogant can you get? The guy spends 4+ years working on a record and you're going to make a call on the whole thing in the 70 minutes it took you listen to it just one time? I don't think so. Also, like Radiohead, he always pushing into that new territory while remaining familiar enough underneath the surface to retain his identity. For those complaining that With Teeth is too similar to his previous works, did you expect him to do a country album? The exploration of new territories will always bring complaints from the unimaginative. It also brings diehard fans who proclaim every track to be the best yet. Is this Trent's best album? I don't know. I've only listened to it for 2 days. It takes at least a week to begin to get a feel. What I can say is that Trent's previous albums have been the best at what he set out to do. <br /> <br />You have to digest any great album a little bit at a time. What did youlove at first? What more do you hear in those tracks every time you listen now? What didn't you like, but is now stuck in your head, clawing at you to play it again and figure out what's so great about it? He's not an idiot and he's certainly not an amateur. With all the time, effort, and self he puts into every track, do you think he's going to crank out a flop?  <br /> <br />To those that say he \\"just didn't try\\" on With Teeth - Sorry chief, but you didn't try to listen to what he's trying to express and accomplish. If you listened, not just heard, and gave it a sliver of the thought he's clearly put into this unique record, you'd recognize the greatness of an artist who has always kicked the bar so high no imitators could even approach jumping near it, much less over it. <br /> <br />Bottom line: With Teeth is exactly what you would expect from NIN. Familiar enough to keep you hooked, but fresh enough to keep you continually interested, searching deeper into the music with every consecutive listen. It's a primitive sound, but what better way to express that raw, bloody nerve of emotion?  <br /> <br />And as for Trent dwelling in teenage angst, well great for him and for us! As they age, so many people lose the passion (positive, negative, whatever) they had as children & teenagers and that's such a sad effect of our culture. I couldn't be more grateful that Trent has kept his (and mine) alive for so many years. If you want contract-required junk, go buy another record. If you want to be challenged and sucked into an album (not just a collection of singles), drowning in amazement at its beauty and genius, spend the few dollars to pick this up as soon as you can get your hands on it. Long live Trent. He continues to inspire legions of fans and define what music is and should be.
B000002J29|5.0|Second's Out, by Genesis, turned my life around. Don't you just love overenthusiastic statements like that? Well, I remember sneaking into my brother's room when he was out, snatching a copy of Second's Out from his turntable, putting on the headphones, listening to it from start to finish in the dark, while looking out the window waiting for his car to pull back into our driveway, so I'd have enough time to run back into his room (still in the dark) and place it back onto his turntable at exactly the right axis he left it at. If the inside record label was even slightly too much to the right, I was always paranoid that he'd find out I was playing his records again and he'd yell at me! He was 8 years older than me and much bigger! He was an avid prog-rock fan and had dozens of albums, and treated them all like gold.<br />ELP was my first love and I thought no other band could amaze me so much, until my brother bought Second's Out and I heard it playing in his room all of the time. I was too young and poor at 13 and my mother wouldn't buy albums for me because she thought I'd scratch them all, so I would listen to my brother's.<br />Second's Out, from the Chester Thompson stick-click count off into Squonk, to the very exhausting end of Los Endos, was nearly a spiritual album for me. It was the first time I heard magic on a record. Like being a child and hearing fairy tales, but now being older and hearing how they would sound. I was unaware of even who Peter Gabriel was, so I had no compunction about calling Phil my favorite singer and the only one for these songs. Today, of course, I could not be more of a Gabriel fan and have seen every tour since the Security tour of 1982-83!<br />But Phil's smoky voice and warmly passionate delivery was the best voice I'd heard to that date. Each song was rendered so magical and potent, that it's still hard to believe this was a live concert recording in Paris. I guess we credit David Hentschel for his production, and the band for their artistry and transcendence. Everything had the right amount of reverb on it. Even the synth solo on Robbery, Assault & Battery should have no right to sound as not dated as it does! Banks and Hackett truly carry the melodic brilliance and performance of these songs, on the backs of the most musical, dramatic and firey rhythm section work you're likely to hear. To me, there is more fire in these performances than in any Metallica or Sex Pistols album recorded. This music was edgy, and ballsy. Today there are still metalheads and jazzers going 'How the heck did they write and perform something as mind-boggling as Apocalypse in 9/8??!!'. How did they, indeed? Speaking of which, Supper's Ready always intimidated me. I broke into this album side by side. First it was Side one. Then Side Two, with Firth of Fifth, and Hackett's pained guitar seagull cries that<br />dive and swipe, and that guitar solo having three or FOUR climaxes! I Know What I Like introduced me to the silly side of Phil Collins and was a nice<br />breath-catching moment.<br />When I did listen to Supper's Ready, each section captured me and sucked me in until I had to listen to the whole song at every sitting, each time taking me on a musical journey in my head. I thought, 'How could there be 5 individuals on the planet who were so on the exact same wavelength to create music so seamless and transcendent as this? Why am I getting so high off this music??!! Is it affecting anyone else out there as much as it was me??!!'. Yes came close at times, but even their musical individuality often threatened to split apart the majesty of their collaborations, and did on 'Tormato'. Second's Out is a documented treasure of those 5 individuals in Genesis and their timeless music. There is no more exciting live album than Second's Out.<br />U2 came close with 'Bad', but that's not a full-length live album. Can they ever capture their music as passionately as Genesis did with theirs on Second's Out? I haven't heard it yet. Has Radiohead? \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" is great, but they haven't yet, either.<br />Last word, on Cinema Show. Bill Bruford threatens to steal the whole album with his performance on drums there. If you are a drummer, listen to the rapid-fire kick drum work in the song's instrumental climax towards the end of the song. I love King Crimson, but I can't think of many times when he has bettered himself in a live album than what he plays on Cinema Show. How about those synth solos? Still damn impressive! I was CRUSHED when Steve Hackett left the group. I enjoyed his solo albums, but I knew he could not end up doing anything as brilliant as Second's Out. Or Supper's Ready. Or Trick of the Tail. Or Ripples. Or Eleventh Earl of Mar. The man had Phil Collins as his drummer!! Tony Banks as his keyboardist!<br />Mike Rutherford as his bassist!! Hackett's departure, especially after the release of Second's Out, hit me more hard than Gabriel's actually did! Nonetheless, this classic album needs to be heard and appreciated for what it is: One of the best representations of any live band recorded in concert. At the top of their game. A live album of previously-recorded material that nearly beats every studio version of the songs it repeats. Presenting perfect performances that are so well blended as one, you wish other bands could do theirs as good.<br />Oh, and if you didn't know, while all of this was going on, as this music was pouring out of their souls, Genesis had one of the best light shows ever. They always had state of the art lighting systems, lasers and fog that could create heaven or hell along with their music in concert. Sometimes on this album, you can hear the French audience gasping and cheering for no apparent reason (\\"Afterglow\\"). The reason was the lights, so meticulously choreographed to the songs as to create a thrilling, never before seen audio and visual emotional spectacle in real time. If you don't believe me, read some of the reviews from the time. I saw it on the And Then There Were Three tour of 1978. There were lasers bouncing off of six giant mirrors above the band's heads and fog swirling through it all. By the time Genesis ended up playing stadiums, they were so far ahead of the live show that they were selling tickets based on their word of mouth alone.<br />I believe Cirque du Soleil is STILL trying to out do them with their sound and lighting nearly thirty years later!! But with no DVD of the show to view in 5.1 Surround from that date, we're left with the music, gloriously on display.<br />Buy the new mastered version of Second's Out, put on a good pair of headphones, relax and put on Supper's Ready. From the moment Collin's casually announces 'Supper's Ready', you will be taken on a ride. By the time you reach Phil angelicly singing '666 is no longer alone', if you are not completely moved, than you probably have no pulse. Or taste. Enjoy!\\"I Might Be Wrong\\" is great, but they haven't yet, either.  Last word, on Cinema Show. Bill Bruford threatens to steal the whole album with his performance on drums there.

0060977264|4.0|I'm a big fan Paulo Coelho.  I was inspired by the Alchemist, moved by the Fifth Mountain, and greatly intrigued by Veronika Decides To Die.  This was the second of his novels I read, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I had no idea what I was reading when I bought it.  It was a whimsical purchase.  I bought it based on my liking of the Alchemist.  The plot of this book is easily explained in the editorial reviews, so, I'll just keep this as simple as possible.  Paul Coelho writes a love story here.  Tender, moving, inspiring, and heartfelt.  I like Coelho's style.  He doesn't bog the reader down with a ton of fanciful imagery.  He only uses literary devices that are essential to his story.  He never overdoes it, nor does he underplay anything.  All of this is applicable to this novel, a pleasant surprise.  I've read better novels, but, this one hit all the right notes.  Sure, it was a bit sappy, and the feminine-sided religion was a little overkill at times, but, that's easily excusable for such a good book.
B000001C6M|3.0|if you where buying metal albums back in the early 80's as i was,this album got your attention.this was much heavier than Metallica,much better musicianship than Venom-their really werent any contenders(Bathory was at least another year or two away). <br />slayer took the dual guitar attack of Judas Priest,coupled it with the-then emerging thrash scene and a monster was born.i always prefered Slayer to other thrash bands because they where HEAVY.speed was secondary to the almighty riff. <br />Today,this album has aged REASONABLY well.the cover and it's lyrical attempts at evil are just plain ridiculous.it is really funny to me that concerned parents REALLY bought that this stuff was to be taken seriously! <br />anyway,the lyrics and some of the musical arrangements on this album firmly place it in the early 1980's.for that reason,the three stars.true classics should be timeless.this one is not.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|THIS IS THE MOSE PUNK ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!! Avril is a goddess on the guitar and writes music better than ANYONE else. She is also da best s8kt0r in history. Her lyrics are genius. All the 5 star reviewers here are genius and cultered, just like myself. Like many people, I love talented musicians. And where do you find those? TRL of course!! You should get this if you want good music. If you want good music then also get:    -Nirvana (music became good after them and Kurt is second to only avril on guitar)  - Good Charlotte, Blink 182, Simple plan (brutal punk rock)  - g-unit (there is no greater team of musicians with more overall talent)  - Vanilla Ice (created Rap and hip-hop. Ice Ice baby!)  - Kenny G (he's sold more albums than any other instrumental \\"artist\\", so therefore he is better)  - Ashlee Simpson   - Limp Bizkit (created metal)  -Linkin Park  -Metallica (St Anger may be the best metal album ever that doesn't feature Fred Durst)    This is what you should not get:    -Miles Davis (this guy was a poser. Get Kenny G instead)  -baroque classical posers like Mozart, Bach, Paganini, Beethoven, Chopin etc   -self proclaimed \\"rock\\" bands ie Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, The Who, Queen etc  -posers who think they can play the guitar (Segovia, Rhodes, Satriani, Friedman, Holdsworth, Reinhardt, Van Halen etc)  - socalled \\"metal bands\\" like old Metallica, Megadeth, Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden  -any of that \\"progressive\\" crap like Dream Theater
B000002I2G|4.0|The \\"Soft Parade\\" (1969), while not the Doors best work, is a rather underrated and misunderstood album.<br /><br />When this album came out, critics and fans alike blasted The Doors for selling out. In addition, many fans objected to the orchestration and strings.<br /><br />To address these criticisms, indeed, this is, by far, The Doors most pop/commercial album. When this album first came out in 1969, in the wake of such masterpieces as \\"The Doors,\\" (1967) and \\"Strange Days,\\" (1967), it is understandable why a fan might be bothered by the pop direction the band decided to take. However, in 2005, with the passage of time, if you look at the Doors entire catalogue through hindsight, you will see that this was merely a phase in the evolution of the band's sound. They went from playing acid rock (The Doors, Strange Days) to more commercial, safe rock (Waiting for the Sun, 1968, The Soft Parade) to blues rock (Morrison Hotel, 1970, LA Woman, 1971). If you look at \\"The Soft Parade\\" though that perspective, you will hopefully not be bothered with the overly commercial aspect of the album<br /><br />As for the string/orchestration, I feel, for the most part, that the songs are enhanced, not hindered by their inclusion. The string/orchestration does not work on all the songs, but for the most part, it suits the album well.<br /><br />Some of The Doors finest songs are on \\"The Soft Parade.\\" Morrison gives one of his finest vocal performances on \\"Tell all the People.\\" \\"Touch Me\\" is one of the best pop songs from the 1960s. \\"Wishful Sinful\\" is simply beautiful and could have been one of their biggest hits, had it had been released as the first single. \\"Sherman's Blues\\" is epic, beautiful. The title track, \\"The Soft Parade\\" is probably the albums, and one of the Doors, most underrated songs. It's an epic, in a similar vein as \\"The End,\\" \\"When the Music's Over,\\" and \\"LA Woman.\\" But \\"The Soft Parade\\" is more off-beat, left-of-center. It's a really cool song that's not given the credit it's due. The rest of the CD is quite strong. The only song that I'm not crazy about is \\"Do it,\\" although I'll give the Doors credit for trying.<br /><br />In one respect, I see \\"The Soft Parade\\" as the end of an era. It was the last album in which Jim Morrison looked, and sounded young, vibrant. Although the Doors would go on to release some of the best music of their career with \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and \\"LA Woman,\\" the Lizard King's voice was a ghost of what it had been.<br /><br />Although \\"The Soft Parade\\" is not the best album by the Doors, it's still a fine album and has a lot to offer a Doors fan.rest of the CD is quite strong.

0446677450|4.0|This book has changed the way I am looking at my life and financial future. I am planning on giving copies to my friends. My Mom became very excited after reading this book and told me to read it.  I wasn't very much into it but as I kept reading, I knew I was wrong about it.  Great book and easy read.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonc has an incredible voice, and she knows how to use it. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Naughty Girl\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\" are very dancing, but the majority of this album is composed of ballads. <br /> <br />\\"Speechless\\", \\"The Closer I Get To You\\", \\"Dangerously In Love\\" are very emotive. <br /> <br />But if you don't like ballads, you will be bored, because this album is full of it. <br /> <br />So I put four stars for the voice and the songs, but I think it's quite boring nevertheless.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|First I want to say if you're thinking this is a horror flick, forget it, you'll be bored and nasty, so don't bother.If you expecting the stage play,it's not, so check those thoughts at the door or you'll be like so many others who thought it could have been better or one of those who poo-pooed it for not being exactly like the play. I say here and now if you want to see the play, go see the play, I'm going to as soon as I can. But, I refuse to compare it to the film because it's not the film. I have to admit I get impatient with those who want movies to be exactly like the books or plays they were based on. Movies are a differnt species. They have to be adapted for the screen, things that work in a book or on stage don't always work on film and vise versa. So that being said, if you want to be entertained by an excellent story and beautiful music via motion picture this is a movie for you, it has dashing men, beautiful women and the music is, in a word, stunning.    Second, if you're familiar with Andrew Lloyd Webber's work you know to expect wall to wall music with little or no dialogue. So I'm giving those who aren't sure if they really like music fair warning on this issue. It's almost entirely music. The movie doesn't need that much dialogue anyway, it sings what it wants to say, and does so beautifully. Music is the language of our emotions, especially when there are no words to say what we feel, and it capitalizes our emotions when there are words to express them. My musical being was nourished by this film, I came away blissfully satisfied and glad I'm alive to hear and experience such beauty. I was overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of this film. I cut my teeth on movie musicals and none took my breath away like this one, (musical or not). I didn't get to see the stage version but I have the original broadway cast recording and have listened to it a zillion times and have sung these songs for years. I have gone to other stage productions of musicals that weremade into movies and I agree that there is no way a film can capture what happens at a live performance. However, this film is about as close as one can get to the energy and tangable vibe of a live production.      Gerard Butler is the perfect movie phantom. I loved the raw emotion in his voice. I will draw a comparison here; Michael Crawford has a gorgeous voice and no doubt made the perfect stage phantom, but when I listen to the performances back to back , his voice is too beautiful for me, it doesn't have the agony and intense rage or raw seductive power that Gerard Butler has. When I hear Crawford's voice I want to say \\"Oh, How pretty!\\" But when I hear Butler's voice I want to...Uh... I don't think I can write it in a review, can I? When Butler sings \\"Music Of The Night\\" it's like gentle, seductive kisses on the ear. My ear hears it but my body feels it. This has never happened to me while watching a movie musical.       Every performance was right on target. Emmy Rossum touches my soul when she sings \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here again\\", I was listening to it earlier today and it prompted me to stop by my dad's so I could tell him I'm glad he's still with me and give him a big hug. Honestly, Sarah Brightman never made me want to do that, and her voice is beyond compare. So, Miss Rossum must have a way with a musical phrase that Ms. Brightman does not.     Patrick Wilson's Raoul may seem a little stiff but I don't think that is an error. I think it's intentional, you know he gets the girl anyway, and I think he has to portray Raoul that way in order to emphasize the Phantom's vulnerability and to make him more sympathetic. It was smoothly calculated on Wilson's part and to me it was spot on.     All in all I adore this film, it has shoved some of my life long favorite movie musicals right off the list and has made itself #1 for me. I'll be watching this movie and continuing to sing it's songs for years to come.     The second disc has all the supplemental material on it and I thoroughly enjoyed the back story and all the behind the scenes stuff, but the DVD-Rom extra with the cast and crew singing \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" in their own special way was a hoot! I loved it!       I hope you'll enjoy this picture because it is so worth your time. Please, I urge you to surrender to the music of the night and go to bed with a smile on your face.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Hum, I don't know what Britney has to do with this album. <br /> <br />She didn't write the lyrics of her songs and her voice was changed by a computer (just listen to \\"Toxic\\", we could think it was all made by a computer). <br /> <br />The songs are meaningless, the music is poor. <br />Where are the instruments ? <br /> <br />It's a poor album, made especially to be bought. <br /> <br />When will Britney become a true artist who writes and sings her songs ?
068987474X|1.0|The only reason I'm reviewing this at all is that the title sounded refreshingly down-to-earth, and I'm very interested in how pop psychology and the media address the entire discourse of gender and difference.  What I got was that guys are go-for-broke hunters, and women are apathetic worriers.  And it's not even 1956 anymore.  Maybe it's time for another sexual revolution.     I'm 25 years old, a college graduate, sociable, single, told I'm attractive (and tend to agree), and sporadically sexually active.  Also like most young people, I go to bars regularly, but unlike them, date very seldomly.      That said, I consider myself \\"in\\" on the type of crowd that seems to be suggested in this book.  And yes, I have found myself \\"just not that into\\" a vast, ever-expanding number of people who may have been better off for having gotten advice like this book's title.  But I have never misled anyone or set a negative-feedback-loop trap for them.  When I want the attention of someone, why the hell should I take all the initiative?    Read: in a world of equality, equal opportunity, and equal rights, I subscribe to the notion of equal work by both parties.  I don't NEED to hound anyone to go out with me, and neither would the people I'd be interested in.  It's not some tipped-scale game; it's the exercise of pure interest.  If the contemporary view is that people are equal, then the behavior shouldn't need to play into gender expectation and role-taking.  Come on, people.  Get over it and get out of the house.  And stop reading checkout-lane flipbooks that claim to be able to explain away your deeper social shortcomings.  Stop right now.
0670033375|2.0|This book was the most disappointing that I have read in years. I was a huge fan of Guns, Germs and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee but this book was definitely not up to the standard set by Diamond with those two. <br />While the book is clearly very well researched, and thoroughly explores issues brought forward, it gets lost in Diamond's rhetoric and preaching about environmental measures that must be taken. At times I was sure that I was reading a book by Naomi Klein. <br />Unfortunately, this book does not live up to previous titles by Diamond.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I thought this was a great album, i didnt like it too much at first, but it really grew on me, for the record, my favorite was the fragile, but this is good as well, if your into the really hard NIN, this probably isnt for you, but if your looking for something different, something with a little more groovin' if thats the right word, the medium, not heavy, not light songs, than this is definately for you ^_^
B0008ISM40|2.0|I want to start out by saying that I have been a huge nine inch nails fan for years. The Fragile and Downward Spiral and Pretty Hate Machine are three of my favorite albums ever, which makes this hurt even more. It feels like to me that Reznor is trying to dumb himself down, or that this is some kind of cruel joke. Some of my friends really like it, unfortunately they are the same friends who like Lil' Jon and the East Side Boys, Disturbed, Smile Empty Soul, Shinedown, and a host of other talentless hacks. Maybe I am getting too old and losing touch myself? I'm not sure. My two major gripes are the lyrics and vocals...the music is tolerable. I suppose it's possilbe that I was too hyped up about this and I was hoping that maybe I would come around on this, but after a few listens I honestly don't think I can even stomach giving this a chance. I give this 2 stars only because I still think Reznor is a musical genious, he just let me down. Oh well, there is still new Tool and Radiohead to look forward too. Buy the new Queens of the Stone Age, or Beck, or Gorillaz, or Porcupine Tree albums, skip this one.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|DOnt get me wrong- I love DT- or at least- until this album- SEEMS AS IF THEY HAVE NO PASSION FOR REAL MUSIC ON THIS- JUST MINDLESS METAL!!! Rapping? aaahhhhh!!!! MEtallica tribute? aaahhh!!!! Images and Words please- sooth my ears!!
0375418407|4.0|This review covers the audio tape version (4 Cassettes, 6 Hours).  This was a really good pre-SW Ep 1 movie.  It goes a long way to filling in a lot of the chess moves made prior to Trade Federation blockade of Naboo.  I felt that the story was a little rough in places, as though trying to keep track of one too many story tracks.  Alexander Adams does a very good job of acting out all of the parts, with the usual good music and sound effects blazing away in the background.  The audio is crisp and clear, and is easily heard in my car's stereo.  Well worth the purchase price.
B000929AJQ|1.0|Unlike Trent's previous material, this is a bad album and it's not worth the money. There's plenty of places on the internet where you can download or listen to the album for yourself prior to buying (the official nin page at myspace, for example). Do that first, because this isn't even worth the money and doesn't really deserve anymore sales.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've never considered myself a \\"Green Day fan\\".  I've got a few of their albums; I'm a record producer and a musician myself and have performed in front of audiences almost as large as they did at Woodstock in 1994 (which by the way, the \\"mud event\\" is one of the greatest bits of rock and roll footage in the last 20 years). <br /> <br />This album is a great album.  The ultimate irony is the splattering of shallow critiques saying the band sucks.  This is the epitomy of the \\"American Idiot\\" metaphor that Green Day is talking about: short-attention-spanned idiots who bounce from one distraction to another in search of life's meaning, when ultimately the pursuit of happiness is a marketing gimmick. <br /> <br />To those who claim the band has changed... DUH!  You try playing the exact same music for 15+ years.  It's not possible.  However, the essence of what Green Day sounds like and their rebellious souls have not changed.  And best of all, it's the same, original band, which is pretty atypical these days. <br /> <br />Personally, I think the \\"American Idiot\\" referred to is strikingly similar to the conservative Republican movement - it fits right in with them being distracted (\\"Novacaine\\") and frustrated.  To the guy who says that politics shouldn't be in music, he's a moron... since the dawn of human creation, music and art has been primarily about politics.  Sheesh. <br /> <br />This is a good album for anybody, whether you're familiar with Green Day or not, and ironically, even if you are an \\"American Idiot\\", if you get a chance to listen to the entire album, you'll be converted.
B0008ISM40|1.0|It's not good. Don't buy it. Most of the 5 star reviews are being posted by unquestioning fans who copy and paste magazine reviews (and there's not many to choose from, because most rate it as mediocre) and put a 5 star rating on it. The one below me for example, about a sense of \\"urgency.\\"
B000929AJQ|3.0|Let me first say, as many others, I've been a NIN worshipper for many years. I first got into them when buying The Downward Spiral when I was like 12 and since then I've purchased all albums, singles, remix albums, lots of bootlegs, merchandise, etc etc etc. I'm certainly not one of those poser fans who bought a few albums and only listen to the singles on them (I know some like that).     I was excited to hear about their new album, until I heard the first single \\"Hand that Feeds.\\" The song was good and catchy, but lacked innovation, depth, and the originality Trent always put into his music. So I bought the album without thinking twice, and let me just say that out of 13 new tracks, only a small handful are really worth listening to (like 5 songs). All the rest feel like tracks taken from remix albums that we're also so used to seeing from Trent (give it another year, there'll be a remix album of this one too).   I wanted to like it, I did somewhat, but the whole time listening I couldn't help but feel that Trent could certainly do better than this. Most of the 5 star reviews here are probably from people NIN newbies who don't really know what Trent is really capable of. \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" was a classic, mixing industrial with synth pop and angsty lyrics, while \\"Broken\\" was more the F-You full on technical metal album, and \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was a full-scale dark industrial, demented, paranoid and severly twisted MASTERPIECE. Trent Reznor has revolutionized modern music and TDS shall live on as one of the greatest breakthrough albums in history - his best work obviously. Then \\"The Fragile\\" seemed to want to do what TDS did but fell short, into what seemed to me lyrics that bordered self-parody. The Fragile was still great in many senses though (musically speaking, it was brilliant).    This album is different though. While I appreciate that Trent has chilled out and relaxed with this album (you didn't expect NIN to sound like TDS forever did you?) and also appreciate his need for a change, that's all fine. But where are the breathtaking instrumentals? Where are the cleverly and intricately placed morbid classical instruments? What's with the predicatable choruses? What happened to the brilliant layering?  I knew they would go this route, anyone following Trent's work would have to be blind to not know he was going more clean, synthy, and overall more \\"metro.\\"   The last and most important element now gone from NIN's work: Atmosphere. Trent used to not only make catchy melodic songs like others do, but he created WORLDS. NIN's music always took your head away from the rigors of daily life and put you into different places; futuristic apocolypses, warm fields, somber rainy streetcorners, vast oceans, etc. The instrumentals and ingenuity of them did it all. Yet here he just seems to go for something quick and easy. For me, a HUGE letdown.   Keep in mind that it didn't take Trent 6 years to write this particular album. He dealt with many personal problems as well as side projects. It was probably only the last couple of years he really dedicated to this album. So I'm not surprised that overall the album feels rushed and somewhat lazy.   I don't want to go into an analysis of each song, as I feel that's boring. But I felt something i didn't feel with the other albums. I really did NOT want to sit through this one for the most part. The majority of the songs end the way they start, offering nothing to look forward to, nothing clever to discover. NIN I feel now is a band for teenagers. And while I still appreciate Trent very much and still feel he's an absolute pioneer in the music world (he revolutionized music, period), I feel I've somewhat outgrown this angst message. And though I'm not a lyric snob (music counts too, not just lyrics), I feel the music leaves a lot to be desired.  I look forward to his next work, hopefully he'll be more concentrated.
B00015HVI8|4.0|Why only 4 stars?  Because the Region 2 dvd set gets more extras!  How fair is that?  I actually went and bought a multi-region dvd player (through Amazon) and then headed over to the Amazon.co.uk site to buy this season.  (Region 2 dvds will NOT play in a Region 1--U.S.--dvd player.)  And yes, the Region 2 boxed set came with more.  Parts 1 and 2 of the Lowdown (which included 15 minutes added footage from what originally aired), as well as Richard Dean Anderson's video diary from Paradise Lost.  Offhand, that's what I noticed, although there may be more than that.  When a dvd is released, it should offer the same extras, no matter what region it is.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Though I didn't get all wrapped up in the story, I rented this DVD just because I like old sailing ships and all things nautical.

Don't they get sore throats?)<br /><br />But the cinematography is terrific, and the Galapagos scenes were a special treat. I may decide to view this again on \\"mute\\". Oh, but the musical score is enjoyable too, especially the string duos between Captain Aubrey and the doctor/naturalist.<br /><br />I've long had intentions of reading Patrick O'Brian's books, but as I haven't done so yet, I'm unable to say if \\"Master and Commander\\" measures up. Nevertheless, it appears to be well-cast and well-acted. So if you like adventures at sea, you'll likely enjoy this movie; if you prefer a romantic comedy, then skip it.
B0000508U6|4.0|I find that whether or not I like this album depends on my mood. For me, this album is best listened to at night... I mostly listen to CDs while driving, and for some reason this music seems much better in the dark, than during daylight hours. Perhaps it is the moodiness and introspection of the lyrics which best plays as a soundtrack to slower times than during the rush of work and errands.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is an absolute classic release.  Heavy Metal was born with this album- way back in the late 60's and early 70's.  Metal was NOT born in the 1990's, it was only rehashed by a plague of poseurs.  <br /> <br />Now, I have a question for the one star idiot.  You said in another music review that you are open minded, yet you clearly contradict yourself in your review of this album.  Because someone mentioned Black Sabbath and you had never heard of them, you go to Amazon and give them a bad review- without even listening to their music.  You admit this, yet you call yourself open minded.  How silly- you must be a 12 year old since you have never even heard of Black Sabbath.   <br /> <br />So, YOU must be the poseur.  Oh, the irony is killing me.   <br />
0553378384|5.0|This is the first review I have ever written for Amazon.  I have to say that this book was so fabulous that I felt compelled to talk about it.  It's truely insightful and so far everyone I have looked up in it feels it's accurate to the point of being spooky.  I especially like the way that it gives you positive ideas to help you work on your path of being a better person. My friend liked it so much she got one for herself :)  Hope this helps.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|WOW. I just got my copy in the mail today.  I lit one up and sat down and watched this movie.  A Saucerful of secrets, Echoes, One of these Days....simply amazing.  the editing is flawless.  great picture quality.  studio footage is awesome.  the directors cut version is corny, original concert is much better (its on the menu).    i originally didnt care for Pink Floyds older stuff (pre dark side) and now i have a totally different view, the old stuff is amazing, and is what is on this DVD.      i highly suggest getting this.    *update: Ive watched this DVD 8 times in 3 days, i cant get enough of it
B0007TKNIS|5.0|While the musical as a movie has not been commonly successful in recent years, this movie musical promises to be completely successful, and it is not hard to imagine why. It is the second longest running musical on Broadway (Cats is first), and was written at a time when nothing like it existed. The film does a great job of adapting the music, the story and the characters. Young Emmy Rossum does a phenomenal job as Christine Daae, with a voice to be envied. The film is very enjoyable, and sensational.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is PERFECT for the holidays. Cast and put together by Andrew L. Webber and Joel Schumacher we're presented with a wonderful adaption of the stage show. It was made differently as not to cause the show to be closed. For had it been a replica the show would be in danger of closing. <br /> <br />A brilliant cast, a good director, beautiful music and a love story to break your heart. Buy it now!
0380977788|4.0|I am a senior in high school and have read many books. I believe Niel Gaiman is a fantastic writer. His book Coraline will keep your attention until the end.  <br /> <br />  The book begins in a nice house where many people live. One of those people is a young girl named Coraline. Coraline is very young and loves to explore the world around her; discovering every little detail of her world can get her into trouble. The excitement doesn't really kick off until she walks into the flat that she has not yet explored behind the door that her mother always kept locked until now.  <br /> <br />  In a Alice in Wonderland setup Coraline explores this brand new world. All the things she once wanted she now would have, but she soon discovers that she wants it all back. Now in her last visit in this strange other world she must escape.  <br /> <br />  Coraline is a very quick read. It's hard to just skim over any of the book because you can easily skip a detail leaving you a little lost. There is also the occasional illustration to show what is to come of the next chapter.  <br /> <br />  I would most likely recommend this book to a much younger audience. This is a fantastic children's book. Though it is not a book of my taste I believe it can give someone appreciation of their parents and what they have. <br />
B000929AJQ|2.0|First, let me say that I have been a fan of nin since the beginning- I have seen him/them play 5 times, have actually talked with Trent briefly about his first album on his first tour and generally, love nin greatly.  With that said, it saddens me to write such a negative review of this album.  Sure, a few of the tracks have grown on me slightly since the first listen, but overall it is painful to listen to. <br /> <br />It should have happened with 1999's The Fragile, in terms of probability anyway. Who would have thought Trent would try to top Pretty Hate Machine or The Downward Spiral and make a respectible effort to do so? Even though it didn't happen, at least he tried. So, what does this have to do with [With Teeth]? Let's just say that Trent didn't appear to try on this album, AT ALL! There are a couple of decent tracks to be found, but these don't appear until the last half of the album- the first half is simply awful.  What about the transitions- the context- the atmosphere that made his previous releases GREAT? What about Trent? As he himself said in the classic angst anthem, \\"Down in It;\\" \\"and what i used to think was me is just a fading memory, i looked him right in the eye and said goodbye.\\"  <br /> <br />Goodbye Trent.  Hope you come back someday. <br />
B000000H5J|5.0|this album kicks @ss. fear factory always made me want to trade in all my human body parts and become this immortal machine terminator guy. best songs are self bias resistor, demanufacture, zero signal, replica. yeah the others kick it too. get the digipack for it contains an agnostic front cover and nice remixes. scare the hair off of little kids backs on halloween...play this cd loud!
B000069HJM|2.0|Imagine Paul and Ringo going out on tour, calling themselves The Beatles. Talk about outrage...its no different here except its a lower level comparison.<br /><br />In Free As A Bird, I have nothing positive to say about it. This is not a release that I will remember Supertramp by.<br /><br />One original Band Member left for WHAT?? To go out on tour and score some Easy Money??? Let it go, I say...unless Roger is willing to return.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this release.
B000929AJQ|4.0|You could rightly argue this is his weakest album, but that's not the point.  This is a solid album, and certainly much better than the latest releases from other older artists like U2, The Cure, Billy Idol, etc.  There aren't any standout tracks like his other albums, but I liked all 13 songs and it's easy to listen to it all the way through.  Sure it's softer, smoother, less angular, but that doesn't make it any less dark and disturbed.  All of his mantras of self-doubt, self-hate and self-destruction are here, but maybe he doesn't feel like he has to scream them for 50 minutes.  Even the album closer, which is probably the most sedate, gave me chills thinking about what he was saying.  To me With Teeth is a natural progression from The Fragile, and I'm glad to see he's focusing more on the craft of songwriting with his voice as an instrument.  Instead of trying to aurally rape your ears, he's actually trying to bring his music and lyrics across.  Keep in mind the guy is getting older and has matured, so I expect his music to mature as well.  In that respect, he delivered everything I was hoping for and more.  For those who are disappointed with this album, I'm reminded of my sophomore year in high school when The Downward Spiral came out.  I remember the so-called hardcore NIN fans complaining it didn't sound like Broken or Pretty Hate Machine...yet now Downward Spiral is thought of as Trent's finest hour.  So my point is that you can't judge an album based on the back catalogue.  No matter how you look at it, With Teeth sounds like NIN, because as everybody learned from the first album, Trent Reznor is NIN.  For this album, he's just not wearing a black fishnet tank top.
B00008WG3U|5.0|Every track of this album is great. MY SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND SKATE track makes me wanna slam and bust some heads. I mean, it gives me this sudden energy to play playt punkrock, skate and write songs aout the government
006092988X|4.0|This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading.  It is a wonderful bildungsroman (coming of age story) about a girl growing up in the city.  Her father is a loving drunk but her mother is a hard working woman who encourages her children to work at everything they do.  I really enjoy this book and read it every couple of years.  Definetly worth the time it takes to read it--- wonderful story.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is one of my favorite blues albums. I've really been exploring the genre lately and I wonder what has taken me so long. Great guitar playing, singing, fantastic separation and fidelity on the recording. This is a pleasure to listen to. Real blues from two of the best.  Awesome!
B00008IAMD|5.0|\\"Hey, Johnny Cash! Wait a minute... Oh my God, it's NIN!\\" <br /> <br />Those were my thoughts when I first heard \\"Hurt\\" and saw the video one night on MTV2. I have only recently gotten around to buying this album but it's definitely worth it. Every song on this album works well, both as stand-alone songs and with each other. \\"Hurt\\" is the most talked-about, and it came as a surprise to me, both as a music lover and a Nine Inch Nails fan. However, I think that \\"We'll Meet Again\\" has taken a new meaning in light of Cash's death in 2003, as though he's saying that we will see him on the other side someday.

B0008ISM40|4.0|With Teeth isn't really a regression; rather, it's a new take on Nine Inch Nails' style. The assured staples are present to let you know it's NIN you're listening to: cryptic lyrics (though not so dark this time around,) random, unintelligible whispering,  and other songs that just come off as cacophonous and deranged in  NIN-style.    With Teeth doesn't present the songs to the listener in a hard, `grindy' industrial tone, but it does attempt to supplant the said tone with more guitar riffs and drums. The success of that is dubious at best. With some songs it works great; others it feels rushed and fragmented. Thankfully, Nine Inch Nails ripped the useless intermezzos from With Teeth and focused more on actual content. With Teeth also has their singer, Trent Reznor, singing in a more upbeat tone this time around. He doesn't come off as a bitter, angry vocalist as much as he used to.    If you're an obstinate fan awaiting a glorious, triumphant return to NIN's old musical style, you won't find it here. For you, there are only a few notable songs that fall into the `old NIN' category. The remaining songs are produced under their new style, and it's clear that NIN has taken a turn musically. If the turn is for the better or worse, that's in the hands of the listener. I found the album to be a refreshing spin on their musical talent with just enough old Nine Inch Nails in there to keep me interested.
B0000640SB|5.0|This movie is a classic already. There are so many great scenes it becomes a surreal extraterrestrial trip. Will Smith exploded in the 90s to become one of the leading block buster action Heroes. Thus, I think right now Men In Black is looked over in terms of its art because the formula is par with other Smith movies. The dialogue, however, is exceptional. The dialogue is never overdone, but manages to fit into the quirky originality of the movie(Jeeves in the pawn shop). Many of the most impressive lines and puns were formulated by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, as the director notes in the commentary. The opening scene of the smashed dragonfly sets the tone for the dark humor and amusing awkwardness. The music is uncomfortably fun and wierd, so it's just right. I also think audiences like films with an exciting premise, which J finds himself in. Also, talking caffiene addicted beer chugging worm guys can't hurt, right? Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal makes Agent K a hall of famer of film characters. Plus, Ray Park (Darth Maul) is in it. He plays the alien with the freaky eyes, and he actually did his wall flip without assistance! The DVD is exhaustive, with more bells and whistles than agent K's arsenal. MIB is definitely a much stronger film in the theater, but nonetheless cool. Now...\\"Look here into the light...\\"
B00005RG6B|5.0|I've had a special place in my heart (soundz a little soft for a metal fan, but hey!) for Queensryche that goes back all the way to when my best friend in high school bought their self-released EP out of the back of a Circus magazine and we first listened to Geoff Tate wail like a banshee.  Those were the days.  I think the height of their career came at Mindcrime and entered mainstream at Empire.  None of their albums have been as good since those days, but I still get them as they come out.  This DVD captures the Ryche at the top of their game.  Still young and fresh and Tate is in full wailing form.  This is the stuff of legends.  The complete Operation: Mindcrime album performed live and it's f*cking flawless!  I've watched it three times already and still can't get enough.  The extras aren't the bomb, the interviews with Tate are insightful and watchable.  The easter eggs are: The Lady Wore Black - Live and Roads To Madness- Live, but it's just the audio and you can get those gems off of the LIVEcrime CD, so don't bother.  All in all, this is Queensryche at its best. Brings back some great memories!  Rock on!
B00004THDI|5.0|I just wanted to let everyone know who read that review that he doesnt know what he is talking about. Yes this is a STEREO only SACD. SACD was first made only in stereo. There was no surround or hybrid SACD. And if you listen to SACD dont buy the regular CD this will blow it away.Im not trying to be mean just stating the facts. Ive been listining to SACD since 1999 when sony released this format and when I heard Billy Joel I was hooked. Have fun and buy them all because Sony is thinking of not doing SACD anymore and that would be awful.
0792839730|5.0|For the amateur military buff, this is an excellent movie to see. I have read Cornelius Ryan's book, which the movie is based on and the movie does justice to the book. The movie shows the collection of mistakes by the Allies which results in many U.S. and British casualties.  <br /> <br />British Field Marshall Montgomery devises the Market Garden operation that the movie covers. The movie covers both British and American airborne divisions as well as the British 30 Corps, an armored unit. The action is well done considering this movie is made before all the computer graphics and special effects that dominate action and war movies of today. The movie also points to the flawed plans of the Allies and we see the effects on all soldiers. We see the development of the battle from the eyes of those on the ground fighting it out and in the eyes of commanding generals as well.  <br /> <br />If you really want to know the story of Market Garden in great detail, I recommend reading Cornelius Ryan's _A Bridge Too Far_. It gives the further details of Operation Market Garden. <br /> <br />The all-star cast is also interesting to see in this movie as well. With the complexity of the book, Director Richard Attenborough does an excellent job in keeping the story focused and the movie scenes fluid as he changes from the scenarios of the multiple military units covered. <br /> <br />
B0007XT87G|4.0|For those who have listened to Porcupine Tree before, the best description I can give of this album is that it regresses a bit from In Absentia back towards PT's more traditional style, and so becomes a blend of both. It has a bit less energy and more melodic focus than In Absentia, and there's a bit less stylistic variety among the songs.<br /><br />All that said, it's pretty good, and I recommend it to anyone who like energetic progressive rock. Certainly, the Porcupine Tree style, which depends more on guitar than keyboard, is distinctive in the prog rock space. It has some of the energy of, say, Dream Theatre, with real live drums instead of a machine (which I really appreciate). But there's more discipline here, and finer detail on the sound engineering. That avoids Dream Theatre's major fault (in my view) which is a tendency to drift into metal for the sake of metal. I cringe during those highly-metallic sections of Dream Theatre works, and I never find myself doing that cringing with Porcupine Tree. I also hear more variety here, as the sound style varies all the way from smooth Pink Floyd-Alan Parsons uber-engineered sound all the way to a dash of grunge garage rock.<br /><br />I think Steve Wilson's compositions also do a good job of avoiding the lame lyrics so common in prog rock. Again, no cringing here, as I might cringe over the loopier stuff in, say, Glass Hammer.<br /><br />If you're new to Porcupine Tree, you really ought to get In Absentia first. It's superb. But if you already have it and like it, you probably should get this too. The title cut and the fourth song, \\"Halo\\", will sound stylistically similar. The third song, \\"Lazarus\\", is this album's bid for some radio airplay, and so is the softest song on the album, but is pretty good even with its dash of commercial influence.<br /><br />\\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" is the longest work at twelve minutes, and begins with a section that harkens back to Porcupine Tree's earlier works - I find it initially reminiscent of the stuff on the second disk of \\"Stars Die\\". It then naturally evolves towards PT's more recent style. It's one of those songs that probably won't grab you when you first hear it, but gets better with repeated listening.<br /><br /> \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" replicates that same pattern in about half the time, starting soft and then building. Not bad. It's followed by the song that I thought sounded most like it would have fit into In Absentia - \\"Open Car\\".<br /><br />The list finishes with some filler cuts. None are objectionable, but none really stand out either. \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" is in that group, and really goes back to earlier styles. If I had to pick the best of this group, it would be the hidden track \\"Shesmovedon\\".<br /><br />I don't expect this one to last on the top of my play list as long as In Absentia did. But it's there now.- I find it initially reminiscent of the stuff on the second disk of \\"Stars Die\\". It then naturally evolves towards PT's more recent style.

B0007GAERG|1.0|I thought with all the hype regarding this diva's \\"comeback\\" album that this piece of work would be something spectacular, but WHOA, was I wrong!  First off, the cover to her latest is just a pure BEYONCE KNOCK OFF...couldn't she come up with something original as she has on all her past albums?  I mean, c'mon here, this makes the cover of her Glitter album actually look attractive (at least that cover was original).  As for the material, well, all I can say is tbe only track worth noting is \\"We Belong Together\\".  This piece takes her back to her popular days when she actually wrote songs of interest.  The lead track, \\"It's Like That\\" doesn't do a thing for me.  It might be a bit catchy, but not as catchy as earlier uptempo songs such as \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Honey\\", or \\"Always Be My Baby\\" for that matter.  As for her so called \\"heart drenching\\" ballads, well, I am sorry, but \\"Mine Again\\" is not very empowering, nor is \\"Fly Like A Bird\\".  As for the track \\"Say Something\\", what the &**^ is that garbage? This gal has really lost her touch, and has grown even further from it (I guess that explains the cover title).  I know this may sound like \\"Mariah bashing\\" as I have always been a big fan; however, I truly feel this is the WORST material she has written.  Mariah, you need to \\"get with it, girl\\" and start working again with the producer who could actually produce hits for you (Walter Afanasieff)...
B000001ELP|4.0|I had to write a review in defense of this album. I have been a fan since 1976, and I have loved just about every album Kiss has put out. When this one came out, I was very surprised by the new musical direction they had taken. It was definitely different from anything they had done and I wasn't quite sure of what to make of the whole concept thing. Getting past the album cover (not their worst, Unmasked has that title in IMHO), the fact that there were no goodies included (i.e. poster, order form, etc.), and the fact that they weren't touring in support of it, this album rocks. The Oath is one of the best openers of any Kiss album. Ace's Dark Light is probably tied with Shock Me as his best (that solo is KILLER!), and A World Without Heroes should have been a huge hit. The other tracks are very different for Kiss but still very strong. Only You, Under The Rose, and Escape From The Island are great tracks. Mr Blackwell and Odyssy are the weaker songs, but I still enjoy them. A much better release than Unmasked. The production is great. Too bad it came out at a time when things weren't going so well for them. It could have been a great success. Too many fans aren't open minded enough to accept when a band flexes their creativity. I think every group should be afforded the opportunity to release an album that is a bit different. Don't look at this as a typical Kiss record because it isn't. It's a great musical effort from a band that was in turmoil at a time when many bands were falling by the wayside. Enjoy!
B0008ISM40|5.0|Yes, he had done it again. Ususally I have to listen to new NIN a few times to get what the hell Trent is doing and to appreciate it. With this album, being able to listen to it on My Space.com got me ready and by the time I got my copy in the mail, I was already loving it. Mr. Reznor has a way of keeping you on your toes, just when you think you have figured him out, he throws something different and unexpected your way. Don't fear change, some is very, very good. \\"With Teeth\\" is a bit different then past halos, but then again, what do you expect?Each and every NIN release has been different and is in itself it's own little masterpiece. You never ever have to worry about all of Trent's work staying the same. \\"With Teeth\\" has a little of everything from more mainstream sounds, pop synth to heavy industrial. Nothing stands out more then \\"Only\\". At first listen I wondered what on earth he was doing. But with each listen even it's chessy synth sound grows on you. It is exciting to see what direction NIN will go in next. An awesome collection of music. Brian Viglione of the Dresden Dolls said it best \\"Trent always leaves a nice fresh boot print in the face of comtemporary music with each record he releases\\"  <br />Thank you Trent for another amazing work, oh and by the way, it was well worth the wait.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|A real let down. Insertion of extra scenes to appeal to the movie going crowd really ruined the flow and character of the piece. Especially the jarring action scenes. (Set the Paris opera on fire? Really.)
1593072937|5.0|I have to say that as soon as I saw the trailer for Sin City on TV i became obssesed. After that it was sin city this sin city that. Although I haven't seen the movie yet, i cant till its on video. Anyways this is one of the best comic books/graphic novels I have ever read. Frank Miller's way of drawing in all black or white is amazing. The storyline definately keeps you wanting to know who Marv is killing next. The basic plot of the story is about a brute of a man by the name of Marv who falls in love with a hooker named Goldie after one night. He wakes up and finds her dead next to him, and spends the rest of the story fighting and killing his way to the culprit. Kevin is by far the most disturbing character ever made (a mute cannibal who cuts the heads of women and eats the rest of them). The comic book does have nudity and some violence in it and isn't appropriate for young kids who are used to stuff like spider man or x-men. this is definately a must read.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Come'on people, this solid first album deserves more than a 4-star average.  There is not one bad track on this masterwork.  You bought this album because JD is dead and Interpol was the next best thing.  Give them the credit they deserve.
B000002H7I|5.0|oh Tracy, you bless my soul. I have all of her CDs and love them all. this one is an early one, and she gets even better, but, if you are a fan, you must have them ALL. buy it, love it, you will like her music, if not, something wrong with you! (kidding) it's good though, ok.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Despite what some critics may tell you, this album is worlds away from The Fragile or the Downward Spiral.  You'd have to go as far back into Trent's catalogue as 1989 to find something that even remotely resembles this album, but even on Pretty Hate Machine you won't find the same focus, the same confidence, or the same sound.  This album stands alone in Trent's repetoire, and that works to his advantage.<br /><br />The Fragile found NIN at its densest and perhaps most inaccessible, with layers upon layers of screaming and noise and dissodant distortion, sprawling out into over 100 minutes and two discs of music (not to mention SIX instrumentals, each as abstract as the other).  That doesn't mean that the album was bad, because it was truly a monument among modern music, but it was also unfocused, scattered, and strangely diffident -- Trent didn't know where else to go so he just piled on the noise.<br /><br />With Teeth is about as far as you can get from that without it not being Nine Inch Nails.<br /><br />From the very first track, \\"All the Love in the World,\\" it is clear that we are listening to a redefined band, with dance beats, high-pitched crooning and pretty piano playing, this is not the same Trent we knew six years ago.  The instrumentation may be sparser, but it has lost none of its trademark complexity or subtlety -- it has merely been broken down to what was essential, and everything else was rightly scrapped.  There is no fat on this album.<br /><br />\\"I'm becoming less defined as days go by, fading away and well, you might say I'm losing focus.  Kinda drifting into the abstract  in terms of how I see myself.  Sometimes I think I can see right through myself.\\"<br /><br />That sounds like pretty standard lyrics coming from Trent Reznor, except on this particular occasion, coming from track number 8, \\"Only,\\" it's delivered over a retro-disco beat with Trent speaking aloud in a deadpan self-aware humor that is completely nonexistent on his previous albums.  To say that this is the usual nihilistic NIN garb is unfair and simply untrue, because every song on the album demonstrates otherwise.  What was once nihilistic is now full of the empowerment and responsibility of being able to believe in oneself, what was once self-destructive is now a reflection of where to move on towards after the self-destruction (Trent was reportedly in rehab during the six-year post-Fragile hiatus).  Critics who say that this is the same old, same old almost make me wonder if they were listening to the same album as me.<br /><br />With Teeth is as good or better than anything Trent Reznor has produced so far, and that's saying quite a bit.  He has lost none of his talent, ability, genius, or relevancy in the past six years, and he's as solid as ever.  And having Dave Grohl as a replacement for electronic drum-loops helps, too.<br /><br />Standout tracks include: \\"Only,\\" \\"The Line Begins to Blur,\\" \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same,\\" and the absolutely sublime finisher to rival \\"Hurt,\\" \\"Right Where it Belongs.\\"listic NIN garb is unfair and simply untrue, because every song on the album demonstrates otherwise.

B0007YMUZW|4.0|Did Mike say he lifted things from the Grateful Dead?  Really?  Does anyone else think that?  Wow.  When you review an album by anyone, you can find points of reference in other bands or artists.  No one is truly original.  But The Dead?   <br /> <br />Anyway, this is another fine product from a truly gifted and prolific artist.  Is it ground breaking? No.  Is it trend setting? No.  Is it well written, played and produced?  Absolutely.  Take it for what it is.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I did rather enjoy this films i have to admit, and i like that fact that the little runtish boy they got to play harry potter, looked like the harry potter off of the picture on the front of the book. I didnt like malfoy however, because i was frightened by him. This is because of the fact he was mean to the runtish harry potter lookalike boy. Ron was funny because he had a pet mouse, and i thought it would be funny if the mouse was eaten by some form of ravenous rabbit. Voldemort had a rubber head that had been constructed by an obviously low paid prosthetics and special effects team but this added more humour to the film, so i was not frightened by his evil antics of doom. This film was rather good but would be better if it had George Knewbold in it.
B000002H5I|5.0|Tracy - OMG you are good! this is her first CD, I believe. I have them all, dam, I like this girl!  revolution, fast car, ticket, for my lover... sigh... so much talent - why is she NOT given more airtime and more kudos? she is so stinkin' good. bluesy and deep, gotta listen to the words, and dance with your baby to Tracy. she's wonderful.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|After seeing so many negative reviews, I had to chime in on this one. This isnt so much a review but a commentary on why or why not someone would love or hate this film.  <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is not a \\"fall on the floor laughing\\" movie. In fact when I saw it I didnt quite look at it as a comedy at all but, just a commentary on life, and how one kid deals with life day to day. I'll have to say most people that probably love this movie were Napoleon or Deb to some extent. Those who werent, or who lived in a more city environment or who were the popular crowd, or jocks, just dont get this I'm sure. Thats not to say they are bad or any such thing, just that you have to have lived in some capacity as Napoleon to get the humor and the wonderful comment on society this film makes. With that in mind I have recommended it only to people who I knew were like that and would enjoy it, and once you sit and see it for what it is, it really is nostalgic.  <br /> <br />You see a regular guy trying to deal with reality with some fantasy escapism, but still taking care of everything he must do to get by in reality. Napoleon's sarcastic attitude to people is hilarious, and I remember having the same thing. I remember wearing helicopter t-shirts, and making boondoggles, and crappy school food, and having only one friend in junior high(because of transferring mid-junior high from another school, much like pedro) and just trying to make it and to be a friend to someone and to offer your \\"skills\\" whenever it was possible.  <br /> <br />If you walked this road in the late 80s - early 90s you will love this movie because it brings back all those possibly painful but great memories. It made me look back and reflect on what got me to where I am today, now married and in a successful career. It made me remember how I dealt with those awkward times growing up. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is a fine movie, though not one I would consider a strict comedy. Call it a documentary in thelife of awkward school kid nerdness, and how you can rise to a challenge.  <br /> <br />Believe it or not unlike most here, I didn't once find myself wondering why the movie lacked a plot. It just worked.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is true. He's not the greatest singer in the universe. I would loathe to hear Pavoratti singing these beautiful pieces of music, though. <br />Like Shane MacGowan, Dylan, and ad infinitum singers who can't hold a note, this isn't what matters. What's important is how the voice weaves through the music; and Rice has done this here irreproachably. <br />Absolutely gorgeous.
0451528956|3.0|I read this book for my senoir lit class.  I enjoyed it.  It was not what I was expecting.  I thought that Dr. Jekyll's transformation was magical but it turned out to be logical and even more enjoyable.  I liked it and I would recommend it to other senoir lit classes.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|this is indeed a Disney Classic if every there was one. a must own. kids and adults will love it. great songs, great story. and the story has a MORAL. spend time with your kiddies. and be a good listener. and go fly a kite.<br /><br />dick van dyke and julie andrews rock. the animation sequences are lovely, the birds and little animals. and jumping into the chalk painting on the sidewalk... ahhh the memories. every childhood should include many viewings of good ole Mary Poppins. a must. my little Kyle watches all our Disney DVDs and videos over and over and over and over ..... better than out on the street getting into who-knows-what - hummm?!
0553573403|4.0|this book compelled me to read more in the series like many books do. If your looking for a good way to spend some time and you like to read fantasy this is a great book.<br /><br />the plot is compelling and intertwining, overall this book was worth the hours but into it
076790592X|5.0|I read this when I was going through a tough time, and it really brought things into perspective. It's easy to read, and really speaks to the heart. Beautifully written.
B000056NX5|2.0|This is actually a fairly bloodless, passionless retelling of JCS. The singing in general leaves much to be desired. The directing is fairly bland and unimaginative. To be honest just decorating a set and costuming it in a new and different way does not a directorial vision make.  Acting is generally weak and the choreography is ridiculous.<br /><br />Skip this and see Norman Jewison's version instead.

B000929AJQ|3.0|Not the best-ever NIN album, no (for me that would be Downward Spiral).  But, as one reviewer said, it feels curiously like coming full-circle. <br /> <br />No, Trent's not really breaking new ground here;  With Teeth feels more like a synthesis of everything that's gone before.  There's the attention to songs of Pretty Hate Machine, with the stylistic moodiness of the Fragile (without the discordance).  A piano winds around and through many of the tracks, lending a seriousness to the introspection this time...it's not just whine and complain.  There's also multiple references to songs from all the previous albums, weaving the same themes into some new perspectives, making With Teeth feel like a conclusion drawn from all that's gone before. <br /> <br />If the Downward Spiral was Trent hitting rock bottom, and The Fragile was him continuing to dig, finding a nice comfy cave, and deciding to set up housekeeping, With Teeth feels like him sitting on the couch down there and looking wistfully back up at the sunlight filtering down through the hole.  Trent seems to be starting to question his decay.  In particular the poignant final track, Right Where it Belongs, has a thoughtfulness that's new for Nine Inch Nails.  I like it. Sooner or later you have to realize that your own degeneration isn't because the world's out to get you--you have to have cooperated. <br /> <br />My personal faves are Right Where it Belongs, which I can't stop listening to;  and Only, which is a track in the spirit of The Fragile's Where Is Everybody? and Pretty Hate Machine's Down In It, which it references. <br /> <br />Overall I find it to be a much more solid and listenable album than The Fragile (I think I'm one of the few people that actually LIKED The Fragile) but it's not a breakthrough like the Downward Spiral.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets stands as one of their greatest albums. A good indication of that is to go look at the live albums, and count how many songs come from each album in particular. Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets generally have 4 or 5 each in a set of 15 or so.  <br /> <br />As an amusing side note to Ridge, Dave Mustane didn't leave Metallica. They threw him out, becuase they didn't feel he fit the band. Mustane's admitted the only reason Megadeth exists is because he wanted to be bigger than Metallica, and show up his old bandmates. He never even lasted long enough to be on Kill 'Em All. <br /> <br />Megadeth is a great metal band in their own right, no doubt about that. But these two get compared constantly, and in the end, it just simply comes down to taste. Some prefer one. Some prefer the other. I just wanted to set the record straight. <br /> <br />I wouldn't hesitate to give a number of Megadeth albums 5 stars, as I gave Master of Puppets today.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|One of the most politically and socially significant films ever produced, Cabaret is as unsettling as it is exhilarating. This 8-time Academy Award-winning film based on the controversial Broadway musical, tells the disturbing story of a fourth-rate American cabaret chanteuse trying to survive in Berlin during the final days of the Weimar Republic. The overriding concept of the film actually serves as a biting and painful metaphor for a morally bankrupt and self-indulgent society so intoxicated by its own rotting decadence and corruption that it fails-or more appropriately, refuses-to realize that it is about to dive head-first into the fires of an apocalyptic nightmare that will ultimately cost the lives of over 11 million people. Liza Minnelli is astounding in her star-making role as the deluded and self-absorbed nightclub singer Sally Bowles, based on the infamous character of Christopher Isherwood's novel, \\"Goodbye to Berlin.\\" Bob Fosse deserved his Best Director Oscar for creating a hyper-stylized visualization of Berlin as it was rotting to the core in the early 30s just as the Nazis were gathering in the wings. But the real show-stopper here is Joel Grey, the horrifyingly demonic and sneering Master of Ceremonies, shrugging his shoulders and smirking at us through the camera with a disturbingly hypnotic twinkle in his eye acknowledging that we all know exactly what history has in store.     Cabaret can be thought of more than just a musical. Unlike the unrealistic musicals of the 40s and 50s in which the characters burst into song out of the middle of nowhere, the musical numbers here are strictly prohibited to stage numbers at the Kit Kat Klub, an alteration from the Broadway version that significantly adds to the reality of this spectacle. Furthermore, if you want to get the entire message of the film in a minute and a half, pay particular attention to the scene when Sally, Brian and Max are driving through downtown Berlin. Listen closely to their conversation juxtaposed against what they are observing on the street outside the car. If taken into social and historical context, the scene is so unnerving, you'll be left speechless.     Overall, if you want to watch a film that is not only an important lesson on the fragility of humanity, but could also be a mirror for contemporary society, then don't miss Cabaret. The movie's ending will leave you (as it did me the first time I saw it) in stunned silence, thinking twice about social apathy in the context of the potentially devastating nightmare we are now experiencing at the dawn of the 21st century.
0345440900|5.0|I thought this was a great book with some refreshing theories.  It is not the end-all, be-all book on child care, but offers some great insights into baby's outlook on life and how to nurture accordingly.  I was happy to finally read a book that was accepting of parents who choose to formula feed instead of breastfeeding.  Most books I have come across enforce the \\"breast is best\\" policy and hardly give 2 sentences to those parents who choose to formula feed... talk about guilt!  (Now I do believe that breast is best, but it's not for everyone, and no one should feel guilty if they can't or don't want to breastfeed.)   <br /> <br />I think this book is best read before you begin mothering your child, as I think it would probably be hard to take on the author's recommendations after establishing contrary patterns.  Also, I feel that this book is best used as a supplement to another child care book that will give you the detailed \\"how to's\\" on feeding, bathing, etc. <br /> <br />As with any book, you have to apply your own insight and experience when applying it's theories to your own life.  This book isn't a HOW TO, but it's definitely supportive to new moms who are figuring out HOW TO.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|This movie was incredible.  When I first saw it, I was kind of amused by the unterrific suspense that led me to instantly figure out what was going to happen next.  But as the movie progressed, the plot became more and more vague, and it was harder to see into the future.  I even found myself tense at some points and excited to find out what would happen.  In the end, it seemed so perfect I couldn't explain it.  I was amazed.  The Professional has three things every good movie should have: <br />1) beautiful editing.  This movie's amazing sound editing and cuts were perfect.  You would be locked in a terrifying suspense-filled scene at one moment, and then the next it would cut into something totally different.  But it made it seem real and intense and it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br />2) a foreign super hero \\"bad guy\\" who fights other bad guys and does it stylishly.  The main character is perfect for this film.  He has no attachments to anyone, complete independence, a pull-your-own-weight kind of attitude, and he's foreign.  The best part is, he's a bad guy, but he fights the other bad guys.  Everybody loves a movie where the bad guy wins.  And he also possesses some kind of strange physical competence that allows him to wreak sheer havoc and kick serious ass wherever he goes.  He's so cool he kicks my butt and I'm just watching. <br /> <br />3) an ending that's so cool I can't even describe it. <br /> <br />this movie is the perfect late-night action thriller, but with a touch of gentle backstory that makes the whole thing much more worth it to watch.  i would paid upwards of $15 to see this movie in theaters.  but it's good enough on dvd.
0060556501|2.0|While the illustrations in this Book are great, the text is not the actual text of C.S. Lewis. The book is written \\"BASED ON\\" the Narnia. Well, the story here is a little twisted which makes a huge difference in the understanding of the main thrust of the narration. Aslan is depicted weak and impotent and redemption story is not evident from the text. Otherwise, if you know the true story, the pictures are worth the money. (You may have to use quite a bit of whiteout on this one.)
B00000JLWW|3.0|There are a plethora of reviews here which concur with my sentiments, so I will refrain from expressing them in this review. I will say one thing, though: James Cameron's Oscar acceptance speech was the most ridiculous acceptance speech I have ever heard. Never mind the \\"I'm the king of the world!\\" nonsense. How about his moment of silence for those who perished on the Titanic? Perhaps Cameron felt obligated to acknowledge the dead since he was dramatizing their tragedy. Perhaps he was being sincere in his sympathies. I don't know. What I do know is that it was one of the most cringe-worthy moments in Academy history. But Cameron doesn't stop there. He simply cannot leave good-enough alone, so he continues to babble on incessantly as his already bulbous head continues to expand. Whereas most actors and filmmakers at least make an attempt to conceal their egotism, Cameron is unabashedly vainglorious, boldly forsaking the humility smokescreen that so many others in show business rely upon for refuge.
B00030590I|4.0|After the movie,I was wondering whether the emperor could be interpreted as Saddam and stability be taken into consideration in  the present war.If US did not kill Saddam and just whispered in his ears like in the movie what he ought to do,what would things be like now?  The directer had said this was a anti-war movie and that it should have had a good chance to win Oscar.(It didn't win.Obviously,he had no idea how Oscar is given out.)
B000002UJQ|4.0|This album really grew on me. Although I do not consider myself a Radiohead fan, I liked this album as well as their previous effort,  The Bends. I go back and forth over which album I enjoy the most. This album's concept, to me at least, seems to be the depersonalization of the postmodern world, with hints of the impending apocalypse. I would say that the production is really what makes it for me. Most of the songs have musical quality, but it is really the sci-fi sound production that puts this album over the edge. \\"Exit Music\\" has one of the most spine-tingling finales I have heard in a long time. \\"Paranoid Android\\" is an epic reflection on the current state of man, and \\"Airbag\\" is an excellent and grandiose introduction to the world of OK Computer. If you don't like the album at first, give it some time. If your experience is anything like mine, it will grow on you.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I first heard this ALBUM in April of '69. My drill instructor would put us to sleep with it in Army basic training at Ft. Campbell, KY. Having listened to JC with my dad all my life, I had to buy it. We wore it out rather quickly and kept buying fresh copies as needed. I've never tired of the enthusiasm shown by the inmates and how this carried over to JC and his crew. Now, my point, which has something to do with this recording. Are we ever going to see a good DVD or other video of JC? The latest is the Montreaux DVD which has JC trying to find a pulse in a crowd of people sitting on their hands. The previous prison DVD is just a show with no connection between JC and the inmates. We need Folsum Prison, San Quentin, MSQ, and/or his MSG show for VH-1 from '94. This is the JC that we hear on his live and studio recordings. Enough with the sanitization.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This is my first NIN cd purchase and it is quite an investment. I grew up listening to Head Like a Hole, Down In It, Closer and Hurt and figured hey, maybe this new album will be like the last few. It is, in that, it's a beautifully crafted album with no filler. Stand outs are \\"Hand That Feeds\\", \\"The Collector\\", \\"Only\\" and \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\". Those are just a few songs from this 13 track masterpiece.
0679735909|5.0|It should be shouted from all the rooftops in the land that A.S. Byatt is an author of true insight and genius. She manages to create the present, the past, and the all the characters therein AND their poems and letters, each with a distinctive voice. Sure, the plot seems to stop dead at points where pages of someone's epic poem are inserted, but read them, they are SO worth it! (And they provide powerful insight into the character's mind and prowess as an author.)
B000929AJQ|4.0|Anyone who expected to open up this new CD and hear a rendition of \\"Down In It\\" should be sorely disappointed.  That album was something that had never been done before, put forth by a 25 year old nobody in 1989. <br /> <br />Unlike the many groupies on here giving negative reviews, I couldn't be happier with the continued development of sound.  This band is tight.  Some tunes will have to grow on me like a moss.  16 years later I'm still not a fan of \\"Something I Can Never Have\\", but I've been involuntarily singing the chorus from \\"All the Love in the World\\" and \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\" for the past 24 hours and need to have my iPod handy for a quick dose if the mood strikes me.  Maybe he's not belligerent enough on this album for many, but I enjoy the pulling-back-of-the-skin lyrics, the live drums and a little bite \\"with a-teeth-ah\\". <br /> <br />Those of you whom have gone through the evolution of other bands, 'Come home to Momma'.  This one has the goods.

B000929AJQ|5.0|This album will probably not be loved by \\"fans\\" who think NIN's best song is \\"Closer.\\" I would have to say the single, The Hand That Feeds, is okay, but does not match the rest of the album. This album sounds like a mixture of Pretty Hate Machine and The Fragile. It is all new, it is catchy in a non-pop sort of way, and the album is worth a listen. If you LOVE \\"The hand that feeds\\" then you may not like this album. <br /> <br />Just like Marilyn Mansons \\"mOBSCENE\\" doesn't do his latest labum justice, neither does \\"the hand that feeds.\\" Get this album if you want something new.
B000005843|5.0|...For Victory is Bolt Thrower's best album so far (as of 2005)and that is saying a lot. After following up their masterpiece Warmaster with the lower-key The IVth Crusade, Bolt Thrower unleashes their full song-writing potential and musicianship with an album so powerful you won't be able to stop listening to it. If you are looking for an unmelodic technical mess, super-fast speed metal, or keyboard-heavy pop-death metal, stay away from this. Bolt Thrower doesn't sound like anyone else out there. If you like brutal, merciless, original death metal to headbang to, Bolt Thrower is it. Get ...For Victory and Warmaster, crank up the volume of your stereo, and prepare to be annihilated by the war machine that is Bolt Thrower!
B00000E5IH|5.0|This album is more than one of Elton's best recordings; it is also one of the best rock albums of all time. The production is excellent, the music is played nearly flawlessly, the lyrics are some of the best Taupin ever wrote, and the music was consistently some of the best Elton has written.<br /><br />This album starts off with a beautiful instrumental, \\"Funeral for a Friend\\", which segues into \\"Love Lies Bleeding.\\" \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" should be experienced rather than described. I plan to have \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" played at my funeral, which will hopefully be very far away.<br /><br />Everyone knows \\"Candle in the Wind.\\" This version is the original, and is a moving tribute to Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />\\"Bennie and the Jets;\\" the song is pretty good, but didn't come off quite as well as Elton wanted it to. The crowd participated less than Elton had intended. Regardless, the lyrics and music are wonderful, and a bit of insider commentary on pop musicians and their fans.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is a 70s pop/rock anthem. Every greatest hits of the 70s list always includes this song. Played heavily on top 40 radio for several years and now frequently on classic rock stations, this song was an instant classic.<br /><br />The next two songs are underappreciated and are very good. \\"This Song Has No Title\\" and \\"Grey Seal\\" are both very good songs. There is a serious undertone to \\"Grey Seal\\" that hints at perceptions and feelings, and perhaps the difficulty of being an individual in modern society. \\"Grey Seal\\" was re-done for \\"Yellow Brick Road,\\" having been previously recorded in a style more like \\"Empty Sky.\\" The original version can be found on the \\"Rare Masters\\" CD. I prefer this version, which is more polished.<br /><br />\\"Jamaica Jerk-off\\" is a silly song. However, someone did their homework because while the song is a bit annoying at times, it fits well where it was positioned on the CD.<br /><br />\\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\" is a bluesy song that is mellow and moving, and relates life to, what else, the movies. If you like soft rock with a touch of heavy, this is a good song. \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" laments the life of prostitutes, and is sad rather than condescending. \\"The Ballad of Danny Bailey\\" should be part of a soundtrack to a movie. It feels like it came from a soundtrack. The song contains a fictional story that draws imagery from the fictionalized accounts of characters such as Bonnie and Clyde. This song just as easily could have been the ballad of Clyde Barrow. The song well executed song provides enjoyable listening.<br /><br />\\"Dirty Little Girl\\" is lyrically a bit of a puzzler for me. I was unable to definitely divine Taupin's point. On the surface the lyrics appear to be about someone physically dirty needing a bath. With the reference to social worker, likely someone who is poor. But is there a point to the lyrics? Regardless, this song is one of the rocking songs on this CD, along with two others that appear right after \\"All the Girls Love Alice,\\" which is a sorrowful song about a young female lesbian.<br /><br />Two back-to-back rockers that follow are the fastest songs on the CD, \\"Your Sister Can't Dance\\" and \\"Saturday Night's alright for Fighting.\\" These are songs to play at that party you were planning, along with \\"Dirty Little Girl.\\" Elton John can rock when he chooses.<br /><br />The last three songs cluster nicely since all three deal with different topics. The first song, \\"Roy Rogers,\\" I really enjoy, though it gives me a strong feeling of nostalgia every time I listen to it. Not really a tribute to Roy Rogers so much as a tribute to old movies and TV shows, the feeling they give you, and memories of days gone by.<br /><br />\\"Social Disease\\" is a mixture of thoughts, but the theme seems to be borderline alcohol abuse. I say borderline because the principal character seems to like his life. Perhaps that is an understatement. The principal character seems to revel in his life.<br /><br/>The last song on this CD is one of Elton's beautiful ballads, \\"Harmony.\\" As happens so often with some songs, this song is flawed in that it could have been twice as long and even then it might not have been long enough.  This song is very beautiful, though there seems to be two themes intertwined that may be aspects of the same theme. One theme is that of love by someone who is on the verge of obsession. The other is a musical question; will I continue to be able to sing well in the future, and for how long? Listening to the song I was unable to pick up on the second theme, but reading the lyrics I realized that the song could be interpreted in the second way.<br /><br />If you like Elton's music, then you must be reading this review for curiosity, because you already have \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\". If you like pop/rock from the 70s, then you already have \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\\" If you have heard music from the 70s and want to find the better music from that era, you have hit one of the best. I believe that while the music sounds a little dated in spots, I believe that released today it would still sell songs. Perhaps it might even influence younger artists.<br /><br />Go buy this CD if you have yet to do so. It is one of pop-rock's greats!in his life. <br /> <br />The last song on this CD is one of Elton's beautiful ballads, \\"Harmony.\\" As happens so often with some songs, this song is flawed in that it could have been twice as long and even then it might not have been long enough.

B000929AJQ|5.0|I have waited along time for a NIN CD, and it was worth the wait.  As usual Trent Reznor puts you through a sonic universe with the help of Mr. Dave Grohl!!   Sure, this CD takes you back to old school industrial/new wave to some degree, but in typical NIN fashion: it's intense.  All I got say, is that Beside You In Time  & Right Where It Belongs says it all.  Thanks Trent!!   I am looking forward to the show in Toronto!!
B000244EMO|4.0|People first seeing \\"Predator\\" may confuse it with a action movie, due to its star and the fact that it has a couple of action sequences in it (e.g., the attack on the terrorist base camp midway through the film).  However, when compared against any number of teenage slasher movies, this film follows the horror formula nearly to a T: a group of people go to X place, cut off from civilization.  One by one a dark, malignant force picks them off until the climactic duel between good and evil at the end.<br /><br />If you enjoy Ahhnold movies, then you won't be disappointed, but if you also enjoy classic teenage horror movies, you won't be disappointed either.  One thing's for sure: Camp Crystal Lake never had this much firepower.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Whether you like The Mars Volta or not, this album is simply amazing music no matter who you are. Anyway, the track listing on this website is way off. The first track is actually all four segments of Cygnus, the second track is The Widow, the third being L'Via, the fourth is actually the four segments of Miranda, and the last 7 tracks are all Cassandra. The album insert has lyrics for the title track which is not on the disc.
B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World presents us with two friends, Enid and Rebecca, as they face life after high school graduation.  Enid is the ultimate outsider, disdaining all around her as conformist and trashy.  Rebecca, her best friend, has been her companion for many years.  After, high school, the two girls decide not to go to college.  Instead, they have a dream to get their own apartment.  Rebecca, being the responsible one, goes out and gets a job, and starts making plans for getting an apartment.  Enid, on the other hand, can't seem to hold down a job for more than one day because her smart mouth keeps getting her in trouble.  Also Enid begins an infatuation with a record geek that she met through a prank.  As she becomes drawn closer and closer to this fellow outsider, she drifts away from her friend Rebecca. <br /> <br />This story is very quirky.  It's very funny, but boarders on the depressing at times.  It's easy to see how sadness and comedy are such close companions.  I really recommend seeing this movie.  It's one of the ultimate outsider movies.

B0007XT87G|2.0|From one side, it is not bad. The production, sound, playing are amazing. On the other hand, probably the worst PTree album up to date, dull and lacking really good melodies. <br />You can easily confuse the title track with any track on Opeth's Damnation, while Lazarus seems to be Robbie Williams' song. <br />I love all PTree albums, including Metanoia, except Deadwing. Commerce and mainstream are killing Steven Wilson.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I used to make fun of those what I thought were stereotypical teen drama shows. I used to make more fun of them if you were supposed to feel sorry for a bunch of troubled rich California kids. But let me tell you, 'The O.C.' is by far one of the best shows that has been on in quite some time. The storylines grab you and the continuity throughout the season flows. If you haven't picked season one up yet, I suggest you do, and get this one ASAP.
B000929AJQ|5.0|As of writing this, of all the 134 reviews.....    5 stars: 73  4 stars: 23  3 stars: 20  2 stars: 12  1 star:   6    It's only music, and it makes me rock, feel alive, and wanting to hear it again. So, i will add another 5 star rate....    Added on May 6th:     After hearing this work, and paying attention to the words, I must say Mr. Reznor is a master in telling us his feelings. All of the album speaks of change, the kind of change I suppose he went through in leaving his addictions (been there, done that myself). Lines begin to blur when you come back from hell, I surely can tell. And the more I hear it, the more I distinguish the tiny little things that make Reznors work shine. All the subtleties in the words tied with grunting, panting or whispering sounds and tones.    And I can tell you exactly how this will end: he has managed to produce a very marketeable product, the one I believe will be enough to recover from the financial troubles inherited by The Fragile. You see, pure innovation does not always pay....    Nice work, really nice, and I can't stop hearing at it.
B0008ISM40|5.0|On this album you'll find Trent's pop-driven industrial side, which gave us `Only,' `The Hand that Feeds,' `All the Love in the World,\\" and `The Collector.' The darker, moody Nine Inch Nails shows through in `You Know What you Are?,' `Everyday is Exactly the Same,\\" `Getting Smaller,' `The Line Begins to blur,' `Beside you in Time,' and the album's title track `With Teeth.'  <br />This is great album,I trully Love this album.
0440213525|5.0|THE CLIENT is a great premise with a couple of minor flaws. In this tale, an eleven-year-old witnesses a suicide and hears a deathbed confession as he watches the mob lawyer die. Now this kid just has to tell the Louisiana police what he knows and then everything is wonderful - simple right? NO! This streetwise kid knows his life is over if he opens his mouth.<br /><br />John Grisham brings to life an adolescent who is wise beyond his years and makes those of us who aren't street smart open our eyes very wide and observe the real world (or at least the real world portrayed in this book).<br /><br />Grisham has created one of my favorite characters in THE CLIENT: Reggie Love. Reggie Love is a feisty attorney who's tough because she was not given a choice but to be resilient in order to survive her life. Reggie's love for children and life is made very clear throughout this book and the reader can't help smiling at her antics against the District Attorney and the police department when they don't think about the safety of her client!<br /><br />In my opinion, Reggie Love makes THE CLIENT a winner! I hope Grisham brings this character back in another story!!
B000929AJQ|4.0|So. Trent Reznor's fourth album is finally out, after much fidgeting and whining by the fan community. (Do you blame us?) And, as it has been said a dozen times before, in a lot more extravagant reviews, it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />If The Downward Spiral as a whole was entirely deconstruction and The Fragile was the rebuilding from the ground up, then With Teeth is the finished product; the new machine.<br /><br />\\"All The Love In The World\\" - The record begins at the same soundscape that had been mapped by The Fragile...electronic, quirky, cold, and moody. This minimalistic environment is held for the first three or so minutes, and then it builds into a soulful, poignant anthem that would possibly make Coldplay blush.<br /><br />\\"You Know What You Are?\\" - If there was any comfort set up by the first track, it's quickly ripped to shreds at the wheels of the steam train that the drumwork evokes at the beginning of this song. I first heard this song live the weekend before the album's release at a show in Las Vegas during the promotional tour. Out of all the new material they had performed that night, this was one of the most memorable, especially because of the chorus. It has the texture of a cut that could have been an outtake from Broken, but underneath it you can hear a little bit of the vulnerability that ran throughout The Fragile.<br /><br />\\"The Collector\\" - One of the hardest songs for me to digest. The feel of it is raw, but not exactly Nailsy. Before I had actually listened to the album, and only knew the tracklisting, I expected some emotionally charged ballad or a soft little piano ditty. So much for going by the title. As of press time, I have no verdict on this song, but I must admit, it's not very high on my list. Maybe I should stop skipping over it and give it a few more chances. Or, hey, maybe I could get mauled to death by an untamed mountain lion instead.<br /><br />\\"The Hand That Feeds\\" - (Do I need to explain this song?) An excellent first single. Nine Inch Nails to the core. Some liken this to \\"Starf***ers, Inc.\\" I think that's a little unfair...THTF isn't as angry, and is much more melodic, whereas \\"Star-effers\\" came off sounding more like the remix of a hardcore punk song. THTF is its own song, with its own sound, and its own message. Okay?<br /><br />\\"Love Is Not Enough\\" - Snarling. Humid. And still kinda un-Nailsy. But it's much more accessible than The Collector, and somewhat easier to get used to. Points for the cool but minimal use of synth in the background.<br /><br />\\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\" -  Great. Catchy. The Downward Spiral synth that drones on and on in the background makes up for some of the tracks that may have been a let down (COUGH COUGH the collector COUGH COUGH). Beautiful.<br /><br />\\"With Teeth\\" - The faint sampling at the beginning of this reminds me of \\"Reptile\\". But that quickly fades away and out into the gnash of the guitars and the drums. The lyrics are, if you've been a good little follower of NIN, easy to decipher: Trent's making another metaphor for whatever vice he was fully dependent on (coke? Alcohol? Pringles?), just like he did in \\"Sanctified\\", way back in '89, when Richard Patrick was actually sort of respectable, and Trent sang about specific fingers.<br /><br />I had also heard this song for the first time live, and it, too, was a stand-out. Especially the chorus \\"AWITHA TEETHA!!!!\\" which will always make a NIN fan laugh with girlish glee that can only be reserved for Richard Simmons and Ex-Secretary of State Madeline Albright.<br /><br />This song is compared to The Fragile's title track, because it goes soft and slow and piano-y in the middle. Well, yeah, okay, sure. The Fragile did that, I guess. But does anyone remember \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\"? Huh? That was the original song that was really loud and then went quiet for a little while and then came back louder than ever. Yeah. See what I mean now? So, before you make wild and crazy comparisons likethat, be sure to examine all of NIN's back catalogue.<br /><br />\\"Only\\" - I was excited to hear what this song was going to be like. Rolling Stone had said that the drums were \\"Billy Jean\\"-esque, or something. And okay, they are (thanks to David Grohl). There was also word about how this song was very 80s. And, sure, it is. But nothing could've prepared me for the first listen of this track. It was disco-meets-spoken-word-meets-Talking-Heads-meets-Pretty-Hate-Machine-meets-something. It was unlike any other NIN song I've ever heard. But if you really want to make comparisons, like everyone else seems to, you can say that it's kinda like Down In It. And I'm only saying that because he makes an oblique lyrical reference to it. But that's still stretching it. Just listen to it, and maybe then you can make all the far-reaching comparisons you want.<br /><br />\\"Getting Smaller\\" - WHOO!!! IT'S THE HIVES!!! YEAH!! Wait, not it's...not...Um...sorry, Trent, but...whatever, man. (The only cool part is where he yells \\"FLIP-FLOP-FLIP-FLOP\\"...it's special, trust me.)<br /><br />\\"Sunspots\\" - Superb. Menacingly laid-back. Almost sounds like something Scott Weiland would sing. If it wasn't so, y'know, menacingly laid-back and stuff. The lyrics are impressive, as well.<br /><br />\\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" - CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. I do believe they played this live at the show, as well. The chorus is beatiful and classic NIN.<br /><br />\\"Beside You In Time\\" - This is another song that must be experienced. The beginning of it brings back memories of \\"The Day The World Went Away\\", and that resemblance stays throughout the song. Trent's relaxed voice, bleeding into the music. The way it picks up towards the end. The transcendence of this piece is unrivaled by any other song Reznor has made. Completely and utterly precious. One of my favorite tracks from the album, if not from NIN's entire career.<br /><br />\\"Right Where It Belongs\\" - One of the most frail songs I've ever heard on an album Trent has sewn together. It's quiet, deconstructed atmosphere blends \\"Hurt\\" and the entirity of the E.P. \\"Still\\" masterfully and woefully. The lyrics present a concept that isn't truly new, but they are nevertheless deeply moving.<br /><br />Altogether, the new machine proves itself a worthy successor of all of the magnificent previous works of Reznor. Some songs may seem flawed, but in time, if you're a true fan like me, their lyrics, rhythms, and quirks will be fused into your head, right where they belong.ou make wild and crazy comparisons like that, be sure to examine all of NIN's back catalogue. <br /> <br />\\"Only\\" - I was excited to hear what this song was going to be like.

B0007TKH66|5.0|When the fourth STAR TREK spin-off, a prequel, premiered in 2001 fans were skeptical of this latest incarnation of the longest-running television franchise in history.  Aside from a couple obvious \\"kinks in the hull\\" ENTERPRISE delivered with a great cast headed by leading man Scott Bakula in the role of the first Starfleet captain to map the stars outside of Earth's immediate territory.<br /><br />Along the way, the crew faced Klingons, Ferengi, Technology Break-downs and a new enemy with a sinister agenda leading into a Temporal Cold War.<br /><br />Season One is inspiring and good TREK.  If anything, it should great promise.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|I never thought I could get truly hooked on a show until this one.  I am 31, a wife, a mother, and an executive and I absolutely live for Tuesday nights now!  Wonderful storylines, great actors, and the best chemistry between actors I have seen ever!  My husband and 10 yr old son both love the show.  Recruit everyone you know to watch this show so we can enjoy many more seasons!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|WHen i saw the movie, i was shocked. i wasn't expecting such a lovely movie, I felt as if i were in the Majestic Theatre again seeing the play. I though it was amazing, it's just like the real play and the songs are awesome, the actors are exactly as one can imagine.<br /><br />If u like musicals, then this will be ur favorite. I never was a fan of operas but i really liked this one. It's so romantic and sad at the same time.. it will melt your heart.. and then the songs will be stuck with you all day haha \\"the phaaaantom of the opera is there.. inside you mind\\"

0060736267|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been on my \\"to read\\" list since girlhood, but I never got around to it, until this week, at age 29.  Now I almost cannot believe I lived so long without reading it.  Smith's novel is a written masterpiece of storytelling, characterization, and narration.  Never have I so longed to be back in college with a professor and fellow English majors, to be sure I hadn't overlooked a single morsel of a book.  Though Smith writes in the third person, it IS \\"Francie's book\\" and the narrator describes the world beautifully through her eyes.  Over and over, a single, simple sentence expressing a fleeting, naive thought by young Francie manages to make more of a poignant and sometimes humorous social commentary than what other authors might take entire chapters to describe.  As Francie grows, so does the narration-- becoming more direct, less naive, and more self-aware.  Francie is one of the most lovingly drawn and memorable characters I've ever encountered-- she is a timeless picture of every curious young girl who has ever grown up in a poor family, dreaming of more, working hard in school and writing her way to a better life.  A century later, I know that I was that girl, and thousands of other women over time have been \\"that girl,\\" yet Francie manages at the same time to be both every-girl and a unique little jewel all her own.  Smith's book not only provides an intriguing description of life of the American urban poor at the turn of the century, but also grapples with social issues still existing in modern America.  This is a book to be read over and over; even while reading it, I was aware of how much I was missing by not pausing to relish and deconstruct particular passages.  However, it is also a novel so well-written and so packed with life that it deserves to be savored between readings.  So, as I finished the book, I had to stop myself from turning back to page 1 and starting again-- at least for a while.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Enterprise is an engaging look at the birth of a universe that many of us have grown up with.  This well acted, well written show does a great job giving us a view of the world we know and love.  Highly recommended.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|Despite being a fan of serious, artsy cinema, I fail to understand why \\"Closer\\" has gotten the acclaim it has. All four leads turn in pretty mediocre performances, though this could be due to the weak script - one of those overblown ones that look fabulous on paper and jaw-droppingly awful when spoken by actors - and Julia Roberts' perplexing drag-queen like performance does nothing to elevate the quality of this cinema.<br /><br />Depsite Natalie Portmans' desperate attempts at some sort of nouveau-style attempt at dramatics (her breakdown scene when Jude Law leaves her is particularly embarrassing), the film wears thin in about a half hour. This is because you know exactly what happens, and you know that these four characters are going to be kicked around so hard that by the end of the film you feel sympathy for none of them. And thats exactly what happened.<br /><br />\\"Closer\\" is the story of two couples whose lives intertwine. Most of this has got to do with sexual attraction - romance and love take a back seat, and this was an aspect of the film that did not appeal to me. Its as if the director really wanted to show us a dark, depressing side of relationships, but at the same time wanted to infuse the film with the air of an 'artiste', so in the end you have a very snobbish film with no substance or artistic merit whatsoever. If people behaved like people in this film do, we'd all be rather stunned, simply because none of the characters carry themselves with the remote consistency of a human being. The play is robotic even, and if that was the intended effect, even that wasn't done very well.<br /><br />I particularly have a problem with Jude Laws' character in the film because the actor has really compromised both on his acting and choice of roles on this one. Forget the tawdry net-lingo used in the movie, its difficult to imagine someone being so spineless and fearless at the same time. Even if they were, Jude Law doesn't do a very good job of convincing us. Julia Roberts looks frighteningly like a man in this movie, seeming so much older than all of her costars, including Clive Owen who is no spring chicken to begin with. Not that this is a bad thing, but it really removes her from the spirit of the film. Natalie Portman is far more effective, but the horrendous dialogue they give her ruins any chance she has.<br /><br />The DVD of \\"Closer\\" is a welcome addition because I believe every film student should see this movie. Its quirky and will be talked about, but to me thats for all the wrong reasons. Unlike real modern classics like 'The Machinist' this movie wants to be a cutting edge dark film so desperately, that it shows. And when that happens, it can't do much else than fall to pieces. This is very poor film-making, and I wish the acclaimed director would go back to making films the way he used to instead of using overpaid Hollywood stars in meaningless films about relationships based on lust and deceit.<br /><br />An ineffective film.
