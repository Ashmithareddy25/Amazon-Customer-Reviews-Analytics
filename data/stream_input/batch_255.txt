B000003TAW|5.0|I bought 'Weezer' initially because I loved the catchiness of the albums first  singles: 'Undone(The Sweater Song)', and 'Buddy Holly'. But a closer listen to the album shows that this then-begining band has backbone. In a time where Nirvana rip-offs were in charge(Candlebox, 4 Non-Blondes etc.), Weezer made alternative music cool again, in a way that only Weezer could do it. Rivers Cuomo is a musical genius who writes songs in ways that some artists could only dream about. 'In The Garage' floored me. That is the songs that I interpret with Weezer, a pop-punk opus to the early days of many a rock band jamming together in the most likely of place for superstardom. Every track on that album touched me in a specific way, but 'My Name Is Jonas' is by far my favorite song on this record. Soft, Hard, Melodic, Punk, Pop, Rock, all in one song. If your a Weezer fan and don't have this record, shame on you, and if you are a Weezer fan, have this reocord and don't know every word of this record, you put Weezer fans to shame. And if you are a new Weezer fan and want to know where to star, this is the record to get. ...
B00005R2M3|5.0|WOW!!!!  Shakira has a style that is like no others.  As a mix of latin and rock there is something about it that is truly unique.  Each song is different and beautiful in its own way.  I don't have any particular favorites- I basically love them all!  The fact that this is her FIRST album in the language of english really made me appreciate her even more.  She knows some pretty impressive words already.  She also co-wrote every song and produced the entire album (need I say more!?).  Some songs are latin, spicy and will make you wanna dance, while some songs have an origional rock-latin sound to them, and while some are slow and romantic.  All the songs flow well and sound incredible.  If you want good fresh music, purchase this cd. It rocks! Shakira is beautiful and talented. Keep doing your thing, girlfriend!
B00005JKWJ|4.0|First, don't expect Blade II to be as good as the first because it just isn't.  No sequel ever is.  However, if you liked the first, the second is very good too.  Fight scenes are better in the second movie, and the plot is pretty good, too.  New weapons, etc.
B000065U6O|5.0|The fact that a \\"nobody\\" like Adolf Hitler rose to such power is frightening enough, but thanks to this film we have a recorded history that helps explain WHY.  Riefenstahl's glorious filmmaking technique depicts the savagely seductive power of the Fuhrer over the people of Germany and is an important piece of history to help remind us \\"never to forget\\" and, especially, to not let it happen again.
B000066C6Z|4.0|&quot;Top Secret&quot; pales in comparison to &quot;Airplane&quot;--that was my thought when seeing it in a theater during the opening week. The Zucker Brothers seemed to be going through the motions, when compared to their previous effort. Many gags seemed to be formula based and uninspired--in particular, perspective jokes were repeated throughout (scenery moving as opposed to a train, monstrous telephone sitting on a desk, boots with no body attached, etc.). <br />That's the bad--fortunately, there's enough good about this movie to overcome the weaknesses--and, miracle upon miracles, it gets better with repeated viewings. I have a well-worn Betamax videocassette of &quot;Top Secret&quot; and a VHS version acquired during a &quot;Movie Channel&quot; preview week--it's about time that Paramount put this film on DVD! It may not be the equal of &quot;Airplane,&quot; but &quot;Top Secret&quot; still has some wonderfully funny moments , a lot of memorable dialogue, and some great rock 'n roll music parodies as well--not to mention the most anachronistic back-up group ever to accompany a rock star. <br />Am not certain if this is mentioned on the DVD, but if you have the means to do so, try listening to the scene at the Swedish bookstore in reverse (perhaps &quot;forward&quot; might be a better way of putting it?)--there's one additional gag that never appears in the &quot;subtitles.&quot;
B00006AW2J|5.0|After a brief foray into psychedelia (culminating with the December 1967 release of \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\"), The Rolling Stones hooked up with American producer Jimmy Miller and came out swinging from the hip the following year, determined to return to the raw r&b roots on whose wings they first rose to prominence.  The first result was the \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" single released in May '68, and then, after being held up for a few months due to squabbles between the band and their label over the original cover art, \\"Beggars Banquet\\" appeared in early December.  One listen to this newly-remastered cd reminded me just why this is my all-time favorite Stones album.  First, I've been through a handful of copies of this album over the past quarter-century, and I've never heard it with the impeccable quality, clarity and stereo separation this reissue produces.  And then there's the meat: From the metal prototypes \\"Street Fighting Man\\" and \\"Stray Cat Blues,\\" to the heartbroken ballad \\"No Expectations,\\" the gritty hardcore blues of \\"Parachute Woman\\" and \\"Prodigal Son,\\" the playful country-flavored \\"Dear Doctor--\\" and of course, the downright in-your-face funky \\"Sympathy For The Devil.\\"  It just doesn't come any better than this.  While The Stones' next two studio albums, \\"Let It Bleed\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\" are brilliant and garnered more commercial radio airplay, \\"Banquet\\" comes roaring out of my stereo a good bit more often.  Perhaps the band's hunger to get back on track is a factor in this album's having (to my ears, anyway), a more impassioned, driving undercurrent  than the following classic albums: After all, when a greyhound is hungry, he's meaner, leaner and runs a lot faster than he does when he's fat and happy-so it only makes sense.  This album's a winner from top to bottom, and I urge you to buy this reissue; you will not be sorry.
B0000640VN|3.0|Leopold is so clever in correcting Kate's boss on &quot;La Boheme's&quot; being in Italian and not French, or that the lead character is Rodolfo and not Andre.  (While we're at it, can we buy that a corporate bigwig living in New York can be that culturally illiterate as to need such correction?  &quot;La Boheme&quot; is, after all, probably produced more than any other opera.  I mean -- didn't the man even see &quot;Moonstruck&quot;?)  Since Leopold is from 1876 and La Boheme was first produced in 1896, Leopold is not only clever, but clairvoyant.  Or perhaps, while Kate was at work and Stuart was in the hospital, Leopold was viewing a Puccini Special on PBS?  And wasn't it also clever of Leopold to refer to Kate's boss as &quot;pond scum.&quot; Now's there's an 1876 expression definitely due for a revival!
B00000K501|5.0|The above review by Sam Sutherland compares Rammstein more to a grim sort of band than it should be thought as. All of the songs this video holds are about love in one way or another, and Sutherland has a few mistranslations (Du hast=you have asked me, Heirate mich=marry me). Overall, the band is great.
B000021YQV|5.0|I was lucky enough to go to Ozzfest for free by wining tickets, and they were the best band there, period. Their second CD is deffinintaly one of my best, and shows they can go from speed metal 1-2 trashes to calm melodic beats, and back. Any fan of Heavy Metal/Rock should and would like this album. BUY IT, IT ROCKS!!
0060931671|2.0|COL 49 is a good warmup for V. no doubt, but while touted as being more 'accessible' than either V. or Gravity's Rainbow, is more like a notebook or sketchbook for those books.<BR>  There are many clever metaphors floating in this Sargasso Sea, but Pynchon will never be a master of character.  Not all novels are about human character but those which are not seem to suffer from the problems the aforenamed Sargasso does; still, shallow and crowded with flotsam.<BR>  Perhaps Pynchon is the greatest American novelist of our time; maybe Jeff Koons is the 'greatest' American artist of our time; maybe our deepest sentiments and hopes have been invested in our cars. Keep living and see what changes.
B00006GFAB|3.0|Here's Kiss (aka Gene Simmons) following in Aerosmith's footsteps and running a close second in the &quot;Greatest&quot;, &quot;Ultimate&quot;, &quot;Best Of&quot;, &quot;Essential&quot;, &quot;Classic Hits&quot; sweepstakes.  Didn't Kiss come out with a box set and an album called &quot;Greatest Kiss&quot; recently.<BR>Not to mention &quot;Double Platinum&quot;, &quot;Smashes, Thrashes, &amp; Hits&quot; &amp; &quot;You Wanted The Best...&quot;.   <BR>You can not fault the music.   The songs are imbedded in the hearts and souls of every kid who grew up with this band in the 70's.  &quot;Ace Frehley, lead guitar!&quot;  But the recycling of the music over and over is wearing thin.  NO unreleased studio or live tracks, NO new music at all.    &quot;If it wasn't for the fans we would be nothing&quot;, Simmons always boasts.   Well I am a Kiss fan, a Stones fan, an Aerosmith fan, a Skynyrd fan, a Tull fan, a Blue Oyster Cult fan, a Who fan etc...etc....and I ain't biting anymore.  Excuse me while I go spin my vinyl copy of Alive I bought 30 years ago for under 5 bucks.
B000000M4M|5.0|Dinosaur Jr. are a big part in the early 90's alt. rock burst.  Albums like this one helped make the alternative scene happen.  From the opening riff of \\"freak scene\\" you know this is an album not to miss.  If \\"don't\\" doesn't send a chill up your spine, I don't know what would.
B000003S2O|4.0|Here's something I've been doing lately: Synchronize \\"On Land\\" with track 2 of David Sylvian's \\"Plight and Premonition\\". Put both CDs on infinite repeat and start them up (make sure the sylvian goes from track 2 on to track 1, then 2, then 1, etc.) The two seem to mesh together in a really weird way. And they're not the same length, so you could keep this going on and on forever if you wish. I like to think of this as in the same spirit as Eno's recent \\"generative\\" work: a mini-installation, if you will.<BR>Try it out. You might like it. The Sylvian seems to be unavailible on Amazon, but I found it for sale at the All Music Guide [website]
0316666343|1.0|After reading many reviews of this book -- and most of them were extremely favorable --, I bought it for myself, shortly after it was published.  It was an \\"interesting\\" idea and good up until near the ending.  Why, oh why, did the author feel the need for the \\"sex with those on earth\\" portion?  It would have been better had the dead girl turn her back on earth and accept the \\"heaven\\" she had been dealt.  I gave the book to 3 people and they all agreed that the ending was a dismal failure.
B00004C4L6|3.0|Every once in a while, someone releases a record that is so bizarre in it's musical approach that it has to be regarded and analyzed apart from everything else. This is one of those albums; it belongs in the same vein as Amon Duul's &quot;Psychedelic Underground&quot; or King Crimson's Beatclub performance. All of these records share an experimental approach that is so outlandish, so extreme, that it can barely be described as having any structure to speak of. Its weirdness is so colossal that any previously made assumptions have to be thrown to the wind, and the music taken on its own terms.<BR>This record starts out with some quiet, unsettling noises produced on organ and treated cello, and joined by some muffled drums. This section gives kind of a general feel for the whole album - somewhat unnerving, eerie and unstable. The rest of the record merges these sounds with all kinds of spooky passages for acidic guitar, organ, and VERY heavy-handed drumming. In particular check out the drumming at about 10:00 and following on the second track - Keith Moon fans take note of the FORCE exhibited here. It's almost as if the drums had to be put in the back of the mix or they would overpower everything else. And those guitars - Craaazy.<BR>In the end of the third track, the guitar develops a problem - it makes screechy feedback if it isn't continually struck. So the guy just keeps striking it. End of problem. This is typical of the musical approach taken throughout the album, where the instruments seem to be more in charge of the music than the musicians.<BR>Don't expect this to be anything like other TD records - it's totally different. A very weird disc, but sure to find some fans.
B000002UVZ|5.0|\\"Then name 3 songs! Just 3 songs!\\" shouted Chris S.<br />\\"I don't have to name 3 songs for you just to prove that I like them!\\" replied a visibly frustrated Chris B.<br />Chris B. had just revealed to Chris S. that he and I were going to the R.E.M. concert at William and Mary Hall that week. Chris S. had responded by snorting loudly and imploring Chris B. to name just 3 songs by R.E.M. to prove that he'd actually heard some of their music. You see, rock concerts were a pretty rare event in our neck of the woods back in the late 80s and many of the kids in our high school would go see any concert they could just to achieve the social cachet earned by those who'd attended a recent rock concert. What? You don't believe that Brian White became a lot cooler the day he showed up at band class in his 3/4 sleeved Rock You Like a Hurricane T-shirt? Trust me, we were all impressed and more than a little jealous.<br />If Brian White had been at our lunch table that day instead of Chris S., maybe Chris B. would have gotten away with it. But, Brian White was far too cool (in no small part due to the aforementioned Scorpions T-shirt) to sit with us. So there we were, Chris S. yelling at Chris B. and vice versa.  Chris S. was just too much of a purist to let Chris B. get away with it.  You see, Chris S. believed that you should only go see a band if you were a fan of theirs - and in order to qualify as a fan in Chris S.'s book, you'd better own several of their albums.  So as a proxy for actually inspecting Chris B.'s album collection, Chris S. simply requested that Chris B. list any 3 R.E.M. songs.<br />Once it became clear that Chris S. wasn't going to let him off the hook, you could practically see Chris B.'s mind start to spin. He was trying so hard to come up with those 3 songs. Suddenly he blurted out the name of R.E.M.'s hit at the time, \\"Fall on Me\\", and a brief look of satisfaction came over his face before his brow suddenly furrowed again as he recalled that he still hadtwo more songs left to name. <br />Another minute passed before Chris B. spoke again, this time practically shouting out the song title, \\"Superman!\\" Students at nearby tables looked up from their tostadas (a bland pizza-like concoction baked to a cardboard-like stiffness that school administrators had the good sense not to dare call pizza for fear of losing what little credibility they still had left with their students) to identify the source of the utterance.  <br />Chris B. was now on display in front of quite a number of onlookers curious to see how this was all going to turn out. Well, as I recall, Chris B. didn't manage to name that third song and Chris S. emerged victorious from their little showdown in the cafeteria.<br />Not to be deterred, Chris B. and I attended the concert a few nights later as planned. It was the Lifes Rich Pageant tour and R.E.M. played a great set of songs, the vast majority of which neither Chris B. nor I had ever heard. You see, I knew no more about R.E.M. at the time than Chris B. did, and I'd been relieved at the lunch table a few days earlier that it was Chris B. and not me that Chris S. had challenged. While we enjoyed the concert, we were quite vexed to find that the T-shirts at the merchandise stands were all a bit fey. No way were we going to school the next day in an R.E.M. T-shirt with a nerdy little bicycle on the front when Brian White might show up in his sinister looking Scorpions T. Instead, we had to impress people with our tales of how during \\"Superman\\" some concert goers had been lifted up onto the hands of other crowd members and allowed to surf around with arms outstretched in the pose of (you guessed it) Superman. No, we didn't move up to Brian White levels of coolness, but we certainly climbed a few notches up the high school social hierarchy at least.<br />Soon thereafter, I began serious study of R.E.M.'s music catalogue. In fact, the first tape I ever came to own turned out to be Fables of the Reconstruction, which I received as a gift from an aunt just a few weeks after the concert (for what may have been my 16th birthday) - up until then, my exposure to popular music had come from the radio or from time spent at friends' houses.<br />Over time, I came to own every R.E.M. album up through New Adventures in Hi-Fi, and today I consider Lifes Rich Pageant to be their finest disc as well as one of the finest discs in my entire CD collection. Of course, it has those two hits Chris B. managed to name so many years ago, but there is so much more to Lifes Rich Pageant. Just to name a few highlights - \\"Begin the Begin\\" is a crunchy and powerful opening track, \\"Cuyahoga\\" and \\"The Flowers of Guatemala\\" are lovely ballads (the former might just be my all-time favorite R.E.M. song!), and \\"I Believe\\" is an anthemic song beloved by many adherents of R.E.M. that I know, including Chris B. Yes, the same Chris B. who couldn't name the 3 songs by R.E.M. 15 years ago. Why don't you cut him some slack? He did the research and became a fan too - he even has the albums to prove it. Maybe even enough albums to finally be considered an R.E.M. fan by his one-time nemesis, Chris S.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|Alice In chains were great! That band had good lyrics and Jerry's guitar playing was amazing! Also out of all of the Seatle bands they had to of been the darkest one! With songs titles like We Die Young, and Angry Chair the band was often overlooked or underrated. They had violent lyrics but, at the same time that had great songs! This DVD is it if special features are your interest! It has a discography, home video footage, and every Alice In Chains video! Including We Die Young the seatle version and Rooster in its uncut version! ... They were that good! Almost being to the point of were it is a joke! Buy this DVD and see if they change your life just like they did mine! R.I.P. Layne for your soul will be remembered but, not forgot!
B00006BTCA|4.0|New York was known for the New York Dolls and the Ramones, then the Talking Heads and Sonic Youth, and now for the Strokes and Moony Suzuki.  Interpol somehow got lost in the mix, possibly because their style of music is different from what has been coming out of NYC lately.<br />There's a reason Interpol are constantly compared to Joy Division:  Interpol take JD's best elements (leaping, pounding basslines, dark lyrics low in the mix) and put it in a blender with ingredients from other early 80's post-punk luminaries.  And would you believe it doesn't sound at all derivative?<br />The first half of the album bests the later songs but each track has its strengths, especially &quot;NYC&quot;, which breaks from the rest by using dreamy drones in the place of definitive melodies to make it easily the best track on the album.  &quot;NYC&quot; is also a song that could only have been written by a New York band, despite its contradictory message.<br />&quot;Say Hello to the Angels,&quot; &quot;Hands Away,&quot; and &quot;The Obstacle 2&quot; are other standout tracks that at first seem innocuous, but later you will find yourself singing/humming them for hours on end.<br />The phrase &quot;Everything old is new again&quot; has never been more appropriate, especially in the music scene.  Interpol fall into that category (to a degree), but they stand out because they actually make the old sound brand new and desirable.
0316666343|5.0|When I saw that Alice Sebold had written a novel, I was eager to read it, as I had previously read her heart-wrenching but still triumphant description of her rape as a student at Syracuse University.  I knew that she was an excellent writer, and I knew, unfortunately, that she has first-hand experience with the subject she tackles in the Lovely Bones.  But I was surprised by the manner in which she successfully told what is, for many reasons, a difficult, painful story.<br />The Lovely Bones is told from the perspective of Susie Salmon, the victim of a horribly brutal rape and murder at the hands of a neighbor.  From heaven, Susie watches over her family and sees the havoc that her death has wreaked on those she loves, just as she sees the life that she so desperately misses and that she can't quite let go of.  Her family - mother, father, grandmother, brother, sister - all struggle with the tragedy in different ways, a tragedy compounded by the fact that Susie's body - aside from one part - is never found, nor is her murderer captured, although her father quickly realizes who is responsible.  After her death, Susie develops a rather strange relationship with a girl - still living - from her school, and gradually the people whose lives Susie touched are brought together in different ways.<br />To give away any more of the plot or details would, I think, unfairly spoil the book.  I would add, too, that this is not a novel for the squeamish, and I found myself often equally engrossed and disturbed.  For the most part, Alice Sebold avoids traditional plot devices, although admittedly some events do seem rather predictable and too convenient, and creates a unique vision of heaven that suits Susie and those she meets there.  The one major exception, one that seems incongruent with the rest of the book even though it all takes place in a realm outside of everyday life, occurs towards the end and seems more like a scene from a well-known Hollywood movie than an organice part of this story.<br />That said, the Lovely Bones is a terrifically well-told book, even, in some ways, uplifting.  I could never shake the shawdow of Susie's death, much in the same way that the characters never do, and I think this is a testament to the strength of Alice Sebold's writing.  I am heartened that this book has found such a wide audience, as it is in many ways different from typical best-sellers, and I hope that it leads readers to her previous book, Lucky.  The Lovely Bones was, for me, the type of book that I was totally absorbed in for the time I read it, and I would recommend it, with the caveats mentioned above, to anyone looking for an interesting, original, and intelligent novel.
B00006GFAB|3.0|... What am I gonna say? Endorse it, or turn my back on it? Well... Here are the facts, as objective as I can write them: there isn't a bad song here. fact. The songs rock pretty hard. Fact. Is the compilation good? Yes, it is. Fact. Then why only 3 stars? I am a huge Kiss fan, so much so that I already have \\"Smashes...\\", \\"Greatest\\" nd \\"Platinum\\"...<br /><br />Is this new compilation better than the previous ones? No. Fact. It is hard to believe that 14 years after its release, \\"Smashes\\" remains their most comprehensive, complete compilation...If you don't have anything (at all) from Kiss, then you can purchase this... otherwise... there isn't really a point... if you're looking for a nice retrospective of their career, buy \\"Smashes\\"... If you want their 70's hits, buy \\"Platinum\\"... and frankly, i think you could live a full happy life without \\"Greatest\\" and this new one...<br /><br />I still have a hard time accepting the fact that they keep overlooking their 80's and 90's songs... I know it has more to do with their record company than Gene and Paul themselves, but still...Without those songs, my friends, no band, no late 90's reunion and no cashing in from the nostalgia and neverending compilations!<br /><br />But fear not: at the present rate, it is safe to expect yet another kiss compilation in a couple of years (or is it months now?), and hopefully, a better one. Here's a thought: Why not allow the fans,who are the ones that will ultimately buy the records,to pick 22 songs, 11 from the 70's, 11 from the 80-90's by voting in their website, just as Iron Maiden (and other bands, for that matter)have done to great results? I even suggest a title: Essential Kiss (I know it is lame, but remember kids, we are talking record execs here, not rocket scientists), with the band's logo as the cover artwork, as someone else rightfully suggested? Or you could split it in 2, just like they did with Led Zeppelin (Latter Days/Earlier Days) and/or Rush(Retrospective I/II)? Let me know what happens... in the meantime... Rock n'Roll all Night, and Party every day!!!. in the meantime... Rock n'Roll all Night, and Party every day!!!

0425152251|4.0|Gaardner, a Norwegian high school teacher, has created a wonderful and readable history of philosophy.  The book is weakly constructed as a philosophy course taught to 14-year old Sophie by a mysterious stranger.  But it is this &quot;novel&quot; side of the book that is the thinnest, for Sophie and the other characters in the novel are mere cardboard cutouts tacked on to the margins of the chapters to provide context for the the real book:  the philosophy course.<br />The course chronologically covers thirty major periods, schools of thought, and philosophers from the pre-Socratics through Aristotle, Aquinas, and Hegel to the Big Bang.  Each is presented in an accessible chapter of a dozen pages, with the philosophy teacher simplifying and clarifying points for Sophie.  With the philosophers presented in chronological order, readers can track the trends of thought as each builds on those who came before.  &quot;Sophie's World&quot; is not a great novel, but it is an excellent review of philosophy, and a quick 500 pages.
6301008960|5.0|I can only vouch for the VHS version, but this movie is a total classic. While it has a solid message about the futility of popularity and the innate human urge to make tribal judgements about others, it is also a delicious piece of entertainment.<br />Pat Dempsey gives a stellar performance as Ronald McDonald Miller, the RoboNerd who fakes his way into the fast lane, and Amanda Peterson proves she is more than just serious eye candy with a sensitive and intelligent portrayal of the head cheerleader and Ron's dream girl. Yet in spite of a brilliant performance in a very very hip teen movie, Amanda didn't seem to do any films worth a dang after this classic. What an outrageous waste of talent.<br />The excellent supporting cast, script and John Hughes quality direction make Can't Buy Me Love one of the most refreshing and intelligently \\"feel good\\" movies of all time. LOVE the ending.
B00005JKBC|5.0|This is a spy story with a twist. The greatest intrigue of the mystery puts you on the inside operation. There are a series of <BR>missions that help fill in the blanks as to why a captured operative may be left to die alone by CIA. But Redford isn't an<BR>obvious hero.

B00005JKHP|4.0|Star Trek the Motion Picture is definitely not the best trek ever put on screen, it's still at it's core, good trek.  I myself was not old enough to have watched The Original Series when it first aired.  I do remember watching as many of the reruns as I could.  I also remember the anticipation I felt after hearing that this movie would be released.  Unfortunately I also remember being, enthralled, yet also disappointed after seeing this movie.  I, like everybody else, was expecting a lot more than what we got.  That's not to say the film was bad, it's does stay in principal with what Gene Roddenberry wanted out of Star Trek.<BR>As far as the &quot;Director's Edition&quot; goes, the enhancements I did see, helped the film out quite a bit.  I would also have to say, it's about time Paramount gave Star Trek DVD's the respect they so richly deserve.  I'm sure I am not the only Star Trek fan that has been disappointed by the DVD's.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This was \\" Forrest Gump \\"...I do remember the movie ! <BR> Very talanted , very funny , very smart , very unpredictable !
0446677450|1.0|I have a very mixed opinion of this book - on the positive side, I admire it's message of investing vs. consuming and thought the section on how the rich \\"invent\\" money by issuing securities had some perceptive comments. Had the author spent some more time on developing these messages - this could have been a useful book.<br />Unfortunately the author manages to destroy his credibility to any serious observer with his series of clueless comments on ethics, real estate deals, taxes, finance, and risk management. Some reviewers here dismiss these errors - I refuse to - some of them are sufficiently basic to make their inclusion in a book of advice to beginning investors both negligent and reckless.<br />First - I will cite his ludicrious claim that he uses his cat as a business partner to get out of bad real estate deals. Even if someone actually took an offer with that kind of contingency as a firm bid (I wouldn't - it's final when all affiliated members of the purchasing group agree, otherwise give me another deal), I'd love to see the look on the judge's face when you go to try and enforce that claim. I suspect the contract would be upheld and punitive damages would be imposed - with a possibility of being charged with fraud if you did it to the wrong person.<br />Next - his reckless approach to writing off stuff on his annual taxes (per his comments about rolexes, Hawaii vacations, etc.) wouldn't stand the light of day in a serious audit. Don't mess with the IRS - particularly on something stupid like that.<br />Most galling was his claim of adding his suits and golf clubs to his statement of assets for a loan application...as a banker, I can only imagine the reaction of a logical loan committee. It's verging on a fraudulent claim in my opinion.<br />And then we get to his comments on tax liens and his famous real estate purchase using \\"nothing down\\" to create a bunch of notes. First, he's deluded about what he can get in some of these deals and the amount of timeneeded to do them (a lot - for those kind of discounts). Next - I never saw any concept of pricing a note based on a risk premium - which any rational lender/seller must do...particularly if you want to do it long term. The fact that he managed to make money on that deal is more a matter of luck than skill - in the long run, the cost of default was enough to limit the use of that particular approach. And in the event the investor doesn't realize it - his bankers will & cut him off.<br />And on the subject of advisors - this is a load of self-serving hype intended to prepare the reader to purchase whatever seminar or \\"mentoring service\\" Kiyosaki & his cohorts are pushing. Take is from someone who's actually had to hire advisors before - he has an exaggerated view of the competance and ethics of most of the advisers servicing his clientele. Stock brokers? Give me a break, they get paid on commission...how many of these guys are going to tell you to put it in cash/bonds? Lawyers? At $400 per hour, they want to keep you talking as long as possible. And my favorite - property management firms....good luck on that one.<br />Finally - this book has a strange attitude on the benefits of self-employment vs. working for someone else. I'd like to set things straight here - the best thing to do is to do whichever option (E,S,B) offers the highest potential return on your time and skills given your personality & resources. If someone wants to pay me more for working as their employee than working on my own (total value) then good for them.... Over the past two years I've thought a lot about starting a business - but have realized that my current job - at a nice salary - offers a better deal in terms of asset accumulation (savings, 401k) and benefits - with substantially lower risk. If you are a highly skilled worker, it may make more sense to be an E or S vs. start a business. It's a matter of working the numbers and taking the best deal.<br />This book started in the right direction but fell victim to the author's ego & seminar-style approach to doing business. Readers should read a few other books before putting these ideas into serious practice.
B00005JKG7|5.0|First off, theres not much I can say about this DVD that everyone else hasnt said already. It's a great movie!<br />I remember the first time I saw this movie, It was in a run down Drive-In Theater in Broken Bow Oklahoma. I was old enough to drive and was on a date, I must say it scared the living hell out of us both. Instead of making out like normal we were both glued to the big screen, John Carpenter has the ability to create such a feeling in a person it's hard to explain. It's beyond creepy, I love it. The music score is like anything else he does, amazing. I love the way the movie starts as well, a crusty old guy telling some kids a creepy ghost story. If you like bloody slasher movies with stupid half dressed females running off into the woods... get something else. The Fog delivers more than visuals, it lets your mind ponder on things.<BR>I am so glad The Fog came out to DVD, This is definatly one to add to your collection.

0140386335|4.0|Like everyone else, my remembrances of childhood contain hazy memories of Atreyu doing battle with Gmork, and a young Barrett Oliver as Bastian yelling \\"I will do what I dream!\\" So, in a mood to reaffirm my youthful fantasies, I picked up a copy of Michael Ende's 1979 novel upon which the movie was loosely based, \\"The Neverending Story\\". I was not surprised that the largely dark tone of the movie was, of course, much darker, deeper and much more sustained in the novel. But I am not here to compare the book to the movie, both of which are classics in their own right. Like the best of what is considered children's literature, \\"The Neverending Story\\" has an appeal and a depth that literally begs for continued readings as one grows older. A novel about growth, maturity, the power (fraught as it is) of imagination, and the necessity of books to provide us with different perspectives on our world, \\"The Neverending Story\\" is a challenging children's novel which respects its readers enough to not treat them like children. <br />\\"The Neverending Story\\" begins as Bastian Balthazar Bux, a fat little ten year old, picked on by his classmates and teachers, and ignored by his father, runs from the torments of his classmates one rainy November morning before school. Ducking into Mr. Coreander's vintage book store, Bastian suddenly finds himself in a state of mind that portends that he has come here for a reason. Following a brusque chat with Mr. Coreander, Bastian is drawn to a book the old man was perusing, titled \\"The Neverending Story,\\" bearing a logo of two snakes in an ourobouros pattern. Grabbing the book and ditching school, Bastian hides in the school's attic and begins to read a book that will change his (and our) life. The book's world, Fantastica is in grave danger - a blinding force called The Nothing is slowly eating away at Fantastica - ambassadors of all Fantastican nationalities are sent to the heart of Fantastica, The Ivory Tower, to appeal to the Childlike Empress, the impartial ruler of Fantastica, only to find that she is dying. By the time the green-skinned youth, Atreyu, is sent to discover the cause of the Childlike Empress's illness, Bastian, (and the reader) are hooked. <br />\\"The Neverending Story\\" is a novel that deals heavily with epistemological self-discovery - Atreyu's Great Quest, and Bastian's, test the limits of physical and mental endurance. Atreyu and Bastian represent two approaches to self-knowledge - Atreyu, the Socratic questioner, and Bastian, the experimental deductive reasoner. Both have their pitfalls, but the novel does not fault these two boys for the risks they take or the execution of their schemes.  Success and blame are best judged by the self in retrospect, the novel suggests, and it is only through experience (as opposed to book learning only) that we understand who we are and our places in the world and in relation to others. <br />Ende doesn't spend much time developing minor characters - most of the strange beings we encounter throughout \\"The Neverending Story\\" are rarely present for more than a chapter or two, but the ones who do stick around are impressive, though sometimes simultaneously distant and welcoming presences. Morla the Aged One, the gnome Engywook, and the Three Deep Thinkers illustrate the ruts we can get ourselves into when we are apathetic, or obssessive, but detached. Gmork and Xayide are our tormentors, the nay-sayers, the opportunists, the manipulators. Falkor the luckdragon, Grograman the Many-Coloured Death, the Childlike Empress, Yor, and Dame Eyola are the signposts of encouragement that we meet, especially in our childhood, but also thorughout our lives, guides who provide love, knowledge, and life experience. In short, though most of the minor characters flit in and out of the novel like symbols in dreams, each serves a purpose in the lives of Atreyu, Bastian, and the reader. <br />As I said earlier, this is a novel which respects the intelligence of its readers- there are long stretches of not only joyous fantasy, but also intense political and psychological trauma. Written in the late 70's in Germany, we should really pay attention to Ende's focus on \\"the borders of Fantastica\\" - the focus thoughout the novel on crossing borders, climbing walls, and passing gates all serve as a powerful comment on a split Communist/Democratic Germany represented by the Berlin Wall, and a dream for post-national fluidity. \\"The Neverending Story\\" is not just a novel, but a challenge - for us to mitigate the power of power, to reevaluate our relationships to people and to literature, to be individuals, and not the \\"weak-minded\\" followers that Gmork lusts after. This is really a terrific book, and one that no doubt will continue to enthrall and delight.
B0000683DH|5.0|Clearly Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is, in my opinion, one of the best Star Trek films.  It certainly did a lot more to please long time fans and draw in new ones, than did The Motion Picture.  Drawing on a very powerful character from the original episode, Khan Noonien Singh. Ricardo Montalban delivers a powerful performance.  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForrest Kelly and all the other original characters do a wonderful job of bringing their characters to life in this film.<br />The Director's Edition is a true joy, containing everything that should've been put on this DVD when it was originally released.  Being an avid fan of the Star Trek books, the feature with Greg Cox (one of the best trek authors) and Julia Ecklar (half of the LA Graf writing team) was a pure joy.  Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is a pure Sci-Fi, genre masterpiece and the Director's Edition DVD is a must for your collection!
B00005JLDW|4.0|This movie was quite a surprise!  The temptation is to have the Computer Generated images dominate everything, and hope that we don't notice that there is no plot.  Not true for this movie thank goodness!<br />This film's set up is simple.  It begins in the present, when a tunneling company in London uncovers a lair of hibernating dragons.  Young Quinn has the first contact with the bull dragon, and manages to survive.  Fast foreword to AD 2020, where the entire planet is devastated do to the fertile and active dragon population.  Quinn is the head of a small clan of survivors holding up in an ancient Medieval castle in Northumberland.  They have managed to coexist with the dragons, and their intent is to outlast their reign of terror.<br />Enter Van Zan, the leader of a rag tag group of American Regulars and National Guardsmen who have managed to fly over \\"The Lake\\" (remember that the dragons control the airways), and are slowly making their way to London.  They have devised a way of capturing and netting the dragons by parachuting from a helicopter, and they have discovered two weaknesses: dragons can't see well in twilight, and they are all female.  The bull dragon live in London, and Van Zan is intent on bringing that goliath down.<br />This is a great film, in that it focuses on characterization, character development, an the clash of ideas.  Quinn, the first victim of the dragons, is content to coexist with the dragons, while the wildly aggressive Van Zan is \\"cocked, locked, and ready to rock\\" the dragons back to the Stone Age.  You see theses two natures collide as Quinn fights the ghosts of his past, and Van Zan wrestles with his almost libidinal drive for action.<br />I kept thinking of Hamlets soliloquy, about taking up arms against a sea of troubles, or suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.  All good stories are metaphors, and the best stories are not about the stories themselves, but rather about us.  This film does that, if you can see past the metaphor of the dragons.  Hint: Revelations Chapter 12-the devil is a dragon.<br />As I watched this movie, I thought that it would have made a great miniseries, and can definitely see this movie becoming a TV series a la \\"Stargate: SG-1.\\"  I love the story, and found McConaughey's character riveting.

B000000OSG|4.0|Guns n Roses roared into the rock n roll mainstream back in 1987 with \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" an album that summed up the hedonistic 80's to a tee, the album also quickly became a classic with critics, fans and musicians. It went on to become the 3rd biggest selling debut album of all time. Consequently the band found themselves shot into the spotlight literally overnight. Once downtown LA scumbags scraping by to buy drugs and alcohol,with AFD they were full fledged rock stars,and by the early nineties they were the biggest band in the world, even during the heyday of grunge GNR seemed to survive while other 80's glam rock band members were filling out applications at tower records. For the most part UYI 2 reflects the bands intense fury and musical prowess they demonstrated so brilliantly on AFD, however due partly to the band's need to top AFD, the album does have its share of weak spots. We could probably do without such demonstations of mediocrity as \\"14 years\\", \\"Yesterdays\\", and \\"Shotgun Blues\\". \\"Get in the Ring\\" although furious seems a little below the belt. Not to say UYI2 isn't worth the money or the trip to the record store. The beautiful cover of \\"Knockin on Heaven's Door\\" puts a hard rock spin on the folk dittie. \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is an absolute assault on the ear drums that will leave most GNR fans writhing in joy. The best song on the album however is \\"Estranged\\", a very lonely epic power ballad, that goes on for 9 minutes, but its nine minutes of absolute glam rock glory, with Slash's now signature guitar sound pulling off expressive solos, Axl singing through a mouthful of pain that sounds incredibly real. The song if anything is more proof that Guns n Roses were always more then your usual run of the mill imitation band, there was something pure and uncompromising about their music.

B00005JL3A|2.0|First, let me say this with confidence: \\"Resident Evil\\" starts with nastiness, and then goes to downright nastiness till the end.      I like Milla Jovovich, so as far as she is on the screen, it's OK.  But the film itself is ... awful.  Not that it fails to entertain us.  It is often scary (some of the kids were jumping in the seat, it's true).  Its production designs are decent.  However, the director Paul W.S. Anderson doens't know one thing: originality.<br />The story is about Alice and the squad with special mission, who have to (they are told) to shut down the main computer of The Hive, underground institute specializing in the study of lethgal virus.  An accident there changes the workers (and dogs too) into zombies, and in this deadly place with booby traps, Alice in undergraund has to fight with a vengeance.<br />OK. ...are   As it is, fondly remembering James Cameron and David Twohy, I started to get bored after a while, the film being completely relying on shock tactics of sudden big \\"Bang!\\" and strongly suggested violence.    <br />Jovovich (a bit one-note) is so-so, though lacking the presense of Jolie; Michelle Rodriguez is good, but I frankly thought they are wasting the time and the career.  All in all, just a passable flick though I strongly recommend that you  watch \\"Aliens\\" instead.
6304712499|3.0|Spawn, the Director's cut, presents a more complete vision of Todd MacFarlane's comic book creation, than the PG13 version featured in its theatrical release in 1997.  Having never read the comic, I can't speak with any authority how successful the movie is at capturing the true spirit of the comic.  Nevertheless, I found Spawn to be very entertaining, with a style and tone that reflects its comic book genesis.  The characters are not particularly deep, motivations are basic, and the dialog is at times, pretentious, grandiose and ridiculous.  The reedited version flows better, is more violent, and is punctuated by a quick-cut editing style, and creative scene transitions.  It is the story of a man burnt to death, who returns to Earth after making a bargain with the Devil (Malebolgia).<br />Since the story is based on a comic book, I was willing to cut the movie a bit more slack than normal.  But such additional allowances are not really necessary.  The film does a fairly good job of explaining Spawn's significance, and the nature of his powers.  He goes through a continuous learning process, discovering just what he can, and should do.  Gradually evolving from using firearms, to utilizing the intrinsic weapon of his own body armor.  The commentary track is very helpful in understanding what the whole story is about.  As is Todd McFarlane's edgy, \\"take it or leave it\\" style interview.<br />Spawn, taps into a number of man's basic fears, fire, burning alive and eternal hell.  For justice to be done to this story, the special effects needed to be outstanding, and they are.  Costuming and makeup, for the primary characters of Spawn, and Clown are great.  Computer generated (CG) effects became prevalent in the late 90's, and Spawn is a good example of a film where CG effects begin to take over.  Almost all of the effects work very well.  The \\"capework\\", Spawn's protective armor, and his spike and chain defense mechanisms are particularly effective.  The fiery tunnel down to Hell looks cool, but the vision of Hell didn't quite work for me.  The \\"masses\\" look way too fake, and the character of Malebolgia, (the Devil) just made me laugh.  With flapping jowls, he conjures up images of a hellish \\"Big Bad Wolf\\", crossed with a CG monster from a USMC recruiting commercial.  The final battle in Hell looks a bit disjointed, and the quality suffers a bit.  The budgetary reasons for this are explained in the commentary.<br /><br />Spawn, is a story of a man, struggling to understand his place, in a world where he no longer belongs.  Learning about himself, his powers, and how to control them.  You don't see much of his real face, but Michael Jai White brings a great deal of humanity, and sadness to the character.  Unfortunately for Jai White, a man who is blessed with an incredible physique, this film does not appear to have done too much for his career.  John Leguizamo's transition to the lewd, rude, and evil Clown, is quite remarkable.  His performance is creative, and with humor that does not appear forced.  Martin Sheen, provides name recognition, and does a serviceable job as the ruthless \\"Wynn\\".  Spawn, is a solid fantasy adventure.  Worth your time if you are interested in the genre.

1556154844|5.0|At my last job I was a programmer who was spending a lot of time debugging. Another programmer brought his copy of Code Complete one day and told me it was worth to buy it. It took me 6 months before I ordered a copy. I wish I had done it way faster!<br />The book is an encyclopedy about whatever a coder can deal with: how to tell about the quality of specifications, architectures, how to do routine design, how to name variables, how to commment code, how to build loops, how build and use data structures, how to deal with the boss, how to perform code reviews, how to test routines, how to debug, etc.<br />The author does not explain the topics thoroughly, but provides comments and links to numerous worthy references, including standards and subscriptions available from IEEE. I found it was sometimes necessary to dig into those references to quench my thirst for data.<br />Reading that book was a shocking revelation about the way I should I have performed my job before. I feel sorry for my boss.<br />If you are a coder and do not consider you had a top-notch education in programming, I recommend you to get that book right away, even if you have to borrow money to buy it.
B00006690F|3.0|Man, from the reviews I been reading here, you'd think Eminem is one of the top 10 rappers out. But he isn't. Eminem is an okay rapper who keeps getting radio and video hits, and great record sales. That doesn't make him a great rapper. I'm not an Eminem basher, because I am a fan of his music, but he is clearly overrated. I can easily name 10 current rappers out who are obviously better than Slim Shady: Rakim, Scarface, Jay Z, Nas, DMX, Common, Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Kool G Rap, and Ghostface.<br />Well, on to the CD. If you liked Em's last 2 CDs, then you'll probably enjoy this CD too. Its the same old, same old from Em; with a radio hit included (this time \\"Without Me\\", instead of \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" or \\"My Name Is\\"), a serious song to follow up the radio hit (this time \\"Cleanin' Out My Closest\\" instead of \\"The Way I Am\\"), and a couple songs out just to offend people (\\"White America\\", \\"Drips\\", and \\"Superman\\"). So if you did enjoyed Em's works up to this point, then this CD is worth buying. But for hip-hop fans like me, I was expecting a little more out of Em this time, maybe some new content for his lyrics, or some new different production, but I got neither. Em sticks his mom-bashing lyrics, and his self produced and Dre produced tracks....
B000069HKH|4.0|For me, like so many others, a new Springsteen album carries with it some major expectations. And for the most part &quot;The Rising&quot; delivers.<br />On the positive side, I love the ambition. Not so much the Sept 11 aspect directly, although that is an undoubtedly part of it - more the incredible spirituality and soul that pours out of the better tracks. Few major artists dare aim so high. And those who do rarely succeed so well. This is a hallmark of Springsteen's best material over the past 15 years (from &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; onward (although perhaps ignore &quot;Human Touch&quot;!)), a period in which I think he's been pretty underrated. The albums aside, just listen to some of CD 4 from the &quot;Tracks&quot; compilation. And that's just the stuff he didn't release!   <br />At its best, and here I'm thinking &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, &quot;Into The Fire&quot;, &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; and maybe the title track, &quot;The Rising&quot; is worthy of my favourite Springsteen material. And my favourite Springsteen material, the &quot;Born To Run&quot; album especially, is as good as anything I own. I mean anyone who can be left unmoved by the call in &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; to &quot;Rise up...&quot; has no soul!  Like so much of the album, I love that here Springsteen somehow avoid the pitfalls of cliche and over-wrought sentimentality that would mar the work of a lesser artist tackling this subject matter. He is able to reach out to heart, mind and soul in equal portions.  <br />The album's got a great sound too.  It sounds E-Street, yet very fresh at the same time.  In particular, I love the drum sound Brendan O'Brien gets out of Max Weinberg.  Listen to a song like &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, and the fill about two-thirds through.  Fantastic!<br />On the negatives, I do think the album is too long.  Personally I could happily do without at least 4 tracks.  To name names: Countin' On A Miracle (very routine colour by numbers Springsteen); Furtheron (up the road) (likewise, although I think it could have worked quite well in a more &quot;Tom Joad&quot; style), The Fuse (I think its cool that he's messing with loops, but this just doesn't work here - and I've really tried to like it!) and Mary's Place (a kinda dull rehash of former glories).    <br />Also, I'm not sure he hits all of his lyrical marks.  But then again, as already mentioned, he's aiming very high.  And I wish he'd use Nils Lofgren better.  Lofgren is such an incredible, emotive player, and I reflect on his contributions to the &quot;Live In New York&quot; set (in particular &quot;Youngstown&quot; and &quot;American Skin&quot;), and wonder what he could have done with some of these songs had he been given a bit more leash.  <br />But these are minor quibbles when compared with what is great about this album.  It's certainly not his best.  But the mere fact it is more than worthy of the Springsteen name means its still way beyond pretty much anything else released this year, last year and probably next year.  And I get the impression that it'll just get better with age.  Afterall, Springsteen's taken what is almost certainly the defining event of this time, and out of it succeeded (somehow) in creating something utterly timeless.

The editorial review sounds like it comes from a guy who's just looking for something bad to say about this album just to be different.  And different that review is as it's the only bad professional review I've seen of this album.  <br />Listening to this album is like riding an emotional rollercoaster.  Ryan Adams has produced an honest album where he's laid his soul bare and he's laid it in the most majestic of ways..<br />Trust me, you must own this album and here's why..<br />New York, New York.....the opening track of the album rocks.  The lyrics are full of verve and everybody can relate to the meaning and feeling behind them..<br />Stars go blue.....what can you say about this song but wow, what a refreshing change to actaully listen to an album that doesn't feel like it's been manufactured and processed to please the crowd.  The emotional lyrics and the honesty of them combine to give this song classic status.  Buy this album just for this song..  <br />Those are just some of the songs I cared to mention as every song on this album is brilliant.  Trust me, put this album in your car and then set off for a drive.  You'll come back thinking you've been on a drive with your best friend.  It's that good, that emotional and that honest.<br />Once in a while an album comes along that proves that the artists are the talent and not the music execs..
B000002JEV|5.0|I really enjoyed the Live 2nd CD. There are no words to describe the incredible talent presented here. The one thing that strikes me about this band is that they are so comfortable and confident of their music that they can easily afford to take improvising risks without a care in the world. I just wonder if the studio audience melted before the blazing talent of this group. My favorite songs are on Disc 2: That's the way, Going to California, Stairway to Heaven, and Thank you. I really don't know why I like these songs in particular - I just do. Now I get to rediscover myself through Zep. Better late than never.
B00000DCH9|2.0|This lacks the raw emotional punch of 'Cold Spring Harbor' and it's certainly not as good as the albums he wrote afterwards. The title track is on every compilation and the three other best songs here are on the must-own live album 'Songs in the Attic' in highly improved versions. This album is mostly obsolete. However, 'If I only had the Words' and 'Travelin Prayer' aren't bad. They are the only reasons to buy this album.
B000002LGQ|4.0|Don't get me wrong. it's not bad. It includes the best Madonna song ever(\\"Like a prayer\\") but it's by far not as good as for instance \\"Like a virgin\\" or \\"Music'<BR>Like a prayer: As I said her best song. This is not the remix version. There are some slower and some faster parts and i like the choir<BR>Express yourself. It's also not the remix-version. Great dance song<BR>Love song: This song is witten by Prince. It's the worst song on the album. Slow and very boring.<BR>Til death do us part: A very fast song about a quarrel with her husband<BR>Promise to try: This one is dedicated to her mother who died when madonna was about five. it's a very slow one. The best one of the slower songs. I love the lyrics and the melody<BR>Cherish: A mid-tempo song. It's so-so.<BR>Dear jessie: This song is with violins. It has a hippie style but I like Rollergirl's coverversion better.<BR>Oh father. A slow one. i think it's dedicated to Madonnas dad. <BR>Keep it together. That's the worst of the faster songs. It's boring.<BR>Pray for spanish eyes. Slow and good for dreaming<BR>Act of contrition. This is not a song. It's kind of an outro. with strange noises. i think it should be funny.<br />Many people say that this is Madonnas best album. i don't think so. It's her most personal (is that the right word?) album but by far not her best.
0316666343|5.0|This book is well written and catches the reader by the first paragraph.  Lots of sadness with the death focus, of course, but lots of hope, too.  Others in my family have given thumbs up on this one also.
0316666343|4.0|I have never read a book that does what this book does- it is incredibly sad and incredibly happy at the exact same time.  I do agree with many readers though that the first chapters are better than the end, but the idea that this book puts out is compelling and intriguing that it is impossible not to get something out of this book.  After I finished this book I felt ,basically, just content.  Not that it wasn't amazing, but it leaves you with a feeling that life, though trying at times, is an amazing and thrilling experience, and that we should enjoy it and appreciate it.
0140120416|5.0|Forty years ago I studied Russian in college and used the unwieldy British- and Harvard-oriented texts of that time. After a few years I forgot it all. I recently decided to relearn the langauage and bought all the good texts I could find. This is the one I keep going back to. It's straightforward, easy to use, and well organized. It's made virtually every commuter rail trip with me in the past year while I work my way through at my own pace.  I've amply annotated it and filled it with 3x5 post-it notes for the exercises. I still use it for the easy-to-find tables in the back. And throughout the appendices, vocabulary lists, and glossaries, lesson numbers are noted for most words and concepts. It's short on subordinating and adverbial conjunctions. The letter-writing section is short and a bit formal for casual writing. It gives good conversational information but it would be better with accompanying tapes. This is the book I took to Russia with me.
0316666343|1.0|All in all, I felt manipulated and disappointed by this book. Worst of all was the perpetuation of the pathetic myth that girls and women are safe at home and that the the real danger is those twisted, loner, strangers out there.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Girls and women are raped, battered, and murdered in overwhelming numbers by men they know, men they love. <br />The horrorific details of Suzie's murder, the ever-lurking murderer, the shallow choices of Suzie's mother, the fact that the parents didn't bother to fight things out with each other, and the dangerous romanticism of alcoholism in the most likable character, all slimed me to the point of wanting a shower.  It was an obnoxiously formulaic plot--keep the reader turning the pages because they can't bear the dreams they'll have if they leave the horror and suspense in mid-tale,  keep the characters stuck in sex, and ignore the self-awareness and real work necessary to take the developmental steps needed to support the changes the characters made.<br />This was candy--if you have the stomach for it--more shallow than Bridges of Madison County or The Horse Whisperer.  It could have been so much more.  I especially wanted a deeper exploration of the mother's ambivalance about mothering, and I wanted to see her make her choices with more passion, more drive for a real quality of life for herself. After all, she had plenty of time to progress to that point.<br />Yuck.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Very thought provoking.<BR>   The movie is a string of vignettes linked by a low-key but interesting plot. The vignettes are each \\"bite-sized\\" monologues or dialogues musing on the nature of life, death, free will, creativity, and existence. They are all done with a sense of humor, respect, and compassion. No one is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\"; thoughts are simply presented by the thinker. React and absorb what you will.<BR>   I saw this one night, and within three hours of waking the next morning, bought two copies, one for myself, one as a gift. I watched it twice the first weekend.<BR>   If you like to think when you watch a movie, or just to sit and think, this is a great movie to watch many times.<BR>   Content aside, the music is a very nice Jazz / Swing collection. It makes great background music, only dominating the scene on the few scenes when it's supposed to be in the forefront. The animation style is interesting. It can take a bit to get used to everything being in motion, but I found I became accustomed to that quickly.
B00005Y228|5.0|I saw the video on MTV for &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; and thought it was very cool and had to hear the cd.  I sampled it briefly at Virgin Megastore and bought the CD.  Not cheesy and cookie cutter like many others out there now.  I had never heard her music before so I had nothing to compare it to except the other acts out there now. It's an excellent dance cd. She sounds like Paula Abdul even in one song...(I don't mean that in any bad way either - just an observation..) a little Madonna..maybe Britney too but WAY better and more REAL. I highly recommend this CD.
1558803602|5.0|I really love this film. It beautifully <BR>captures so many aspects of life. <BR>Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter act so<BR>well together. Everytime I hear <BR>&quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot; by The Platters, I<BR>cannot help but think of this film.<BR>I think Ebert had smoke in his eyes,<BR>though, when he reviewed this film. Why did he give<BR>it such a tough review? I will never understand that.<BR>If you believe in love, watch this film! It is quite<BR>a fantasy-tale, but can be very comforting to a lot <BR>of people. You'll see what I mean.<BR>   Trust me-- watch it!
0345446798|5.0|For those of us who love dogs and enjoy working with them everyday, it is a real joy to find a book that shows so much respect for dogs as intelligent, observant, thinking beings. If every human would read this book, the life of every dog on earth would be easier and happier, and, of course, the humans would enjoy considerable benefit as well because they would understand their dogs so much better.
B00005JKDR|5.0|DISC ONE: For moviegoers during summer of 2001, the marquee was packed with animated options: Shrek, Atlantis, Final Fantasy and Monsters, Inc. If you disect the movies, the first two end up being dissapointing when viewed in the small screen and Final Fantasy is just made with a different public in mind. Now, Monsters, Inc. achieves in DVD format the same feel you got when you (hopefully) saw it in theaters: the movie IS a great movie for all ages. No bells and whistles: simply brilliant!<br />The script is very funny, clever and innovative (it is worth seeing on the DVD how much it evolved from the original treatment it was going to have...), turning around the ageless childhood fear of monsters into a fear of kids BY monsters, who need kids' screams in order to power their society. Top ranking scarer, big, blue and furry Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and his one-eyed assitant, Mike Wazowski (brilliantly played by Billy Crystal) see their \\"monstrous\\" lives turned around when Sulley accidentally brings a little girl (Boo) by accident into their monster world.<br />Complementing the script and the voices, the animation is incredible. The faces of the characters, the blinking of the eyes (the red in the eyes, when Mike sprays antibacterial stuff on his face, the glassy look in Sulley's eyes toward the end of the movie), the fur of Sulley (every hair moving just as if he were real), the illumination all through the movie. Plus the persecution scene leaves you speechless: there's SO MUCH happening in it, and it's so seamless: one of the great animation accomplishments of the movie without any doubt.<br />DISC TWO: One element that powerfully called my attention is the very human (is that ironic or what?) touch that the second disc has. For example, the Director, the two Co-Directors and the Producer appear in the very beginning, showing you how to find your way around the DVD. It's not that it's a convoluted DVD or anything of that sort: simply the two discs are packed with all sorts of goodies and they are making an effort to have you find it all.<br />One of the best things included in disc 2 is the Oscar-winning animated short film \\"For The Birds\\" which we all enjoyed in theaters so much right before Monsters started. Also included are the complete outtakes (call them \\"bloopers\\" from the movie, if you may, whose concept alone makes you scratch your head in surprise while you laugh till it hurts). But the fun to disc two doesn't end there: there is a wealth of details for the more technically-inclined or those who simply are curious about the way animation is done, with a whole tour through the process, from story reels, to layout, animation, simulation (a key component in the level of perfection accomplished with Sulley's fur and the way Boo's big shirt works) ahd shading/lighting. Same thing is done with design and music & sound. Wrapping up the goodies is a pretty fun tour of Pixar studios where you can catch a glimpse of why these guys are able to come up with such a funny movie: they're having a blast there! :D<br />Technical comments<BR>-If you view the DVD on a computer (as I did), the first time you do it, you will go through the installation of the InterActual player software. Hit \\"Accept\\" at every step of the way: whether you like it or not, you won't be able to take advantage of all the elements in the DVDs unless you view it using this software...<BR>-Another detail for computer users: the \\"Peek-A-Boo Door game\\" was useless on my computer. It's designed to be played when viewing the DVD on a DVD player. In fact, it almost brings my laptop to its knees. So, my recommendation to you DVD-viewers using a computer to go past the intro page with all the games on it and click on to view the movie.<BR>-Subtitles included are in English only, so that probably will not make Spanish-only or French-only-speaking viewers too happy, n'est-ce pas? Verdad?<br />In general, though, excellent! Five stars to this incredible production by Disney and to its Two-Disc Collector's Edition. You will enjoy every bit of it and watch it several times over.
B000002LCI|5.0|Ask any fan of the Mode what's their favorite DM album, and most likely they'll give you one of two answers: \\"Black Celebration\\" or this, their 1987 album \\"Music for the Masses.\\" This album was a career-defining statement that had the Mode in top form and cemented Martin Gore's standing as one of the most sensitive and thoughtful songwriters of his era. You know the hits: \\"Never Let Me Down Again,\\" \\"Behind the Wheel,\\" and \\"Strangelove.\\" But dig deeper, and you'll find greatness in even the non-single album cuts. There's the quiet elegance in \\"Things You Said,\\" the fire and urgency in \\"I Want You Now,\\" and the lovely \\"Nothing.\\" For much of its career, Depeche Mode were dismissed as a band that produced music too synthetic to convey any emotion. To that, I say, \\"rubbish.\\" \\"Music for the Masses\\" is a great album with as much feeling and emotion as anything by DM's rock and roll peers.
B000062Y98|5.0|Why the hell is everbody mentioning Queen and their old<BR>album ? ; this is metal style music and Queen did not take<BR>patent on this title.<BR>A night at the Opera is probably the most wellproduced<BR>piece of metal that you'll find. It's supermelodic, heavy and<BR>x-tremely vocal-oriented.<BR>The build ups are very advanced and you are not likely to<BR>confuse this with anything else on the current scene.<BR>Super !
B000000WZ4|4.0|It's something of a miracle that Depeche Mode's 1997 album even saw the light of day.  Since their misguided 1993 release \\"Songs of Faith of Devotion,\\" the group lost key musician Alan Wilder, and singer David Gahan had a very public meltdown and battle with drugs.  Impressively, Gahan was able to clean up his act and reunite with Martin Gore and David Fletcher for \\"Ultra,\\" which finds the Mode returning to their synth roots after they tried (and failed) to be a rock band on \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion.\\"  Yeah, guitars pop up here and there, but this is an electronic album all the way.  The album's best cut is easily the single \\"It's No Good,\\" which features rubbery, agressive bass set to Gahan's trademark moan.  \\"Useless\\" has funky drums, abrasive guitars, and bleeping synths.  A favorite track, \\"Sister of Night,\\" is a near-ambient gem that radiates in its quiet beauty.  Gore hasn't lost his touch as a songwriter, and he comes up with lyrics that reflect Gahan's personal tribulations in the single \\"Barrel of a Gun,\\" which vaguely refers to his battle with drugs.  \\"Ultra\\" isn't one of my very favorite Depeche Mode albums, but it's an impressive return to the spotlight considering the hurdles this trio faced during its making.
0316666343|4.0|The opening scene pulled me right in. What could be more horrific than the rape and murder of a child?<br /><br />In beautiful, seamless prose, Sebold broke my resistance to dealing with anything heavenly. The premise had me marvel at the way the author uses the omniscient point of view so skillfully as the dead girl watches her parents, her sister and little brother trying to come to terms with her absence, to her being murdered when no body is found. It kept me going for the first 200 pages. Then my interest dissipated. There is not enough development in terms of action and plot, and the fast read slows down as the novelty wears off and nothing takes its place.<br /><br />At the end, the father's illness is hardly surprising, and the mother's return is not really a return. She makes little attempt to make up to the little boy she left behind. Maybe that is all too realistic: a sibling of a murdered child not only loses a sibling, but in a way, also the parents when a part of them dies in the trauma.<br /><br />The metaphysical morphosis as the dead girl finally loses her virginity with the boy she once kissed is hardly satisfying, since this is not what Susie seemed to have wanted all along from her heaven.<br /><br />The absence of a resolution to the crime robs the novel from the potential drama and the emotional catharsis it should evoke in the reader as the book ends, that tingling feeling of still being there is missing.<br /><br />Talia Carner, author,<br />[[ASIN:1930252986 Puppet Child]] and  [[ASIN:0977382125 China Doll]]
B000005JAX|5.0|As Depeche Mode approached the height of their popularity, songwriter Martin Gore quietly released his solo EP.  With the exception of &quot;Motherless Child,&quot; I didn't know that these songs were actually covers until I bothered to read the CD's credits.  Gore sings these tracks with enough personality and depth to claim these songs as his own.  Productionwise, it doesn't stray very far from the synth-heavy roots of Depeche Mode, but the mood and tone are a bit darker.  Those who are looking for the hook-heavy pop of &quot;Strangelove&quot; or &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; will be disappointed here, but this is a pretty good collection that DM fans shouldn't miss.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Was there ever a better suspense thriller than Steven Spielberg's \\"Jaws\\"?  There can't be very many films that have matched the thrills and quality of this film.  \\"Jaws\\" became the biggest moneymaker up to the date it was released (1975) and helped to create the summer blockbuster.  It also made a young unknown director into Hollywood's golden boy, a position that Spielberg has kept for the past two and a half decades.<br />Spielberg's detractors have claimed that Spielberg ruined Hollywood by churning out \\"juvenile\\" blockbusters, but I demure.  Spielberg's films are so much better than the junk that Hollywood regularly makes.  \\"Jaws\\" is better written and directed and has better characters than almost all thrillers made since.  Spielberg can't help it if so many inferior directors try to copy him by turning out inferior films.<br />Roy Scheider stars as Martin Brody, the chief of police of a small town on Long Island.  Brody thought he was getting away from it all by moving here from New York City, but instead finds his problems are just beginning when a young girl is found devoured by a shark.  Brody must find a way to close the beaches and kill the shark to keep further people from becoming the shark's next meal.  Unfortunately, the town's slimy mayor and deadbeat locals are determined to keep the beaches open to take full advantage of the upcoming fourth of July weekend (\\"We're a summer town.  We need summer dollars.\\")<br />Finally, after several more deaths, Brody teams up with shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) on a Moby Dick-like quest to kill the beast.<br />Spielberg's direction is quite taught.  I particularly liked little touches like that scene where Brody is nervously watching people swim in the ocean while people pass him obstructing his vision.  There's also little humorous touches as when a person stops to talk to Brody over a trivialty cutting off his view, and when Hooper and Quint get into a contest by showing off their scars.<br />Certainly the characters are more interesting than in your average thriller.  Roy Scheider manages to exude just the right amount of masculinity and vulnerability as Brody.  I found it interesting learning about Brody's fear of the water.  \\"It doesn't make sense for someone who's afraid of the water to live on an island,\\" Hooper says to Brody.  \\"It's only an island if you look at it from the water,\\" Brody points out.  Brody's confronting the shark will be his way of facing and overcoming his fears.  I also really liked Richard Dreyfuss' nutty performance as the eccentric ichthyologist.  But it's Robert Shaw who steals the show as the salty, hard-bitten sailor.  I thought the speech that Shaw gives about his experiences with sharks after the sinking of the Indianapolis to be one of the highlights of the film.  It gives some insight into his character as well as to his apparent death wish.<br />Not to be overlooked is John Williams' now classic score.  Who doesn't now recognize the \\"Jaws\\" theme?  Spielberg would collaborate successfully with Williams in many subsequent films.<br />The ending is also very satisfying.  Unlike a lot of horror thrillers that leave you feeling unnerved and upset, this film's ending leaves you feeling happy and exhilarated.  Spielberg is said to have improvised here, uncertain as how to end his film.  Bravo Spielberg!
B00003CX8J|4.0|The long-awaited comic book-to-film translation of X Men left some fans satisfied and some wanting more. There are some terrific action scenes and great characters. Veterans Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) are terrific, as are Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Tyler Mane as Sabertooth. The Special Effects in the film are inventive and amazing. My favourite SFX moment: Where Magneto is walking across a pathway created by moving metallic planks across a chasm, the pinnacle of cool. Director Brian Singer has loaded the film with eye-popping visuals and some great one-liners. Michael Kamen's futuristic score (one of his best) adds to the mysterious tone. After watching the film several times through, there are a few little quibbles. Wolverine is a great character, but a bit more exposition on the other characters would be good, and the rather stringent running time leaves the film a bit short on great set-pieces. Still, that's what sequels are for!<br />The DVD extras are great, with trailers, some interesting deleted scenes, \\"The Mutant Watch\\" featurette, a Bryan Singer interview, Hugh Jackman's screen test, still photo gallery and TV spots. To quote Darth Vader: \\"Impressive. Most impressive.\\"
B000056HRZ|5.0|To me, \\"Casablanca\\" is one of the most perfect examples of films from Hollywood's golden age.  It's the kind of black and white, studio-bound film that they don't make anymore.  It's also got Humphrey Bogart, one of Hollywood's greatest stars in one of his signature roles.  <br />\\"Casablanca\\" is the story of a cynical cafe owner named Rick Blaine, who sticks his head out for no one. Rick used to be a notorious anti-fascist who fought against Franco in Spain and ran guns against Mussolini in Ethiopia. However, after being abandoned by the girl that he was in love with,  ... Rick ceased to care about causes and instead settled in Casablanca.....<br />\\"Casablanca\\" was made as war propaganda to convince an isolationist America to join the battle against fascism.  But thanks to sharp writing, directing, and acting it transcends this and becomes a universal story about the need to get off our behinds and combat evil.  Many of the lines have gone down in history, so that even people who have never seen this film recognize the quotes.  <br />Among the memorable quotes:<br />\\"Here's looking at you kid.\\"<br />\\"Of all the ginjoints in all the world,...\\"<br />\\"I'm no good at being noble,...\\"<br />\\"Here's looking at you kid.\\"<br />\\"Play it, Sam.\\"<br />\\"Louis, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\\"<br />I'm sure fans will be able to think of plenty more.<br />Bogart represented a different kind of hero.  Unlike the almost sickeningly idealistic Victor Laszlo, Bogart's character is quite willing to turn a blind eye to the world's problems.  Which makes his ultimate act of self-sacrifice so noble, because it is so unexpected. ...  We find ourselves amazed by the cynical Rick's ability for goodness.<br />The ending of \\"Casablanca\\" has got to be one of the greatest, and most satisfying endings ever in a Hollywood film.  It is the ending perhaps more than anything that makes \\"Casablanca\\" so much better than the average Hollywood film from that era.<br />\\"Casablanca\\" is a must for any lover of old films.  Like me!
0446608955|5.0|It had been on my bookshelf for months but I didn't have the interest to read the book. I only read it when I learned that we were going to watch the movie starring Mandy Moore. Needless to say, the book was far better than the movie. The book was also better than what I expected. In fact, it's one of the best

6305127638|4.0|One of the strongest Trek films, First Contact is also flawed. Clearly there was footage cut from the film prior to release. Like Wrath of Khan, First Contact would benefit from a director's cut restoring some scenes. There are a number of scenes where the transitions are a bit awkward and it's clear that more character development and exposition is missing from this film than some of the other films in The Next Generation series.<br />While recycling the Moby Dick motif has received much criticism (it was used to great effect in Wrath of Khan), it works perfectly in First Contact. Picard's cool, controlled persona finally cracks here and for good reason; his character underwent emotional trauma. It's only natural that he would respond with anger and frustruation. Sure, we expect reason from Picard's character but this actually contributes to the Picard.<br />All of the characters benefit from the expanded screen time although, again, it does feel like there is more missing. Perhaps it was sacrificed to keep the pace of the film. Regardless, it wouldn't hurt to restore it to its rightful place. After all, it benefited Nicholas Meyer's Wrath and (for the most part)the reediting on ST:TMP also helped clarify and improve the narrative flow.<br />First Contact was an improvement over Generations. While that film is solid and entertaining, it always felt that it was made for television and not for the big screen. The epic element always has worked well for Trek when the big screen adventures were made. The same holds true here as well. With Nemesis coming out in December it's time that Paramount and director Jonathon Frakes return to First Contact and let it live up to its five star potential.
6305622914|5.0|This film has some moments of hilarity that will make you laugh until you cry; but it also has moments that will cause some reflection.  And in the end, it's actually somewhat gentle fare, considering the subject matter, which on the surface may seem wont to lend itself to a much coarser interpretation.  Rest assured, however, \\"The Full Monty,\\" directed by Peter Cattaneo, is a fun-filled excursion that skirts some serious issues while warmly embracing the more humorous aspects of the human condition.  It's a telling study of desperation without the misery, of loss without the moroseness, and finally it's an upbeat, uplifting tale of pursuing possibilities, and what it means to reach for the rainbow in the wake of the storm.<br />The film opens with a clip that could've been prepared by any local chamber of commerce, touting the city of Sheffield, England, as a growing concern in the industrial market, a veritable city on the move.  The story then quickly jumps ahead twenty-five years, and we find that the once booming steel business has been quieted, the mill closed down indefinitely.  Which means, of course, that many able bodied workers are out of a job, and their prospects for the future are less than bleak.  Among those forced to go on the dole are Gaz Schofield (Robert Carlyle) and his friend, Dave (Mark Addy), whose lives become especially complicated by their current status of \\"unemployed.\\"  Unable to make child support payments, Gaz is about to lose visitation rights with his son, Nathan (William Snape), and losing his job has left Dave emasculated, leading to problems with his wife, Jean (Lesley Sharp).<br />Then one night the \\"Chippendales\\" show arrives in town, and for the \\"ladies only\\" performance, the local venue is sold out, at ten quid a head.  And after having a quick peek at the dancers for himself, inspiration suddenly strikes Gaz, who figures if a bunch of \\"puffers\\" like the Chippendales can cause such a stir, why not some local talent?  Like himself, Dave, and whoever else he can get to jump on the bandwagon with him.  The kicker is, Gaz knows that they're going to have to go the Chippendales one up; and that means going \\"The Full Monty.\\"  If they're going to pack `em in, they're going to have to go all the way...<br />Peter Cattaneo is to be commended for handling so sensitive a subject and the accompanying issues with such warmth and humor.  Let's face it, a story about a bunch of guys who resort to \\"stripping\\" in order to survive could have gone in an entirely different direction.  But thanks to the insights of Cattaneo and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, the result is a film that reaches out and touches the humanity in us all.  The characters are all richly drawn and delivered by Cattaneo through his actors with great care.  These are very real people with whom anyone past the age of majority will be able to identify, in one way or another.  And that's what really sells the film.  Cattaneo keeps it all very real and down-to-earth, sets an effective pace and backs it all up with a terrific soundtrack of contemporary music.  Who will be able to come away from this film NOT at least humming Hot Chocolate's \\"You Sexy Thing,\\" or thinking about the scene in which \\"Horse\\" (Paul Barber) \\"auditions\\" to Wilson Pickett's \\"Land of 1000 Dances?\\"  Or when the guys, after having rehearsed for awhile, are on line at the employment office when Donna Summer's \\"Hot Stuff\\" comes on and they can't keep still.  Cattaneo takes a positive approach to negative issues, wraps it all up in humility, humanity and hard work, and in doing so he gives his audience a film that is highly entertaining, emotionally involving and unforgettable.<br />Heading up the ensemble cast, Robert Carlyle is right on with his portrayal of Gaz.  He completely captures the blue collar, working class image and attitude that defines his character so succinctly.  And he convincingly conveys the fact that he doesn't know one \\"beat\\" from another, as evidenced bythe way he is \\"always ahead\\" of the rest, regardless of which piece of music they're dancing to.<br />Mark Addy captures the essence of who these guys are, as well, giving a memorable performance as Dave.  His is an extremely sensitive portrayal of of a man dealing with some very personal problems, which he addresses through his character quite believably.  And, in Dave's case, especially, Addy manages to elicit empathy without making him unduly sympathetic, which affords him, as well as the others and the film, the ability to maintain a semblance of dignity in the face of adversity, which is essentially one of the main tenets of the story.<br />Also turning in an effective performance is Tom Wilkinson as Gerald, the former foreman of the steel mill, now reduced to being just one of the guys, and on the dole along with the rest of them.  Wilkinson brings to light the fact that Gerald's issues are somewhat different from the rest initially, but he gradually develops his character to the extent that you finally understand that Gerald is not so different from Gaz or Dave or the others after all.  And it's Wilkinson's insightful portrayal that more than any of the others cements that sense of community which is, in the end, the great equalizer of the species.<br />The supporting cast includes Steve Huison (Lomper), Hugo Speer (Guy), Emily Woof (Mandy), Deirdre Costello (Linda), Paul Butterworth (Barry), Dave Hill (Alan) and Bruce Jones (Reg).  In reality, losing one's means of survival can be a devastating experience.  And what Cattaneo has done with \\"The Full Monty\\" is establish a sense of hope for those who may find themselves one day in the \\"outbox\\" of life, and he's done it with style, class and that most necessary of all of life's ingredients, humor.  This is a film to embrace-- and to enjoy over and over again.
0790729652|3.0|Tim Burton's gothic style goes over very well with Batman. Trouble is that there's much here that doesn't work as well as Burton's off kilter visual style. Michael Keaton does a terrific job as Batman. He brings both an edginess and comic element to the role. The contradictorary elements in his portrayal highlights the very contradictorary character of Bruce Wayne/Batman.<br />Jack Nicholson's Joker fills up this movie in a way that later villians couldn't. His over the top performance fits perfectly within the Batman universe and, again, provides balance to Keaton's performance as Batman. The other performances are fine as well although the great Michael Gough is virtually wasted in the role of Alfred.<br />There are quite a few flaws. Trying to &quot;sell&quot; Batman with the inclusion of Prince's songs just doesn't work. Prince's music, despite his talent, doesn't belong in this film. In fact, there shouldn't be any pop music at all. The script is riddled with plot holes large enough to drive the Batmobile through. It's clear that the script passed through many hands and last minute rewrites. My theory is that Jon Peters probably had a heck of a lot to do with the changes. Burton's inability as a director to tell a straight forward narrative has come to light with more recent films. His style always seems to triumph over content. The best Burtom films begin with a solid well written script with few major changes. Batman isn't one of them.<br />Still, there is quite a bit to be said for getting the gothic mood right. Burton manages to see Batman closer to Bob Kane's vision vs. Hollywood's. Still, this was a missed opportunity. If Keaton's character hadn't been underwritten (some would call this keeping the character &quot;mysterious&quot;) and the script well structured this would be a 5 star classic. Batman Return is a much darker but ultimately sharper film (and still remains the best in the series to date).<br />The DVD is a crisp, sharp transfer and looks pretty good. It looks a bit too dark for my taste (compared to both the laserdisc and the original theatrical film). The soundtrack has been effectively mixed for 5.1 dolby is a marked improvement over the earlier transfer on DVD. A pity there aren't any extras thrown in. I'd love to see the screen tests for Batman, rehearsal footage or outtakes. Additionally, commentary from director Burton, Nicholson and Keaton would make this DVD much more interesting.<br />Here's hoping that someday Hollywood gets it right.etty good.

B000002UAU|5.0|First of all the Beatles are my favorite band.  I love just about all of the songs and cd's but this one is my favorite.  I hope you will enjoy this cd as much as I did.
0790730960|4.0|Burton managed to get Batman right the second time. The script is sharper, full of satrical elements and the view of crime ridden Gotham bleaker than before. Batman appears as ruthless as before although there is a better sense of a human being under the mask. Batman's still one of the walking wounded but he does have a sense of humor.<br />Burton had full control here and a solid script to begin with. Although Christopher Walken is wasted in his role as Schrek, the rest of the cast gives interesting, varied performances. The action sequences are among the best Burton has ever directed.<br />The DVD transfer is sharper than the original Batman and the sound top notch. Batman Returns does lack the extas one expects now. Given the deluxe treatment given to Superman: The Movie, I'd expect the same here. Unfortunately, this is a pretty bare bones DVD. Audio commentary and background footage (as well as script excerpts) would have been welcome and made this a more compelling buy.
B00000IO4J|5.0|Yes, it's \\"another pod-people, puppet-master, monster-takes-over-the-town movie\\", but it's leading stars are excellent in their roles, and it's infused with humor and some real startling moments which make the whole thing fun to watch. It's not for tots: there is a lot of violence in first fifteen minutes of the film, and the kids \\"test\\" one another (to make sure they're not aliens) by snorting home-made powder.  But it's all done with tongue-in-cheek. I was especially pleased with the performance of Elijah Wood as the school \\"target\\", Casey, who spends the first half of the movie getting beat up, and the second half of the movie kicking alien butt.  \\"Casey, when did you become Sigourney Weaver,\\" one of his classmates asks... Hah!  It's fun.
B000059XYK|5.0|OKay, so this isn't the greatest movie ever made, but I gave it my 5 stars because I had SO MUCH FUN WATCHING IT! ...Totally worth it, in my opinion, because I love cars, Angelina Jolie and there are lots of little moments in the movie that were goofy and fun. (ie, \\"TV Trivia\\", \\"Boosting cars or having sex?\\" and Donnie trying to teach a little Asian woman to drive - I can laugh about that one especially since I am Asian myself :p)<br />Plenty of memorable characters and a killer soundtrack, too. So if you're looking for a rush of mindless humor and displays of loyalty between friends and family, take an hour & a half out of your day and watch this...
020530902X|5.0|This little book is a must have for writers at all levels. It is especially good for those moments when you read through your own work and feel that what you wrote does not sufficiently express what it is you really wanted to say.

Totally worth it, in my opinion, because I love cars, Angelina Jolie and there are lots of little moments in the movie that were goofy and fun.

B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem's the \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\" is a very good peice of art that has fortunately got the attention it deserved. [If] Eminem's first album \\"Slim Shady LP\\" was a dark record[,] ... this record is an even darker album ... which makes it even more appealing to buy ...  \\"Stan\\" a twisted tale of worship and hatred as Em raps as Stan, an obsessed fan over Dido's single \\"Thank You\\". Stan repeatedly sending letters to Em never gets a letter back, so, he drinks till he can't see, throws his pregnant wife in the trunk of his car and drives off the side of a bridge, oddly enough, Em writes him back two weeks later. After the shock of \\"Stan\\" wears off, you'll get a taste of regular Em on \\"Who Knew\\", where he as usual spits disses to everyone alive (and dead) over a corky beat. Next is another diss spitting track, but this time it's a heavy and dark beat over which Em spits on \\"The Way I Am\\". Trying to sugarcoat himself a little bit, Em brings out a part two of \\"My Name Is\\" on the infectious little pop anthem \\"The Real Slim Shady\\". Following up this the regular Em formula on tracks like \\"Remember Me\\", \\"I'm Back\\", and \\"Marshall Mathers\\", but then, a very disgusting skit completely dissing Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J of I.C.P (Insane Clown Posse) on \\"Ken Kaniff\\". Following up this the poppy \\"Drug Ballad\\", the darker and more gangsta rap feel of \\"Amityville\\" and the occasional diss collabo with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg ... ... Following this up are two more Em diss songs, including the ending track \\"Criminal\\".<br />I am very glad people are finally realizing Em is a great artist and should be rewarded for such good material. I hope after reading this review, you will go take a very good listen to this album and realize how good it is, and if you don't have it, you will buy it.
B0000687L5|5.0|I knew nothing about this movie when I rented it, but I was drawn to because of Tim Roth.  I know I will see this movie again. A beautiful fable, beautifully shot, perfect casting, and a mesmerizing plot. I get a lump in my throat thinking about it.
B00005QCYD|4.0|Jurassic Park III is basically about a set of parents who are split up and they let their son go on a trip with a couple of their friends. Their son never returns nor do his escorts. The island the boy and his chaperones were moving around was off-limits, a law by the government because it has said to have exotic, and very dangerous creatures living on it. Most citizens assume they are dinosaurs because of the widely know adventures of Dr. Alan Grant on another series of islands. And so do the parents now. So, the parents call Dr. Grant and ask him to give them a tour of the islands, never mentioning their son and his disappearance. They say they are very rich, still a married couple and give him a fake check for $1,000,000. He reluctanly agrees, and they fly to the ring of islands. The parents order the plane down (so they can look for their son) but Dr. Grant knows their are dinosaurs on this island so he tells them they better not. To their luck the plane crashes instead because they were flying to low and they are now strandes on a dinosaur filled island. All the find is one of the chaperones tied up his parachute, dead, and rotting due to 8 weeks of being stuck in a net hung from a tree, and their son no where to be seen. Now they need to avoid raptors, T-rex's, many more, plus, a new species they never knew existed. One more problem, the raptors are smarter than they thought.
0446608955|5.0|I purchased &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; for my self by myself the day before the movie started playing. I couldn't wait till it was out on DVD.<br />I love the way Sparks wrote it so much that I read each chapter twice, before moving to the next. Sparks' writing already touched me when I read the prologue the first time. I couldn't help but do, as his words there said: \\"This is my story; I promise to leave nothing out. First you will smile, and then you will cry don't say you haven't been warned.\\"<br />Landon and Jamie are so loveable only because Sparks created them. I could totally identify with them, especially Landon as the narrator. As the story goes on, I stop reading its not even 300 pages, and I've read more than half in a few hours. I want it to last longer. Then I read a chapter every week, just not to end as soon as it could.<br />Jamie was the girl I wish I could be, the perfect friend. And Landon the perfect boyfriend, he's so romantic, he did anything for Jamie. They lived so much love, like in a lifetime. Everyone was in love with everyone, them with each other, and I with them. It's really sad it's all a fantasy. Espeacially for me since I am too much of a dreamer. Like everything in life it was good while it lasted. True love never dies.<br />Read it, love it. It will take you where you've never been.
0871137380|3.0|A very interesting book in the sense that it allows the reader to experience a small taste of modern day warfare in a developing country.  With most future military conflicts involving U.S. soldiers probably taking place in developing or third world countries, I feel this book is a great asset in overcoming the ignorance people have about war in general, and more specifically about the social and political situations that a large percentage of the world's population struggles to survive in.  This glory, and gory account shows the brutality of urban warfare, the reactions of people who have nothing to lose, and most importantly the often forgotten and mis-represented horror and futility of war.<BR>  <BR>I don't usually give much attention to introductions or afterwords in a book, but the author's description of his research methods, reasons for writing the book in the first place, and general accounting of his experiences is wonderful. If you read this book, read it from cover to cover!<br />My only criticism would be that this book in a peculiar way glosses over modern day warfare. In a battle where essentially less than 20 U.S. soldiers die, in a period of less than 48 hours, I felt giving this story eternal life in the pages of a book may not necessarily have been required.  You could go to your local VFW or Elks club, and talk to veterans of america's previous wars who experienced a \\"black hawk down\\" scenario several times a week, during WWII, Vietnam, or Korea.  The ideals and outcome of this story, have already found life in the pages of many excellent books thousands of times over. But, perhaps it is necessary to repeat the lessons learned so many times throughout human history, in order that we don't repeat them. An interesting quote from the book:<BR>\\"War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade for the ultimate practitioner\\".  Cormac McCarthy

B00004TJKI|5.0|One of the best courtroom mysteries ever. James Stewart is the perfect actor for any mystery movie. Whether he's acting for Alfred Hitchcock or in this case Otto Preminger.
B00001NFCY|2.0|I can't give this one star because it's not awful--it's just not any good. It doesn't actively hurt my ears; there are melodies, and Scott Stapp's voice is decent (though I don't think he sounds that much like Eddie Vedder). But it all sounds like they've taken all the rock/metal of the past 15 years, digested it, and turned out this bland combination that manages to sound evocative of all of it without having any distinctive style of its own. And worse, it's all the same. Some's a bit faster, some's a bit slower (though it tends towards more towards the latter), but there's very little variation in style. And &quot;Higher&quot; always reminds me of that cheesy power ballad &quot;High Enough.&quot; It's bad enough ripping off Pearl Jam, but they should be ashamed of ripping THAT off! <br />I've heard worse lyrics, but I've heard much better ones, and I'm not a big fan of all the Christian imagery. <br />All in all, it's nothing that's worthy of sheer hatred à la Celine Dion, but nothing that's worth your money or enthusiasm either.

0316666343|4.0|Because of the current epidemic of teenage-girl kidnappings, I read this book.  Ms. Sebold's novel presents many interesting concepts: the breakdown of relationships in the face of tragedy, suburban fear of \\"the sociopath next-door\\" as well as the hopeful possibility of life after death, even if you don't believe in God (as he/she is not mentioned in heaven).  I liked the book particularly for her imagery--after I read the book, I couldn't stop thinking about her descriptions of how a soul passes from here to there--it's comforting.

B00005QGAT|5.0|THEN THIS IS IT!!! Off The Wall, what more can be said about this album that hasn't been said in one form or another by the other reviewers already??? This showed the Michael Jackson that people WANTED to remember as one of the greatest living performers of our time, before years of tabloid garbage and self-mutilation began taking their toll on him. His collaborative efforts with producer Quincy Jones really paid off both commercially and artistically for him. Songs like Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, Rock With You, and She's Out Of My Life are classic in every sense of the word. The rest of the album still maitains a quality and freshness which I truly believe Michael has never equaled since (though Thriller comes pretty darn close). Not only did Off The Wall contain some of the finest session musicians in R&B at the time, but the amount of energy and enthusiasm that Michael brought to the album is something that to this very day continues to lack in his current work.<br />There is a reason why many consider Off The Wall to be Michael's finest hour and that is simply because it's one of those rare instances where the music really moves people, whether it be on the dance floor or in everyday life. In my honest opinion, this is the only Michael Jackson album you'll ever need, PERIOD.<br />p.s. Get the expanded version for improved sound and revelatory bonus tracks.
B00005JKG7|2.0|...the Thing (***), the Fog (**), Ghosts on Mars (-*)Vampires (-**) seem to try and recapture the magic of Halloween, like the score in the Fog really tries to be Halloween but falls apart from its unoriginality. ... The mood and sets of this movie are actually really pretty good. The set-up is great, the first hour is very nice, but the movie quickly devolves into a real witless piece of revenge. (Um, why do the zombies come back 100 years later? How do they know it's 100 years later? Do they have calanders? Why even take revenge on the town NOW? They didn't do anything to you zombie folk.)<br />I just have to ask, why do drowned zombies KNOCK on the door trying to get in? The first time I saw this, I was like, OK, that has to be someone else leading us to believe it is one of the villians... but sure enough, the zombies knock on the door trying to get in! How polite!<br />The transfer, sound and extras on this are really great and add quite a bit of value to this movie... however you must like the movie first for it to matter... John Carpenter says during the commentary that Hal Holbrook didn't like the movie when it was finished. I have to second that. I like elements of it, but the movie as a whole doesn't measure up to his previous works, I mean work, Halloween.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This CD is an excellent follow up to their last release, The Soft Bulletin.  There is something magical about this album.  It has the ability to spark activity in your imagination long after you've drifted into sleep.  I think the best part about this album is that each song does a good job of leading to the next one despite the differences between them - for example, there is a huge contrast between the screams on Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. 2 and the vocal performance on In the Morning of the Magicians.  Although the lyrics speak about topics such as trying to understand your place in the world, loss, and unrequited love, the music speaks with a triumphant and optimistic tone.  If you don't have this album already, you should consider buying it.  It would be a good investment.  This is the type of music that can break your heart and make you glad to be alive at the same time.
B000069AUI|5.0|Simply put, this is an excellent album from an outstanding band.  &quot;In my place&quot; &quot;Clocks&quot; &quot;The scientist&quot; and &quot;Politiks&quot; are all standouts.  Coldplay comes out with a louder and more upbeat sound on this album that is even better than &quot;Parachutes.&quot;  &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; should prove to everybody that this band is the real thing and will continue making great music for years to come.
B000068MFS|5.0|This movie was wonderful! The characters were played perfectly by John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale.  I saw and immediately liked it.  The characters made the movie so real, it was unbelievable!<BR>I give it an A+! Don't hesitate to see this movie! Go out and see it ASAP!
B00006GFAB|3.0|I didn't give this album a three star review because of the songs.  Let's face it, KISS is a great band and these songs are terrific.  The problem with the album is that KISS has already released greatest hits collections and even a box set before.  The only reason to release this album is to make more money for the band and record company.<br />The other problems include song selection and cover.  Seventeen of the twenty-one tracks come from the 70's leaving little room for later material.  KISS made some great songs during the 80's and 90's that are as good as many of their hits from the 70's, but they don't pay much attention to these songs.  The problem with the cover is that it only shows the four original members of the band.  In fact, no where in the cd booklet do they mention other band members.  It's like they never existed.<br />Bottom line:  Don't buy this album if you already have any of their many other greatest hits collections.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is a masterpiece, from top to bottom. Much better than Parachutes...
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold weaves a masterful mystery in a profoundly simple way.

0316666343|2.0|Chalk it up to to having read too many stellar reviews or having spent the summer talking myself into reading a book about a child raped and murdered, but now that I am finished, I admit, I am disappointed.<br />In some eerie ways, the best of the book rests in its first few chapters. These are lucid, and raw and painfully descriptive--the murder, the early mourning, the landscape...<br /> As time moves on, however, the book devolves into an odd light touch.  Susie lilts from place to place, person to person, commenting on their behaviors and actions. While you sense her longing to be back there in the thick of it, as a reader, you're not so certain you want to be there. <br />Sometimes, you feel angst and sympathy, even empathy for the characters, but everyone is so lightly painted. It is hard to grasp on to something worth caring about for more than a moment or two. ...
B00005UKE0|5.0|I had forgotten what a great record this is.  In fact, I never really knew it before.  Most of the time when I listen again to albums that I remember as great and important in my life but that I haven't heard it awhile, I'm faintly disappointed.  Sometimes by the music, sometimes by the promised new clarity of re-mastered CD versions that turn out to not to add very much, which even sometimes detract from the sound I remember.  At best-as with Beatles records I know well-I'm reconfirmed in my admiration and experience again the old thrill, but with the addition of many memories and associations.<br /> \\"All Things Must Pass\\" happened to come out at roughly the same time as a number of other great records-not only new directions for the 1960s greats like John Lennon and the Stones, but the first recordings of some new artists who would dominate the 1970s and have long careers, like David Bowie.  The first two albums by John and Paul got the most ex-Beatles attention (especially since they were sniping at each other on the records as well as in press), and even Ringo surprised everyone with a couple of solid solo records. <br /> George Harrison, the \\"quiet Beatle\\", the mystical one, had been writing superior songs for several years, though at best he could get 2 or 3 on a Beatles album.  He was hitting his peak on the last album the Beatles made, \\"Abbey Road,\\" and had the two biggest radio hits from it, \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" both as classic as anything Lennon or McCartney wrote.  <BR> \\"All Things Must Pass\\" was his three-disk LP coming out party as a solo artist, although he gathered a large array of distinguished musicians to be part of it, notably Eric Clapton and members of the Delaney and Bonnie band that had just broken up, and some writing collaborations with Bob Dylan (they would reunite many years later as part of the Traveling Willburys.)  The sound was horn-rich, which frankly didn't come over all that well on the LP.  The CD remaster does improve the sonics for a change.  <BR> But the real wonder is the songwriting and the singing.  Some of these are absolutely first rate songs:  \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" (a Harrison/Dylan composition), \\"Isn't It a Pity,\\" \\"Beware of Darkness,\\" and my current favorite that I didn't notice the first time around so to me it is like a new song: \\"Run of the Mill.\\"  Even the lighter, breezier material, like \\"What Is Life,\\" \\"Wah Wah\\" and the Dylan tune, \\"If Not For You\\" is much better than I remember. <BR> <BR> Then there's \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" which is possibly most famous for the copyright infringement suit that Harrison lost, for the song's resemblance to \\"She's So Fine.\\"  Now, some 30 years later, \\"She's So Fine\\" is a nice oldie, a good song, but \\"My Sweet Lord\\" is a great song, a great production, a classic.  Apart from the religious references, purely as music it lifts the heart.  (This CD includes a re-recording that apparently tries to omit references to the other song, though I don't quite get it-it's just Harrison singing in a higher register than usual, searching for a melody.  It's nowhere near the quality of the original.)<br /> There's stuff on this CD I skip over, though I'm glad I have it because maybe it will speak to me some other time.  I've learned my lesson-it's worth going back to greatness to rediscover the music of this moment.<br /> This CD is a great deal.  Now I hope that a true \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation from Harrison's later solo records will be issued someday.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is definitely a book worth purchasing.  I first read the excerpt here on amazon.com and then couldn't wait to get my own copy.  The story is heartbreaking, hopeful, funny, and sad all at once.  The characters are extremely believable and easy to relate to.  Once I picked it up, it was extremely hard to put it down.  Even after finishing the novel, the characters stayed with me.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let me preface this review with the fact that my CD library consists of endless metal and hard rock CDs and that my purchase of &quot;Let Go&quot; is way out of character.  I begin with this because despite my attraction to hard, guitar driven, often times loudly screaming artists, this CD by this young girl from Canada is very appealing.<br />After a lot of contemplation I finally bought this CD, and I have to admit that I enjoy it.  The only initial attraction was the attitude of Avril herself - &quot;skater,&quot; &quot;I don't give a damn,&quot; etc.  But after listening to the album, I found that her very deeply personal writing style was great.  Her poetic lyrics and soothing voice invite singing along, and while I'd say the musicianship of the group is clearly that of a bunch of teenagers, the songs are nonetheless very well put together.<br />The single &quot;Complicated&quot; represents the album well, some songs being more challenging personally and some being more uplifting.  It is also the midpoint of the depth of the music, some other songs being very much more involved and some being much more shallow emotionally.  There are a number of songs that are much heavier as far as plain guitar jamming is concerned, while others are ballads featuring only acoustic background guitar.  All in all the album offers a good amount of non-repetitive pop music from a young woman's heart that appeals to both me and the 12 year old girl alike.  Call me crazy.

But, luckily, She is the only less-than-average character in Martin's series.<BR>So, in conclusion, this book is highly recommended to anyone over fourteen (I don't think that kids should read about brother-sister incest, or a man with a six foot long ...). This book will keep everyone guessing, but, be warned: nothing will prepare you for what will happen on the last page. (Don't look ahead!)<BR>And now I become another of the many people who cannot wait for \\"A Feast for Crows\\" BR>Thank you for reading my review, <BR>blaake.
B000069CWE|5.0|&quot;Hybrid Theory,&quot; regardless of its mass popularity and overextended radio time, is still one of my favorite albums.  When this &quot;remix&quot; of that album was announced as an upcoming release I was spectacle as I think many were.  I figured they were milking the success of that album to no end, and while that may be true still, I have come around to believe that this album truly took a good amount of effort, thought, and style to create.<br />Yes, it is basically a CD full of remixes, but what that does not mean is that it isn't worth listening to.  What I will say, though, is that this album exhibits the group's love of techno and hip-hop simply because the &quot;reanimators&quot; as they put it are all hip-hop or techno DJs.  As a result all the songs that were definitely metal with a taste of hip-hop or techno from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; are now on &quot;Reanimation&quot; as definitely hip-hop or techno with a taste of metal.  It truly is Linkin Park in the eyes of the hip-hop industry, and this blend is a refreshing combination of my two favorite types of music that basically make up the polar opposite ends of the pop culture spectrum.<br />Basically, if you loved Hybrid Theory then there is no reason you should not love this album also; it just might open your eyes to the hip-hop world if you have little familiarity with it.  Also, if you are a fan of any metal whatsoever and you also seem attracted to the likes of any of the &quot;reanimators&quot; listed on the album, then there is no reason you shouldn't love this album.  I think this album marks an amazing blend of the metal world with the hip-hop world, and if it becomes amazingly popular it will demonstrate what can happen when worlds collide.
0380820846|5.0|A worthy continuation of the Bridgerton series. Offer left me rather cold, with its obvious Cinderella story, but Romancing has the gentle wit I rely on Julia Quinn to provide.
B000000993|5.0|Tool's &quot;Undertow&quot; is something that I believe any rock lover can appreciate.  The combination of true professional work on all levels of music is something that is hard to ignore, and you can see by Tool's enormous and almost cult-like fan base that these skills are not overlooked.<br />Tool's &quot;Undertow&quot; set the standard in pop culture with the single &quot;Sober&quot; that drives slow and steady from start to finish; it is a masterpiece representing hard rock of the early nineties.  The rest of the album is quite similar.  Each song features the bass-driven group delving into topics that are, for the most part, very deeply rooted in society.  Controversial attitudes towards topics such as religion put this group among one of the most intelligent sounding groups of all time.  But it is not these attitudes that make Tool a great rock band; it is instead the way that the group writes music to go with these eerie lyrics.  Metaphorical (and sometimes spooky) lyrics with echo effects and clever rhymes are backed up by just as odd distortion methods on the guitar and very heavy bass lines.  All in all, it is a sound that can hit you in your head intellectually and then send a chill down your spine.<br />Finally, if you are unfamiliar with Tool then you are missing out on one of the founders of the current hard-rock wave.  Start with &quot;Undertow&quot; to explore the history of the genre and see that even today this album is one of the most easily appreciated albums.
B000000W5L|5.0|This album came out after Sticky Fingers, which was a bona fide hit, thanks, in part, to the Andy Warhol cover.  I was in high school when this came out (ouch, dating myself) the critics were not that impressed mostly because it was ragged and maybe too long (2 LPs at the time).  However, I loved it then and love it still, despite the fact that I'm a middle-aged woman now!  From the opening kick of Rocks Off to the the funk of Soul Survivor, this is a keeper.  There's a real loose feeling to this album and a sense of fun.  <BR>At this point in their careers, the Stones were starting to slip off their \\"dangerous\\" image (see Midnight Rambler, etc) and this was sort of their last gasp in that regard.  They showed they could still rock the house, create lascivious songs that weren't jokes, and remain the world's premiere rock 'n' roll band.  Substitute sexual conquest songs for politics and this is a lot like what The Clash created about 5 years later.
014028009X|4.0|This is a funny book. Pride and Prejudice in the modern, no post-modern, era. Bridget has a ton of things to worry about. Alcohol, cigarettes, food, diets, money, her job(s), the tangled affairs of her family and friends and most of all her own love-life.<br />This is a book for women, yeah, but it's also a great read for men. How the other half thinks and funny enough to make it entertaining.<br />I couldn't put it down, and I've got a ton of other books to read. I loved it.
B0000696I1|1.0|Well...I was always a fan of TMNT growing up.  So of course I had to see all 3 movies.  While myself and some of my friends argue whether this one(#3) or #2 is the 2nd best TMNT film made, its still in my opinion the worst of the 3.  By far in my opinion #1 is definatly the best.  No question asked.  This deviated from the whole storyline and really had no place.  I saw this as more of a kids movie than anything else...whereas I could get into the first two more.  I'm rating this pretty low as I think they could have done something a lot better with the third film.
B000063USY|1.0|If this movie reflects the current state of our society, it is a sad day, indeed. Aside from the offensive language and dress, there was absolutely no plot to speak of. I can't believe this movie is only rated PG-13. ...
B00005MAM2|2.0|This is by far the most overrated anime of all time not the best. The only reason everyone sweats this movie is because it has been labeled as a classic, people dont want to admit that they didnt like it because they think everyone will make fun of them. ex: You dont like Akira Oh my god thats the greatest anime of all time. Dont believe the hype its long, boring, and the plot makes absolutely no sense. I actually started falling asleep when I was watching this, yeah while I was watching the greatest anime ever, sure it is. Dont get me wrong the animation is top notch and the character designs are great, I just thought the story was poor. If you like Ghost in the Shell and Perfect Blue you will definately like this, if you like to understand the storyline when you are watching a movie then look elsewere.
B00005JKDR|5.0|this is the best movie in the world the story line is great it is a movie that the whole famliy will want to wacth again and again
B00000099Y|5.0|\\"Deep, intelligent lyrics? This ain't Sylvia Plath folks, it's not even Weezer. Tool has no more depth than the typical moaning nu metal radio band.

Obviously he doesn't care enough to go learn more about them on the web.  A critic is someone who is not good enough to do what he is criticizing someone about, and critics like Michael Ellis have nothing to say.  Be a thinking reader.
0783229526|5.0|If you want to keep your kids away from drugs this is the movie for them to see.  Its funny and interesting if you don't mind a plot that doesn't quite show up for a while.  Truly a cinimatic masterpiece.  There should be more like this.  Brutal realism makes it a movie you can't leave.
B00000AFFF|3.0|Two pop music wise guys team up for  a vehicle that should have been a tour-de-force from start to finish but which got stuck in a ditch, wheels spinning, engine roaring uselessly. There is an insistence on medium ballads or funeral march ballads, sadder-than-dead fish torch songs,and though there is merit to a good number of them, the torpor wears you out. Costello continually tries to hit the high notes at seemingly the exact same moment in each song, with his pitch being the equal of having a live magpie taped to your face. It's a horrible, piercing experience before long, and the rationale that it's a brave thing he's doing by using his limited apparatus for the lofty points on the sheet music won't cut ice.Bacharach, I recall, wrote a good number of spry up tempo songs as well, and had a sense of humor. Perhaps he felt he needed to get serious now that he was gettng some serious attention from critics because the acclaimed Costello deigned to work with him. The album is dour, gloomy, utterly depressed in the long run; it would have been best if they canned half the songs here and released only the truly memorable work. It would have been better if they remembered to bring their sense of humor to the sessions when they recorded this thing.
B00006AW2G|5.0|One of the best of all times is even better! Sound quality is fantastic, much improved over the original cd issue. I bought \\"Let It Bleed\\", the record the day it came out way back in '69. I saw the Stones perform the songs live shortly after in 1970. When the cd was released I  thought, what could be better? Well it's been too long of a wait  but this cd is just freakin' NIRVANA. Put on the song \\"Let It Bleed\\", crank it up and get your mojo working, YEAH!
B000069AUI|3.0|Not being a fan of Coldplay and not having even heard \\"Parachutes\\", minus the singles \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Trouble\\", I picked up \\"A rush of blood...\\" on the strength of the first offering, \\"In my place\\" and after quickly  previewing the album before it's release.  Comparisons to Radiohead and the lesser, Travis, are undeniable given the lilting falsetto of Chris Martin is so akin to the vocalizations of those bands.  I'm pleasantly surprised by the overall melodic content of the record although tracks such as \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Green Eyes\\" and the title track wilt under the mopey-sentimentality of Martin's delivery when not backed by a catchy hook.  Songs are memorable for so many reasons, be it a hypnotic riff or a lyric that mirrors your own fate.  Chris Martin's desperate pleas on \\"In my Place\\": \\"Please, please, please Come back and sing to me...\\" capture the intense longing of a broken soul.  The superb \\"Clocks\\" almost didn't make it onto the album, but it proves to be a standout track.  The chord changes are sublime and when Chris timidly sings \\"You are, You are\\" it is simply arresting. \\"Whisper\\" provides an interesting diversion and seems like a faultering Radiohead song.  \\"Warning Sign\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are other favourites, with the latter highlighting what Coldplay do best, graceful piano and laguishing guitar ballads; cool and  fragile.  Poppy, tempered melancholy for the mainstream.  Although lyrically often one dimensional, they are sonically more palatable and optimistic than the latest offerings from Thom Yorke and the boys, as good as those records are in their own right.  \\"A rush of blood to the head\\" is not groundbreaking, (nor does it have to be) but it will please their fans and should affirm Coldplay as a key force in the \\"Brit-pop\\" music scene.
B00006AW2J|5.0|The 1986 cd release was good for the time. 16 years later and the sound quality is truly a joy to behold. Put on &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;. Turn the volume way to the right and enjoy some of the best &quot;Rock And Roll&quot; of all time. The Stones were at the top of their game and this re-issue of &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; just couldn't be any better.
0792839749|1.0|I agree with the dozens of other viewers who have reviewed \\"CCBB\\" on DVD and commented on the \\"Pan and Scan\\" cropped TV format. Many people have gone out and spent much hard earned money on new large TV's even \\"Widescreen TV's\\" to share films like this with their families, especially their children. It seems many viewers and reviewers no less, are upset that this film had not been released in the SuperPanavision it was made in with a picture aspect ratio of at least 2:25:1. My two cents is, why can't we have \\"BOTH\\" widescreen and fullscreen formats on the same disc. It isn't expensive, I have several Warner Brothers and Columbia Tri-Star pictures with both formats on the same DVD. If they can do it and still sell the DVD for a modest price why can't MGM???? Actually, MGM has done this at least once for another title.  So MGM get to work and give us both formats of \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" on one DVD and give those people over at Twentieth Century Fox (Who released \\"The Sound of Music\\" in both formats on \\"two different\\" disks!!!) a run for their money and really show your quality and you will see deep appreciation from your customer base who really love MGM!<br />Please NOTE!! This is a review of the DVD, you have it posted, incorrectly, under the VHS tape edition. thanks, cal
B000066NW0|3.0|Despite the hardcore pretenses of Avril Lavigne, this album is so industry. Although she got co-writing credits, most of the songs sound like they were crafted by a team of &quot;9-to-5&quot; writers in Nashville. That's a good thing if you don't like anything that deviates from the contemporary hit formula. That's a bad thing if you're looking for a memorable cd with true artistic integrity.
B00006C7G9|5.0|This miniseries is,by far, the greatest war epic ever produced.It thoroughly represents the horrors of war based on first hand experiences and puts you in the middle of the action. However, contrary to what some people believe, this is not necessarily an anti-war epic. I think it says to us that war is something that should NEVER be taken lightly and in most cases should be avoided, but sometimes,regrettably, is necessary.This is one of those cases.Considering Steven Speilberg was involved in this as well as Schindlers List...I am sure he feels this way.Finally,this film also represents that the men who fought on the allied side were,in the truest sense of the word,HEROES!
B00005JKJA|5.0|'Mulholland Drive' is the kind of film that leads to seemingly endless debate and theorizing. Message boards fill up with commentary claiming genius as much as absurdity and frustration. This is actually a rather intimate film in the home viewing format, producing unique reactions and wide ranging emotions. Each viewer takes from David Lynch's masterpiece what they will, but everyone has an opinion. Why? One can not walk away from this film and simply forget about it. The human mind resists because the urgency to unveil whatever mystery lies within those hypnotic two and half hours is just too potent. 'Mulholland Drive,' unlike Lynch's 'Lost Highway' will indeed give up its most telling secrets. Those ten clues offered in the sleeve of DVD additions aren't simply a hoax. For example, as noted by Lynch, there really are two extremely important clues revealed even before the credits roll. I will not reveal them, but I will say this. One of these clues is valuable to first time viewers. The other is, for the most part, beneficial only to those who have already seen this picture. Yes, there are a few subplots that really don't contribute to the main theme, but they're incredibly interesting and entertaining nonetheless. Take for example the black comedy of that triple homicide and the exploding vacuum cleaner. This scene is obviously a loose end from the serial story Lynch had in mind for ABC, but how could he not include it?<br />The character Naomi Watts portrays is the center of this film. Her performance is nothing short of a miracle. Pay particular attention to the astonishing duplicity she serves up playing both 'Betty' and 'Diane.' Yes, that disheveled blonde in the final half hour is played by the same actress that gave 'Betty' all that excessive sweetness and charisma.<br />I won't reveal anything about the plot because, prior to experiencing this film for the first time, it's hardly necessary.<br />In addition, describing what makes this film great would take far longer than this review could possibly be.<br />Briefly, 'Mulholland Drive' offers vibrant imagery, jaw dropping performances, great lines, A. Badalamenti's incredible music, rich and exceedingly rewarding ideas, and a holistic experience that will stick with you long after all those popcorn summer blockbusters begin collecting dust at the neighborhood video store. 'Mulholland Drive' melds the dreams we aspire to attain together with the dreams we create when we sleep. It displays a sharp intuitive sense of how we internalize hope and our desires for the future. What's more, this film develops fascinating characters based on the fantasies we fall in love and the realities we wish to shun. Why mince words? 'Mulholland Drive' is brilliant cinema.longer than this review could possibly be.<BR>Briefly, 'Mulholland Drive' offers vibrant imagery, jaw dropping performances, great lines, A.

B00006AW2G|4.0|I don't (yet) have an SACD player, so I can't comment on the sonics of the SACD layer. I did however do an A/B comparison of the regular CD layer (this CD plays on any CD player) with the LP and it sounds almost as good as the LP. The CD advantage is that on songs that used to be distorted towards the &quot;middle&quot; of the LP, the quality is excellent as well. Negatives: the packaging offers nothing of value: no liner notes putting this seminal group and album in context to the music and politics of the late 1960s, no photos, and no bonus tracks, which would have shed some light on these all-too-familiar songs. a GREAT bonus would have been if they had put the very rare mono version of Let it Bleed, where Keith sings much more...ABKCO missed a golden opportunity to make these reissues trully exceptional. Unfortunate.
B000066NW0|3.0|The songs she sounds good on, she sounds really good and conversley the songs she sounds poorly on sound horrible.<BR>She needs a few more years under her belt for her songwriting to smooth out. Song by Song:<br />1. Losing Grip - driving song -avril sounds good -could have been a better song with better lyrics.<BR>2.Complicated - smooth song that appeals to the masses.<BR>3.Sk8er Boi - Trying to keep the punk image side to avril going this boring and poor song is released. Error!! <BR>4. Im With You - A boring monotone song with bad lyrics.<BR>5. Mobile - The song that should have followed up complicated. Avril shows some depth here as well as having the lyrics down. Probably the best song on the CD.<BR>6.Unwanted - Sounds ok here and there but never really takes me anywhere and by the end of the song i feel like i have a headache and need a nap.<BR>7.Tomorrow - I think this song was meant to show the depth of her voice and actually does the opposite. Well written song, unfortunatly it should have been written for someone else.<BR>8.Anything But ordinary - Probably appeal to the 11-14 yr old girl crowd, but is devoid of any muscial inspiration.<BR>9. Things Ill Never Say - Vanilla voice, Vanilla song.<BR>10.My World - Another Kiddie song. See above.<BR>11.Nobodys fool - I guess this is an attempt at a rap. poor and monotone<BR>12 To Much To Ask - She still hasnt learned how to control the momentum of her lyrics so she often falls short.<BR>13.Naked - Promising song that gives you an idea of whats possible from Avril in the future.
B00006AFUR|4.0|After having the advance CD of this album for a few months now it has made quite an impression on me. I first bought it for my fiancee knowing she likes the lead singer a bit [understatement] but it slowly krept up in my CD player now and I am currently learning to play most of the album on my guitar. I must admit I wasn't expecting so much from this group as it slightly had an outer space feeling towards it but after listening to the first 5 songs you get a different approach to the band. I do like the first song which is there first single to be released, Capricorn (A Brand new name) which I believe will be good as a first single and should credit the band a lot but I know for a fact that when they release (if they do) Oblivion as a single that will give them commercial success. I know that this will be one of the bands to watch in the near future and when they start work on new material it will be an experience to watch them evolve as time goes on.<br />I can only say that this album has caught my attention alot and not just for the teen sensation lead singer that most girlies will go for but for the music they have produced it really is an expericence to listen to. I would highly recommend this album to alot of people, I do have the advance CD but have also purchased the official release aswell with the extra CDG for the computer.
0553106635|5.0|Being one of the people who loved this book, I tried reading all the negative reviews to see what the people who didn't like it had to say. Their major problems seemed to be the length of the books, the constant killing of the 'good guys', the different angles of one's personality, and the overall down to earth -meaning violence, sex, betrayal, death- style of the book.<BR>As to its length, the man has a lot to say, he deals with many many characters, and they have a long way to go before they accomplish their goals. Daenerys for example, has a whole continent and a whole ocean to cross before she actually gets to the fighting part, so be patient. From what I've read some people didn't even understand that there are MORE books on the way, and thought that was the end. Nope.<BR>As to the killing of the characters, I was depressed too. I never expected any of it because I've never seen it happen in any of the other books I'd read. But the fact that it's new doesn't make it bad. In real life these things happen. Who said the good guy has 17623173721638217 lives? He does not. He's made of flesh and bones, and he dies just like the bad guy, and easier as a greek saying says (the bad dog never dies). That's what makes it more exciting. Eventually good will prevail(I hope), so if the good guys are dead, who will make it so? That's the problem and what makes you want to read on and on. Maybe some bad guys will turn good? Who knows. <BR>And so I come to the multiple aspects of the characters. In all the other books I've read there are bad guys and good guys. They fight, and the good guy wins. Fine. Simple. But what if you get to know the characters better and discover the good nature of the bad guys? Doesn't that exist in everyone? We all have our reasons for doing what we do and some consider us good or bad. That's the complexity of human personality. Don't blame the man for being realistic and analyzing his characters in depth. It's far better than one-sided personalities.People aren't like that. Why should you want them to be so?<BR>And finally I come to the violence and sex part. I must admit that I found myself being disgusted and sad some times while reading the book. I agree with the opinion some might have that these things happen in real world, and we read fantasy books in order to get away from that. But I guess we could just divide the fantasy books into 'fairytales' and 'non-fairytales'. It's an ADULT book, no one said otherwise. It's a matter of taste. If you like soft fantasy where everything turns out ok and no violence exists in the world, try The King of Elfland's Daughter or something like that (don't get me wrong, I liked that book too). <BR>As far as I'm concerned, I loved the perplexity of the book. The intrigues, the conspiracies, even the violence, because that's what makes you want to see the guys responsible for it being punished. <BR>I apologise for the length of the review and I hope I've been helpful.
0743455967|5.0|On Writing is concise, interesting, informative and motivational. Instead of the usual lengthy autobiography, King centers his story on the pieces of his life that affected his writing ability. Next, King offers advice on writing, gives references on where to find more tips and information and even manages to inspire. The most amazing thing about this book is that Stephen King can even make a lesson on grammar fascinating.
0140067477|3.0|After reading this 158 page book filled with old friends of my childhood; Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, Pooh and other western world friends, six times for my school required reading, I regret to inform that this story does not uphold the Taosim aspect of this book. I believe it was a good idea for Benjamin Hoff to write a novella based on A.A. Milne's childhood stories of Winnie the Pooh, but I was let down on how he explained Taoism. In his attempt to explain this teaching of China, he managed to insult many other lifestyles and ways of living. In this book I learned that people should basically meditate all day long and not live in houses, not use cars, and not partake in activities that many people of the world are involved in such as  jogging or eating at a fast food place once in a while. I was also enlightened by the fact that basically things happen to Pooh for no reason whatsoever, and also that everything proved by modern science is false and can basically be interpreted as &quot;We don't know&quot;. There were some rich teachings of Taosim in the Tao of Pooh, such as the painting of the Vinegar Testers and how that related to Bhuddism, Taoism, and Confucianism, but overall I think Benjamin Hoff should have left the book to that instead of showing how the other practices in life are inferior the Taosim. In my opinion, Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, Pooh, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Roo and Tigger are representatives of the various people in the world and their different  backgrounds and personalities, and we should all repect and learn from each other inspite of our various walks of life, instead of believing that one school of thought, Taoism, is more superior than other beliefs, which is the feeling Benjamin Hoff imposed on me when I read the Tao of Pooh. I think I'll stick to my wise and knowledgeable Uncle Alan for information on Taosim.
B000066NW0|4.0|Everyone should stop ragging at Avril.  I'm a pop music fan, but I didn't buy her album because she's &quot;punk.&quot;  Not everyone likes her because she claims to be punk.

B000059MPH|4.0|Death on the Nile takes the viewer on a genteel cruise aboard the paddle-steamer 'Karnak' as it, along with its motley collection of passengers, wends its way through the stunning scenery of historic Egypt. Unfortunately on this voyage the Nile proves to have disturbing currents, and a wealthy heiress with a propensity for making enemies is shot. Corpulent Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot is on hand, and, as the body-count rises, must tax his legendary 'little grey cells' to the limit in order to expose the assassin in their midst.<br />The charm of this film is that to most of the audience it will be foreign in both time and place. The Egyptian location provides a visual feast, with visits to the pyramids, the inscrutable sphinx, and the eerie wailing statue of Ramses II at Abu Simbel. Scenery like this makes it somewhat easier to forgive the movie its overlong running time of almost 2 ½ hours. The story (originally penned by Agatha Christie) is set in the 1930s - the golden age of detective fiction - when murder investigations were much less clinical affairs than they are today. In an era before DNA sampling, Poirot uses the narratively more interesting approach of involving suspects in conversation, and reading between the lines.<br />The cast is certainly star-studded, but unfortunately several of the characters tend towards stereotypes. However, there are some wonderful performances by several of the silver screen's grandes dames - Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, and particularly Angela Lansbury as the inebriated author of appallingly bad romance novels. <br />Although a little slow initially, various techniques (such as dead silence being used as the ultimate suspense music) keep the viewer's interest piqued right through until Christie's trademark denouement.
B000006U44|4.0|Kate Bush's 1977 debut album didn't have much of an impact on the pop charts in the U.S., but she immediately became a huge star in the U.K.  The first single, WUTHERING HEIGHTS, went to #1 for 4 weeks and is considered a classic.  It's a truly beautiful (and slightly odd) song that chronicles the pain in the romance between Heathcliff and Cathy.  Only a talent as original as Kate Bush could make a hit from such a high-minded literary source!  Strangely enough, the song was later covered by Pat Benatar, who did a nice job.<br />THE MAN WITH THE CHILD IN HIS EYES was her second UK top 10, peaking at #6 and hitting the lower regions of the US Hot 100.  It's a breath-taking ballad that is extraordinarily beautiful.  Many of the other songs on the CD are more uptempo, including THEM HEAVY PEOPLE, another highlight.  It's a shame that Kate's debut CD wasn't a bigger hit in the US, but I'm glad that she later had some success here.  Some reviewers here compare Kate to Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan, but she's truly a unique singer that cannot be compared adequately to anyone else.  If you like her later stuff, you'll probably love this CD - it really is a classic.
B00005JKJA|3.0|I love the way the movie played out with full of supense and lots of other lives seeming to connect... Love the background music and the 50's atmosphere the director made the audiance feel...Remember to pay close attention to all the things the main and minor characters are saying doing and props being closed in on closeups.  Other than that, I was a well rounded mystery.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I believe the Flaming Lip's &quot;Yoshimi battles the Pink Robots&quot; is as about significant to rock music as Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer.&quot;  This is my personal album of the year for sure.  Many believe &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; was better, and though I believe &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; was a good album, &quot;Yoshimi&quot; for me is a masterpiece.  Just a beautiful, emotional, genuis album.  Being a singer/songwriter, the Flaming Lips have given me hope and inspiration to continue on my path, and not to give up on popular music.  Things have been looking pretty dismal in the music industry.  The Flaming Lips are a ray of light.  Thanks for &quot;Yoshimi&quot; not letting those robots defeat me.
B000062TU1|5.0|This movie version of the first volume of Harry Potter.  It is a wonderful movie.  It closely, very closely follows the plot of the book.  First I will rate the movie part then the special features.<br />   Harry potter is has alot going for it.  it has an amazing storyline, and amazing special effects.  The story is about a young boy named Harry Potter.  As a baby he was dropped off at his aunt and uncles house.  He was abused, then hagrid, a wizard came and told him he was excepted to Hogwarts school of wichchraft and wizardry.  The acting is probably the best I've seen in children actors.  The chemistry between the trio is amazing.  it adds a whole lot of enjoyment.  And the special effects, they are amazing.  The best special effects I've seen in a movie.  This movie blends modern technology and a great story, to make one of the best movies of 2001.<br />  Next I will review the special features disk.<br />  The special features are great.  They include a tour of Hogwarts, puzzles and games, and a commentary.  The point of the game is to get to the end, witch has many deleted scenes.  The tour of Hogwarts is also pretty cool.  It can't go through the whole of Hogwarts, but it does go through quite a bit.  The commentary is about the making of the movie, which is quite interesting.  Basically the special features are great.  This has better special features even than Star Wars Episode 1 the Phantom Menace.  The special features are very unique, quite like the movie.<br />  Overall this is the DVD of the year, and definetly worth buying.
B000053VAF|5.0|First of all, I have to say that I'm a big Kevin Smith fan. There isn't a movie of his that I dislike. But before I knew anything about Jay and Silent Bob and the whole viewaskewniverse, I bought this movie.<br />I watched it mostly because it starred Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and had an unusual story. I am a huge fan of movies that everyone considers bizzare or out-there and this film fits perfectly.<br />I'm going to skip the story assuming you already know most of it, and get to my review:<BR>Yes this movie is full of cuss words. Yes it's bloody. But No: I don't think this is in any way &quot;anti God.&quot;<br />Kevin didn't make this to cross God out, he made it to spread the word of God...only using crude humor.<br />What really stands out about this movie, is that it knows when to seperate the comedy and the action. Plus, it makes you think and &quot;answers&quot; many questions of the Bible.<br />Great performances and lots of laughs from the famous Jay and SIlent Bob. However, I have something to say to all those &quot;squirmers&quot; out there: this movie contains many long scenes of dialogue, and may be considered boring to some viewers. But don't let that scare you away. Even if you don't know who Kevin Smith is, see this movie!
6305537798|3.0|I felt this movie was fairly okay. It involves high school teens getting ready for the prom. I liked Joseph-Gordon Levitt's part of trying to get Bianca to fall for him and she eventually did. <BR>I thought that, of course, Julia Stiles and the one who played Bianca were both very hot and attractive. Heath Ledger had his own cool part as well. Of course, it's not really that great to <BR>pay someone to go out with someone. I found it to be a descent<BR>funny romantic teen comedy.
B000003WFB|4.0|This is a different recording of one of the best known pieces by Bach.  The differences come in three varieties, first that the recoding was done in the round with the two halves of the orchestra surrounding the conductor and microphones, giving a real sense of being surrounded by the performance.  The second major difference is the speed of recording; it is much faster than the usual standards.  The third difference is that it is much more involving than the usual reproductions, the passion takes flight and you are carried along by the words and music.<br />I highly recommend that you get a copy of this to show how Operatic the ladies of Leipzig thought it when they wrote to the town council complaining of the Opera Comedy played in church on Easter....
B00005UKE0|5.0|An absolute classic, `All Things Must Pass ` was originally released in 1970, very shortly after the breakup of The Beatles. Some of the songs are fillers but there are some real gems Such as:<br /> The famous spiritual anthem, `My Sweet Lord' which was played on radio stations around the world, following George Harrison's sad passing in late 2001.<br />As well as the excellently redone 2000 version. Except the two versions should have been arranged on the CD in sequence which they have not been.<br />Then there are the wonderful 70's smash hits `What Is Life' and `If Not For You' which I incredibly remember from my childhood.<br />Also notable is the hippie type ` Let It Down ` and the very wise warning in `Beware Of Darkness'. There is the rollicking `Ballad Of Sir Frankie Crisp' and the Country and Western style ` Behind That Locked Door'.<br />There are also inspiring songs of spiritual renewal like `Awaiting On You All' and Hear Me Lord'.<br />The only part of the album which I do not enjoy are the additional tracks on CD 2 which are mainly instrumental hard rock jam session pieces.<br />`All Things Must Pass' is an essential piece of rock history and an essential part of your collection.
0345448898|3.0|...  They're good, not great, and nowhere near amazing. There, I said it. Now read the reasons.<br />I applaud Phillip Pullman on his spectacular imagination, which has created a world parallel to ours in which all people have daemons in the form of animals, the church has almost complete control over our lives, armored bears rule kingdoms in the arctic, and God himself is a lying slimeball.  ... <br />There are two major problems. One is the surprising lack of humor. I can think of one funny part in \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and about three in \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" And don't look for much in the way of wit. The second is the finale. While this could have ended on a thought provoking and mystical note, it instead has to go for a sappy cliche about how we need to do the best we can with where we are and what we have (Awwwww[...]<br />P.S. Don't read these if you are easily offended by anti church slander.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is a great CD. I have listened to it a million times over and still get that same stoke whenever I hear Chop Suey or Toxicity. Serj graces the CD with his frantic and extremely talented style of singing. Chop Suey is one of the most vicious songs on the CD and has the most unbelievable ending. Daron and Serj's voices have a great harmony and is set up to be quite possibly the strongest most powerful song. The stop and go style is great. Toxicity is more melodic then Chop Suey with a cool guitar part and the song is broken into two parts so you won't get bored. This seems to be a theme in all songs. There is no song on this CD that is the same all the way through. Every song gets changed up for the second half, so each song is totally unpredictable. You won't get bored. This CD ranges from poetic songs like Phsyco and super heavy songs like Shimmy. Its got everything a rock fanatic wants. Its superior to most every other album out there. Buy it. You'll love it.
B000002BUY|4.0|This could be the best Incubus CD. After Make Yourself and Morning View, they really put out an original CD. This CD ranges from fast rock (New Skin) to some good almost techno/rock music (Idiot Box) and pure rock hits (A certain Shade of Green). My Favorite Things is a really cool and fast song with lots of energy. Its almost techno, but goes into rock for the chorus and bridge. New Skin is the best song on the CD. Its got a cool drum part in the background and it fast, powerful, and changes itself up a few ties during the song, like the \\"Until the 20th, century, reality was everything humans could touch...\\" part that is kinda random but fits well with the song. .. Its a funny and impressive track that you could hear no where else but this CD. You'll mlike this CD. If you need a change from Incubuses normal self, get this CD.
B000069AUI|5.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed Coldplay's first effort with Parachutes, it was with anticipation that I awaited their second release, A Rush of Blood to the Head.  And I was not let down.  With this CD, Coldplay has matured just as Radiohead did during their transition from Pablo Honey to the magnificent The Bends.  The words, the beautiful melodies, and Chris Martins soaring vocals, mixed with impeccable, albeit restrained guitars and drums and piano all contribute to make this one of the very best albums of the new millenium.  I mean, it just knocks your socks off.  <br />A Rush of Blood to the Head is somewhat more experimental and more hard rock than Parachutes.  Every, and I mean every song on this CD just gets better and better the more you listen to them.  There are no fillers.  From the first song, Politik, through to the last one, Amsterdam, there is not one that I would skip.  Each one is different yet showcases the enormous talent of Colplay.   And to top it all off, the studio recording is top notch.  I would be hard pressed to name my favorites, because they are all that good. Politik starts the album with a bang, with hard guitars and Chris Martin's wonderful vocals.  Then the album flows from song to song, with anthems, slow languid piano riffs and romantic singalongs. And what a finish with the breathtaking last song, Amsterdam.<br />All I can say is, get this album, you wont regret it for a second.  You will, only wonder what they can do for an encore to live up to this major accomplishment.  Radiohead did it with OK Computer and I get the feeling Coldplay will too.  In the meantime, enjoy and may Coldplay Put a Smile Upon Your Face ;-).
B000067DNC|5.0|A great show, with excellent special effects, surprising plot twists and some really good writing and acting. Sometimes the direction leaves something to be desired, with some integral dialog and/or scenes that would illuminate the plot or the action being ignored or thrown away, but the show keeps your interest and it's about time the second season was released. I watch my taped episodes over and over again, and I can't wait for Season 3 in January! The show is in its sixth season on The Sci Fi Channel, and one can only hope season seven is on the way!
0783229526|5.0|Fear and Loathing is a phenomenal statement of American society and an outstanding glimpse of the early 70's, when \\"the acid wave reached it's high water mark\\".  More so, Gilliam's masterful cinematic rendition of the book retained Thomson's unique intent.<BR>     Hunter S. Thomson wrote about life and his perspective of America.  Fear and Loathing is indeed a drug-induced romp through Las Vegas, but its underlying theme is much more.  Hunter S. didn't write this story to shock a few readers with the unfathomable antics of two seriously committed addicts, he wrote it as a slightly askew perspective of the United States.<BR>    Thomson (Depp), using his pseudonym of Raul Duke, sets out on an adventure with his mentally unstable \\"Lawyer\\" (del Torro) to search for the American Dream.  Funded by a sports magazine to cover a motorcycle rally near Las Vegas, the unlikely pair abandons every law, rule, and regulation our country has set to keep the general populous safe.  Swinging from drug to drug in a hazy binge that rivals any other, Hunter attempts to find the pulse of society and see if it's still alive.  His conclusion is that... you'll see.<BR>     Over all, Fear and Loathing accurately captures the extravagant mayhem that a pair can cause in short period of time, all without harming anyone except an unfortunate mental-case (Riche) and the Insurance industry.  <BR>     This movie is the extreme drug culture pushed to the limit, but it also reflects the absolute freedom a man can have, if he seriously commits himself to it.  <BR>     If you want a detailed movie that takes you on an intellectual journey, this is not it.  If you want to understand Thomson's idealized concept of himself and of the personal liberty we have, then look through the glorified drug use and self-destructive behavior and see what this story was meant to be.  (one part of ) The American Dream.
B0000042H4|5.0|This Ring set has always been the standard by which all other Rings are judged, and rightfully so. Solti's set boasts the greatest overall combination of cast, orchestra, and conducting. This recording has defined Wagnerian performance since its creation, and it is undoubtedly the definitive recording of Wagner's masterpiece.<BR>       These daunting scores are among the most difficult in all of opera to analyze, interpret, and perform, and Solti's performance is very strong. His rather slow, punchy approach has been criticized by many, but I found it to be very appropriate. Solti brings great lyricism when required, but also tremendous power and volume. Both most be equally convincing, and Solti does just that.<BR>      The Vienna Phil is undoubtedly one of the top orchestras in the world, and it shows on this recording. The cleanliness and full sound of this magnificent ensemble are unmatched in any other Ring (the Berlin Phil comes close, but Karajan's chamber-like approach lacks the full sound that I loved in this set).<BR>      Nilsson's huge, steely voice projects like none other, and she brings life and intensity to the role of Brnnhilde. She lacks the warmth of Flagstad, but is more intense and has better high notes. Windgassen, a little light-voiced for my heldentenor tastes, is a very strong, youthful Siegfried, though he was in fresher voice on the 1953 Krauss set. George London's Rheingold Wotan is very lively and beautifully sung. Hans Hotter, the greatest bass-baritone of the time, was in his later days and not in his freshest voice, but his interpretation of Wotan in Walkre and Siegfried is unimaginably powerful. I think this is his finest performance as Wotan, despite fresher-voiced accounts elsewhere. Neidlinger's Alberich is the greatest interpretation of the role by some margin. He is absolutely frightening.<BR>       The smaller roles are equally well taken. King and Crespin shine as the Volsung twins, as does Bhme as Fafner. Gottlob Frick isHunding and Hagen, and I must say that I've heard better performances of these but they are still strong. Fricka is split between two legendary singers: Kirsten Flagstad and Christa Ludwig. Flagstad had seen better days but does rather well considering her age, and Ludwig absolutely shines. Gerhard Stolze's Mime in Siegfried is somewhat over-characterized, but he is very much true to the spirit of the role. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau is an unusual choice for most Wagner roles, but his Gunther is intelligently portrayed and well sung. Claire Watson sings beautifully as Gutrune.<BR>        No Ring recording is perfect, and this one is no exception. However, no one can deny the great power of this performance, and the amazing cast, orchestra, and conducting it contains. I encourage Wagner enthusiasts to explore other recordings, of which there are many good ones. However, if you want only one copy of the complete Ring, look no further. This is the best one out there.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Shakira's songs are pretty catchy and have good sounds, but i have to say her song writing is pretty [weak]. \\"to buy more thongs, to write more happy songs\\" it doesn't get much more [weak] than that. But pretty good for her first cross-over album
B00003CXXP|3.0|Basically, Spielberg is not the man and hasn't been for quite a while. Go back to doing E.T. like things. Or, go back to doing Jurassic Park or Jaws like things. This movie has part of those lineages, but also contains the overly melodramatic lineage of movies like Saving Private Ryan. Ugh. Stay with one line/vision for the film. By far, the best line throughout the movie is the Stanley Kubrik line. If you stop the movie when it comes to it's logical, yet depressing, ending, it's a good movie (deserving 4 stars).<br />Haley Joel Osment is amazing. I think he might actually be a robot (or uebermarionette). No kid of his age should be able to act that well.

B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush Of Blood To The Head is absolutly beautiful. Chris Martin reveals his emotions with lyrics that are just awsome . Begining with an interesting song called Politk where his key words &quot;Open Your Eyes &quot; creates such a powerful message. Also, the number one single In My Place is a song thats filled with soul and hits you deep inside making us all think of our own situation. Though the entire cd is strong the best song in my opinion is A Rush Of Blood To The Head. Where Chris songs&quot;Im going to buy a gun and fight a war, if you can tell us why we are fighting for .&quot; Coldplay just deliverin two albums are becoming one of the greatest bands in the world and with this new album. Chris Martin delivers lyrics so outstanding that he makes the beatles look bad. This is easily album of the year in my mind. So go pick it up as soon as you can . Let Coldplay take control of your pain and ease your heart. Thank you Coldplay.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has managed the impossible, their sophomore effort is just as good, if not better than their first album.  Every single song on this album is spectacular.  My personal favorites are &quot;Clocks&quot; and the title track.  I hope Coldplay is around for a long time and continue to make great music.  At the rate they are in, that doesn't seem to be a problem.  Well done guys.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is an excellent example of how Hollywood loves to re-write history. I found this movie so inacurate that it was made painfully unbearable. This movie only tells the angry American post-Pearl view of the attack, and ignores and re-writes most of the facts about the attack. The movie has people getting messages they never received, planes getting shot down that never got shot down, and people dying and coming back from the dead more than they do in comic books. The attack scene was horribly inacurate, and seems to have only been shot so the film makers could throw in some big explosions. The movie makes the Japanese seem like the worst villians to ever exist, and completely ingnores their side of the story. The only things that the film makers got right was the date, and that the Japanese attacked a place called Pearl Harbor. If you like bad fiction you might like this movie, but if you want to see what really happened and see a good movie watch Tora, Tora, Tora!
B00005U18E|3.0|I'm sorry.  I really am.  I wanted to love this movie.  Couldn't wait to see it.  I love Colin Firth, and thought the rest of the cast was great.  I understand that they couldn't fit everything in the book into two hours (or less) on the screen.  I even liked that they changed the plot a little so that I didn't know about everything that was going to happen.  But...one of the things I loved about Bridget Jone's Diary (the novel) was her friends, especially Tom.  In the movie, they were so watered down!  And I hated that Bridget was so...inept, so wishy~washy.  I also hated that they made her look so sloppy.  Just because she was a little overweight (actually, she looked pretty normal to me) didn't mean that all her clothes had to ride up on her or that she didn't know how to brush her hair.  I could go on, but it would get boring.  It was a cute movie, but I just think more justice could have been done to this wonderfully funny book.
B0000069NM|3.0|I had a little skim through the reviews and found that all my original ideas had already been plagarized by other reviewers.  So I'll keep it short and sweet: <br />1. Should have been billed as MMW with special guest John Scofield.  All the five-star reviewers boast about how Sco gives his backing bands creative breathing room.  More like lets them do ALL THE WORK, twiddles off a few barely fitting phrases, and then claims the credit.  <br />A lot like Miles used to do in the later years, in fact. <br />This segues nicely into point 2.  Sco is WASHED UP!  Sickboy never spoke a truer word in Trainspotting when he so elegantly argued that every great artist passes a point of no return in their careers when their work begins a downward spiral of degeneration.  Listen to Sco play with Miles and hear the difference.  There is a young, hungry, passionate musician, fluid, brilliant!  Listen to him with MMW or Soulive and he sounds jerky, uncomfortable, out of his element.<br />3.  Still a decent listen, has its moments, if you're a fan of the &quot;backing band&quot; and not Scofield.
B000069AUI|3.0|I am a huge coldpay fan and after listening to Parachutes a countless number and seeing coldplay perform some of their new album live before its release i was thouroughly excited to find out that the band were releasing the album soon.  However, I'm not so sure about it.  I know that the album is just as deep musically as parachutes, but i cant seem to get &quot;into&quot; any of the tracks like I got into Yellow and Spies.  At the moment I rate the album as 3 stars but I assume that this album will grow on me with time, and i hope i can learn to enjoy it as i enjoyed parachutes. However, it is not exactly what i expected.  I will let time decide if that is a good thing or a bad thing.
B000002OZY|5.0|Given The Who's reputation for being among the bad boys of the 60s, smashing instruments and lights, blowing up drums, who could have guessed that they would have created one of the most cohesive pieces of rock music ever, a concept album, an opera, and plain solid rock. Furthermore, the story is relatively easy to follow, with a variety of sordid elements, the details of which can be found in a host of places, and which have been covered by other reviewers, so let's focus on the music.<br />The music holds up well; more than well, it was well done, and remains one of my favorites. Released originally in 1969, the album had the benefit of building upon ground broken by The Beatles, among a host of others. The Beatles infused elements of classical music into rock. The Moody Blues fused classical music and rock into one. The Who raised the ante by creating a new \\"classical\\" opera where the music was rock instead of classical.<br />An example of some of the best instrumental neo-classical rock on this album is track 5, \\"Sparks\\", which has excellent bass, is definably rock, and yet retains the complexity and flavor of a classical work, in rock music form.<br />Among the other songs that are definably rock are \\"I'm Free\\", \\"Tommy Can You Hear Me\\", \\"Eyesight to the Blind\\", \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", and \\"Pinball Wizard\\".<br />Other songs that fill in the story that have the flavor of a musical are songs like \\"It's a Boy\\" and \\"1921\\". One song that has elements of a Beatles song is \\"Christmas\\".<br />I'll allow the reader to categorize the other songs. Truly it's not important. What is important is that The Who took a variety of musical elements, classical, rock, opera, and created a master work of music. Music that tells the poignant story of a child abused by his mother and step-father after witnessing the murder of his father. Thrown in are classic elements of opera: infidelity, exploitation, and cowardice, along with elements explored at that time in very few works: incest, homosexuality, and sexual abuse.<br />As you listen to each of the tracks, discover that The Who were able to infuse multiple styles of rock music into the various songs, because each song allowed a variety of styles to enhance the subject of each song. Hard rock, instrumental, pop, harmonies, raucous solos, hard-driving riffs, heavy bass, horns, it's all here, and more.<br />Has \\"Tommy\\" dated well since 1969? I think so. The essence of the sound remains The Who, and if you know Who music at all, much of it sounds current, three decades and more after it was written. \\"Tommy\\" is no less current. Listening to the \\"The Acid Queen\\", I hear music that some of today's artists are trying to achieve: a more basic rock sound, steering away from complex synthesizers and over-orchestrated, over-exaggerated rock sound.<br />Okay, where is the drawback? The album really needs to be listened to in its entirety. Some of the songs and lyrics make little sense outside the context of the album. But given that the album is an opera, it makes sense that the album needs listened to as an album. I only listen to \\"Tommy\\" as an album, except for the stray tracks on collections.<br />\\"Tommy\\" is another of the numerous works of rock that were very experimental at the time it was released. \\"Tommy\\" succeeded in being very good rock, and broke more new ground for rock music. It has aged well, and continues to be one of my favorites. It's The Who.

B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather Triliogy is as good as it gets in cinema today.  Although the Godfather Part 3 was just made to capitalize on the fame the first two films garnered, it still is not a horrible picture; however, it isn't the same quality of picture as the other two.  The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family and the difference between mafia business and personal feelings.  Al Pacino is by far one of the greatest actors of all time, and this movie franchise allows you to see the growth that he made as an actor as well as the progression of his character Michael Corleone when he takes over the family &quot;business.&quot;  I would recommended this film to any and everyone who loves a story that gets you emotionally envolved as well as looks at the mafia when they were in their prime.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album is just pure genius.<br />Every single song is incredibly wonderful. The style is so rhythmical and so emotional. It sounds wonderfully produced, obviously, as the co-producer is Rick Rubin (who has worked with the Red Hot Chili Peppers).<br />Everything is perfect. Including the almost inaudible overtones in the song \\"Chop Suey!\\" during the verses in the sudden silences. Even those sound perfect. Everything is perfect.<br />I made myself a \\"home-made\\" version of this CD a few months back, but I wasn't satisfied. So I went out and bought it yesterday while it was on sale and I can finally rest easy knowing that I have Toxicity in the highest quality I can possibly have. It's extremely worth the money. You will not be disappointed. This is just as good, if not better, than System of a Down's first album.

It is a scary movie and I dare you to go out some night in a thick fog and try not to look behind you for a figure reaching out to grab you.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I was expecting a lot more from this.  I don't know why.  I guess I'm just used to listening to David Gray, who in my opinion, is a better songwriter than John Mayer.<br />Don't get me wrong, this CD isn't a bad buy.  But don't pay more than [price range] U.S. for it... it's not worth it.  Don't expect Bob Dylan or David Gray or anything.  Some of the songs are catchy, some aren't.  The lyrics are nothing extremely special.  I give it three stars because it seems as if he writes these songs from his heart, but nothing more because it also seems as if it's completely over-produced... it doesn't display John's raw talent like I thought it would.
B000069HKH|4.0|This album rates favourably with any the Boss has done, but it would have been even better if the producers had allowed the other E-Streeters to be more in evidence (note Clarence's sax fade on &quot;American Skin&quot;, as a point of reference). &quot;You're Missing&quot; is almost too beautiful. All in all, Bruce can stop chasing Bob Dylan's or Woody Guthrie's shadows as a poet of modern America...he has matched the masters.
B00005B36H|5.0|It's impossible for me to be unmoved by Tool's genius. To me, their music is perfect. Maynard has the scream of a banshee, yet has the HUMILITY to back off, and sing with the voice of a lark when he feels it necessary. Adam COULD play the same old boring guitar leads that most rock bands of our generation embrace, yet chooses not to. Instead, he plays from his gut, and listens to what his heart tells him to play; not what he thinks will impress a crowd. Justin is THE most unique bass player that I've ever heard, aside from maybe Les C. Danny has so much drive in his drums. So much power behind the melodies, yet you'll never hear a self-righteous solo to merely impress his audience. Sure, at times he does play alone, but only for the intent of setting the mood for a song, not showing off. Seperate, they are four vastly creative people, but together they achieve something so much more. An equilibrium of everything they four value. They are constantly trying to re-evaluate their music, and re-invent it, only to make it better and more passionate. <br />Lateralus is a product of their maturing and re-invention. It is on a level above Aenima, because it embraces so many different ideas and emotions, that were never revealed before. It also shows their extreme abilities with their instruments, and the willingness to take the spotlight off of their own image. Having, myself, been absorbed into every Tool album, it's refreshing to see how Lateralus is a symbol of their progression in style, form, and skill. If people don't enjoy this album, it will not be because of Tool, or their &quot;flaws.&quot; Certainly, if one can listen to Echoes, then they can tolerate a few 9 minute songs. Tool is greatly unappreciated, and sadly: misunderstood. <br />They have tapped into a musical world, that only a few legends have. In time, people will come to realize the potential of Tool.
0784011680|5.0|CHAPLIN was a film that when I saw in the theatre I was amazed not only in the life of this one man but in the enormous pool of talent Hollywood has, Directed by actor/writer/producer Richard Attenborough (Gandhi, A Bridge Too Far, A Chorus Line), this movie tell the ins and outs and humor and dark sides of man who changed Hollywood forever. His comic talent and timing were incredible and his ingenuity in filmmaking revolutionized the industry. E was a lover, womanizer, lonely, angry and always reinventing the wheel.<br />Starring as Chaplin himself - gives an award winning performance is Robert Downey Jr. (Soapdish, Short Cuts, Bowfinger). His depth and aging process are very real and amazing transformations makes this movie completely real.<br />Other cast members include<br />Dan Aykroyd (Ghostbusters, Driving Miss Daisy, Sneakers) as Chaplin's ground breaking director Mack Sennett.<br />Anthony Hopkins (Silence Of The Lambs, Mission Impossible II, The Mask Of Zorro)) as the author of Chaplin's life story George Hayden.<br />Geraldine Chaplin (Home For The Holidays, Gulliver's Travels, To Walk With Lions) who is the real-life daughter of Chaplin playing Charlie's grandmother,<br />Kevin Kline (My Life As A House, Dave, In & Out, Wild Wild West) playing actor Douglas Fairbanks.<br />Diane Lane (Jack Murder At 1600, Jack, The Perfect Storm) playing Chaplin's first love.<br />Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny, In The Bedroom) playing Chaplin's first of many flings.<br />Nancy Travis (Three Men And A Baby, Greedy, Doc Hollywood) playing Chaplin's next love.<br />James Woods (John Q, Hercules, Nixon, Casino, The Hard Way) playing Chaplin's prosecutor.<br />Also you can find David Ducovney (The X Files) and Penelope Ann Miller (Carlito's Way) in small parts.<br />Visually Richard A. made an incredibly detailed and realistic time capsule of history, memories and madness in the life of a creative genius. The DVD extras include a behind the scenes short as well as a `hidden menu'. I leave that for you to find.

B00005YW4H|4.0|I saw this album in a store one day with no particular intention of purchasing anything until I listened to it. I really enjoyed the initial sampling of Norah Jones's [second?] CD and was quickly persuaded to take it home and more or less wear it out. The unfortunate thing about this CD is that it kind of gets old pretty fast. She's got a great voice, but the melodies are kind of mediocre and some of them seem to be out of character for the rest of the CD (ie. track 3, Cold Cold Heart - a remake of an old Hank Williams diddy and track 7, Turn Me On).<br />  The great things about this CD is that it seems so much different than a lot of the other garbage that's being played today. Norah Jones is really pushing for a bit of variety here, and it's worth a listen to hear her try for it. A lot of good songs to drink a cup of great coffee while reading a worthwhile book to. On top of that, you get 14 songs and 45 minutes worth of music. I think that's it's a endeavor worth at least the purchase of a used CD. Just don't drive to it with heavy eyelids:-).
B00003CXRP|3.0|AMERICAN SWEETHEARTS was directed by Joe Roth (Angels In The Outfield, Streets Of Gold) and co-written by one of the stars themselves - Billy Crystal (Monster, Inc., When Harry Met Sally, Analyze This). For me it was a great treat watching Billy. Billy has this sarcastic criticism about the Entertainment Industry - and life overall - that is so close to things I have said about people, places and things that I often wonder if he is following me recording my thoughts! He is hysterical!<br />Now - as far as the film goes....it has a pretty big cast - John Cussack (16 Candles, Say Anything, The Grifters) and Cathrine Zeta Jones (The Mask Of Zorro, the new Chicago, The Haunting) do a great job as the `Hollywood Couple' gone wrong. Except for the public eye and the personalities on camera - off camera they are `oil and water'. Cathrine character is support by the hysterically funny and often underrated Hank Azaria (The Birdcage, Godzilla, Anastasia) as her Cuban lover. He is a scene-stealer! Here's another talent that needs o be given a chance. Through it all, Billy Crystal's character, the publicist (who also has a sidekick - cleverly and meekly played by Seth Green (all three Austin Powers films)) needs the help of Cathrines'sister played by (with an impressively timid performance) of Julia Roberts (Pretty Women, Steele Magnolias, Erin Brochovich). Quite a cast, right?<br />Needless to say, enter the eccentric performance of the crazy director (of Catherine's and John's newest film the general public has been dying to see); Christopher Walkin (Brainstorm, The Dead Zone, Mouse Hunt) There is comedy, slapstick, farce and more. A good story and silly premise make for a very entertaining movie for all!<br />Again, I mention that Billy Crystal has some of the best lines - like - `...oh look, there's the buffet...\\" and many many, more! Stanley Tucci (A Mid Summer Nights Dream, The Pelican Brief, Road To Perdition) gives a fantastic performance as the typical Hollywood Producer gone panicked.<br />The DVD extras include the usual trailer and previews and there is also a special section with deleted scenes where there is a limited on camera commentary with director Jo Roth. The bad part is that it is the only commentary on the DVD. It would have been nice to have the commentary on the whole feature film - this was a big disappointment to me. Overall I loved the movie. This is something to own!

B00005JKDR|4.0|This DVD release is well worth the price - you get two discs, <BR>full of information, interviews and in depth studies of how <BR>the film was designed, computer animated and finished.  Although<BR>the film is only 92 minutes, the material that accompanies it is<BR>four and a half hours long.<br />The film is a delight, very original in concept and beautifully<BR>designed.  There is plenty of action and thrills without a great<BR>deal of evil, which is a relief.  The colors are crisp and the<BR>lighting is luscious.  The characterizations by John Goodman and<BR>Billy Crystal as the lead montsers are full of nuance, especially<BR>Goodman.<br />The film earned a number of Oscar noms including Best Animated<BR>Feature and won the Oscar for Best Song - deservedly.<br />A great addition to the family video library and great fun for the whole family.<br />Highly recommended!
B0000640VO|5.0|For those people who have written horrible reviews, it is obvious that you are sadly missing... something.  A film is not a philosophical discourse - SO RELAX! This is a beautifully charming and sweet fairy tale, nothing more, and certainly nothing less.  I will agree, it needed more character development - but the French don't care what you or I think - so enjoy the momentary diversion, poor yourself and a bordeaux, grab a pillow and curl up and be transported.<br />To that poor reviewer who though she was a mute... perhaps you would enjoy chris rock or something else a little, je sais pas qoui.<br />Vive L'Amelie!
0316666343|5.0|If something seems overhyped, I usually develop an instant bias against it, so I went into reading this book doubting it could possibly live up to its accolades.<br />Surprisingly, it actually does live up to its hype, which is all too rare given the relentless marketing machine publishers unleash behind certain debut novels these days. I was actually moved to tears several times. <br />Jumping off from a fairly sensationalistic premise, the book is a very moving novel about how we age, families, young love, and what heaven might really be like. One of the most satisfying reads I've had in the last year. Highly recommended!
B000069AUI|5.0|OK let me tell you that there have been good and revolutionary albums in 2002 ( Red Hot chili peppers by the way, Mobys 18, The Strokes Is This It and many others) but no album can reach the greatness of this effort. Just listening to it put a smile on my face. After the whole sucess of Parachutes nobody thought they could do better and the follow Up would not live up to the feel of Parachutes. Well this album is probably 100 times better. I never thought Parachutes to be a brilliant album. It was good but not a masterpiece but this album is so good and so powerful and just fantastic that I cant describe it. This deserves 5 stars and is now one of my favourite album. Coldplay keep up the good work and lets hope you make more good albums in the future.
B000005JA8|1.0|...I like a wide variety of music but this album is just so devoid of melody that I really have trouble appreciating it. I know, this is called \\"dadaism\\", or whatever. The point is that people should realize when they buy this that it is an extremely challenging listen. While I sometimes can enjoy music that plays hard to get, this album is just absurd to me in its lack of coherent structure. The first side of the album (first six tracks) are pretty decent I'll admit. \\"Frownland\\" and \\"Dachau Blues\\" are memorable enough, \\"The Dust Blows...\\" and \\"Ella Guru\\" are good for a chuckle, \\"Hair Pie: Bake 1\\" is a cool instrumental, and \\"Moonlight on Vermont\\" is probably the coolest, most accesible part of the album. Yet starting with \\"Pachuco Cadaver\\" on the second side, the album quickly starts to drift in obscurity, with unmemorable tracks that you don't care to become familiar with because they lack any true melodies to make you want to. I'll make a dumb joke out of it and say that when the speaker (Beefheart, himself?) makes his intentionally absurd comment at the beggining of \\"Pachuco Cadaver\\" (concerning the fast and bulbous squid) and says \\"Get me?\\", that's where I start losing all hope of getting it. This is probably the most unnecessary double album in rock in my opinion, I lose interest after the first side, which means I can barely justify a single album. I almost always respect art the way it is in terms of length, but the songs start to become so repetitive, with little variation. With some few exceptions, such as \\"Pena\\" (different vocal), \\"Orange Claw Hammer\\" (an unnecessary second free association piece), and \\"The Blimp\\", which is just too weird to fit anywhere else (I give it credit for at least standing out), most of the rest of the album just plays out the same old stint over and over-Beefheart lays a very unmelodic vocal over some very unmelodic music, lacking the harmony of traditional music. It pushes my mind's boundaries of what music can be...to the point of utter frustration. I have tried to get through this album with a sense of humor, yet I find it hard to do this when Beefheart has so little himself about it. Sure there are some jokes between songs (including studio banter), but during the actual songs themselves, I find it ridiculous how seriously Beefheart seems to take music that incoherently rambles like this. Anyway, I've tried many times but it always ends up in torture and quite a chore to sit through, with one slightly memorable finishing track in \\"Veterans Day Poppy\\", which I'm sure was tacked on the end because nobody could find a more fitting ending to the madness.  I'm sure this will make a great gag gift for a friend.
0679882820|4.0|This has become our 15 month-old's favorite book, and she has even learned to do one or two of the noises. I read it to her at least 3 times a day. Of course, as a parent, you will be obligated to have a go at some of Mr. Brown's noises, and Mr. Brown is a wonder. I find the Knock and the Splatt problematic, although I'm quite good at the Moo and the Klopp.
B000001ELL|5.0|I have and love all the KISS albums. This is my favorite. It's not because it's disco(which it is not at all), it's because nobody seems to like this album. So, I kind of adopted it as my favorite KISS disc. It is the last of the classic KISS albums. The sound is not disco, pop, or anything else, it is KISS's classic sound(slightly watered down by the producer). &quot;Unmasked&quot; in 1980, was the album that deserves the reputation &quot;Dynasty&quot; gets. &quot;Unmasked&quot; was disco pop rock. This album was KISS starting to get tired of each other. I think this is KISS most underated disc(next to &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;). If you want to have all the classic 70's makeup albums, make sure you include this and &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;. You can skip &quot;Unmasked&quot; and &quot;The Elder&quot;.

0684874350|5.0|This book was a wonderful break from the average traditional memoir.  The story is not only told through the eyes of the subject (in this case, young Frank McCourt himself), but it is told through the eyes he had at that time.  For example, when recounting events from his very early childhood, he writes as a very young boy would think.  He doesn't understand death, he doesn't know why his father is an alchoholic, he doesn't know why his mother is always crying.  As the story progresses and he gets older, his perception changes and he begins to see the world with the greater understanding that each passing year brings.<BR>In the midst of this tragic tale of poverty and despair, one cannot help but notice the humor.  Oddly enough, this fits in very well with the tale.  We have to laugh as the young 'Frankie' attempts to understand the elements of life (death, poverty, etc.), and does so by creating for himself explanations which, though they seem to us absurd, could easily be conjured by a young boy.<BR>The great strength of this book lies in the way Frankie looks at the world.  He lives in horrible circumstances, and as he ages he becomes increasingly aware of this fact, and yet he still manages to find pleasure in life.  He does not, of course, think his life is perfect, but he knows it's HIS life and he seems to accept it.<BR>If this book were nothing more than complaining and whining about his poor, miserable childhood, it would be a waste of time.  Angela's Ashes is just the opposite, however.  We truly can see a childhood filled with sadness and poverty, not from the point of view of a grown man looking back, but through the eyes of a dirty little Irish boy.
B000002J1B|4.0|As a reformed Yes fan it's been many years since I've listened to Relayer, but I put on my LP today because I'd always recalled this as one of their best efforts.  And, it still holds up.<br />Previous and later Yes albums have suffered from a complete lack of discretion; jumping around thematically, stop and starting, and generally sounding like a bunch of studio tracks edited together.  Relayer is surprisingly cogent and, most importantly, has genuinely interesting and musical themes.<br />This is an album that is significantly greater than the sum of its parts.  Patrick Moraz is a jerk extraordinaire, and none of the members of the band have ever been known for their modesty.  But somehow, they got together here to make an album that flows very well and is captivating.<br />Gates of Delirium does indeed sound futuristic, and even today still sounds fresh.  Patrick Moraz, who normally is a complete spazz on the keyboards, simply keeps things moving and plays more rhythm than solos.  Chris &quot;Fish&quot; Squire's bass playing has never been more appropriate or driving.  Check out Sound Chaser, for instance.  On previous albums he would've been all over the place showing us how well he can play and how many notes he can hit, very rarely to our amusement.  Here he shows us that he knows what the right notes are to hit, and it works.<br />I agree with a previous reviewer that this sounds quite a bit like fusion, but I think it's simply a move toward a more aggro prog rock sound, such as where King Crimson headed.  Unfortunately, Yes chose to not explore this path after this album and went to a decidedly lamer sound with the exception of the song Going For the One.<br />So, if for some bizarre reason, you are a non-Yes fan and have decided to check out one of their least popular albums, then you've come to the right place.  This album works quite well and should appeal to fans of '70s bands such as Mahavishnu Orchestra, mid-era King Crimson, as well as appealing to fans of later Legendary Pink Dots and perhaps Ozric Tentacles.

0060926317|1.0|Perhaps my least favourite thing about this shoddy attempt to cash in on a culture that has suffered immensely for the past two centuries is the author's assertion that these allegedly \\"pure\\" Aborigines are choosing not to reproduce. European and North American readers may not be aware that Australian Aborigines were subjected to an official government policy of destroying family groups, removing children and attempting to breed out Aboriginal blood. Very many Aboriginal people today view this as genocide, so to suggest that a group of \\"pure\\" Aborigines, whether fictional or factual, are choosing to let their race die is quite possibly the single most offensive thing a white woman from Kansas could invent.<BR>I'm sorry the author decided that Aborigines were sufficiently exotic and far away to dispense with even the most glancing attempts at research. I'm even sorrier that this offensive cocktail of codswallop continues to be printed, to the deep distress of many Aboriginal people. I doubt Harper Collins would have reprinted it if the author had chosen Jews or American Negroes as a vehicle for her cultural appropriation.

B00006GA4C|5.0|It seems like ever since I first got a CD player, I've been waiting for the EARLY Grand Funk albums to be released. Unlike a lot of bands whose albums were at least available, albeit not remastered, most of the GFR catalog has been strangely absent from the CD racks for years - until now. People tend to think of &quot;We're an American Band&quot; or, God forbid, &quot;The Locomotion&quot; when they think of the Funk, but what they often overlook is how powerful, raw and loud these guys were in the early days. And this, &quot;THE RED ALBUM&quot;, is their masterpiece. Capital has done a great job on the remastered sound, with Mel Schacher's booming, heavy bass right up front right where it belongs. These guys were crankin' when this type of sound was critically lambasted - alongside Sabbath, the early pioneering metal of Grand Funk was looked upon as being talentless noise by the critics. We all know now that it was simply a precursor to heavy-metal in general and the Seattle grunge sound in particular. This, along with their first album, &quot;On Time&quot;, are testaments to one of the loudest, heaviest bands in existence.
B000069AUI|5.0|Although i loved 'Yellow' it got on my nerves after awhile, it's still a great song, but it was too overplayed which normally kills some good bands ::cough::nickelback::cough::.  I bought this album because i loved the first single 'In my Place'  and i found that this album is filled with fantastic lyrics and music. Everything is just so perfect.  No hate-lyrics or harsh riffs on this album, just people who make music just for the sake of making good music.  This CD is going to be in my player for a while.. i cant describe how good it is, just pick it up and be swept away.  <br />(Although i said you can't really pick high points, the track 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' is my personal favourite, check it out!)
1558807381|1.0|Visually appealing, but the story stinks, particularly in character development.  For the first time in my life, I was so utterly bored that I considered stopping the tape midway.

Buy the cd now, you'll be in for a VERY pleasant surprise!
B000068FWC|5.0|Supertramp were a 70s progressive rock group that enjoyed a huge worldwide following (the French in particular, loved them). With Breakfast in America they managed to bridge the gap between rock credibility and commercial success. They wrote shorter, poppier songs for this album while still retaining their smooth, luxurious sound. It worked. The album was a massive critical and commercial success. The single, Logical Song was a huge hit, but the album also boasted classic songs like Lord Is It Mine, Breakfast in America, Goodbye Stranger, Casual Conversation and the amazing Take The Long Way Home. Breakfast in America, made in 1978, is Supertrampâs last truly great album. It is slightly poppier than their previous stuff (it is the Supertramp album your little sister would like), and some cynics would say, more shallow. Shallow? Just listen to songs! If anything Supertramp are lyrically more focussed on this album than ever before. And donât be fooled - t he sound is great (just listen to the clips!) and like all truly great albums can be appreciated by all ages and tastes. Supertramp went on to make a number of albums after this, but they were pale compared to Breakfast. Remember them this way.<br />âºÃ*

B00005JKDR|5.0|I really loved the Disney/Pixar animated film \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" when I saw it in its initial theatrical release. The marvelous fantasy/comedy takes place mainly in a sort of alternate world populated by a wide variety of colorful and amusing monsters--most notably, Sulley (voiced by John Goodman), a big, lovable blue cross between Bigfoot and Godzilla, and Mike (Billy Crystal), a round, green, one-eyed bundle of manic energy. Together they have a suspenseful and exciting adventure when a human child accidentally crosses over into the monster world. It's a hilarious and heartwarming film that's filled with laughs, thrills, and some marvelous visual images.<br />The 2-disc DVD edition of the film is loaded with entertaining extras--the bonus disc alone boasts approximately 207 minutes of added material. The extras are cleverly divided into two main groups: \\"Monsters Only\\" and \\"Humans Only.\\" The first of these groups allow you to go deeper into the imaginary monster world of the film, whereas the second group lets you peek behind the scenes and see the creators of the film at work.<br />In an attempt to keep this review down to a manageable length, I won't go into detail about all of these marvelous extras. From the \\"Human\\" side of house, it's fun to see the film's director and the other behind-the-scenes talents get to speak to the viewer directly. You also get a taste of what it's like to work at Pixar studios. Also fun is a look at the film's friendship song, with commentary by songwriter Randy Newman.<br />Particularly interesting is the huge gallery of concept art (some still, some animated) that documents how some concepts in the film changed by the time it reached its finished form. You get to see a version of Mike with no arms, versions of Sully with tentacles instead of legs, and more oddities. For technophiles, the extras go into details about the efforts to get the computer animation program to render Sully's fur properly. I also loved the gallery of TV ads and theatrical trailers; they remind you of the superb job that was done marketing the film.<br />The \\"Monster\\" extras are fun; you get to pretend you're  a new employee at the Monsters, Inc. factory. The extras are packed with details; there's even an employee handbook that you can read. There's also a new short film, \\"Mike's New Car,\\" in which Goodman and Crystal reprise their vocal roles. All in all, the 2-disc edition of \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is a masterful example of what can be accomplished with the DVD format.nd theatrical trailers; they remind you of the superb job that was done marketing the film.<br />The \\"Monster\\" extras are fun; you get to pretend you're  a new employee at the Monsters, Inc. factory.

B00006AW2E|4.0|Full disclosure: I don't have this CD, but it's headed for my Wish List, so I can't speak to the technical qualities of this reissue. But I do have the LP, and remember back in the day when the Rolling Stones were the funky, authentic British Bad Boys who took American R&amp;B and threw it back at us, as well as in the face of the Fab Four who dominated the charts. You won't hear the Beatles cut to the quick like the Stones do on &quot;She Said Yeah,&quot; one of the most intense tracks of the 60s; you won't hear Paulie sing with the soulful abandon of Solomon Burke that Jagger musters on &quot;That's How Strong My Love Is&quot;; the dirty blues of &quot;Talkin' Bout You&quot; and the bittersweet &quot;Good Times&quot; are the heart and soul of who the Rolling Stones were then, and who they were to become. And if all you know are the hits, here's &quot;Heart of Stone,&quot; one of their first and best. A great record from a group that has rarely been this consistently good again.
6305128952|5.0|Almost from the first scene there is enormous tension in this movie. The smashed innocence of youth, the imperious maneuvering of an overbearing mother/executive - executive/mother, and the seemingly willing doormat of a husband are all played against the shadow of a horribly injured horse, which for a time are the only wounds the players really acknowledge. It's easy to get involved in the plight of Pilgrim, the horse, but as the story progresses, it becomes clear that the horse's injuries are small potatoes compared to the injuries shouldered and nurtured by Scott Thomas (the mother) and her daughter - as well as Redford (the Whisperer), although I didn't piece that together until I'd watched it a second time.<br />Redford and Scott Thomas are at the top of their game (I'm not much of a Redford fan and I'm only beginning to appreciate what a gem Scott Thomas is), and although Horse Whisperer subtly leads the viewer astray for a time, deliberately focusing on the injuries to the horse and the daughter, about 45min in to the movie you can sense real intrigue developing between Redford and Scott Thomas. Redford plays the strong, semi-silent Marlboro man (masking his own injuries behind a thick veneer of quiet competence), and Scott Thomas transports her restless world of conference-calls, cell phones, fax machines and overworked anxiety to the Big Sky meadows of Montana. It takes days, weeks, for her to recognize the incongruity; however, eventually the recognizes the quiet value hidden in ranch life, and when she does, Scott Thomas sheds her urban values in a rush - for a time.<br />I've enjoyed this movie several times - one of the few times I agree with the professional critics. Super! A must watch. Not really a \\"feel good\\" movie, but Horse Whisperer is a thoughtful \\"reality check\\" that leaves the viewer (or at least me), playing all sorts of woulda, coulda, shoulda mind games.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is one of the best bands to come out of the UK in some time.  I've seen the band in concert; they put on an incredible live show! It's very rare that a band's sophomore effort is better or equal to the debut.  I'm pleased to say, that's not the case with \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\".  This CD gets better every time I listen to it.  It has emotion of \\"Parachutes\\", yet it takes its own path in terms of musical style.  Well done Coldplay!!!<br />My personal favorites:  Clocks, In my place

0553213105|5.0|Being a student (10th grade), I feel obliged to relate to other students not only how much I enjoyed this novel, but also that it may not be right for everyone.  It seems that many other students do not particularly like the novel, especially the male crowd. If my class was ever assigned P&amp;P I am sure that there would be many complaints from my classmates... but they complain about every novel we are assigned, and therefore I can never really trust their opinion. If you are a student looking to read P&amp;P I highly recommend it. My own ideas on this novel are quite favorable. I am sorry that not everyone has a taste for Austen. I consider her one of the best authors who ever lived. I enjoyed reading Pride and Prejudice as well as other Austen novels.  Her novels, especiall P&amp;P, are quite funny and I have often found myself laughing outloud on many occasions (which is not an easy feat). Pride and Prejudice is not a novel to be over looked.
B00000JHAU|5.0|If You're Feeling Sinister is one of the few albums I've heard that is actually perfect.  The Boy Done Wrong Again may seem somewhat dull at times, depending on your mood, but it is nevertheless a very pretty, melancholy song and the rest of the CD is just flawless.  This was the first B&S I heard, and I was hooked after one listen.  I've purchased some of their other work, which is also most excellent, but this album is the one I always go back to.  Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying, is just beautiful and one of my all-time favorite songs.  If everyone owned a copy of this CD, I think the world would be a much better place.  Buy it.  It's just so incredibly lovely.
B00005UEAR|2.0|I've now of 6DOIT since it's release date and originally i thought it was a sorry excuse for Dream Theater, but i thought i'd wait until i saw a couple of shows and really listened to the album to express my opinion.  However, my dislike for this album never went away.  <br />The CD has some high points, &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;, not the &quot;Glass House&quot; as the first review calls it, is a solid track.  It contains excellent instrumental compostion and percussion presence especially in the first and last few minutes, and the hardcore edge is definately pumpimg (It's too bad this song sounds terrible live).  &quot;Blind Faith&quot; should be put on the list of LaBrie's best vocal tracks, his voice sounds superb especiall during the &quot;With or without you....&quot; verse.<br />However the CD seems to be Dream Theater's sad excuse to break into mainstream music.  The fact of the matter is, this will never happen.  The majority of the people who listen to the radio and watch MTV are not even metal fans so Prog would be rejected like sour milk.  Dream Theater should be working on impressing the fan base they have, I know myself and my friends want Dream Theater to make something that will be put with &quot;Awake&quot; and &quot;Images and Words&quot; in a few years.
0783204914|3.0|... and when I say &quot;Hollywood,&quot; I don't mean this in a complimentary way.  I can't say that I wasn't entertained, but other than that the film has very few redeeming values (remind you of anything else Hollywood has released in the past 25 years?).  <br />Although I enjoy Pacino as much as anyone, he plays the same note in every single picture -- loud, forceful and aggressive.  The ending was just awful and totally unrealistic and brought back bad memories of other (unnamed but obvious) films where someone makes a dumb speech (or says/does something else totally contrived and meant to arouse emotions) and everyone stands up &amp; claps at the end.  I really wanted to like this film more than I did, and the ending sort of ruined it for me.  I think I've outgrown the sort of maudlin, sentimental unrealism Hollywood throws up on the screen to woo the masses.  I'm sure this review won't be very popular either, but I think honesty is a more important value than &quot;not snitching on your friends.&quot;  If you disagree, please feel free to snitch on me with a &quot;no&quot; vote.
0316666343|1.0|...<br />     The first chapter sets up the reader for some major disappointment.  Susie is telling us about her murder and yet there is no emotion for her or the reader.  It seems that she is just an observer in her own death and not even a horrorified observer.  The lack of emotion and important details continues throughout the whole book.  The murderer isn't even that interesting!  For a story about a murdered girl, there is a lot of fluffy tales of the happenings on earth(Starting after chapter 1 and going to the end of the book), such as a sister's romance and a budding friendship between 2 classmates.  There are many tales of sex as well, which seems completely unnecessary.  Overall I gave this book 1 star because I was upset that the hype got to me and my book club.  <br />For every 1 star there is a 5 star... so this is just 1 opinion for which there are millions more to choose from.

B000069AUI|5.0|The song 'Yellow' was garnering more and more airplay, and i had definitely heard of Coldplay but didn't have any of their<BR>songs. It was a few years ago that my friend told me to go and buy Parachutes, and I was completey blown away.<br />So the two year wait for 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' has been eagerly anticipated. After listening to this album for a week now, I haven't been disppointed. Coldplay have exceeded my expectations, infact they have done even more. They have made a masterful album full of life, with warm, soulful, uplifting tracks of the highest quality. The heart rendering emotion displayed in 'The Scientist' will be nothing like you've heard this year. The amazing piano work on 'Clocks' is breathtaking. Just close your eyes and listen to 'Green Eyes' and you'll be transported to a beautiful place, and 'Warning Sign' with it's guitar compliments the lyrics perfectly. Chris Martin puts every inch of his heart in to his songs and never leaves a stone unturned. 'God put smile on you face' and 'A rush of blood to the head' are louder but never lose their appeal and grace that Coldplay have firmly put in to place. Every song is great in its own right, and the soft 'Amersterdam' is a perfect album closer.<br />In this day and age many bands stuggle to find a grip in their music and more often than not produce inconsistent material with<BR>no real connection holding them together. Coldplay blend they're music consistently, with meaningful lyrics and above all music that touches the heart. Believe me, putting aside suggestions made by Martin himself that this could be the last album, at this rate Coldplay can become the biggest band in the world.
0316776963|3.0|Maybe I'm too straight laced.  Just didn't think all of this was &quot;laugh out loud funny.&quot;
0345451325|2.0|Okay...I'm going to try to be as nice about this as I can.  I am a fan of the x-box game (as is my little brother) and I actually got him this book to try to get him into reading.<br />Now, this book is a fun (and short) read.  Space battles, cool aliens, and all the other trappings of a space opera.  But it's not nearly original in the least bit.<br />Bits and pieces of this book were stolen from several of the most powerful sf war novels out there.  Much (if not most) of the discussion of the Spartan II's is taken straight from Ender's Game, and I'll be the first to say that Card does a much better job at handling the ethics of raising children to become soldiers.  The rest of it is ripped from Starship Troopers, but once again, Nylund's war philosophy limps meagerly behind Heinlein's masterpiece.  <br />Unless you are a big fan of the x-box (and soon to be PC) game, there is absolutely no reason for you to read this book.  The only reason to read it is if you want some background to the world in which the game is based.  For that, it's splendid.  Otherwise, it's a waste of time.

B000003S0P|5.0|In 1974, sensing &quot;Red&quot; would be the last album King Crimson would record together, Robert Fripp, John Wetton &amp; Bill Bruford decided to go out with a metallic bang. Such is the case on the opening title track, which leaves the listener both amazed and awe-struck the entire 6:12. As the record moves into the second track, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, the listener is treated to even more of these &quot;semi-heavy metal&quot; abrasions, including Wetton's vocals sung in between these muscular metallic arpeggiations. The parallel guitar riffs present in &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; by Fripp, are masterful and hook-laden, which demonstrates the mastery of his guitar playing intricacies brilliantly. Wetton's bass work and Bruford's percussion rhythms (especially on &quot;OMRN&quot;) are audio poetry in motion as well. The latter two cuts, &quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;Starless&quot;, display David Cross' mastery of the violin and Mel Collins dexterity in his saxophone playing respectively, both exquisitely done to a tee. Sadly, &quot;Red&quot; would be the last album to feature the core trio of Fripp, Bruford and Wetton. Fripp would retire King Crimson for six years, before gathering together a new lineup in 1981, featuring the likes of Adrian Belew on lead vocals and Tony Levin on bass, among others. With so much &quot;heavy-metal&quot;, classical &amp; jazzy get-up-and-go, not to mention three highly talented and competent musicians to bring it all home in splendid fashion, &quot;Red&quot; is definitely a must-have KC masterwork you'll definitely want to have in your progressive-rock CD library!
B00006950W|5.0|My brother rented this movie from our local video store and I wasn't even going to watch it considering it was a movie made off of a video game. I'm not a game player and usually not interested in the video game type of movie. However, I sat down to watch it anyway and found that it was really good after all. That is, if you can wade through the boring first15 minutes or so while they set up the plot. Besides the fact that the plot was interesting  (sort of an &quot;Alien with Sigourney Weaver&quot; kind of feel), and some of the effects great (those dogs!) - the acting was really good too! This was especially surprising considering the main actress was Milla Jovovich who as far as I can know has only done bad acting in bad movies (think, Blue Lagoon and the recent Joan of Arc.) She really does well in this though, making a much better success of her tough girl role than she did in Joan of Arc. She does start out rather uninteresting, but as the movie progresses, so does her character and her acting - some great martial arts type of moves from her here, too. I thought she did really well - especially in the last half. <BR> <BR>Another character worth mentioning is the character &quot;Ray&quot; played by the beautiful and talented Michelle Rodriguez who starred in the boxing movie &quot;Girlfight.&quot; She was great in that, winning a lot of critical acclaim, and she's great in this, too. Even though it's not the well developed, starring role she had in Girlfight, she's still fun to watch. She plays a tough, smart-mouthed soldier and some of her trademark smoldering looks are worth seeing the movie for alone. Plus she's just beautiul - I think she was the best thing in this movie, actually.  <BR> <BR>So some of the characters were more developed than your average action flick and I found myself caring about two or three of them, the action was good and the plot kept me interested. All in all, definitely worth a look. I hope people aren't turned away by the fact thatit's a movie off a video game - I'd like to see a sequel.

B000059PR5|5.0|The day after is a very good movie. My dad used to always take me to look at the tall buildings in downtown Kansas City when I was little. The first time I saw this movie I was 6 years old. When the part  came that showed downtown Kansas City gone, I was traumatized for life. But don't let a small thing like that deter you from seeing this movie! It is an awesome movie and I think everyone should watch it at least once.
B00006G8O1|4.0|I've watched \\"Donnie Darko\\" three times now in the last five days, and still can't say definitively if I like it.  I appreciate the heck out it, am impressed by the imagination and creativity of the filmmakers, and admire the fact that what they put on screen belies their $4 million budget.  Most of all, I enjoy the heightened sense of awareness I get every time it finishes.  It's a feeling that lets me know, without question, that I've been affected by what I just saw.  But when I think about the film rationally, as opposed to emotionally, it crumbles under the weight of its own conceit.<br />Set in October of 1988, the story follows young Donnie Darko, a seemingly unbalanced teenager who is prone to sleepwalking.  On one such night journey he meets a new friend, a 6-foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.  Upon returning home the next morning, he finds that an unaccounted-for airplane engine has crash-landed on his house, crushing the room where he should have been asleep in bed.  It's the kind of setup that keeps the audience on its toes for the rest of the film.  Where did the engine come from?  Who is Frank?  What do the fates, which obviously want him alive, have in store for Donnie Darko?<br />The problem is that writer/director Richard Kelly has some ideas for answers to these questions, but he either: 1) Didn't have the budget to realize them; 2) Didn't want to give them away too early; or 3) Didn't want to give them away at all, preferring for the audience to fill in the gaps on their own.  I don't have a problem when most filmmakers choose path #3.  The audience should act as a participant in determining the meaning of the film.  But they can't do it alone, in a vacuum.  Kelly provides clues all along, but they are so hidden and so obscure, that even the most discerning viewer probably wouldn't be able to find them on first (or second, or third pass).  It becomes even more frustrating when the ending, supposedly constructed to tie up all loose ends (or at least all loose ends that the writer has bothered tying up), bends and breaks the audience's ability to suspend disbelief.  There's one final thread that I still can't logically rationalize, even though I know what was supposed to happen.<br />Donnie rails against ignore-the-grey-area thinking, claiming that life is more complex than that.  I wish Kelly would have heeded his own advice, for he does a lousy job presenting complex characters.  Most everyone here is either good or evil, black or white.  He loves the beatific Darko family, the progressive young teachers at school, and Gretchen (Jena Malone), Donnie's new girlfriend.  He hates, and is unsympathetic to, Kitty, the little girl dance troupe that she exploits for her own ego, and the infomercial pitchman whose theories she buys into wholeheartedly.  No scene holds a more pointed example of Kelly's inability to hide his hand, than an emergency PTA meeting.  Called because someone has flooded the school and put an axe in the head of its mascot, it is inevitably interrupted by Kitty, who has discovered that an English teacher (Drew Barrymore) is teaching Graham Greene's short story \\"The Destructors\\".  \\"Do you even know who Graham Green is?\\" asks a concerned mother.  \\"I think we've all seen 'Bonanza',\\" comes the arrogant yet ignorant reply.  Kelly didn't even have enough confidence in his good guys -- and by association, their quest -- to give them credible bad guys to rail against.  Instead he offers villains whose actions are one step above twirling their moustaches menacingly and tying damsels in distress to railroad tracks.<br />In Kelly's defense, \\"Donnie Darko\\" was his first film.  And to his credit, there is a lot here that is either very accomplished or shows potential.  I did say that every time I watch the film it affects me in a poignant way, and now I'll tell you why.<br />First of all, it looks great.  Kelly and crew, low budget or no low budget, have made a film that you can stand alongside any big budget blockbuster of the day, and it wouldn't look out of place.  They even manage a skillful recreation of the living water effect first seen in James Cameron's \\"The Abyss\\".  His camera work is ambitious or simple when necessary.  In a film called \\"Donnie Darko\\", one would expect that light (or the lack thereof) would be an important player.  Kelly and cinematographer Stephen B. Poster use clean suburban sunshine in the daytime, and extreme darkness at night.  The latter is often punctuated by blinding flashes of light, most notably the brilliant beam that presciently spews from Frank's left eye.<br />Kelly does fine detailed work making sure the authenticity of the time period is maintained.  From the clothes, to the conversations, to, most importantly, the music, everything fits the era to a T.  He manages to get fine use out of not one but two Tears for Fears songs: \\"Head Over Heels\\" adds power to an effective tracking shot showing the treacherous ecosystem that is Donnie's school; a cover of \\"Mad World\\" adds melancholy, without adding melodrama, to the affective denouement (like I said, emotionally the film works, but it can't stand up to reason).<br />Overall, I'll give Richard Kelly the benefit of the doubt, and deign to recommend his film.  Like I said, it offered me enough of a visceral rush that I've seen it multiple times, and look forward to seeing many times more.  For all potential audience members, remember this: \\"Donnie Darko\\" will not make much sense, at least until you've done some further research into the hidden meanings of the film.  Appreciate it as an emotional experience first, and its pleasures will fulfill you.<br />I guess I liked it after all.

B00005JLD2|5.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is a true and real life biography of a girl being snapped away from her mother because she is a half-caste - offspring of a white man and an aboriginal woman. The movie has a very detail description of the intention of the Whilte Australians in the 30s to whiten all these children by removing them from their mothers, sending them to the training camps. The story depicted 3 girls running away from the camp and walked 1200 miles back home to reunite with their mother. The movie is very natural and touching that you will just be drawn inside the hearts of those girls, who has nothing but strong determination to go home and live a life they want. The movie also described the arrogance of the Whitle Australians until the 1970s, who tried every effort to justify their whitening process of this Stolen Generation. It is a very honest portray of the experience of Molly, who was unfortunately being forced into this generation and lived a wandering and heart breaking life due to this policy. It should be watched by all people so that we could learn to respect other people's life and culture as they are, instead of superimposing what we think is the best for them, for they might end up to be a curse of life for these people. This is a very touching and introspecting production that should not be missed. It does not attempt to achieve a melodramatic effect, but a simple honest reminder for respecting the aboriginals who are actually the native people who live on this island continent. Things haven't been really improved in Australian over the aboriginal issues, but this is a very good attempt to raise the conscious of people over the land that the White Australians conquered 200 years ago, and how much the mentality of some of these people have and have not changed. The cinematography is also spectacular. In all, this is not a movie to be missed.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol has come out with the freshest sound I've heard in a while. They are compared to other bands, but who isn't these days? Like everyone else they have their influences, but they manage to sound unique. Obstacle 1, The New, and Stella..., are some of the best songs I've heard in a long time.  This will definitely be one of the top 10 rock CD's of the year...maybe #1.
B000067CPX|5.0|The clowns who insist that the Peppers recreate BSSM need to try a little soul-searching and, especially if they were of adult age when BSSM came out (1991), they need to GROW UP (real quick).  'By the Way' is the best pop CD so far this decade.  I can't think of anything that quite compares to it.  The lyrics allude to surrender, recovering from addiction, the way of love, and to hanging out moment to moment with none other than the \\"Big Guy Upstairs.\\"<br />Someone (probably Anthony) has had a break-through, an epiphany, their heart filled to soaring with the beauty, grace, and majesty of the Living Deity, the Fulcrum of Love, the Maker of Existence.<br />No, this is not a gospel music CD.  It's your BUDS!!!  Anthony, John, what's his name on drums, and that miscreant, Flea (?) would never come out with anything OTHER than a RHCP record.  These are the same goofballs who wore giant lightbulb heads at the MTV awards 7 or 8 years ago.  The same outcasts who played Rick's American Cafe in East Lansing back in '86 (!) - each wearing nothing but a single white gym sock.  For what they've gone through, addiction and death (and dreaded line-up changes) it warms the cockles of this reviewer's heart to hear them sounding so unbelievably PURE, FREE, and full of JOY.<br />Jeez, I love this CD.  'Midnight' is my favorite so far.  The last song, \\"Venice Queen\\" is neurologically imbedded in my skull with that great refrain \\"G-L-O-R-I-A is love, my friend.\\"  The other songs, believe it or not, after just a few listens (especially for you long time RHCP fans) are, well, perfect.  It's true.  Sad to think, though, that it looks like I've finally arrived at the demographic where one of my favorite rock acts will actually win a (gag) Grammy (if not several).<br />\\"By the Way\\" is a kick, a Phenomenally Good Listen, and is very likely to become an all time classic.
B000005IRG|5.0|One of the \\"killer three\\" CBGB's albums (alongside Patti Smith's \\"Horses\\" and the Ramones' debut), \\"Marquee Moon\\" is the perfect record. Tom Verlaine's voice has been criticized as sounding sloppy, but in reality, those who do not appreciate his singing style will dislike the album - his voice represents the entire record's art-punk innovation. From the joyous opening blast of \\"See No Evil,\\" to the transcendent title track (over 8 minutes long!), \\"Marquee Moon\\" is one of the top 25 greatest records of all time. It merits an indiscriminate recommendation. For anyone with even a mild interest in punk, this is an essential purchase. Don't believe me? Just give a quick listen to Tom Verlaine's fantastic one-note solo on the title track. Then listen to the rest of the record. Repeat. Repeat. And so on.
B00005M91K|2.0|I liked this DVD &quot;okay&quot;.  It was good, but not fantastic, and NOT in the same league as Koyaanisqatsi's visuals and music.  I was hoping for something a lot like Koyaanisqatsi, and this is &quot;somewhat&quot; similar.<br />Instead of so many beautiful nature scenes, Baraka focuses more on the human element.  Sometimes this is wonderful, like the monkey chant, and sometimes it disturbed me, like watching workers slice baby chicken's beaks off.  From the title, which means &quot;blessing&quot;, I didn't expect the darker elements to be there, and I didn't appreciate them.  (I'm pretty sensitive to seeing animals in pain and/or treated as objects, so whole &quot;chicken&quot; section bothered me quite a bit) I don't see the blessing in mutilating baby birds...  It is certainally real, but I just don't see how that fits in with the &quot;blessing&quot; theme I thought it was supposed to have judging from the film's description.  <br />The music was also not nearly as rich and moving as it is in Koyaanisqatsi. I found myself bored more than once.  Koyaanisqatsi holds me enraptured from start to finish, no matter how many times I see it.<br />But some portions of it are great, and I suppose I'm glad it's in my library, and on DVD so I can simply skip the parts that bother me.  If I'd seen this at a friend's house first, I would not have bought it for myself, however.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Frosted window panes, candels gleaming inside and the most wonderful Christmas music ever, by the one and only THE CARPENTERS.<BR>I was so happy to find out the the 2 albums &quot;Christmas Portrait&quot; and &quot;An Old-Fashioned Christmas&quot; were to be released in their entirety on CD for the first time on this stunning collection.<BR>The music is beautifully remastered. Richard does an excellent job and I hope to hear much more from him!<BR>On &quot;Christmas Waltz&quot; it has a little staticky sound that wasn't on the LP or Cassette releases or the release &quot;Christmas Portrait - The Special Edition&quot;.<BR>When I think of Christmas I know I can't get throug it without the Carpenters. I hope to see the 2 Christmas specials on DVD &quot;...A Christmas Portrait&quot; and &quot;Christmas with The Carpenters&quot;!<BR>Go Richard! I wanna see rarities!
B000002UAR|5.0|It's actually very difficult to try and review a record from 1966 36 years later and judge it by standards of 1966.<br />Can you put yourselves in the shoes of a 17 year old kid in 1966?  You just walked home from the local record shop and you're sitting down in front of the turntable.  You slide your thumbnail along the plastic to open up the album and remove the LP from its paper jacket.  You carefully hold the edges of the record with your palms and set it down, pulling the tone arm over to drop the needle into the groove.<br />The guitar stylings of George Harrison are what you hear first, as &quot;Taxman&quot; plays through your phono speakers, a great new Beatles tune indeed.  After listening to more of the record you hear the heady symbolism of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, the Beach Boys-like harmony of &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, the horns-rich McCartney kicker &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; and the Lennon acid-trip-set-to-music &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;.<br />Yes, there are many other great tunes on this album...radio favorites like &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;.  And other greats like &quot;She Said, She Said&quot;, a song based on something Peter Fonda is said to have said to John Lennon, &quot;I know what it's like to be dead&quot;.  How about &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; and Lennon's beautiful &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;.<br />And at the age of 17 in 1966, you do not yet know that &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; would help usher in a genre of music known as the Chicago-sound with bands like The Buckinghams, The Ides of March, The American Breed, Chicago and more using rich brass harmony.  In 1966 you do not know that Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys was also sitting listening to Revolver, which in no small part spurred him on to create &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.  And you don't realize that there are lush string quartets playing on &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. String quartets on your local Top-40 radio station!!  How can &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; with string quartets be played on-air alongside &quot;You Can't Hurry Love&quot; by the Supremes or &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; by Tommy James &amp; the Shondells.  Those are two great songs, but how do they compare to the orchestration and imagery of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;?<br />These guys were just the Beatles...a rowdy quartet from Liverpool, England, right?  Not much different from Gerry and the Pacemakers or Freddie and the Dreamers???  Not anymore...not after Revolver.  After Revolver, rock and roll changed.  The music was now becoming Rock music, and bands like the Beatles were evolving into something new.  British bands like The Yardbirds, The Who and The Pink Floyd were experimenting with exciting new sounds, and there was a whole new free-form sound in the U.S. coming out of San Francisco with bands like The Charlatans, The Great Society (later Jefferson Airplane), The Grateful Dead and others.<br />&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; came out in `66, and then &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; came out in `67...this sealed the deal.  Rock music was born.<br />How could you not own the CD &quot;Revolver&quot;?al Top-40 radio station!!  How can &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; with string quartets be played on-air alongside &quot;You Can't Hurry Love&quot; by the Supremes or &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; by Tommy James &amp; the Shondells.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Tired of the same old movies.  You know the ones I'm talking about...the ones with never ending fight scenes, or things blowing up left and right, the ones with lousy dialogue and bad timing, corny moments and underdeveloped characters.  Well, if you are - this is the movie for you.  <br />Creative, fresh, interesting, with as many twists and turns to keep you guessing and never for a minute regretting seeing this movie!  The acting is good, the directing is superior, and the plot keeps you on your toes.  <br />I don't want to give anything any but the gist is the central character has a unique form of amnesia - he cannot, no matter how hard he tries, make new memories due to a serious blow to the head.  He is trying to find his wife's killer...how he goes about this is the premise of this film.  He has discovered some very creative ways with which to tell himself how the investigation is going.  <br />One tip - the film is played out in an interesting way that can leave you dumbfounded at first, but once you get the hang of how the movie plays out it's easier to follow.  You may have to watch it twice before it all clicks into place!  <br />If you are a fan of twists and turns and an ending that mistifies - this is one to see!
B00005B1EX|4.0|I don´t know the amount of overdubs this live release received in the studios, but whateve it was, Halford hit the jackpot here, definitely.<br />The album is explosive, tight, strong. The band paly ferociously and with precision. The JUdas Priest tunes presented here shine as bright as ever, fresh. The Halford original´s also work very well.<br />It´s a live album with no, I repeat, NO weak spots, no fillers. Even fans like myself who were not familiarized with FIGHT will enjoin its songs. Amazing
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is one of Manson's greatest CD's. Antichrist Superstar was terrific also but this one is even better. My favorite songs are Dope Show, Coma White, Mechanical Animals, Rock is Dead. I am really sick of all of the people who judge him based by his looks and assume he is a Satanist. If you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, than why judge a CD by it's cover? Few people remember that it's his life, his choice and he chooses to enrich us with better music than the pop stuff that's going around like an epidemic lately. The CD is worth buying and will become one of your favorites hopefully. Rock on!
0345347951|5.0|Good books can open a reader's eyes and reveal a greater truth about the world he or she lives in.  Childhood's End goes a giant leap beyond that and opens the reader's eyes to the universe he or she is a part of.  For the most part we go through life day by day, dreaming of adventure but living a dull, eventless life.  For the first time in a long time, I was forced to think about how miraculous it is that we are here at all, and how mysterious the workings of time and the universe are.<br />More than anything else, this book made me wonder about our place in the universe.  Are we alone in the universe?  Or are we simply one of many races out there, and not very high on the totem pole at that? (the book compares humans to an &quot;Overmind&quot; the way we might compare an amoeba to us).  Either way, it makes the infighting we do amongst ourselves seem pretty pettty.<br />Childhood's End is not a complicated book, it certainly doesn't take long to read, but it is easily among the best works ever of science fiction.  I am amazed when I think that this book was written 50 years ago.  Change a few numbers and terms and this book could easily have been written today.  Given the fact that it was indeed written half a century ago, and that for the most part Clarke overestimated our accomplishments to date, it certainly puts things in perspective.  Here's to hoping that in real life, it doesn't take Overlords to put things in order on Earth!
B00005JKNC|5.0|I gave this one a pass when it was in the theater, and now I'm regretting it.  Not because it is so visually stunning that it has to be seen on the big screen, but because it deserved my attention (and the attention of others).  This is a very powerful and entertaining story in an unassuming wrapper.  But, the lack of Hollywood explosions and gratuitous sex have apparently made it virtually invisible to the movie-going public (myself included, I'm sorry to say).  This movie is about love, friendship, community, and personal integrity.  It's about doing the right thing, even when the potential consequences do not bear thinking about, and the potential rewards seem non-existent.  It's about quiet little heroes who do not win wars or pull children out of burning buildings.  It's about the kind of people that we like to pretend we are.  It forced me to take a good look at the man I see in the mirror every day.  And, for that alone, it would be worth the price of admission.
B00005J9M1|5.0|I traded in my original VERY disc (purchased in 1993 upon release) for the special remastered  \\"further listening\\" package - containing VERY and an additional disc of material from that same time period. Boy, was I in for a treat. Upon first spin, I felt like I had just unlocked some secret vault of hidden jewels. Some of the songs here blow me over.  Hey, Headmaster, Too Many People, Violence, Falling, Decadence, Absolutely Fabulous (with those nutty girls from the show), Euroboy, and Girls &amp; Boys make up an almost \\"lost\\" album - a rather credible one at that. I won't bore you all the accolades surrounding VERY, but will say you can do yourself a favor by upgrading your CD collection with the purchase of this version. If you're old enough to be familiar with VERY, then you are old enough to appreciate daft nuances dropped like cocktail napkins at this year's most special soiree. I'll be the first one to raise my hands in surprise support. These discs are priceless, timeless, superb songwriting. The melodies and rhythms soar and intertwine like distant celestial bodies clashing into some nebular harmony. The lyrics are postmodern satires of lives in play. Are you with me? Don't want to scare you off, just nudge and encourage past any hesitancy. Lowering the caution flag, I'm way too busy listening to mine to loan or share. I can't be bothered. I've already skipped breakfast, lunch, and dinner; so don't ask. Just speed off and buy your own copy. Find your own personal paradise. It's all right here - a spin or two away.
B00005JKG7|5.0|John Carpenter in his prime right after Halloween's huge success. What else can you say about this movie? The documentary is great on this DVD and i really enjoyed it. The movie looks good, it sounds good, it's a fun ghost story movie. It's finally on DVD and i'm a happy guy owning this. If you like Halloween or any John Carpenter movies this is definitely one to buy and add to your collection. The DVD version is long awaited and it's finally here. John Carpenter is a great film maker and this ranks up thier with Halloween, In the Mouth of Madness and The Thing.
B00000FCBC|1.0|The new covers are utterly horrible, denied of any credibility or passion, James vocals are all the same growling. And what about the picture of \\"THE METALLICATS\\"???!! This band died a long time ago. They just cant compose great stuff anymore. Theyre probably going to make joint singles and records with rap, country and boy bands soon!!
B000066NW0|4.0|I am tired of people giving this girl a hard time, yes this CD is not punk, though it does have some of that flavor, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Honestly I think that that is just a reaction to the fact that Avril gets played on the radio and MTV.  Look TRL isn't necessarily an anathema, ocassionly Carson Daily messes up and puts a talented person on. <BR>  Avril has an amazing voice, has that ever been said of Billy Joe, I think not.  While the lyrics on the album are a bit week her performance is heartfelt and very promising.  When the lyrics match her voice that will be a CD for the ages.  However that is not to say that this isn't a CD worth having, don't worry you don't have to tell your friends, you can just put it on at night in you room.
0962477060|1.0|I have been playing guitar for 20 years.  This book does not follow standard music theory, deciding instead to use nonstandard terms that the author invented.  This book will not help you become a better musician, and will not help you understand your finderboard.  It will help you memorize some patterns that you probably won't know the name for, or the application of.
B000069AUI|4.0|Chris Martin says that some of this album was inspired by 9/11.  So far this year, the two best albums of the year have hisotry with this tragedy.  Both Springsteen's &quot;The Rising&quot; and Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; are brilliant.  &quot;Politik&quot; is a defiant yet fitfull opening for this bands sophomore opening.  &quot;In my place&quot; touches anyone who has ever been in love.  &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face,&quot; is a catchy and purposeful offering to this album.  &quot;The Scientist&quot; is a below average sequel to &quot;TROUBLE&quot; from the Bands first album &quot;PARACHUTES.&quot;  However, the show-stopping surprise of the album is Track 5, Clocks.  This song is the 21st Century version of A Ha's &quot;Take on Me.&quot;  This song also owes U2 some debt.  Do yourself a favor and take sometime to absorb this albumn.  It is one of the best offerings of the year.
B000069CWE|5.0|This Cd is Awesome. No matter what anyone says this cd ROCKS! I love it and Listen to it right after I listen To Hybrid... Everyday! I recomend it to anyone cause it has all sorts of genres of music mixed in one: Hip hop, Techno, Rock, Mellow ect. This is one of thoses cds you have to buy no matter what anyone says just to own it!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Took My then 3 year old son to see this at the theatre.. Him and I both loved it. He actually sat through the whole thing. He's been asking too see it again for the past year. We will be buying this movie the day it is released. John Goodman and Billy Crystal are great together.
0452282152|4.0|...in the presence of her master, Vermeer. Beautifully done.  As rich, sweet, layered, and unsentimental as the master's masterpieces themselves.  So, Colin Firth will play Vermeer?  Smoldering, indeed.  Anyone know who has written, or is writing, the screenplay?
B00005JKES|2.0|I was unhappy with this version.  Too many scenes were deleted from the original episodes.  I higly recommend VHS.
B000002C1V|2.0|I bought The Final Cut when it came out and found it hard to listen to then, but recently I read a nice bio of the band and decided to give the record another shot. While I can appreciate the idea behind the album and find it lyrically interesting, the real problem is the music and the vocals. These have never been Roger Waters strong suit, and given his complete control of this album, it is now plain to see that his weakness in these areas sidetrack a good idea. In some cases the music seems like earlier songs off The Wall. When Roger sings the soft parts his voice works fine, but when then music builds his voice becomes brittle and its just too grating. Its too bad he and David Gilmour were not working as well on this album as they had on earlier Pink Floyd albums. As I listen to several of the cuts here I can just imagine Roger trading off to allow David to sing some of these parts and then we would really have something. Save this purchase until you have everything from \\"Meddle\\" to \\"The Wall.\\" Then you might give this a go.
0962477060|5.0|I found out about this instructional book ... I learned this book was a top selling instruction book at www.amazon.com. After reading all the reviews and the Authors interview ... I was compelled to buy this book. ... This book provides the learning environment that works for me. You start by learning about the CAGED system, which I think is absolutely necessary for learning guitar chords and scales. I can honestly say that I'm a much better player and knowledgeable player because of this book and I reference it everyday to review how well I know my chord and scale names at any position along the fretboard. The book is presented in a manner for left and right brain folk. Theory and verbage on one half of the page and illustrations and pictures/finger locations on the other half of the page. This simple and effective presentation and the way in which the author progressively moves a student forward in the process of learning guitar is absolutely the best aspect of this book. I've only gone thru part I of the book, and the only negative thing I can think of about this book is this. Now that I learned chords and scales all the way up and down the fretboard, where's the songs for me to learn and apply my new found knowledge. You will not find songs to learn in this book. This book teachs how to play guitar, not play songs. The authors reasoning for this is due to the many different tastes a student has for music. This book is only intended to help prepare a student to learn songs on their own. The only other thing I would recommend w/ this book as I would w/ anything is make your learning fun and enjoyable. Supplement what you learn in this book by taking what you know and finding your favorite easy songs and/or exercises to learn to play as well. Develop yourself a practice routine that includes chords, scales, lead patterns, and modes, from this book and allow time to learn new songs/exercises (finger picking/alternate picking exercises)and/or review songs already learned. I state that this book is for beginners only because I'm a beginner myself, but others ... have rated this book as suitable for any level of play.
6303920713|5.0|I watched this yesterday, and can't quite believe I never saw it when it came out... considering I'm a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan and of movies similar to this.  Maybe I was tired of THE PRINCIPLE and LEAN ON ME type movies at the time... nevertheless, this is an excellent movie with a very good message.  Basically through it all... no matter who you are, no matter what difficulties you face in your life, and no matter what cards are played to you... the fact is that you make your own choices.  By making your own choices, you choose the path of your own life... even if you give in and allow someone else to make those choices, that was your choice, too.<br />There's a lot of rough language, and rough characters... but a much more believable storyline than other movies of this same type.  It seems all it takes is one person to care to make a difference, where others may see no light.  Michelle Pfeiffer's character is that light... and if you've ever asked yourself &quot;what can one person do,&quot; this may be a very rewarding or enlightening movie for you - as it was for me.
B000069CWE|4.0|Well, I got this CD as soon as I saw it in Best Buy, and listened to it when I got home, wondering if they did as good as I hoped they would do. Well, they did great. But in comparing most of the remixes to the original, I have to say that Hybrid Theory was a much better album.<br />PTS.OF.ATHRTY had a different sound than the original; it sounds somewhat sci-fi. Seeing the video made it seem even more so. It also has a bit more of a hip-hop sound than it had. Overall Score- 8/10<br />ENTH E ND- Motion Man killed this song. I almost want to find out what he looks like so I can get somebody to arrest him on the streets for murder. The beat is changed, and sounds good, but the verse by Motion Man, and just about everything he says makes me want to just go to the next song. The last verse was the only thing that almost could've redeemed this song. Almost.<BR>Overall Score- 4/10<br />FRGT/10- The lyrics are changed a lot on this one, making it sound deeper, and all-around more thought-provoking. The verse by Chali 2na, unlike a few of the hip-hop verses on this CD, is actually good and goes along with the rest of the song. I actually like this better than the original!<BR>Overall Score- 9/10<br />P5HNG ME A*WY- The new lyrics at the beginning of this song, and the new chorus, make this sound different, but it sounds quite good. Overall very enjoyable to listen to, and it beats out the Hybrid Theory version, although I didn't like this song as much as some of the others on the CD.<BR>Overall Score- 6/10<br />PLC.4 MIE HAED- They redid the beats on this song, making them sound a little deeper, but removed the second verse and replaced it with a hip-hop verse that nearly ruins the song, as Zion speaks too fast for the tempo of the beat, and the words he says really don't make too much sense. I'm not too much of a hip-hop fan though, but Chali 2na did MUCH better on FRGT/10. In my opinion, this song is one of the least enjoyable on the CD.<BR>Overall Score- 3/10<br />X-ECUTIONER STYLE- Short, but really enjoyable. I love the way at the beginning it sounds like a part of Forgotten, but then fades into the SHUT UP! sound of One Step Closer. Black Thought's rap also is fun to listen too, and the way he makes it go back to the SHUT UP! chorus of the song is great.<BR>Overall Rating-7/10<br />H!VLTG3- I hate to give this song a bad review. I loved the original version, and the remix that was done after it, but the piano-jazz sound of this makes me skip this song most of the time I listen to the CD. The DJ Babu rap at the end doesn't help matters much either- not much of what he says makes that much sense.<BR>Overall Rating- 2/10<br />WTH>YOU- This remix carries the great rock sound the original had, and doesn't change too much of the original lyrics. It also adds a good verse near the end that brings the song together moreso than the original did.<BR>Overall Rating- 8/10<br />PPR:KUT- The beats of this beat out(no pun intended) the originals by making it have more of a creepy, deep sound to it. The lyrics are also more understandable. My only complaint is that the second verse of the original was replaced; it was my favorite part of the song. The hip-hop verse that replaces is is quite good though, and pulls the song together well.<BR>Overall Rating- 8/10<br />RN@WAY- Keeping much of the beats of the original, the lyrics are done over a bit, making the first part of the song better than the original. But the hip-hop verse near the end is simply bad. It doesn't keep in touch with the rest of the song.<BR>Overall Rating- 5/10<br />MY<DSMBR- The beats were redone with a more techno beat to it, and the lyrics weren't changed much. The addition of Kelly Ali is great; hearing a woman do some of the lyrics just adds a bit to the song.<BR>Overall Rating- 7.5/10<br />BY_MYSLF- The computerized new feel of the song makes it sound deeper than the original, and the chorus, although a bit hard to understand at times, is a great addition. The end of thesong, with the same words repeating, pulls it together quite well.<BR>Overall Rating- 9/10<br />KYUR4 TH ICH- Mr. Hahn does some nice techno beats, and although it doesn't sound, well, anything like the original, it's enjoyable to a point.<BR>Overall Rating- 6.5/10<br />1STP KLOSR- I love this remix. Jonathan Davis' verse adds a lot to the song, and it keeps the \\"SHUT UP!\\" part that I loved. The only problem with it, as with KRWLNG, is that it's too long until the lyrics really start.<BR>Overall Rating- 8.5/10<br />KRWLNG- Too much music at the beginning, but it's worth waiting for the song. Aaron Lewis doing the chorus is superb. The violin sound actually fits quite well to the rest of the song, and it makes a great finish to a great CD.<BR>Overall Rating- 8.5/10<br />So do I like it? Yes. Is it better than Hybrid Theory? Not to me. Is it worth buying for any LP fan? Definitely.
B000069CWE|3.0|I'm a huge linkin park fan and also like bands like metallica, iron maiden, and other heavy metal. Personally I HATE rap and hip-hop. Hybrid theory was just an unbeliveable cd and there wasn't a single song that I was disapointed with.<BR>   In reanimation there are some songs that are better than the original. But songs like xecutionar-style are all just rap from small town guys that are all snoop doggg wannabes. Also the amount of guests they have in each song gets annoying if you listen to the whole CD. I would have MUCH rather have just had a new CD with new songs, instead of just giving their computer a virus and seeing what it spits out. There are bits and pieces of some songs that are awsome and songs like pts of authrty are all around awsome.<BR>   Overall If your hooked on hybrid theory don't buy this cd chances are you will probably be pretty disapointed.
B00004RE7D|5.0|Star Trek III The Search for Spock is a wonderful, middle movie to the more or less trilogy of II, III and IV.  I was a little disappointed that Kirstie Allie couldn't pick up where she left off in the role of Saavik.  Robin Curtis does do a very good job though.  Christopher Lloyds Klingon Commander is absolutely Klingon through and through.  All of the original cast members are true to their characters.  Overall, Star Trek III is not the best of the original six, but it's most certainly not the worst either.  A wonderful story that, like all the rest, I've watched more times than I can remember.
B000050XEI|5.0|A year ago, I was completely &quot;enya&quot;gnorant...I had no idea who this wonderful artist was.  Then I heard &quot;Only Time,&quot; and I was instantly captivated and mesmerized.  My passion became a quest--a quest to find the artist and the CD that this single belonged to.  Last January, A DAY WITHOUT RAIN and I were united; I've been blissfully content ever since.<br />This CD is audio tranquility without peer, a soothing and relaxing respite from our frantic, frazzled world.  The music conjures up colorful images from days long past:  a minstrel in a king's hall, a maiden in a meadow.  As a devoted &quot;Tolkienite,&quot; I imagine hearing the voice of Enya singing softly in the background as I read about the grandeur of Rivendell, or the peaceful landscape of the Shire.  (And does it come as any surprise that Enya is on the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; soundtrack?)<br />A DAY WITHOUT RAIN cannot be recommended more highly, even from a burned-out ex-rocker like myself.  &quot;Deora Ar Mo Chroi&quot; has GOT to be music from Heaven itself!
B000002UB6|4.0|Let It Be was one of the first portrait albums that clearly defined a group of men who were changing and exploring other avenues of music. This album reflects on the past while struggling to move into the future. Although the album is quite sad at times and depressing the music can carry the listener to a new realm. Although tracks like Two of Us, Maggie Mae and Dig It throw this album way off track, the album holds together fairly well. Many tracks have been reExplored such as One After 909 and Across the Universe. The Long and Winding Road, and Across the Universe are two tracks that would not have had the same emotional potentcy if they had not had Phil Spector's touch. Hard to believe Paul would object to his &quot;tampering&quot; of this beautiful number. In the end this album is therapy and joy, a timeless masterpiece for all to enjoy.
B000063V8S|3.0|I bought this set at (...) and had a problem with disk one during the episode, Brothers.  The picture would freeze and then jump forward in the episode.  In order to eliminate the possibility that it was my player, I played the other disks and found the same locations on layer 1 on each, but the others played fine.  I exchanged the set for a new one and encountered the exact same problem on disk 1 with the exact same episode.  I again played several other disks, finding the same points on the same layer, but had no problem.  (...)
B00000JPH4|5.0|True, the quest story is as old as mankind, but here it is told in such a cinematically captivating and charming manner that this movie remains in a class of its own. You'll find a spectacular array of creatures and marvelous twists in the plot. One of my favorite scenes is where the two Gelflings fall over a cliff, the girl spreads her wings, the boy says: \\"But I don't have wings\\" to which the girl replies: \\"Of course not - you're a boy.\\" The fact is that all the species come across as very real and believable - from the kindly and wise Mystics to the human Podlings to the awful and hideous Skeksis. The meal scene in the Skeksis castle is particularly vivid and memorable, although it's not for the squeamish! The visit to the lair of the witch Ogra is also quite humorous and spectacular, and I loved the little doggie, if it is a dog. This is in the class of [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy]] exactly 20 years before the latter was made, although it's probably not fair to compare the two. For one thing, Dark Crystal convinces with its world of believable puppets, which adds a unique flavor to the film. I cannot fault this little gem on any aspect: the old myth is infused by new life here because of the marvelous turns in the plot, the scenes are so colorful you cannot forget them, the characterization is of the highest caliber, and the cinematography is breathtaking.
B0000257YN|5.0|There's something for everyone on this CD. Beautiful ballads, hot dance-songss, Latin songs and R 'n B songs.<BR>If you had my love: Her first single is a mix of R n'B and Pop.

B00005AQF7|5.0|This has to be Snoop Dogg's best album.  The only other Snoop album that even compares to it is Tha Last Meal.  This album is now a classic.  The best songs on this album are Loddi Doddi, Murder was the Case, What's my Name, Ain't no Fun, and of course my favorite Gin & Juice.  So get ou there and buy this if you don't already have it.  Go ahead and buy the censored version to show your kids what rap really is.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|Far and away one of the most overrated movies of the last few years.<br />Good acting, terrible script and music; very predictible (in fact cliched).  There are far better movies of this type out there.
B0000214F0|3.0|Some describe CALIGULIA as \\"the\\" most controversial film of its era.  While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it.  Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence.  What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.<br />For a while it looked like it might.  CALIGULA was a major box-office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all), and although the film was released on VHS to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re-edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade.  But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited \\"R\\" and original \\"Unrated\\" versions.  And no doubt Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen.<br />The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE by way of Fellini having an off day.  Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars--and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought in soft-porn director Tinto Brass.  Then, when Guccione felt Brass' work wasn't explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly.<br />Viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about, but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination.  There is a tremendous amount of nudity, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is very explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a grand orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in for good measure.  The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture, and mutilation the order of the day.  In one particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs.<br />In the accompanying documentary, Guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome.  If so, he missed the mark.  We know very little about Caligula--and what little we know is questionable at best.  That aside, orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of Roman society, where adultry was an offense punishable by death.  And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, slightly Oriental, oddly space-age sets and costumes offered by the designers.<br />On the plus side, those sets and costumes are fantastically beautiful, and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice; the score is also very, very good.  The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in reasonably good form.  The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with.  As for the DVD itself, the film is presented in its original ratio, but the term \\"restored\\" applies to previously censored scenes, not to the film itself, and the quality is so-so.  An unintentionally hilarious documentary is also included on the disk.<br />My final thoughts: the movie does possess a dark fascination, but ultimately it is an oddity, more interesting for its design and flat-out weirdness than for content.  Some of the bodies on display (including McDowell's)are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography... but then again, some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstenance, and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism.  If you're up to it, it is worth seeing once, but onceis likely to be enough.  I suggest you rent it first.is likely to be enough.  I suggest you rent it first.
0452282152|5.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier<br />Inspired by a painting by Dutch artist Vermeer, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is a fictional account of how this famous painting came to be.   Just as Johannes Vermeer painted this anonymous girl back in the 1660's, author Tracy Chevalier painted a beautiful picture of the world of 17th century Holland and the world of this young girl who eventually becomes the subject of one of his paintings.  <br />Ms Chevalier's story starts with the introduction of Griet, a young teenage girl who lives with her parents and younger sister in a very humble home in the town of Delft.  She is helping chop vegetables in their kitchen when her parents receive a visit from two stately looking guests.  Griet finds out soon enough that this couple is Johannes Vermeer the painter, and his lovely wife Catharina.  Johannes notices how Griet is separating the vegetables by color and his observation does not go unnoticed by Griet.  This first brief encounter between them is the spark that starts their new \\"relationship\\".<br />Griet learns then that she is expected in a few days to start working for the Vermeers as their maid.  Griet's father is no longer able to work due to an accident he had on the job, and now it is up to Griet to help the family out.  Her older brother has already left home, and is learning to make a living at what their father used to do: Make tiles. <br />A few days later, Griet is living with the Vermeer's and their children and servants.  They live lavishly for these times, and Griet soon becomes accustomed to her new life.  She returns on weekends to visit her family, but she has to stay with the Vermeers during the workweek. <br />Griet has many duties as a maid, including doing the laundry and helping out with the children.  She slowly bonds with the children, all except Cornelia, who seems to be a trouble maker and tries her best to get Griet into trouble with her parents.  This becomes especially evident when, for somereason, Johannes decides to make Griet his assistant, on top of all the duties Griet has to perform as their maid.  Because of Catharina's jealousies, his wife is not to know about this special role that Griet was about to play in the house.  With the help of Catharina's mother, Griet finds ways to secretly help Johannes \\"grind\\" his colors and do other necessary things to help him prepare for painting, in the hopes that Catharina doesn't find out.  <br />Griet falls in love with his paintings, and with him.  And soon, all she can think about is him.  Since she is now his special assistant, she is privy to his private world of painting, a world that even Catharina is not allowed to trespass.  Through the eyes of Griet the reader sees how Vermeer created his beautiful works of art, using a creation that was the forerunner of today's camera.  A new world opens up for Griet. Because of this, Griet also knows that she is headed towards danger of losing her job.  <br />GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING in my opinion was a literary work of art.  Maybe I was heavily influenced by the cover, which depicts the actual painting of this girl that Vermeer made famous back in the 17th century.  Regardless of the reason, I personally enjoyed this fictional tale of the creation of one of Holland's most famous paintings of the renaissance era.
0316666343|3.0|Lighten up!  This is a good story, fun to read and easy to put down. I finished it in 3 hours with a cup of tea and a scone. If you want to get into theological arguments over a summer book, I think its a big waste of time. It is pretty well written and the characters are good enough that I cried a couple times.<br />However, there was material here for a longer book with more plotting and deeper characterization - the plot is pretty linear. I also wished that there had been a bit more justice in this book, but then I am a long time reader of murder mysteries...so I kept expecting the detective to figure something out.<br />Lots of fun and should be read for fun. The ending was a bit much and I would have preferred for the protaganist to be more 'hands off'. If I had a second chance on earth, I don't think I would have done what she did, but hey...its a summer novel!
B00006AW2J|5.0|If you are reading this, you are probably already familiar with the fantastic music on this disc. You already know it is one of the greatest albums released by the Stones. You are probably wondering if the remastering job justifies buying a new copy of the disc when you already own a copy. I suggest you buy this album. You will love it. Then, you can also compare this to the original ABKO release to see if you want to buy any more of the remasters. Personally, I found the sound to be incredible. However, I did not do a disc-to-disc comparison with my original.
B000001IQH|3.0|There are some great, catchy, anthemic songs on here. Beyond that, there just isn't anything of merit. It's not just that Rancid has been done in the past (better), or that their songs are disposable, or that any real punk fan has moved on to purer, better, older things, or that they come off more as poseurs than anything else, or that this album is overcrowded with the same songs, or even that the hype surrounding this band is hazy and overpowering. It's all of those things put together. Rancid just can't live up. They've got a great punk band name though.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Without a doubt, this is one of the cutest movies that I have ever seen.  Disney once again puts out one of the finest DVD's on the market in this soon to be classic.  My children can't stop watching it.<br />Monsters, Inc. is the factory that runs the \\"Monster World\\" and it is powered by the screams of children all over the world.  The imaginative factory allows the employed monsters to enter the child's room through an elaborate system of doors.  All is going well until the loveable James P. Sullivan (Sulley), played by John Goodman, inadvertantly allows a small child into the factory.  The place is turned upside down in search of the small girl, as children are believed to be toxic and dangerous, but through the ordeal, Sulley learns a great deal about children, and more importantly himself.<br />The film is masterfully done with state-of-the-art digital picture and sound, not to mention a wonderfully witty dialogue and whimsical plot.  MONSTERS, INC. has a super cast as John Goodman and Billy Crystal are absolutely fabulous, and their timing together couldn't be better.  Throw in the devilishly evil Steve Buscemi and experience of James Colburn just to mention a few, and you have an amazingly interesting group of characters.<br />This 2-Disc Collector's edition is loaded with bonus features.  The movie, itself, can be viewed in the full screen version which was specifically reframed for standard televisions, or in the widescreen version which is digitally enhanced for 16X9 televisions.  Another nice feature is the all-new short animated film, MIKE'S NEW CAR, which was created exclusively for the DVD, as well as the extremely funny outtakes and never-before-seen deleted scenes.  There are a few games on the second DVD, including the adorable \\"Peek-A-Boo\\" Door game that will keep you guessing for hours, as well as \\"Rock-Paper-Scissors\\" with Mike and Sulley.  I think my children have played this a thousand times!  Other bonuses include a look at the \\"Monstopolis Art Gallery,\\" a behind-the-scene's look at the making of the \\"If I Didn't Have You,\\" and \\"For the Birds,\\" the 2001 Oscar winner for Best Animated Short Film.<br />Overall, this is an outstanding DVD that is perfect for the entire family.  The film, alone, is worth the price of the DVD, but with all of the extras added in, MONSTERS, INC. easily becomes a real bargain.  This is a \\"can't miss.\\"
B000002H6C|4.0|The only real problem with this album, which has been harped on constantly in past reviews, is the admittedly odd production which only really becomes apparent when you turn the bass right up. Was it a mistake? Surely not. Metallica and Flemming Rasmusson were no amateurs at the production game, evidenced by their 2 perfect previous releases. Was it intentional? If so, why? I don't know, and I certainly can't judge whether or not it detracts from the overall quality of the album in that it's impossible for me to picture it any other way. Can you honestly tell me that the S&M version of \\"One\\" is superior? Give me a break. It just adds to the angry, complex mystique.<br /> There isn't a weak second on this album. While \\"Master of Puppets\\" was superior in terms of it's sheer, head-banging, foot-tapping metal perfection, \\"...And Justice For All\\" is just as good in strikingly different ways. Deliciously complex chord-structures, breakneck and frequently fluxing time signatures and the James/Kirk interplay is superior to all their albums before or since. And yet it's all done in such a cold, barren way that it's so utterly unique. The closest this album veers to emotion is the gritted-teeth eulogy to their tragically departed friend Cliff in \\"To Live Is To Die\\" which is only made more powerful by the cold acceptance and exploration to all things melancholy layered around it.
B0000021S9|4.0|Recorded during a tour of Japan in support of their fifth album, this double CD live recording contains most of the essentials from Chicago's first five albums.<br /><br />The set opens with material mostly from Chicago V, including Dialogue, Parts I and II, a Hit By Varese, Saturday in the Park, and State of the Union, with guitarist Terry Kath sounding phenomenal on the latter. The band's first album, Chicago Transit Authority, is well represented, with strong renditions of Questions 67 and 68 (sung in Japanese), Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is and Beginnings, while Ballet For a Girl In Buchanan (the seven-song suite featuring Color My World and bracketed at the start and finish by the hit single Make Me Smile), from Chicago II, never sounded so good. A 10-minute version of 25 or 6 to 4 features another stellar Kath solo, and the CD's finale showcases Peter Cetera on bass and Danny Seraphine on drums on a medley of I'm a Man and Free.<br /><br />The sound quality is rather poor in comparison to the Carnegie Hall album, but the band is tighter and sounds more confident. All in all, a great trip back to the 70s when this band, with its original lineup, knew how to rock and roll.
B00002MZ2C|2.0|Like every other Rage album, but weak. And weak is not something Rage should have been even for a moment. And Morello becomes less of a guitarist all the time.
B000069AUI|5.0|As much as I loved Coldplay's debut album, Parachutes, I strongly felt that they could top it quite easily. Their debut demonstrated remarkable songwriting skills and a gift for melody, but suffered from a simplistic, almost narcoleptic sound and the occasional overblown ballad ('Everything's Not Lost' in particular).  It turns out that I was right, because their sophomore release tops Parachutes by a landslide in every facet. From the incessant drum beat and haunting coda of 'Politik', it immediately becomes apparent that this is not merely an extension of Parachutes. Coldplay have inherited a much more orchestrated, eclectic and energetic sound without sacrificing their tuneful ear. If anything, Coldplay proves that it is possible to make superior rock music with little emphasis on guitar, as wonderful piano work dominates the entire album. My favourite songs include the heavenly 'God Put A Smile Upon Your Face', the Beatles-esque ballad 'The Scientist', the ear-tickling piano of 'Clocks' and the syncopated, hypnotic 'A Whisper'. If there is a weak spot, I'd say it is the first single 'In My Place', simply because it is the only song that doesn't really demonstrate the band's incredible growth from their last CD. If you liked Parachutes, then you'll stick with this CD for weeks. A strong candidate for album of the year.
B00005N53P|5.0|This is one of the best albums that I have purchased this year. Every song is amazing! It is a fun album that is really catchy, and the music is fantastic. Great drumming, excellent guitar playing, and a very cool lead singer. What more could you want! My favourite songs are Alone Together, Trying Your Luck and the Modern Age. Buy this album now you won't be disappointed!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|one of the most stylisticly interesting films i've ever seen.  It explores the illusion of happiness, and hope in a hopless world.  the imagry will be shocking to alot of viewers.  but it is still a very well done movie.  dont watch it alone, or you might get nightmares.
0805062971|5.0|WOW! WOW! WOW! This book jumped up a punched me in the face. It completely changed my life. After reading it you will never see things the same again. I love all of Chuck's book's but this is my favourite, and it is also the first one that I read. I read the book before I saw the movie. I love the book, I love the movie. They are both amazing pieces of work.
0345350499|3.0|A good book, if enormously depressing, but the legions of small-minded &quot;pagan&quot; girls that use this as their bible really grate on me in real life. It's a book. It's just a book. It's not even &quot;how it really was on Avalon&quot;. It's a good story, but it's a story.<br />Never in my entire life have I slammed a book by complaining about its fans. I do it here because the fans are so annoying, and they're so much a part of the Internet. Where are the rabid Darkover fans? I'd much rather deal with them than the insane fans of this book.<br />If you can read it and not take it too seriously, then good! I fully recommend you read it, if you can make it through the 800 pages. If you can't, perhaps you'd be better off concentrating on the real world until you're grown up enough to handle this book.
B00005QAPH|5.0|This the best portrait of an artist's mind ever made in Cinematic terms. Fellini captured the true whirlwind of ideas, fantasies, desires, evocations, memories and nightmares of a film director (in this case, Mastroianni) who suffers from a blank in the middle of his will-be next film.<br />This is a film where Fellini uses himself as the primary source for his character with beautiful evocations of his own childhood and all the characters that populate his mind.<br />Constructed against the idea of a plot, the film goes deeper and deeper into the main character's mind allowing Fellini do display his true command of the images.<br />Beautifully shot in B&W it is incredible how Fellini and his cameraman arrange all the elements inside the frame - resulting in shots that are not found anywhere else. Every shot is a masterpiece of image composition that only DVD can do justice to.<br />This CRITERION edition is vastly superior to all other versions of this film. Not only it provides top quality on the film itself, but also a huge amount of valuable extras. The comentary is key to understanding the \\"whys\\" and \\"hows\\" of the Fellini universe. But there are also photos, interviews, a Fellini's short, a documentary, etc.<br />A true masterpiece from a master director.
B0000057C5|3.0|So you live in Alabama and you don't speak german. It's Ok. Rammstein speaks the international language of great music. So the lyrics are supposed to be dark and dirty. What you don't know can't hurt you, right? Anyway, this is a really good metal/industrial album with a few lighter/melodic songs too. It's the perfect disc to put on while having a Heineken and bratwurst with Heidi. And if you don't like it, you can schlobbin ze nobben.
B000007T1M|4.0|This one is too far paced. Teh songs are all distorted. Unlike with their next record &quot;Toxicity&quot; they really don't find their niche.<br />But it is still a damn good album.<br />All the opening tracks are good. but as you get passed the middle (Track 8) it starts to confuse you a little. Peephole is a great song. So is P.L.U.C.K.<br />And of course Sugar and Spiders, but they are not the best songs on here. I think personally the best two tracks are &quot;Suggestions&quot; and &quot;Soil&quot;. definitely worth checking out.
0553274503|4.0|A friend of my mom's in France sent me this book quite a long time ago. It sat on my shelf for months before I finally picked it up to read it - and by the time I got to the second or third page I didn't want to put it down. I finished it that same afternoon.<br />This book is amazing because the author has the talent to use the journal format in a very effective way. Not many people can do that. Usually I find that style rather dull - but here it is outstanding. Through first person you step into Charly's shoes. As things dawn on him, they dawn on you. Some parts are humourous and most are touched with a bit of pathos, because you know that any minute all he has gained is going to go. And when he goes - you go with him.<br />It's very sad and moving overall and I was so affected by it that I didn't want to even talk to anyone for several hours after finishing it. I just kept thinking about the story.<br />It's definitely a classic and I think everyone should read it.
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is the sh-t. I love this album. Everything on this one is great. Best songs though<br />Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, Chop Suey!, Forest, ATWA (best song), Shimmy, Toxicity, and Aerials.<br />a damn good album. better than their first record, by far.<br />check this one out. one of the best from 2001, if not the best.
B000068TPN|5.0|I watched this movie twice in one evening. I seldom do such stupid things as staying up 'tiil 1 AM watching movies , but this was exceptional! Seeing Sam Elliot's portrayal of the Sergeat-Major of the 1/7 opened the floodgates of my memories of almost 30 years ago. When I served in the Army , I knew a few old senior enlisted men like that. Salty. That is the correct word to describe such people. A look. Manner of speech. No BS!<br />Mel Gibson's portrayal of Lt. Col. Moore raised my already high opinion of his acting ability. Some compare the performance to Braveheart ; this was better. <br />I have seen most-if not all-of the Vietnam war films ; this is unquestionably the best. My highest recommendation.
0345340426|5.0|Anyone who dares to call himself a reader, or better yet, a learned reader, should therefore be intelligent enough to recognize the sheer genius of `The Lord of the Rings'.    To say nothing of the symbolism and subtle incorporation of humanistic themes, there is the author's obvious skill and knowledge of Norse/Gaelic mythology, German history and linguistics, particularly Old and Middle English. How many authors today are that learned?    This book reads like a more charming version of ancient history. From a factual standpoint, it is so thoroughly complete, expanded and detailed, that it is quite possible to make a career of studying Middle-earth and its inhabitants. No, delete that...There actually ARE professors who have devoted themselves to the study of Tolkien.    And why shouldn't they? Who else but Tolkien could have incorporated beautiful prose into a book aimed for children, have it read in so appealing a manner as to grant it international success...And then manage to write a \\"sequel\\" that outshines the first?    \\"The Hobbit\\", an innocuous work for the 1950's Harry Potter demographic, unleashed hobbits upon the world. When readers begged for more, Tolkien did not write a [inexpensive] companion that would have robbed his brilliant ideas of their potential. Instead, he took 12 years to connect 'The Hobbit' with 'The Silmarillion', marrying the innocence and childlike beauty of the former, to the epic scope and near biblical prose of the latter, to create 'The Lord of the Rings'.    What makes 'The Lord of the Rings' works is its ability to appeal to any type of reader: Those who look for fantasy may find it, as do those who look for real romance, those who seek action and adventure, and oftentimes, the simple reader who wishes to believe once again that in a fight between good and evil, good will reign.    And what makes 'The Lord of the Rings' still dominate the fantasy genre after half a century, is its originality. I do not mean Tolkien's creation ofhobbits, or his concept of a ring of power. I mean that Tolkien was the first author to write a work about such foreign concepts and beings, set in a foreign world with foreign cultures on such a grand scale, and yet allow the smallest reader to feel that they are a part of that story. It is the simplicity of 'The Lord of the Rings', its accessibility to any reader, that gives this book its popularity.    I read this book through the month of December. During the Christmas holidays, I finished 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King'. Sometimes I wish I could go back and read it for the first time again, for nothing comes close to the first time I put down that third installment, my heart breaking into thousands of shards, and tears flowing as if there were no tomorrow. Nothing compares to how I felt when I first realized the story was over. Truly over. The ending is not bittersweet; bittersweet is a chocolate you can't decide tastes good. The ending is sweet agony.    Readers should know by now not to expect the usual fantasy drivel from Tolkien. If they do, then they have been living under a rock in an enclosed camp of ignorance.    In my opinion, if a reader derives no pleasure from `The Lord of the Rings', it is purely the fault of the reader, not the book. You cannot blame the book if you are too illiterate to understand its beautiful prose, or too short-minded to read anything that does not offer gory battles within the first few paragraphs. It is not Tolkien's fault that few \\"readers\\" these days have the ability, or the desire, to understand any literature that is not predictable or formulaic. Sadly, the days of people who could read and appreciate Shakespeare and Hemingway are passing; as they pass, so does the ability for the current generations to appreciate works such as this.    `The Lord of the Rings' is the supreme achievement of the fantasy genre; of fiction; of literature. To know 'The Lord of the Rings', to understand it, to enjoy it, to shareit, and to love it, is to enrich the very part of you that dares to believe in anything.
0060506989|4.0|This was an exceptionally difficult book for me to read--not for the content or writing style--but for the subject covered. Vietnam was almost \\"my\\" war. I served in the Army at the onset of hostilities in 1964 , and lost many good friends there.<br />Many other reviewers have panned the detailed style of the authors ; I view the book as highly descriptive. I am not critical of style if the content is there , and in this case it IS! If a reader wishes to be \\"entertained\\" , then this is not the right book. The movie is much more compelling on an entertainment scale.<br />What does come through the dryly written text , however , is the belief of Hal Moore in the \\"duty , honor , country\\" aspect of military service. I felt a strong bond to him through the integrity he has displayed towards the men under his command. I , for one , would have felt honored to serve with/under him on the field of battle.<br />There are alot of other Vietnam war books that are much more excitingly written , but none of them describe a greater triumph of the American soldier under fire than this one. If you really want to know \\"what happened\\" , this is a must read.
B00004U3UG|5.0|Army of Darkness is probably the funniest/wierdest/coolest movies I have ever seen! Directed & Co-Written by Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead Series, Spider-Man, DarkMan) \\"Army of Darkness\\" has remained one of my most favorite films of all time. The film has every element of a great movie: Commedy, Action, Rommance, Horror, and a wonderful main character played by Bruce Campbell. This film is technically the third in the \\"Evil Dead\\" series although it doesnt require you to have seen the original two. That is always a good thing for a sequel. The story of \\"Army of Darkness\\" begins when Ash, a wise-cracking sales clerk from S-Mart accidentally awakens an evil force by reading passages from the Neconomican, also known as \\"The Book of thw Dead.\\" Bent on getting rid of Ash for good, the evils from the book send Ash back to the Middle Ages along with his '73 Oldsmobile. Now he needs to find a way back to his own time and lead the people around him against the evil Army of Darkness. The music in the film is one of it's strongest assests. Composed by Joseph LoDuca, the scrore pulls you right into the atmosphere of the film. Also Danny Elfman composed the \\"March of the Dead\\" theme which adds some variety to the score. One this thats very unique about this film is how many different DVD editions have been released for it. There is the Theatrical Version, The Special Edition (with the original ending), The Director's cut (with 15 minutes of cut footage), and a Bootleg Edition which is the same as the Director's Cut just lower quality. Since the Director's Cut version was limited to only 40,000 copies, its pretty hard to find it anymore. If you are a real Army of Darkness fan I would suggest getting the Theatrical Version and the Bootleg Version. The theatrical version has the ending used in theaters and the Bootleg Edition has the original ending which is much more suitable for the film but not as fun. You can see both endings and all the extra features you can possibly find with these two Editions. So, if you've read this far you're probably pretty interested in this movie so get out there and buy it! ...

B000002V0Q|4.0|This is a very good straight metal album, but is nothing more than that. However, Metallica Jr., err, Megadeth, has never been, and will never be in even the same ballpark as Metallica, much less superior too them, and you should all realize that anyone who says otherwise is in the extreme minority...  Still, that aside, this album is certainly an enjoyable listen, even if it is no where near as good as The Black Album(which it is a stunning rip-off of, by the way), and is certainly nowhere near as good as the Mid to Late-80's stuff by Metallica. It also isn't as good as their previous album, Rust In Peace.<br />This isn't really a thrash-metal album anymore, just a straight metal album, which IS NOT a sell-out, by the way. They do kick it up to a decent speed on a couple of the songs, but most of the time it is fairly mid-paced.  The loss of speed aside, this is a album is quite different from Rust In Peace in a number of other ways. Rust In Peace was overrun with dozens of solos, and unconventional song structures throughout. Most of the songs on Extinction are of the basic rock song formula, and though it still has quite a few solos, it has nowhere near as many as Rust In Peace. This isn't entirely a bad thing, as I think Rust In Peace occasionally over did it with the soloing. The guitars are also a bit bassier and more ominous than they were before, though they still are a bit light on some of the songs, especially since Megadeth has always relied less on straight power-chord riffing than the other thrash bands. Mustaine's vocal style remains essentially the same as before, which is too bad as he really isn't much of a vocalist, but the intruments are good enough that this really isn't too much of a problem. Lyrically, this is the best Megadeth album I've heard. It is generally maturely and fairly intelligently written, with the exception of Psychotron, which is stunningly dumb, and High-Speed Dirt, which is fairly dumb.<br />Song-wise, this album is fairly consistent until the last quater or so, at which point it loses much of it's momentum. They are all at least decent songs, but the end is definitely weaker than the rest. Skin 'O My Teeth, the opener, is arguably the strongest song on the album, and is one of the faster, thrashier songs, with a good chorus. Symphony of Destruction and This Was My Life are two of the other major stand-outs from the album, though the first 7 songs are all strong.(With the exception of the verses of Sweating Bullets, which are quite annoying, but the chorus is good enough to redeem it) Captive Honour is probably the best track of the relatively weak final couple of tracks, despite having a screwed up, half spoken part towards the beginning of it. Psychotron is the only really weak song, and it isn't too bad.<br />So, all in all, this is good, straight-forward, and highly conventional heavy metal. Thus, it isn't really brilliant, and it sure as hell isn't Metallica, but it is still worth the money of any Metal fan, presuming he isn't an underground psycho who thinks that anything that isn't self-conciously anti-commercial is a sell-out.sistent until the last quater or so, at which point it loses much of it's momentum.

B00005UEAR|5.0|GREAT ALBUM!!! Highly recommended, the music and lyrics are awesome as always and the second disc (the sixth degree) is mind blowing.  Excellent compositions going on there --- they did a great job.  Buy this now.
B000066744|5.0|The first time I stumble across this movie on the Independent Film Channel (15 minutes into the movie) I thought, hmm... this reminds me of the Titanic (yes, I mean *the* megahit \\"Titanic\\" movie).<br />The similarity is uncanny... Same era, same piers/docks, same ship model/size/interior style/number of smoke-stacks/coal burning engines/grand ballroom/third-class cabins/first-class cabins. The story is even similarly unfolded as a narrated flashback scenes.<br />Can't really explained it, but somehow I stop myself from switching to a different channel because something tells me that this movie is better than the Titanic. I have to tell you, *that* was a good decision.<br />This movie is more satisfying than the Titanic.<br />You can read other reviewer's synopsis about the story, I'd like to point out the stuff that amazes me. First of all, the music is gorgeous... some jovial, some grand, some sweet, a couple... haunting. Second, the movie does an excellent job in portraying the 1900 character as a piano genius that draws inspiration for his music from what he observed... in real-time! In one of the memorable scenes, he literally changes his music as he looks at different people on the ship. Third, the character's view of the world is... \\"interesting\\", and I guarantee that you'll talk about it long after the movie ended.<br />You don't have to be a pianist to appreciate this film, but for those of you who plays piano, all of the piano scenes in this movie are well-executed (there're a lot of them), I was hard-pressed to spot that the actor is \\"faking\\" it. As I learned later on, one of the actors is actually a well-known jazz musician. Some of the scenes are really imaginative and really \\"smoking\\".<br />Finally, seeing this movie really deepen my appreciation for independent moview. This movie feels like a fresh breeze from the ocean compared to the cookie-cutter type Hollywood movies. Like one of the characters said:<BR>\\"...It's not immense, but it's worth the effort...\\"
B000069AUI|5.0|To think &quot;Parachutes&quot; was one of the best albums that came out in the new millennium.  Here's another gem from the same band!  &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is simply beautiful.  Can't stop listening to it.  There's not a single song I want to skip.  And may I add the fellas are one burning live band.  They're electric!  Get a copy of their new record and catch them live in your city!
B00000F14B|5.0|If you can't bear to watch your preschooler's favorite Disney &quot;classic&quot; one more time, may I suggest a trip to River City?  This is a great first &quot;real&quot; musical for young kids - a bit longer than the animated flicks, but you can always FF to the next of the many wonderful songs when the native gets restless.  My three-year-old loved the patter songs, Hermione Gingold's better-than-a-cartoon character and the rowdy choreography.
0609610570|1.0|As an avid reader of management and strategy books and articles, from this book I expected to gain many insights into effective implementation of business critical projects.  Unfortunately what I read in Bossidy's book comes across as common sense and/or tried and tested management strategies.  I honestly cannot say I came across anything new or overly interesting in this book.  Jack Welch's text tells many interesting 'stories' along the way to describing how things get done at GE...if you are tossing a  coin I'd suggest you go for Welch's book instead (and Welch's profits are going to charity...).
0380789035|5.0|On September 1, this book became the surprise winner of the Hugo Award for best novel of 2001. Given what books it beat out for that award, that's a high recommendation indeed. I myself haven't read it yet, but it's now high on my list. Amazon.com forces me to give it some number of stars, and there's rarely a Hugo winner that doesn't deserve five, hence the recommendation.
B00006F7IM|5.0|After years of complaining, Major League is finally getting it's DVD. This movie is a brilliant portrayal of baseball in the 1980's. All the characters in the movie are very realistic and seem to shadow actual baseball players. Don't let the 80's references get to you, or Charlie Sheen's haircut. Anybody who has not seen this, rent it, no buy it. NOW!! It is that good.
6305171769|2.0|Well, when I first saw this movie, I was assuming it was picking up where the sixth one left off.  That made little sense to me.  Why would Laurie Strode fake her death and leave behind her little daughter as prey for her crazy brother?  Kinda selfish, to say the least.  Then I understood what \\"20 years later\\" implied.  When watching this movie, you have to pretend that everything after the sequel doesn't exist.  Laurie Strode is living somewhere else now with her teen son.  She assumes that her dear brother Michael has no idea where she is.  Fool!  Michael knows everything.  Lots of blood and carnage follow.  This movie is OK as a horror genre flick.  I liked it better than the sixth one.
B000069AUI|4.0|I like 'refreshing' as an adjective for Coldplay's music.  The new cd, like 'Parachutes,' offers something a little different in today's pop/rock menu...  This really is great song writing -- understated, melodic music, insightful lyrics, a very mature vibe in the vein of Radiohead, Dave Matthews Band, and U2, but with its own unique flair.  You recognize Coldplay when you hear them.  That alone makes them distinct in the popular music scene.<br />As for the cd, it's a bit deeper than 'Parachutes.'  It's got the same quiet feel, but there seems to be more happening in the songs, more depth to the arrangements, more instruments, including a lot of piano.  It's more upbeat, too.  The drummer has more to do on this disc than the previous, which is nice.  The songs are subtle and very catchy, and fans of their debut will definitely not be disappointed.  Overall a superb offering by a band that has earned its stardom by bucking the sludge trend and striking out on its own course.  Pick it up!
B00005RFAI|2.0|Pink swears that she's freed herself from her r&amp;b flavored debut &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot; and is now doing material of her choosing.  But when it gets right down to it, &quot;M!zzundaztood&quot; is just as contrived as her last record, and probably even more so with her dubious &quot;I've-gone-punk-now&quot; stance.  No doubt, there are a handful of good songs here, such as the single &quot;Get the Party Started.&quot;  But she elevates herself to a pedestal above Britney Spears on the supremely irritating and self-absorbed &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me.&quot;  And while Dallas Austin makes a welcome impression on the album, her choice of Linda Perry (of 4 Non Blondes fame) is questionable.  All in all, it's not a terrible album, but it's a shallow, borderline one.  With a couple more albums under her belt, maybe P!nk can earn our respect for her as an original artist.
B0000696I1|5.0|Not as good as the first two, but a worthy buy nonetheless. Interesting twists as the Turtles take on new advisaries and certain hilarity usually welcome and adored by Turtle fans.<br />Look forward to John Woo's CG adaptation of TMNT. Visit [URL] for more info.
B00004RHZU|3.0|Before she changed her sound on &quot;M!zzundaztood,&quot; P!nk released &quot;Can't Take Me Home,&quot; which had the top 10 single &quot;There You Go,&quot; a catchy &quot;I-just-dumped-you&quot; song that's typical, of-the-moment r&amp;b.  It's what we've come to expect from the songwriting/production team of Shekespere and Kandi, who have a flair of writing relationship-oriented songs for the Ricki Lake camp.  Elsewhere on the album, we're treated to trendy, overproduced r&amp;b that reveals almost nothing beneath their sheen.  &quot;Most Girls,&quot; produced by Babyface, is the best of the bunch, but elsewhere, it's pretty much &quot;been there, heard that.&quot;  She may call herself &quot;Pink,&quot; but the lack of personality on this otherwise servicable CD suggests a far more bland color.
6302642256|4.0|I have nostalgic memories from watching this film as a kid in the eightees.  Along with &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; and &quot;ET: the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, this was one of my favorite sci-fi films.  The concept of aliens and UFOs fascinated me.  Unfortunately, it seems to have fallen out of circulation.  Luckily I was able to get a copy of the VHS some time back.  I hope Disney will re-release this film on DVD so we can see it in its original widescreen aspect ratio.<br />Joey Cramer is David Freeman, a boy living in a picture perfect Florida town in 1978 with his parents and bratty kid brother.  However, he finds his life changed when he is knocked out in the forest for a few minutes, or so he thinks.  When he returns home, he finds that it is 1986.  David has been missing for 8 years, yet David himself has not aged.  David's parents are now eight years older, and his bratty kid brother has grown up into a quite decent 16-year-old.  David's quest to find out what happened to him will take him to an alien spacecraft run by a computer named Max.<br />The first half of the film is structured like an eerie mystery as David and the police try to piece together what happened to David.  This is perfectly complemented by Alan Silvestri's eerie score.  The film loses some of its mystery later on, but it's still highly enjoyable.  The spacecraft looks incredible, and the scenes where David gets to fly the spacecraft are really neat.  I think though I liked Max better before he assumed his Pee-Wee Herman voice (voiced by Pee-Wee himself).<br />The ending nicely tied things up.  Too bad we don't get to see  what becomes of David's crush on the local girl.
B000002UZ6|4.0|Tina Turner's success story is a middle finger to the trials and tribulations that made her early years a living hell.  Following the release of 1984's \\"Private Dancer,\\" Tina sold more records than she ever did with her then husband Ike, and she quickly shot to international stardom with a solid string of hits.  Her songs lean heavily toward rock and may be lacking in the soul department, but they do feature Tina's tremendous, gusty voice.  This hits collection compiles her biggest hits which we all know so well.  Her signature \\"What's Love Got to Do With it\\" has been the soundtrack to broken hearts around the world, while other singles \\"We Don't Need Another Hero,\\" \\"What You Get Is What You See\\" stand out well.  Another showstopper of a song is her formidable cover of Al Green's \\"Let's Stay Together,\\" which was a global hit back in the 1980s. Tina once warned us, \\"You Better Be Good to Me.\\"  Indeed, we have.  She's a diva who's rightfully earned her title, and this impressive collection is a great survey of one of the most-beloved singers on the globe.
B000068TSI|5.0|This true story drives home the lesson that so many good men serve in the armed forces of the United States.  Recognizing this fact puts into perspective the bad ones like William Calley who committed attrocities like My Lai.  Every politician who will decide whether to send young men into combat should read this book and watch this movie.  We need to make sure that the war we send our young men to fight unlike Vietnam is a just one and that their sacrifice is justified.
B000002LK1|4.0|The above title doesn't imply that I think Depeche Mode sold out with this album.  No doubt, this record deservedly went multiplatinum and evelated them to a household name in British pop. And while it doesn't quite match the heights of landmark albums like &quot;Music for the Masses,&quot; &quot;Violator&quot; is one fun ride.  The opener, &quot;World in My Eyes,&quot; is what we've come to expect from the Mode: hook-heavy yet moody synth pop with a danceable edge.  &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; (which, strangely, everybody seems to misintrepret as an inspirational song) makes good use of its guitar twang, while &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; (their biggest American hit) has a nice house-y feel.  The non-single cut &quot;Sweetest Perfection,&quot; is a seductive, slow-moving number that features songwriter Martin Gore taking lead vocals. Producer Flood really takes the group to a new direction on this record, which fails to bore the listener.  &quot;Violator&quot; isn't their best record, but it ranks high on my list of favorite albums from the Mode.
B000066NW0|2.0|THIS IS NOT PUNK MUSIC! That being said, I don't mind her music. I actually liked \\"Complicated\\" the first 500,000 times I heard it. Let's face it though, the music industry is totally fabricating her \\"punk\\" image in order make her more appealing to the pop music population. Teeny-boppers all over are pleading, \\"But she's punk!\\". Is she? What is punk about her music? The fact that she sings about a \\"Sk8er Boi\\"? It's absolutely ridiculous. Can she play that guitar? I'd love to go and see her live to confirm that. Her music isn't the worst (although some of her songs really are pathetic), but any artist who is destined to disappear 1 year after their debut album (and we all know she will) hardly deserves 5 stars.
B00005NB8J|4.0|The director/producer team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, who gave us Independance Day and Godzilla [ ] first produced this inventive and exciting Sci Fi flick. I'm not usually a fan of this genre, but this one is actually rather good compared with traditional science fiction. Starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the film is basically a homage (French for \\"rip-off\\") of the old Sci Fi stories, but there are some interesting ideas and a series of terrific action set-pieces.  The story consists of an Egyptologist who discovers the secret of an ancient relic called the Stargate. The explorer solves the puzzle and then he and a team of soldiers enter the Stargate and discover a city of people who are descendants of the ancient Egyptians. The people worship gods who are actually an alien culture, and then the trouble begins. Great stuff. Dissapointing DVD extras though, with only production notes. One hopes this will be re-released in a \\"Special Edition\\" soon.
B000062YAZ|5.0|From the point of view of someone who thinks Slayer, Metallica and Pantera are probably the best Metal Bands all around, RIB is arguably Slayer's finest...the album's one drawback is that it's TOO SHORT.  Not just spine-tingling guitar, terror-instilling drums (Lombardo is my personal fave), freightening vocals and lyrics, but it all comes together producing the perfect metal album and what metal is all about...primordial aggression.  Granted...this album was \\"an acquired taste\\" relative to my 2 previous Slayer albums (Seasons & South), but now I can't quit the addictive habit of listening to it on a weekly basis...going on 5 years now.  I've since bought every Slayer album (except Undisputed) and have found no equal.

0804106304|5.0|This book will never need an introduction or prologue.  The story is full of flavor and spice.  Amy Tan unraveled  the story of eight Chinese women as they grow, learn, and interact with the Club.  Each story shows some ancient Chinese views and mixes them with American ideals.  For a book to show you Ameica's merger of different cultures, read this book.  Her picture books are also a must read for children and adults alike.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is no Slaughter-House Five. But what novel can possibly compare to that one? Though not as staggering as that book, Cat's Cradle is still can unbelievably well done novel that manages to be both hysterical and profound in a way that only Vonnegut can seem to pull off. It is a short book, but this slim volume contains a mountain of insight on religion, war, human nature, sex, well-being, and the limited nature of human comprehension. It broaches all these subjects with humbleness; it brings no pretensions to the table and is throughly honest--it never feels like it is being preachy. Bokonon is one of the best characters I have encountered in all of literature, and the philosphy he promulgatges is so obvious that it is hard to believe that it sounds so fresh. I guess that sometimes obvious things are hard to see. This book states the obvious that maybe we would never notice on our own. Cat's Cradle is vintage Vonnegut. Bokonon says: \\"History, read it and weep.\\" I say, read Cat's Cradle and have your mind blown.
0823016285|5.0|This is just the best book around to understand how to make a portrait alive with feeling. As the title states, it is all about facial expressions and not about drawing per se, or even portrait drawing. It lists the basic expressions, the main muscles of the face, and then goes on to illustrate how they are related and how expressions &quot;work&quot;.<br />The book is not as dry as this description sounds. The prose is  witty. Most of the illustrations are purposeful pencil sketches or cartoons rather than academic portraits: they are very illustrative and to the point.<br />Reading this book helped me understand better how to make a portrait come alive, by keeping all the features of the face coherent. It won't help you draw, but it will make you &quot;see&quot; better what makes up a face and an expression.<br />Definitely 5 stars: the book is fun, easy to read, well bound, and as far as I can tell, exhaustive.

B00006GFAB|3.0|First saw on TV a few of the songs that appeared on this album and thought it would be pretty good. It &quot;Shocked Me&quot;, when I found most of the VERY BEST stuff did not make this album. Such as ladies Room&quot;, &quot;Take Me&quot;, &quot;X-Ray Eyes&quot;, &quot;2000 Man&quot; are only to name a few VERY BEST of songs from Kiss that are not on this album. I would obtain the &quot;Double Platinum&quot; album which is a TRUE &quot;Best Of&quot; Kiss and skip this album. And use &quot;DP&quot; to introduce the new generation to the group.

0451199871|3.0|One morning the body of a beautiful but rather cheap-looking girl is found in the library of Colonel and Mrs. Bantry at Gossington Hall. The Bantrys don't have a clue of the identity of this unfortunate girl. Luckily Miss Marple is there to help the police in their investigations and guide them politely to the discoveries that will solve this complex case.<br />Following Murder at the Vicarage (1930) and The Thirteen Problems (1932) this is Miss Jane Marples third appearance. Why Christie waited more than a decade to get back to her old spinster in 1942 remains unknown, but it might have something to do with the enormous popularity of her private detective with the little grey cells: Hercule Poirot.<br />The come-back of Miss Marple has not really the same spirit as the bulk of Agatha Christie pre-war books. It certainly lacks the freshness of Vicarage, although some characters from that book make their second appearance in The Body in the Library. The characters are drawn in the typical style that has become a trademark of Christie, so nothing wrong with that. The ending though is so utterly unlikely that is gives you a rather bitter aftertaste. From a whodunit point of view the end is neatly composed and proves the master ship of the Dame of Crime, but that is far from what real life is supposed to offer. I know, you shouldn't expect realistic story-lines if you open an Agatha Christie novel, but there are certain limits.
B00005A46T|3.0|I bought this CD on a whim, never having heard any of Slipknot's music before. I was tired of mainstream [music] that was being played to death on the So Cal rock stations and took a risk here. Well, I wasn't completely disappointed. There are some hardcore, rockin tracks on this CD. \\"Everything Ends\\", \\"Heretic Anthem\\", and \\"I am Hated\\" are definitely aimed at all the injustices that a person experiences in relationships of all sorts -- business, friendship, romantic, etc. The guitars are loud and twangy, the drumming is definitely solid. This is the stuff that was meant to be played at the highest possible volume while speeding down the highway. <br />My only real complaint would be the lyrics of the songs themselves. Most of them don't make sense...and it's hard to get into a song when you constantly have to pull out the liner notes to decode what you're hearing. Music should be interpreted, enjoyed, and rocked out to...but not decoded. That takes the enjoyment out of it.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Coming from a country that is most commonly associated with dorky mounties,ice hockey, and the French, Nickelback had the odds against them when itcomes to popularity in the states. Fortunately, the band's heavy chords and Chad Kroeger's raspy voice make Nickelback sound like anything but canadian twits. Over the past 2 years these neighbors to the north have gathered a decent sized fan base of rock loving americans. Indeed, Nickelback is the embodiment of pop. When you start talking music,however, they are another story. Their new album Silver Side Up opens with the fierce anthem &quot;Never Again,&quot; which blantantly condemns the act of domestic abuse. The follow up is the cleverly crafted &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; a song whose catchiness is undeniable. &quot;Woke up This Morning&quot; is mildly enjoyable, while &quot;Too Bad&quot; is another crafty<BR>combination of power chords that molds into another mind numbingly catchy tune. And then there is nothing....every track from then on is monotone. You could combine any of these songs into one and you could hardly tell the difference. Thankfully there is a trace of difference in the closing track &quot;Good Times Gone.&quot; Lyrically nothing challenges the mind or stirs the emotions of the listener, it's all pretty straight forward. Although &quot;Never Again&quot; strays from the other songs by addressing the seriousness of domestic abuse, it does not prove to be insightful. Overall, Silver Side Up is an unoriginal album with a few catchy tunes. If you enjoyed &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; or &quot;Too Bad&quot; then you may enjoy a couple more of the songs, but will not find anything like the band's previous two hits. If you're looking for a hidden gem or latent depth in<BR>this album, you'll find none.
B00003CX8V|5.0|The Apartment is an insightful movie made by one of cinema's most talented directors.  The plot is fairly simple, but C.C. Baxter's (Jack Lemmon) is anything but.  By innocently lending out his apartment to a coworker, Baxter's residence becomes the love nest for his philandering colleagues.  Along the way, Baxter develops a friendship with Fran Kubelik (Shirley Maclaine), one of several attractive female elevator operators.  Baxter is rewarded for his generosity by getting promoted by Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).  Little does he realize that Fran is Sheldrake's latest plaything.  The Apartment has all that you expect from the best of Wilder:  great performances, witty dialogue, and a plot that holds to this day, even if most of the depiction of the corporate office environment has changed dramatically (When was the last time you saw an elevator operator?).  The three stars provide great characterizations, with MacMurray the real surprise here playing against type.  This film is also notable for solidifying the Wilder/Lemmon team.  With The Apartment, Lemmon was no longer playing second male leads or supporting roles.  A worthwhile film that is still enjoyable today, but the DVD version leaves much to be desired.  The picture quality is good, but the looping (the sound synchronization) is off and very distracting.  Don't know the reason for this, but considering this film's place in cinema history, I would have thought it would have gotten the A treatment.  The DVD is a disappointment.
B000068QY7|4.0|In a time of less than rock, namely Default, Our Lady Peace, Nickelback, Puddle of Mud, Jimmy Eat World, Hoobastank, Blink-182, and Papa Roach, Oasis turns the clock back to when rock and roll mattered. Sure, \\"heathenchemistry\\" is a blatant rip off of the Beatles, but atleast they are reaching back and using arguably the best band of all time. The other bands mentioned above rip off recent hit makers like Metallica, Limp Bizkit, and Goo Goo Dolls and try to meld these sounds into something new and catchy.Problem is, with this happening everything on the radio has turned monotone hippie pop rock. On heathenchemistry Oasis uses classic rock riffs, blues, and Beattles pop to create an album worth listening to. Heathenchemistry rocks from the very begining with the anthemic \\"the hindu time\\" and clevery fades into the bumpin track \\"force of nature,\\" sung by brother Noel Gallagher. One of the album's high points is the Champagne Super Nove-esq \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out,\\" much like any of Oasis's trademark pop anthems, but with a little more emotion and craftsmanship. The rest of the album is quite enjoyable, although not as strong as the beginning. Heathenchemistry closes on a funky note with \\"better man.\\" BOTTOM LINE although the album may be a little incongruous and at times pure Beattles, it's still a great break from what's on the radio and actually rocks like the old school days.

0783243499|5.0|This is one of those movies where you either love it, or you just don't get it at all. It's also one of the few adaptations that is about as good as the book, and at least captures the spirit fairly well. But, it's not for everybody. If you're expecting a comical slasher film with \\"witty\\" (re:insipid) humor like in Scream, don't bother.<BR>Firstly, you have to have a somewhat quirky sense of humor. If the first few minutes, where Christian Bale explains his morning routine, consisting of his various hair and skin products, exercises, and clothing options, in a slightly homosexual home shopping network narration, do not make you laugh, you might as well just turn the movie off. If they do make you laugh, then get ready to bust a gut, especially each time Bale screams \\"I HAVE TO RETURN SOME VIDEOS!\\"<BR>What most people don't understand is that the movie is a horror film, but not in the conventional sense. Bale plays a successful \\"Wall Street guy\\" (the fact that you don't know exactly what he does is intentional) who starts to lose his mind. We take a trip through Bale's 1980s yuppie world, eating with him and his eclectic \\"friends\\" at the top restaurants, schmoozing with artists and models, at work, at home, at play. In the beginning, Bale's murderous episodes are infrequent, spur of the moment. Soon however, they become systematic, gaining pace faster and faster until the final mass killing spree. The whole movie is laced with black humor and 80s pop culture. In one scene, Bale kills an associate after explaining to him why he thinks \\"Sports\\" is Huey Lewis' best album. Bale gives the best performance of the year, hands down, alternating between cool detachment, comical hysteria, and sheer madness.<BR>The greatness of this film only becomes apparent after a couple of viewings. There are so many little tidbits and story elements that have significance to the meaning of the movie as a whole, it is almost like a literary work.<BR>The point of the movie is that Bale's character does not exist. Physically yes, he is there, but as he says right in the beginning of the movie, he has no real personality. Instead of having an actual personality, with likes, dislikes, feelings, and preferences, Bale is simply a meshpot of social standards. He has the right clothes, right body, right job, right friends, right fiance, went to the right school, and eats at the right restaurant. The fact that he has no real character is highlighted by the fact that a number of times in the movie he is confused with someone entirely different.<BR>The reason Bale's character begins to kill is not because he is disgusted by the materialistic world he lives in, it's because he idolizes it. He sets for himself an impossible standard which he is obsessed, to the point of insanity, of living by. When he fails to achieve those standards, he begins to feel a passionate hatred for himself, and for anyone who is able to live by them. His first killing is of an associate of his, a man who mistakes Bale for someone else. This associate has a better job, a better business card (that part really ticks Bale off), and can get better reservations than Bale. All of this makes Bale feel so inferior, inadequate, and resentful that his maniac inability to be anything less than entirely correct by social standards is displayed when he hacks the associate to pieces with an axe. He then proceeds to use the associate's apartment as a base of operations. <BR>But Bale's wrath is not just limited to those who have it better than him. Prostitutes, homeless people, any random person who isn't attempting or has simply failed to achieve the right yuppie lifestyle disgusts Bale, one one hand because they remind him of his own inadequacy, and on the other hand because he so desperately wants the world to be brand name perfect. He needs to feel superior, he needs to feel that he is the most \\"adequate\\", so he plays power games against characters from the underbelly of society that end with him killing them.<BR>There are dozens of clever twists and witty scenes in the movie, but the end contains the biggest twist of all. If you're really clever, you might see it coming, but you have to pick up on two minute things. First, the fact that almost all of Bale's acquaintences think he's a sissy, and that the murders become progressively less plausible. When it is revealed, we realize the horror of the movie is not in the murders, but something far more unsettling. Insanity is probably the biggest faux pas in this yuppie world where the standard is to keep everything nice, pleasant, and expensive, and in the end we find out just entirely how much Bale's soul is corrupted by his obsession with this standard. It is all summed up by his final line in the movie: \\"Whatever...\\"

B000002B30|3.0|If you like Bruce Springsteen and are in a middle-aged class as myself or older, this so-called Greatest Hit gathering offers none favorites you wouldn't already own or have access to in your collection. However, if you are a high school or college listener who can't stand tolerating today's air-droned Pop scene, this release would be an ideal introduction to the 70-80's classics from The Boss. Unfortunately, whatever age group may represent yourself, something undeniable remains a burden influencing this CD's content: the song listing excludes probably an entire disc of memorable greats (with the final new tracks not providing much inspiration either). Hopefully after their latest studio effort, E-Street makes available an organized track gathering to support such the songs left out here. This volume if released should include It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City, Rosalita (Come Out Tonight), Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, The Promised Land, Prove It All Night, Cadillac Ranch, Fade Away, Cover Me, I'm On Fire, I'm Goin' Down, Pink Cadillac, War (Live), Tougher Than The Rest, Tunnel of Love and maybe a couple of tracks from THE RISING now available among others. THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD really was a decent/respectable CD recording yet more a personal or introspective Springsteen accomplishment and as such didn't spawn popular hits. More recent Live CDs also didn't promote anything new or original on their own either, unless you get some `This is just beastly, man!` high believing you're front row center at a sold-out concert of the past. I guess for conciliation there is the option to spend your money on the TRACKS box set but even that only offers one then previously unreleased cuts and not any leftover famous tracks waiting for their longtime overdue gratification/resurgence...
6304698798|5.0|TGTBATU (title of the film) is a brilliant piece of work.I saw the movie 3 days ago for the first time and I was amazed.The music by Ennio Morricone and the directing by Sergio Leone was stupendous (dont mind the spelling).This movie contains one of the best movie sequences I have ever seen.The final showdown between the good,the bad and the ugly was a beautiful sight to see.Go watch it and prepare to be entertained to the max!!!
B00005OAIE|4.0|Seems to me that the harsh critics above are kind of missing the boat on this one.  I didn't expect to like this album at all, though I thought his hit song was catchy.  Turns out the whole album flows quite nicely, and to me it's clear that he is actually quite talented.  The production values alone are outstanding, and he doesn't ruin his songs with tweaked distortions and little musical gimmicks that would get old quickly.  A few of the lyrics could have been better and a few of the directions he chose weren't quite what I would have liked, but that's about as negative as I can get with this one.  Take a listen to most anyone elses debut album and see if you can say the same.  Have you heard Sting's debut album with the Police?  Not what I would call a great album and I'm a big fan.  I'm pretty impressed with this one.  I consider this 'sentimental' music and that's pretty hard to pull off.  Some people don't like that kind of music in the first place, so they're probably not going to give it a fair shake.  I really don't see the Dave Matthews link.  I don't hear him trying to make that ridiculous twang in his voice.  I happen to think 83 is a great song. I particularly like that I can listen to the whole album without getting annoyed at certain sections and wishing it would just skip every other song.  I think this album will appeal to a lot of people because it just sounds good and it all goes together.  Suggesting that it didn't take talent and a great deal of attention to detail confuses me.
0688170528|5.0|This book was amazing and I couldn't put it down! The plot is about a guy Chris that is thought to have murdered his gierlfriend and best friend since birth, Emily. He insists that it was a suicide pact and the police got there before Chris had a chance to shoot himself.  The prosecutors don't believe his story, so they take him to court to attempt to charge him with a life sentence.  This story was written beautifully though some parts were a bit risque.
0691023565|5.0|I got this book because I saw good reviews and heard that this was a classic...so I got it. <br />This is the first book that I ever encountered that teaches problem-solving. Further more, it teaches it through the use of heuristics(noun: A commonsense rule (or set of rules) intended to increase the probability of solving some problem). Half of the book cantains what the author calls The Dictionary - which contains a large number of heuristics that a problem-solver can use in his attempt to dissolve a problem. The author also describes in the first few chapters of the book on how to go about solving problems. Really gave me a new perspective on problem solving...Can't wait to apply what I have learned. <br />Buy it!(its cheap anyway...nothing to lose)
B000068TPN|5.0|I found this movie to be simply amazing. As a great fan of war movies, once again i saw the terrible tragedy that humans can account for. Mel Gibson is such a great hero, caring about his men, and the movie is sad, shocking, yet worst of all bassed on true events, that made me feel sad for those who died in the Vietnam war. Only those who's life it touched can really feel the tragedy but this  movie made me respect what peace is today. <BR>I highly reccomined it to everyone.
B00004XONN|5.0|I don't know how Radiohead did it. They recorded the<BR>best album of the 1990s and followed it up with an<BR>equally great album in a radically different style.<br />Anyway, on to the review:<br />  Everything in its Right Place - 7<br /> This is basically Thom Yorke whining something<BR>about sucking lemons and seeing colors over an<BR>electronic \\"bleh bleh bleh\\" voice. Not my cup<BR>of tea but perhaps I'll learn to appreciate it<BR>over more listens.<br />  Kid A - 10<br /> Great song! The lyrics can't be made out but the<BR>synths are upbeat and owe something to Kraftwek. <br />  The National Anthem - 10<BR> <BR> The album's centerpiece, a combination of cacophanous<BR>horn section and European electro-groove. Never heard<BR>anything else quite like it in my life.<br />  How to Disappear Completely - 10<BR> <BR> My favorite Radiohead ballad. Lush with lots of <BR>strings. The lyrics about wanting to disappear<BR>make me recall how abuse victims disappear into<BR>themselves when they can no longer consciously<BR>bear the pain.<br />   Treefingers - 7<BR> <BR> Ah, it's an instrumental. Very relaxing, perhaps<BR>too much so. If easily bored, skip it.<br />   Optimistic - 9<br /> Here's the rocker. Crank this one up, baby, and sing <BR>along to the invigorating chorus. \\"The best you can <BR>is good enough.\\" Indeed.<br />   <BR>   In Limbo - 7<BR> <BR> This one is just kind of \\"there\\" for me. I don't hate<BR>or love it, it's just there, as a transition between<BR>Optimistic and Idioteque.<br />   Idioteque - 10 (wow, lots of 10's on this album)<br />  Let's just say it's mind blowingly great and leave it at <BR>that. Intense in a NiN kind of way but without the self<BR>pity.<br />   Morning Bell - 8<br />  Like \\"In Limbo\\" I have no strong feelings about this<BR>either way. Judge for yourself.<br /> <BR>   Motion Picture Soundtrack - 10<br /> Another beautiful ballad that culminates in luscious<BR>harp swirling. Magnificant close to a magnificant<BR>album.<br /> Radiohead are gods. If you don't have the Bends, OK <BR>Computer, and Kid A, BUY THEM NOW!
B000069CWE|5.0|1. Opening- 5-5 an amazing opening to the album, musically takes you to the point your mind needs to be at to listen to this album.<BR>2. Pts. Of Athrty- 4-5 well it'd be higher if it wasn't for the fact that that lyrics aren't really anything new and it's just some beats in the background but what it doesn't have there it makes up with the video and the actual greatness that linkin park bring to every track.<BR>3. Enth E Nd - 5-5 Kutmasta Kurt/Motion Man One of my favorite tracks on the album and with good reason. Some really good reinterpetted lyrics and some good guest appearances.<BR>4. Chali- uhh well it's kinda just a simple phone message. but a good lead in.<BR>5. Frgt/10 - 5-5 Alchemist/Chali 2na- ill track with some really good new lyrics.<BR>6. P5hng Me A*wy - 10-5 Mike Shinoda/Stephen Richards- ok this is without question my favorite track on the album. Stephen Richards lyrics are ill and mike does an amazing job with everything too. Might be a little biased because i'm a huge taproot fan (WELCOME).<BR>7. Plc.4 Mie Haed - 5-5 Amp Live/Zion Of Zion I- SWEET!, the new lyrics and the guests are great. the beats are really sweet on it too.<BR>8. X-ecutioner Style 5-5 X-Ecutioners/Black Thought XECUTIONERS are great and do a good job on this track.<BR>9. H! Vltg3 - 3-5 Evidence/DJ Babu/Pharoahe Monch ok let me explain the logic behind this rating... well THE DAMN PIANO IN THE BACKGROUND WHY WHY WHY. I was looking forward to this track the most because high voltage was my favorite old track and with evidence and monch on the track i couldn't see how they could go wrong but they added the piano so i can barely listen to it but when u can get past that it's a great track.<BR>10. Riff Raff- whatever another talky thingy<BR> 11. Wth>You - 5-5 Chairman Hahn/Aceyalone- COME ONNNNNNNNN... thats a great opening and reminds me of the time i got to see these guys live. Ill song and good remix by the hahn<BR>12. Ntr/Mssion- cool lead in i guess<BR>13. PPr:Kut - 5-5 Cheapshot/Jubacca/Rasco/Planet Asia- awesome beat and background and new lyrics... also guests are great.<BR>14. Rnw@y - 5-5 Backyard Bangers/Phoenix Orion I love the lead in here. Pretty sweet but the whole song is great.<BR>15. My{Dsmbr- 4-5- hey it'd be a classic on any other remix album is just a beat in back of the lyrics.<BR>16. Stef- TAPROOT<BR>17. By_Myslf 5-5 Josh Abraham/Mike Shinoda/Stephen Carpenter- Josh Abraham i think is the guy who did Faith/fame on the Bizkit Remix album? but that was the best track on that record and this song holds its own.<BR>18. Kyur4 Th Ich - 4-5Chairman Hahn- Wasn't a great song to begin with but Hahn saves it from being a loss.<BR>19. 1stp Klosr - 6-5 The Humble Brothers/Jonathan Davis SECOND FAVORITE TRACK and Jon Davis rules end of story.<BR>20. Krwlng -5-5 Mike Shinoda/Aaron Lewis - Great Ending<br />As I have displayed this album is well worth the buy and despite being great songs by themselves they play even better in sequence because it is such a great mix. Lovin' the Park right now. Also check Taproot as i said above. Late
B000002UJQ|5.0|Well, most that can be said about this album already<BR>has been said, so here's my song-by-song review.<br /> Airbag - 8<br /> This song is about someone feeling especially <BR>exhilerated after surviving a car crash. Good<BR>rocker with a driving rhythm section and a nice<BR>intro to the album.<br /> Paranoid Android - 10<br /> Very clever song indeed, featuring bizarre imagery<BR>about alienation (\\"i'm trying to get some rest from all <BR>the unborn chikkin noises in my head\\")combined with an<BR>unsettling, constantly shifting song structure. I love<BR>the synthesized voice droning \\"I am paranoid but I am<BR>not an android\\" behind Thom Yorke's wail. Absolutely <BR>brilliant.<br /> Subterranian Homesick Alien - 9<br /> Song basically is about a bored suburbanite wanting<BR>to be abducted by aliens. The opening melody and the<BR>atmospheric guitar/synths are quite effective in setting <BR>the mood, making the listener feel like they're onboard<BR>the UFO.<BR> <br /> Exit Music to a Film - 10<br />Gorgeous ballad originally written for Romeo<BR>and Juliet. Radiohead are quite adept at <BR>pacing a song so that it builds up to a powerful<BR>ending. Too many bands these days have no clue<BR>and just hammer out power chords all the time<BR>with no sense of drama and build at all.<br /> Let Down - 9<br /> \\"Let down and hanging around. Crushed like a <BR>bug in the ground.\\" Apparently Radiohead are<BR>fans of REM as they sound just like them here.<BR>Except Radiohead are more talented songwriters<BR>and I enjoy this more than most REM.<br /> Karma Police - 9<br /> Radiohead goes for straight piano based pop. The <BR>twisted lyrics prevent it from being pop. \\"Her Hitler <BR>hairdo is making me feel ill.\\" Huh? This is still the<BR>most marketable song on the album except for No Surprises.<br /> Fitter, Happier - 7<br /> Stephen Hawking-like computer voice rambles on and on.<BR>Experimental? yes. Great song? No. Interesting though.<br /> Electioneering - 7<br /> You want guitars? Fine, here they are. Nice lyrics about<BR>political corruption set to standard hard rock. Song<BR>doesn't do that much for me but I like it enough not<BR>to skip it.<br /> Climbing Up the Walls - 9<br /> Ah, here we go. Yorke's voice is distorted beyond<BR>recognition and the words are nightmarish but somehow<BR>the song manages to be quite slinky and sexy. Classic.<br /> No Surprises - 10<br /> Beatlesque ballad about a dull man in a dull, routine<BR>world settling into total complacency. Great stuff. Very<BR>catchy and meaningful at the same time.<BR> <BR> Lucky - 7<br /> I'm split on whether I like this song or not. The<BR>non-chorus parts are simple and somewhat grating while<BR>the chorus is chilling with the synthesized choir. The<BR>lyrics are good too.<br /> The Tourist - 10<br /> Album ends with a bang. I feel this is one of the most<BR>underrated of all Radiohead tracks. The \\"Hey, man, slow<BR>down\\" chorus gives me shivers every time. The members of<BR>Pink Floyd would kill to be able to still write songs like<BR>this, but sadly they have not since the late 1970s.<br /> Over all, I treasure OK Computer.  Easily best album of<BR>the 1990s easily and amazingly the follow up Kid A is as <BR>good while radically changing styles.
B00005JKG7|5.0|Early in his career John Carpenter had a knack for finding spooky situations and placing viewers squarely in the middle of them.  For Halloween it was the creepiest holiday of the year, for The Thing it was a frozen wasteland a thousand miles from anywhere, and for The Fog it was a coastal town smothered by a glowing fog so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face (or the undead pirates coming towards you with cutlasses drawn).<br />The film boasts several great genre actors in Jamie Lee Curtis, her mother Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook, and Adrienne Barbeau.  The film also has several actors who grace many of Carpenters other films, including Buck Flowers, Charles Cyphers, Nancy Loomis, etc.  Rob Bottin, the fx guru who would create the creature effects for Carpenter's &quot;The Thing&quot; appears briefly as the head ghost, Captain Blake.<br />Mr. Carpenter introduces us to the town of Antonio Bay, CA on the eve of the town's 100th anniversary celebration.  A pre-credits campfire story told by the great John Houseman introduces us to the story of how a ship, the Elizabeth Dane, crashed off shore 100 years ago, drowning all aboard.  As Houseman's watch chimes midnight, signaling the beginning of the 100th anniversary, a glowing fog rolls in heralding the start of a tale of vengeance that was 100 years in the making.<br />I have watched this movie many, many times, and it always seems to last about 50 minutes.  I get so wrapped up in the great mood, atmospheric music, and fine performances and direction, that time just flies.  Such an excellent movie to pop into your DVD player on a particularly dark (or foggy) night.  Even if the DVD sported no extras this movie is worth the price, but luckily for all of us this special edition adds even more value with a small treasure chest of extras.<br />The Fog gets 5 stars, only because I can't give it six.
B00005T30L|1.0|Although another reviewer suggested and compared this movie to other &quot;quirky&quot; comedies like Rushmore, I didn't like this movie at all but did like Rushmore very much.  I have liked all 3 Wes Anderson flicks to date.  But this movie just wasn't for me.  I found it very slow.  Very dry.  Although Buscemi does a good job, I have liked him in other roles more.  I think for most people this will be a real 'hit' or 'miss' movie.  And for me its a 'miss'.
B00004RE7D|5.0|The teary & emotional ending of the classic SSII - THE WRATH OF KHAN (so classic that the film is mentioned in an episode of SEINFELD...as Jerry and George get choked up remembering the film) continues in THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK. Was it possible for the filmakers to outdo one of the most famous death scenes and eulogies in sci-fi film history? Well, almost! The two scenes are used to open 'SEARCH' and the movie viewer is reminded of the emotional power of 'WRATH' and what's in store for 'SEARCH'.  The sequel delivers with continuity (minus Bibi Besch, and Kristie Alley as Lt. Savik  is replaced by Robin Curtis) as  \\"Genesis\\" is again one of the subjects of the plot.  The crew must race back to the Genesis planet to retrieve Spock's remains and to go back to the planet Vulcan to deliver his \\"essence\\" placed in the mind of Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) by mind melding with Spock before Spock's death. . At the same time, a Klingon crew have found out  about Genesis and they too rush to the Genesis planet.  Again, as in 'WRATH' another great cat and mouse game, with Captain Kirk (Shatner) and crew, this time against the Klingons, ensues over Genesis and this time, The Enterprise is destroyed - -...    Overall, THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK is great film in the STAR TREK mythos, directed by Spock himself (Leonard Nimoy) with the continued emotional depth started in WRATH OF KHAN.
0684803356|5.0|Ernest Hemingway - For Whom The Bell Tolls<br />For one who wants to read the book that has it all I recommend Ernest Hemingway's For Whom The Bell Tolls. Friendship, strife, security, terror, love, war, good, evil; this book has them all. It is the story of Robert Jordan, a sympathizer of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, whose duty is to lead a band of guerrillas in blowing up a bridge as part of a Republican offensive. Along the way Jordan will learn the revolting pasts of several of the guerrillas, fall in love with one of them, and spend quite some time meditating on \\"truths\\" he was once sure he knew.<br />No sooner has Jordan met with the guerrillas than he discovers that one of them, fearful of being hunted down by the fascist forces, stands against him and threatens to take the entire group away. This first taste of tension is mirrored several times over in Hemingway's gripping novel as Jordan's quest to destroy his bridge turns into a contemplation of whether his cause is truly worthy or not. <br />Much of what Jordan sees recommends the latter. Jordan's guerrilla partners are not simple adornments to his crusade; they all have livid pasts and he finds much to learn from them. Even as they curse and spit at the fascists several of these guerrillas communicate, through their stories, arguments against the futility and cruelty of the war they have willfully taken up. Others, too young to realize what they have gotten into, create commentaries on war through their naïve brashness.<br />Additionally the humanity of the guerrillas makes Jordan question the commands from his isolated, detached superiors. In time Jordan forms strong bonds with his friends and discovers that the thought of sending them into harm's way is not a simple abstraction. This is further complicated by a girl Jordan meets and falls in love with and Jordan's own questions about the worthiness of his orders.<br />Like Robert Jordan we, as readers of For Whom The Bell Tolls, are invited to meditate on many of the thoughts that so bother him. What need a person do to live a full life? How important is it to stay true to principles, even when fighting in vain? What are the limits of brutality? These are a few of the questions Hemingway grapples with in his book. The answers are so well bound with the narrative that often one hardly notices a metaphysical discussion has occurred, but those who give the text a second look will find a philosophical subtext as gripping as the plot line.<br />As for the story,  Hemingway creates out of his assortment of characters a narrative of breathtaking beauty. For Whom The Bell Tolls has the power to move one to tears, wet hands with sweat, and force page after page of devoted reading. Hemingway's language is not the most beautiful, but in lieu of poetics his writing has the next best thing: crisp clarity.<br />Perhaps the best thing to say about For Whom The Bell Tolls is that at nearly 500 pages (which glide by in a snap), scarcely one has been wasted. It is a war novel laced with the drama of a Henry James piece and a drama lacerated with the carnage of war. In other words this fine book of Hemingway's manages to transcend two genres and end up at some unknown point in between, but certainly above both.
B00005BJR0|3.0|Whether you prefer the original theatrical release or the director's cut of Blade Runner, and there are many in both camps, to not include the narrated version is a huge mistake and the reason I will not be buying this DVD.  This time the studio had it right.  Not for the right reason, perhaps, but the VO convention ties Deckard to his 1930's noir kin and makes Blade Runner timeless. The happy ending is unfortunate but the unicorn image in the director's cut is as well. Not including the version of the film that originally compelled audiences to love it is just puzzling.
B000069AUI|5.0|... Coldplay is your band! I became a fan rather late, I purchased Coldplay's debute album &quot;Parachutes&quot; only about four months ago, since that time the CD has gotten play at least twice daily at the office. It's brilliant, it's genius.. I didn't think they could do it again. I was wrong.<br />I tried to write up a proper review of this album for you, I think the RollingStone review does it justice, and I encourage you to check that review out if you want a critic's perspective. and honestly I can't say much, other than, once again we have melow-melodic-genius at work. The sound and production quality remain consistant with the first album, but more influences shine through this go round, the opening track starts out with a heavy piano riff letting you know you're own a new page. From then on, if you're an old fan or a new fan, the rest of the CD will dazzle you, never dull.<br />I see this album as a major milestone for Coldplay, although their catalog doesn't show it yet, you can listen and know they have surpased Radiohead, and other bands they were once compared to.
B000069AUI|5.0|Sorry, this really isn't a constructive review, I just wanted to rave. I love this cd already! It is a fine follow-up to Parachutes, and has been the only CD I've listened to for a week (and that speaks volumes, trust me). Early favourites: the Scientist, Green Eyes and the title track. Highly recommended.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is the best Disney film in awhile. In my opinion Disney is the best American animators but since this movie(with the exception of the Lion King of course)there has been a wave of horrid Disney movies(such as Lilo and Stich).  But this movie is really good.  It's simply mezmorizing.  It's beautiful and has the best music in a disney film.  It's dazzling and cute, beautiful and sad.  The story of the film is: A young girl named Belle, who thinks she knows everything she wants, goes on a magical adventure.  The prologue of the movie is, a greedy prince many years ago lived in a beautiful castle.  One day an old lady knocked on her door and asked if she could stay in the castle one day for the rose.  The prince turned it down and the old lady transformed herself into a beautiful women, transformed the prince into a beast, and said \\"you must love someone and earn there love back before the pedals of the rose fall off, then the spell would be broken.  Now back to Belle, Her father got lost in the woods.  Belle went to find him and she saw a castle.  When she went in there she eventually met her father and mada an exchange.  She said if she would let her father free, she would stay there, thus begins the movie.<br />  The effects are wonderful.  Especially in this remastered version.  The animation is just plain and simpley BEAUTIFUL.  The music like I said is top notch, and this new version will have a brand new sog, Human again.  But fom the mesmorizing song Tale as old as time, well that song is not only beautiful but it has meanig and values like a nother poster said. Tale as old as time it means since Adam and Eve men have ruled our society.  Song as old as rhyme Barely even Friends then somebody bendss unexpectedly: that means love needs the two to make changes.  And finally Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast.  This is a great scycological tool also.  For a couple who are facing horrible hardships.  This is one of the best Disney films.
B00000F14B|4.0|One of the last big musicals to go from Broadway stage to Hollywood screen, the Music Man is a tale of a small Iowa town, ca 1912, that gets taken in by a fast talking Band instrument salesman. Robert Preston encores his role from Broadway as Prof. Hill, Shirley Jones plays Marion the Librarian. Great music with some terrific ensemble numbers such as &quot;Iowa Stubborn&quot;, &quot;Pick a Little Talk a Little&quot;, &quot;Wells Fargo Wagon&quot; and of course, &quot;76 Trombones&quot; make for a joyful musical experience. The story is a little contrived but so what. You'll enjoy suspending your jaded 21st Century sensibilities as you fall in to this tale of a small time sales-hustler at loose in an Iowa Stubborn small town. It's still a fun tale full of swagger and exaggerated Midwestern small town values as imagined by Meredith Wilson's romantic pen. And of course there are the great barbershop quartet numbers sung by the Buffalo Bills that fit seamlessly in this lively production. Pop this disc in your player and you'll be humming the songs for days.&quot;Marion the Librarian&quot;, &quot;The Sadder but Wiser Gal&quot;, &quot;Lida Rose&quot;, a very young Ron Howard singing &quot;Gary, Indiana&quot;, &quot;Goodnight my Someone&quot;, &quot;Ya Got Trouble&quot; (with a capitol T and that rhymes with P and that stands for Pool!&quot;), &quot;Shipoopi&quot; (the girl that's hard to get),. You couldn't ask for a better show full of lively tunes, silly characters, falling in love plot line, everything you ever wanted in a musical. Once you watch this one you'll leave your living room smiling and singing.
B0000025KI|4.0|If Bruce Springsteen had kept only the meaningful songs and left off the less-inspiring ones, \\"The River\\" could have been a masterpiece; it probably would have been whittled down to a single disc, but that disc would contain some of his best work, and the best only.<br />The problem with \\"The River\\" is the amount of bland, effortless 'rockers' that appear in inconvenient places. For example, 'Ramrod' appears right after the wonderfully haunting 'Stolen Car.' 'Cadillac Ranch' (one of the better upbeat tunes) and the predictable 'I'm A Rocker' don't seem to follow the dark and desperate 'Point Blank.' Somehow, the boring \\"rockin' songs\\" don't fit the longing and despair of the display of paper wedding dolls on the back cover, or the wonderful photograph of the actual Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas on the lyric foldout (that is, an awe-inspiring scene of rows of cars buried half way in the ground).<br />The true greatness of \\"The River\\" comes from honest and world-weary songs like 'Independence Day,' 'I Wanna Marry You,' and the title song, one that proves fairy tales often never come to be. Meanwhile Springsteen's classic view on the struggles of ordinary folk appear on 'The Price You Pay' and the unique perspective of 'Wreck on the Highway.'<br />Released between two of Springsteen's masterpieces, 1978's classic \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" and 1982's genius \\"Nebraska\\", this album appears to be a mixed blessing, though its hit single ('Hungry Heart') confirmed his superstar standing. All told, when one ignores the disappointing rockers on this album and concentrates on the true gems, \\"The River\\" is one The Boss's most honest creations.
0440219078|5.0|This books is truly great. It is easy to read and yet wonderfully written. You won't want to put it down because you'll be too interested in what's going on in that place? Why is everything so different? Are there no decisions? What is a giver and why is it so important?<br />This is one of the best books I've ever read.
B000002TPS|5.0|In most ways, heavy metal foursome Megadeth is a more intelligent and musically flexible version of Metallica; this is not made surprising (or derivative), as guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine was the former's original lead guitarist, and his writing influence was even felt by Metallica to their second album--all after he had been fired from the band. Relevant comparisons aside, Mustaine, Nick Menza, Marty Friedman, &amp; David Ellefson continue to prove their dominance of heavy metal (and give Metallica a run for their money when it comes to merit) with their 1994 masterpiece, the inventive, yet underappreciated, &quot;Youthanasia.&quot;<br />The tracks contained on this disc are pure heavy metal, and still hold a powerful musical and lyrical element of classical arrangements, as heard in the intro of 'Blood Of Heroes' (which also displays great vocal mixing) and the harrowing 'A Tout Le Monde.' 'Train Of Consequences' sounds like an updated rock version of Alfred Noyes' poem &quot;The Highwayman&quot; while other songs like the title track, 'Family Tree,' and 'Addicted To Chaos' are so genuinely real they are nearly heartwrenching.<br />&quot;Youthanasia&quot; remains a surreal heavy metal accomplishment, though slightly obscured by some of Megadeth's more often-noted albums. The band attributes its label as &quot;below standards&quot; to producer Max Norman's theory that the tracks had to be 250 beats a minute in order to get on the radio (as they contend in an interview with the magazine &quot;Maximum Guitar&quot;). Nonetheless, &quot;Youthanasia&quot; is solid, and its heavy metal foundation is both blistering and gutwrenching.
B00006F83Y|2.0|What in the whole wide world is there about this album that inspires such wild outpourings of praise?<BR>This is a collection of middling, forgettable pop tunes broken up by hard guitar breaks and a bunch of disc jockey parodies that get old the second time you hear them.  <BR>You might call the mix \\"experimental\\", but there really isn't anything here that hasn't been done before and usually with a good deal more intensity.
B00004XONN|4.0|...  There are many understandable reasons why music fans (and specifically, Radiohead fans) would hate this album:  Guitars are practially non-existent; Thom Yorke's voice is reduced to static and noise, or computerized jibberish; singable choruses must have run away with the guitars... there are many others, but those of you who hate this have your own lists, I'm sure.  <BR>     So why 4 stars from me?  The music here is not sing-along stuff.  You would never crank these tunes up in a convertible on the way to the beach on a hot summer day with your favorite girl or guy.  And you'll probably never listen to them while you work out.  What Radiohead has done is follow the creative spirit of The Beatles when they made Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  They crafted these songs without worrying about what could be done in an arena in front of fans, and instead created aural pieces of art.  And like Sgt. Pepper (and OK Computer), the songs move the listener forward, as if telling a story.  The lyrics are sufficiently vague, so who knows if that was really their intention.  But if you let yourself take the journey, it just FEELS like a trip, with the music shifting moods and rhythms, sounding like nothing you've ever heard before, and thus taking you to places that are fresh, invigorating, melancholy, and almost a little scary.  But unlike anywhere you've ever been.  <BR>     They went to great pains to experiment on this record.  It's impressive just in the sense that if you really listen closely, you will hear so many parts, some floating in and out, some droning away, some barely audible but necessary to create the right mood for the song.  They didn't just magically appear -- the 5 men of Radiohead had to imagine all these unique sounds, figure out how to capture them to tape, and then arrange them to somehow turn noise and sound into music.  <BR>     And despite the computerized blips and bleeps, Radiohead has created music that has real energy and emotion.  From the first drones of the keys and Yorke's fluttering vocals on \\"Everything in it's Right Place\\", you see the first glimpse of this new world they want you to explore.  There is not a guitar to be found, but it somehow builds in intensity, with Yorke repeating the line, \\"What was that you tried to say... tried to say...tried to say...\\" with more and more desperation and anxiousness.  \\"The National Anthem\\" is based on one repeating bass riff that never stops.  But the elements around it -- the drums, the electronic flourishes, the horns (as rude as they are) -- build and build on top of, behind, and around the churning bass, making for a cacaphony of sound that somehow, totally JAMS.  Before the final elaphantine honks, those horns are WAILING, as if each player was told, \\"solo over this lick as if it will be the last great improv of your life.\\"  <BR>     \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" takes what should be a typical acoustic guitar part and puts it in outer space, along with shooting-star keyboards and a beautiful melody from Yorke.  \\"Optimistic\\" sounds like a futuristic world in the winter, but has one of the really memorable vocal melodies as it's chorus.  This song could easily be played on MTV Unplugged, stripped of all the production, and it would still hold up.<BR>     Even the songs that aren't anthemic or high energy have a place on the album.  \\"Kid A\\" is the second track, and the one in which we presume the Kid in question is \\"born\\".  Yorke's vocal murmurings and the bell-like keyboards sound like an infant robot's playpen.  \\"Idioteque\\" sounds exactly like just that -- a disco for moronic, futuristic, club-hopping clones.  <BR>     There are no lyrics to explain a hint of a storyline; no liner notes to put the listener in a certain time or location.  In fact, any of the scenarios for the album I've presented here are purely speculative.  But the music and the spare lyrics that ARE there, and the pure originality with which they are arranged and presented, put picutes in your head.  They lead you along an arc of sorts, and there is a beginning, a middle, and an and of this otherworldly trip.  If you can accept that in listening to this album, you are simply no where NEAR Kansas anymore, you will end up in a place that makes Oz look like the 'burbs.  And you might discover a real beauty in its novelty.
B000069AUI|5.0|With their relentless perfection and constant drive to be better musicians, Coldplay has somehow improved on their incredible debut album \\"Parachutes\\" with this new release. <br />The songs are more complex, more full, and more sophisticated in both their lyrics and their arrangement than the songs on the previous album. My personal favorites are \\"God Put A Smile On Your Face,\\" \\"Clocks,\\" and \\"Green Eyes.\\" <br />This CD was well worth the wait and I'm looking forward to listening to it more and more in the upcoming months and years.<br />And I'll also be enjoying \\"The Last Broadcast\\" - another fine recent release from their British compatriots Doves. If you like Coldplay, check 'em out - you may like Doves too.
0743455967|5.0|This is my first Stephen King book because I avoid horror novels. A friend recommended it to me and I was blown away. Not only did I get a well-crafted window into King's life, and a writing lesson that left me panting to write, but I also found a glimmer of faith in his writing as well. King writes like he wants to be my friend. Thank you, Stephen.
0743442539|2.0|Quite frankly, I don't understand why this book is lauded as Le Carr's greatest novel. It seems that the only purpose of this novel is to show us how immoral espionage is and to show how know in the Cold War was \\"right\\". However, it does this by long and boring dialogues throughout the protagonist's many interrogations. By the time the book starts to pick up, it seems Le Carr decides he has said enough and rather abruptly ends it. If you want a better example of Le Carr's work stick to Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and the other books in that series
B00005JKJA|4.0|Mulholland Drive was the first movie directed by David Lynch that I had ever seen.  When the end credits of Mulholland Drive began to roll I was slightly confused but very impressed by what I had seen.  It was clear to me that Lynch is a very talented director.  Mulholland Drive stuck in my mind for days after I watched it.  Contrary to what many have claimed, I think that there is some sense to be made of this movie.  The movie is a look into the downward spiraling mind of a naive young woman who came to and was destroyed by Hollywood.   The first half of the movie is how she wanted her arrival in Hollywood to go.  Rather than having a bad audition for the 'Sylvia North Story' she has a sizzling audition in her dream only to have her opportunity taken away by forces she couldn't control.  This and many other points of Naomi Watts character's seemed clear to me by the end of the film.  I think that if you are willing to pay attention to events in her dream and how they compare and parallel the events and dialog near the end that narrative arc of the movie makes sense.<br />Having seen Mulholland Drive, I made a point to see some of Lynch's other works.  Of the Lynch films that I have seen (Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, Eraserhead and the Straight Story), I was absolutely floored by Lost Highway.  I thought that Lost Highway shared similar thematic elements with Mulholland Drive except that it didn't have any of the loose strings that Drive did (a result of its initial status as a TV pilot) and that visually Lost Highway is was a cut above.  After seeing Lost Highway, Drive felt almost like a Diet David Lynch by comparison.<br />Mulholland Drive rates below Lost Highway and Eraserhead in my view but is still a compelling film and an excellent introduction to the mind of David Lynch.  This is not his strangest or his most disturbing film (honors that go to Eraserhead and Blue Velvet repsectively).  Mulholland Drive is a very interesting and very well made film that for me was an excellent introduction to Lynch's works.
B000066NW0|5.0|A lot a people say Avril is a poser. I don't think she is. She just wears what she wants and if she IS a poser, i don't care. I like her music. Avril does skate but she's not yelling to the world that she is punk rock! Everyone else is. Most of the people who diss her an call her a poser don't even have her CD! Don't judge her on what she wears. She's selling her music not her clothes. I don't really know what her music is. It's not exactly pop and it's not exactly punk. Some of Avril's songs may a pop sound to it but if you listen to songs like Unwanted and Losing Grip, you won't think so. It's different and it's what this world needs. Listen to some of the lyrics because most people can relate to them. I like all the songs but my favorites are probably Anything but Ordinary and Things I'll Never Say. And no, I'm not some pop lover who worships Britney Spears and N'Sync. I listen to stuff like Sum41, No Doubt, Blink-182, Michelle Branch, Shakira, Sugarcult, and Linkin Park. You either like her or you don't. So if your not an open minded person and you judge artist by where they shop, don't buy this CD.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|A friend of mine gave me a copy of this cd when I was out for a visit in LA. I have listened to it practically non-stop since then. It is such a pleasure to listen to someone who can really sing and sing with such heart. I had the good fortune to see Rufus at Emens Auditorium in Muncie, IN for a benefit show to keep the high school that James Dean went to in Fairmount, IN. A huge thanks to David Loehr (sorry if I misspelled) for bringing Rufus so close. I have never been to a concert that sounded better than the cd.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Great DVD!!!! Great concert footage, some of the best Ive seen. They really did it right. A pretty good combination of older songs with new stuff off their latest release. Its amazing that after 20 years maiden still is one of the most energetic and fiercest bands around. Their longevity and metal strength musicianship are a fine tribute to their fans and an inspiration to see and hear in a radio world filled with lolly pop rock one hit acts.
B000002H70|5.0|On those occasional rainy autumn afternoons when you're feeling introspective and a little regretful about past break-ups or things you feel you should have thought twice about, THIS is the perfect soundtrack for your angst.  Somehow, The Cure has tapped into the human psyche and written a somber litany for us.  As an adult, I fully understand &quot;Disintegration&quot; without bending to sophomric insult.  This is the diary of past experiences recognizable to anyone of us with a few regrets and a lot of rememberances.  There are very few releases that can bring me down a notch or two, but The Cure has created a sad and beautiful netherworld that I sometimes need to visit.  &quot;Disintegration&quot; is a sobering reminder that we are only human.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This CD is nothing but a trite and worthless piece of garbage that truly is a testiment to the declining rate of progress in music in recent years. This CD shows little or no originality at all.<br />The title track is a rip-off of the title track to her debut album and that song was bad enough to begin with. What the hell does \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" mean anyway?<br />Then we then head into more of the same juvenile morass with jokes like the barbie-doll sounding Lucky, the virtually unlistenable Stronger whose video is a cheap knockoff of Janet Jacksons Miss You Much and then the ridiculous cover of the Rolling Stones Can't Get No Satisfaction which features vocals that are more like a mouse singing on a broken microphone.<br />Why this CD is still getting such great reviews is absolutely unbelievable!<br />She will never be anywhere close to Madonna! Madonna earlier music has tens of times more maturity than what could ever come from any of Britneys albums. Bloody hell even N Sync & Christina Aguilera are better than Britney.<br />Before you waste your money on this I say stop put this CD back on the shelf, go pick-up Deleriums Karma, anything by Genesis, Made In Japan by Deep Forest or Peter Gabriels SO. Trust me any of these CDs I mentioned you'll be happy to own where trash like Oops I Did It Again will sink and vanish off the face of the music world.<br />DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! PERIOD!

0679882820|5.0|How can you go wrong with DR.Seuss?  Great book to introduce sounds to your little one.  I read this book to our 1 month old.
B000067CPX|4.0|Being that there isn't much for music these days that does not have the boy band or hootchie mama appeal, this album was a breath of fresh air.  Radio stations that are not playing to appeal to the 12-21yr age group are recycling grunge from 10 years ago.  At least there's something else new AND good to listen to.  I bought this CD with low expectations given the amount of airplay of &quot;By the Way&quot;, thinking the rest of the CD would not be worth listening to and was pleasantly surprised.  Plus you can play it in the car with kids and not have to explain &quot;that's not a word that you should repeat&quot;.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Disney's Beauty and the Beast is one of the best movies that they have ever released. Over the years, I have collected many Disney titles and this is the one that I have most enjoyed.  The storyline and the animation is unique and appeals to adults as well as children.  I think that the idea of releasing a dvd edition of this movie is a must and I can't wait until it is released.
B00000JCOV|1.0|First of all...this is not a metal album, nor is Slipknot a metal band.  Let's get this straight.  Slipknot is aggro, or nu-metal, or whatever you want to call it.  Alternative rock with effects, distortion, power chords, and smoke and mirror tricks in the production room to make it sound heavier.  With that said, I can continue the review.<br />First of all...the good.  This album is fairly intense.  It is heavy (despite the fact that most of this was acheived through slick production and over-use of simple riffs and DJ tricks).  The singer isn't too bad at all....yes, his voice is a cheesy nu-metal ripoff of death metal, but it is better than most in the genre.  The drum work isn't too bad at all.<br />But, the lyrics are atrocious.  They sound like something a screaming 7 year old brat would yell.  I mean they are downright some of the worst lyrics I have ever heard.  The guitar work is very simple and repetitive.  A 2 or 3 week guitar student could play this album through....anyone can strum 2 chord riffs, turn up the distortion, and call themselves a musician.  <br />Furthermore, the ridiculous sounds in the background need to go.  There is no need for the 2 extra percussionists and the DJ.  The songs all sound extremely muddy...there is no musical focus to this album whatsoever.  Basically, this album is just typical mallcore nu-metal that appeals to 14 year old \\"rebels\\".  Save yourself the wasted time and money and don't buy this [stuff].
B00005RHGK|5.0|With extremely cool make-up and ILM effects, &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is the scariest movie ever.  I strongly suggest getting the DVD, because it has a lot of cool special features and the original theatrical trailer, which features one of my favorite songs, &quot;Voices&quot; by Disturbed.  Also, did you ever notice that most DVD's that come out now are SPECIAL EDITIONS, yet they have the same stuff most DVD's do?  That's weird.  Anyway, I have listed ALL of the Special Features below:<BR>BEHIND THE PEEPERS (THE MAKING OF JEEPERS CREEPERS)<BR>1.  Finding Trish and Darry<BR>2.  Designing the Creeper<BR>3.  Cars &amp; Trucks<BR>4.  The Creeper comes to Florida<BR>5.  Night Shoots<BR>6.  Composed by Bennett Salvay<br />-Deleted and Alternate Scenes<BR>-Diff. Languages (English, French, Spanish)<BR>-Audio Commentary by Writer/Director Victor Salva<br />TRAILERS<BR>1.  Jeepers Creepers<BR>2.  Hannibal<BR>3.  The Silence of the Lambs<BR>4.  The Terminator<BR>5.  Carrie<br />PHOTO GALLERY<BR>Some from the making and some from the feature<br />There are a lot of special features, which is a good thing, because, if you're like me, you like to watch the making of the movie and see what all the casts and crew have to say about the movie, and in this case, I wasn't sure what the man behind the mask of the Creeper looked like, and I was sure he'd show himself in the Spec. features.  However, I think if they had cut out the language, this could have been rated PG-13, it's really not that gory, but there are a few gory scenes.  The film itself is about 90 minutes, and the documentary on the making of the film is about 58 minutes if you select PLAY ALL on the menu, after accessing the BEHIND THE PEEPERS - THE MAKING OF JEEPERS CREEPERS menu.<br />ACTING:  The acting was good, Jonathan Breck did a really good job at the Creeper, and, did you know that New Line is considering passing over Kane Hodder for the role of Jason in &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;?  If they do, I wonder ifBreck will get the part, but I think that role is meant for Kane only.  Justing Long took his fear a little too far, I mean, his eyes widened every time he was scared so wide he could have took them out and they would be big enough for two Earth's (exaggeration for the dummies).  Eileen Brennan was good at the Cat Lady, and Gina Phillips was really good at playing Trish, but she swore a lot, so that was kind of...weird.<br />I strongly suggest buying the DVD, you'll be glad you did, even if you don't have a DVD player, you can watch it at a friend's house or something...
B000006ZL4|5.0|I wasn't quite sure how to rate this album going into the review.  I mean, I've listened to all of Symphony X's albums, and I think without a doubt this is the best one.  The opening to &quot;Of Sin and Shadows&quot; is great...nice and thrashy and then moving into a great keyboard sound.  Also, the songs are varied quite a bit, unlike &quot;V&quot;, in which I thought all the songs had a certain sameness to them.  The first 3 minutes of &quot;The Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot; are one of the best pieces of music I have ever heard.  <br />On the down side, the lyrics can be a bit cheesy (but not as cheesy as on &quot;V&quot;).  Also, the solo sections are quite predictable after awhile....guitar then keyboard then guitar then keyboard.  <br />I don't like the endless comparisons everyone has been giving to Dream Theater, so I won't include one at all.  All in all, this is a great album within the progressive/symphonic metal genre.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I thought this latest venture by Disney and Pixar was excellent.  The characters were simply wonderful.  The story was one that both adults and children could follow, and once you were into the story, it took you away.  I found it totally entertaining and enjoyed every minute of it.  It will soon become one of the Disney Classics!
B00004RFFU|5.0|I caught this one again in anticipation of soon seeing &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;.  While not knowing if the second film is any good or not, it would have to do a fantastic job to keep pace with the original.  I honestly can't think of a way they could have made &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; better.  I have read most of &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, and this movie captures the essence of this world to a &quot;T&quot;. <br />The biggest coup was probably getting Tom Cruise to play Lestat, and he delivers.  Ann Rice had her initial objections to him, but they were later recanted.  What Cruise does best is to play the arrogance of Lestat, while still making him somehow likeable.  <br />And the supporting cast makes me think that &quot;Queen...&quot; is going to be a real stinker, as none of the originals appear in the next film.  Brad Pitt doesn't shake up the screen, but his job is to be narrator, and in this he performs well.  Kirsten Dunst shows how she was going to be a star in the future with remarkable poise.  Stephen Rea plays the vampire you just want to strangle, and Antonio Bandaras shows enough Charisma as Armand that it could have spun off into it's own movie. <br />But alas, it doesn't look like any of these are going to be in any future Rice movies, and I get the feeling that the whole franchise may have been stopped in it's tracks.  If that's the case, own this one and catch it over and over again, as this is a time that Hollywood actually got it right.
6305358613|1.0|I was forced to see this by a woman I was with. It bored me to death. I was hoping for something gritty and violent but it was just another chance for Cate Blanchett to prance about in pretty frocks with men in tights to god-awful medieval minstrel music. I'm sure that woman just loved dressing up in her mommy's clothes when she was a little girl and she's never grown out of it. I'm convinced her decision on whether or not to take a role is simply \\"do I get to wear pretty frocks?\\". Yawn-o-rama.
B000001ELB|5.0|This is the first and best KISS compilation of hits. It is remastered and sounds clearer then ever. You don't need to bother with any other KISS best of cds. The new one is a rehash of their whole career. &quot;Greatest KISS&quot; is decent but also includes some mediocre songs. This has all the classics from the classic lineup. All the songs on here are from the time period when you know who played on what and that Ace and Peter were on every song. The best KISS compilation album.
0345440900|3.0|I read and reread this book trying to figure out how to put my twins on EASY, but never could find the details on how to apply the methods. I bought the VHS tape which was even less specific. I thought a lot of the rest of the book was common sense and not very useful.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film tells the story of a teen named Donnie Darko. It takes place in 1988, and it shows. Donnie is living in a rich suburban town and goes to a private Christian school. He seems pretty normal at first, but then one day a rabbit appears to him. It's not any rabbit, though. It's a large rabbit who tells Donnie the world will end soon. It also makes Donnie do violent acts like flooding his school. Donnie is seeing a psychiatrist who tells him he is schizophrenic. He's disturbed, but he's still on the search for something else. Something bigger than him. This film is a complex  science fiction flick, but also a dark comedy. The comedy part is where Patrick Swayze comes in. He plays Jim Cunningham, a simple minded self righteous motivational speaker who divides everything into the categories FEAR and LOVE. What I think is funny about this is that it's all so real!! There are thousands of Jim Cunninghams all around the world. <BR>Anyway, Donnie Darko is really brilliant and worth the watch
B00004TH7Z|5.0|'Brave New World' is utterly phenomenal!  Iron Maiden has proven that classic metal is alive and well, and the 3-guitar assault and songs on this disc are perfect!  Murray, Smith, and Gers are clockwork, and they know when to shred, and just as importantly, when to hold back.  This is collaboration of the first degree!  Bruce's vocals are fantastic, and he is, once again, in top form.  In fact, his vocal delivery is the best i've heard yet.  Nicko's drumming is as tight fisted and strong as ever... ditto Steve's intense bass playing.  As a 41 year old hard rock/metal afficionado who has been through all decades of acid rock/hard rock/metal/nu metal, from the 60's through now, I can say with certainty that this latest Maiden studio album is a hard rock/metal masterpiece!  As is the new 'Rock in Rio' DVD. Long live quality bands like Iron Maiden!!!
0446677450|5.0|This book changed my life. Now I am out of debt and preaching how to become rich by saving one dollar at a time.<BR>It is the perfect gift.
0780626966|5.0|Telling all the horror lovers in the world that they should own this is a HUGE understatement. If you don't own this already, please, by all means, GO BUY IT!!! You will not be disappointed!! I mean, what more could you ask for? You've got all seven very popular Nightmare On Elm Street sequels in ONE BOX SET! You couldn't possibly go wrong!! Plus the extra DVD, the Nighmare Encyclopedia is fantastic. Being a huge fan of horror, you could say that i was really excited when i purchased this because i definately got my money's worth...and you will too!
B000003S2M|4.0|This album and the follow-up, &quot;The Pearl&quot;, really have to be taken together in the same listen. They both feature the same sparse piano melodies over a treated Eno-scape. These two albums are my favorites for relaxation, reading, painting - you name it, they're great for it. That's why it's called &quot;Ambient&quot; music - it is made to fit in with almost any atmosphere, blending with, as Erik Satie once said, &quot;The sounds of the knives and forks at dinner&quot;.<BR>My favorite time to listen to these records is in a rainstorm, especially with distant thunder in the background. The rain sounds seem to bring out subtleties in the music that can't be heard otherwise.<BR>So if you like Eno's &quot;Ambient 1&quot; or &quot;Discreet Music&quot; or Steve Roach's &quot;Structures from Silence&quot;, this is the album for you.
B00003BDXG|1.0|A movie like this is not fun. THis is the movie where Stone apparently lost his mind, and succumbed to the popularity of Tarantino at the time (in its appice), so he accepted to shoot this sick piece of garbage.<br />Shame on Woody Harrelson for accepting to be in it. As for Julliette Lewis, she practically made sure that she will never be able to act in another role than that of crazy and disturbed women.<br />If Stone wanted to criticize the press and the people´s thirsty for violence and instant \\"heroes\\", I imagine that he could have got his hands in another screenplay, other than this atrocity.<br />I´,ve already watched a number of ultra-violent movies. But NATURAL BORN KILLERS is above them all, with something else: it´s stupid. It´s ugly. It´s bad. And it absolutely does not have the moral lesson he was supposed to give.
B00005A46T|3.0|'Iowa' is a sweet cd, don't get me wrong. But it nowhere near compares to the sheer murderous rage and beautifully grotesque lyrics and music of the debut. This cds high points are the tracks &quot;Disasterpiece&quot; (one of Slipknot's best songs), &quot;Everything Ends&quot;, &quot;Left Behind&quot; and &quot;Metabolic&quot;. The weak points are the lyrics which are far from the genius of the debut. Overall, this cd belongs in your collection but don't expect it to be better than 'Slipknot'.
B00000612P|5.0|FAntastic. Just that. It has not dated a single little bit even today. An eternity work.
B00000JCOV|5.0|... Slipknot is ... insane guys rocking out. This album is one of the greatest rock albums ever. It fuses together elements of metal, rock, hip hop, and more to form a perfect album.<BR>1) 7426100027- A freaky intro that welcomes you into the broken and sick world of Slipknot.<BR>2) (sic)- A ferocious rock song ... ....A classic.<br />3) Eyeless- A song about Corey's father. It's very insane and hard. One of the best songs on the album.<BR>4) Wait and Bleed- The single. Contains nice melody. Very well written.<BR>5) Surfacing- The new nation anthem! Listen to the chorus!!!!!<BR>6) Spit It Out- A very much hip-hop influenced song that goes 100mph.<BR>7) Tattered and Torn- A slower yet hard ...and disturbing song. <BR>8) Frail Limb Nursery- (not on the cd in stores, cds with this intro were pulled early in the albums life) Very twisted and freaky intro with a girl talking and crying.<BR>9) Purity- (not on cd either) This song is about a girl named Purity Knight who was trapped in a box underground and tortured worse than you could imagine. It was pulled due to impending lawsuits. Best rock song ever!!<BR>10) Liberate- Really hard and crazy and fast song. Awesome.<BR>11) Prosthetics- Slow song. Very disturbing and sick. Beautiful.<BR>12) No Life- One of the best songs. Very fast and hard and insane.<BR>13) Diluted- Very unique sounding song that switches up. Very cool.<BR>14) Only One- ... Listen to it.<BR>15) Scissors- Slowest song. Very sick and painful. Great.<BR>Bonus Track: Eeyore- The hidden song which is a death metal/punk sounding ...
B000000OMB|4.0|I am disappointed to hear prog rockers putting this album down as average pop of its day. I was 7 years old in 1982 when I first heard 'Only Time Will Tell' on the radio, and it was obvious then even to me that it stood out from all the ordinary synth pop at that time.    I bought this album in 1990 not knowing what to expect from the rest of it. Wetton, Howe, Downes, and Palmer combined to form a unique, atmospheric sound with a classical feel on every track that was unparalleled by anything else I'd heard at the time, until I heard GTR. The interplay between Howe's guitar work and Downes' keyboards still makes me drool with pleasure. It is easy to picture the dragon thrashing about a stormy sea at the beginning of 'Time Again'. If you only know the two hits, you are missing some fine compositions here. The one song I'll skip on occasion is 'Wildest Dreams'. It seems rushed and the vocals strained at times, but it's still a good song with some awesome drumming.  'After The War' from Astra, their third album, drives the point home better.      A band formed by members of the Alan Parsons Project called Keats had a similar sound to Asia (and APP for that matter), featuring lead singer Colin Blunstone from the Zombies. They recorded only one album.     I'll warn you, it is lighter stuff (Keats-- like APP). Also check out GTR, and for more guitar/keyboard interplay, 'Heads or Tales' by Saga.
B00005A46T|5.0|I must say, thank God for Slipknot.  As I was losing faith in the new millenium due to all the ... rap-metal (which, thankfully, seems to finally be dying off) and all the nu metal clones, along comes Slipknot and kicks my ....  While this album is not as eclectic as \\"Slipknot\\" or \\"Mate Feed Kill Repeat\\", \\"Iowa\\" is a lot cleaner and a lot heavier.  True, they could have done without the length of the title track, but the rest of the album rocks like no other since Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\".  Highlights include \\"People = Shit\\", \\"Heretic Anthem\\", and the radio-friendly \\"Left Behind\\", and IMHO, the version of  \\"My Plague\\" contained herein is MUCH better than that from the \\"Resident Evil\\" soundtrack.  However, if I had it my way, I'd put \\"Wait and Bleed\\" at the end of every Slipknot album; ... on every metal album for that matter.  Anyways, I'm now a maggot thanks to this album, so keep 'em coming guys....
B000001FVL|4.0|That song was interesting enough to make me pick up the album a few years ago, but it quickly became my least favorite song on the album. Horn and Downes quickly grab hold of you and transport you to a frightening, futuristic world and never loosen their grip until the last chord fades. Well, it is really just two guys having fun in a recording studio, but it is unfortunate that they will never be more than the answer to an MTV trivia question to my Dave Matthews loving generation. No offense Dave, you were just the first to come to mind. Each song is a miniature futuristic story in which the past always seems to be recalled as being better than the present. Get ready for a sci-fi adventure that you won't regret; you'll even find yourself in a B-movie.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|No, the storyline in Akira does not make much sense.  Akira should not be praised for its storyline because this is not where it really shines.  Where Akira does succeed (and hugely) is in drawing the viewer in and viscerally conveying the sense of chaos and disorder of Neo Tokyo and the characters' lives.  You can litterlly feel the sense of abandoning responisibility and order as you see the events unfolding. <br />Run down schools, biker gangs, corrupted politicians & police, restless teenagers, rebel dissidents, and lost people looking to cult religions all fuel the fire in Neo Tokyo.<br />Technically, the awesome city backdrops along with some of the coolest animated action scenes drawn showcase the highest quality of animation.  My jaw just about dropped when I saw what the artists did with smoke and flying projectiles.  The physics in their artistry is beautiful to behold.<br />The moody music is perfectly suited for the malaise you sense visually.  It is the unspoken guide to the city that is running itself down.<br />A lot of people enjoy movies but never realize that the real reason behind that enjoyment versus another film that bored them is that the enjoyable movie drew them in and immersed them in the world and moment that the film takes place.  Akira does this with the snap and precision of a Milestone Anime.

0441172717|4.0|That may seem like a strange heading but the more I read through the book and the more the Fremen characters became important and the saviors of the Dune universe the more I realized that Herbert tapped into the mystique of Islam from a Western vantage point.  His use of Islamic/Arabic terms is obvious and intentional and to an untrained ear it adds to the mystique.  But behind the terms is a theology that is rooted in Islam.  We cheer for the Fremen.  From the point of view of Islam, even though Dune's theology is syncretistic and a bit suspect, this is why this faith holds such an appeal.  Again, this may sound a bit strange but this was the impression the book left on me.<br />As for the sci-fi component, the universe Mr. Herbert has created is brilliant.  It is not grounded in this world or space but is a universe unto itself.  His knowledge of desert and the importance of water makes for engaging reading and one imagines the world as quite real and believable.  <br />But ultimately I was more drawn to the philosophy/spiritual component and the interest in the Messianic figure as such a figure can be found in all religions and the Islamic view of such a figure matches the Messianic figure here more than it does a Christian, even Jewish, type of figure.  This is not an Islamic theology book but this book opened my eyes a bit as to how the early Islamic community may have succeeded and why it has the appeal it does even today.  And, it seems to me, Mr. Herbert used this story as a launching pad to insert his idyllic worldview.<br />Why not five stars?  It (or I) just ran out of steam at the end.  But still one of the best fiction books I have ever read.
B00006EXCC|4.0|Despite what one reviewer said, I think &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; is a pretty decent song - but our friends at ABKCO have almost ruined it by somehow putting Mick WAY back in the mix.  It sounds to me like he's another studio down the street.
0790733226|5.0|This movie is tremendous, visually, aesthetically, conceptually.  It blends the whole spirituality/science thing with amazing dexterity.  Both fields seek meaning in this life and both ultimately end in a mystery.  So too this movie.  Jodie Foster is brilliant as a scientist who longs for meaning even in the midst of her scientific endeavors.  This movie is big all the way around.  Rather than highbrow entertainment we are drawn to the characters and really feel the character Jodie Foster portrays.<br />My only criticism is the pseudo-religious character played by Matthew McConaughey which is a more sterilized version of presenting the religious element.  But the religious element is necessary to make the whole thing work or it becomes just another sci-fi flick.  Perhaps in places the movie is a bit over the top but in the end it works.<br />Visually the film is remarkable.  It is not overladen with special effect but the special effects that are present are dynamite.  The best thing about the movie is that the observer is not a bystander but is required to engage the film and enter in.  This isn't mystical hocus pocus but the signs of a really good movie.<br />Well worth watching.  Even more than once.
B000002TWN|5.0|Preface: D'Angelo's \\"Brown Sugar\\" is and probably will always be my favorite CD. <br />My husband (then boyfriend) bought this CD after hearing the single \\"Brown Sugar\\". He was so excited to listen to it that he listened to it on the way home in the car and actually sat in the car listening to it until it was finished (30 minutes!). He was incredibly impressed with the CD, to put it mildly. He was wowed by D'Angelo's remarkable blend of jazz, neo-soul, R&B, and gospel. He was most impressed by the sheer brilliance of each and every song, saying that he didn't have (nor would he want) to skip a single song! That made me REALLY want to hear the CD, so I listened...<br />All I could say was \\"WOW\\". My favorite artist pre-Da'ngelo was Stevie Wonder (they are still my two favorites, I love both equally) and D'Angelo was proving to be mighty good competition with just his freshman album! His sensual, raspy, yet incredibly strong voice was equally impressive and was a perfet match for his music. To my astonishment, the title track (which I'd absolutely loved prior to hearing the album) was actually one of my least favorite songs on this album! The only songs I liked less are tracks #5 (the explicitly titled song about infidelity and it's possible consequences, a great song, but in my opinion, not his best) and #6 (\\"Smooth\\" - my least favorite song on the album, though that's not saying much since I really like this song!). My personal favorite song is easily \\"Higher\\", which is, quite possibly, my all-time favorite song (followed closely by \\"I Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer\\" by Stevie Wonder and \\"Change is Gonna Come\\" by Al Green). \\"Lady\\" and the cover/re-make of Smokey's \\"Cruisin'\\" are my second and third favorites, respictively. I usually dislike covers/re-makes of classics, but D'Angelo definitely did this song justice!<br />The influences of the likes of Stevie Wonder, Prince, Marvin Gaye, just to name a few, are evident, yet D'Angelo carries his own recognizable (versatile as he may be) style. I am a sucker for an amazing vocal range (a la Prince) and D'Angelo certainly fits the bill. He can move back and forth between sultry falsetto to intense baritone (and everything in between) making it sound so effortless. D'Angelo truly is a musical genius in my book.<br />D'Angelo is a gifted musician in all aspects of the word. If you enjoy soul, \\"neo-soul\\", and/or R&B, \\"Brown Sugar\\" is a must...then again, you probably already knew that!
B00005RY7X|2.0|I was really psyched that power metal is back.  I love this genre.  I love the way \\"Party Hard\\" sounds... I love the hook.  I love the use of the one-chord pulsing piano and the major scale melodies in that song.<br />Except... I was a little disappointed when...<br />The whole album sounded the same way!!!<br />These guys are talented... but they copied \\"Party Hard\\" a dozen times!  The same one-chord pulsing piano is also in \\"She is Beautiful\\" and most of the other songs!  The same major scale melody (and in most cases, even the same notes) are used!  The same structure is used for all of the songs, the same formula.<br />Doesn't the phrase \\"Let's get a party goin'..\\"<BR>sound extremely similar to:<BR>\\"She is beautiful...\\"?  That's what I'm talking about!<br />If you know nothing about music theory, then let me put it this way:<BR>ALL OF THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME.<br />They all talk about the same thing.  It had wonderful potential.  But Andrew WK lacks a LOT of diversity.  A LOT.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is simply the best Pumpkins album ever! Even though it's hard to compare their albums to eachother, this one is definitely the best. I think it has the most emotion and power on it. &quot;Soma&quot; is probably my favorite song, because of the very calm start and then slowly building up to a magnificent ending with great guitar work. This masterpiece of music has literally changed my life greatly, because this was my first rockalbum ever, and I still think it's the greatest... They must have been doing something right...
B00005R5G9|4.0|MANNEQUIN is a cute romantic comedy from the era that style forgot...the 80's.  The film features a gorgeous pre-\\"Sex and the City\\" Kim Cattrall as the titular character.<br />Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy) is a frustrated artist, living from crummy job to crummy job, and coming to the end of a rocky relationship with the ... Roxie (Carole Davis).  When kindly Claire Timkin (Estelle Getty - TV's \\"The Golden Girls\\") gives him a job at her floundering department store, he is re-united with his favorite project, a gorgeous blonde mannequin.  When the mannequin comes alive and declares that she is Emmy, an Egyptian maiden from over 1,000 years before (played by Kim Cattrall), he is more than a little amazed.  With Emmy's help, he re-invents the department store as a cutting-edge fashion centre and finds the love of his life.<br />The film also features Meshach Taylor (TV's \\"Designing Women\\") as Jonathan's flamboyant assistant Hollywood, and also stars James Spader, G.W. Bailey, Stephen Vinovich and Christopher Maher.<br />The DVD includes both fullscreen and widescreen versions of the film as well as the trailer and DVD trailers for \\"The Princess Bride: Special Edition\\" and \\"Fiddler on the Roof: Special Edition\\".  (Double-sided, single-layer disc).
B000002LQR|5.0|This is one of those special CD's where you like every single song. I'm a drummer, so it's important to have good, solid, grooves on any CD that I listen to. Chad Smith does a great job at playing some slammin' grooves. He's also a very accomplished drum clinician as well. Flea is possibly one of the most talented rock bassists of our time. John Frusciante's guitar playing on this album is nothing less than spectacular. The lyrics are truely poetic and intellectual, yet have that street edge, only found from someone who's really gone out and lived and experienced life to the fullest. <br />What can I say that hasn't already been said? This album is FAT! ALL KILLER! NO FILLER! Just a solid, funky, groovin', slammin, classic rock album! The Ultimate RHCP CD!
B000002JNJ|3.0|Pantera is one of those bands you either love or hate. Prior to Cowboys from Hell they spent many years honing their chops on classic Priest inflicted speed metal. Cowboys From Hell virtually sheds all indication of this, inciting many to accuse them of hiding their past. <br />The main problem with CFH is Terry Date's flat production, a Pantera trademark. The riffs seem heavy enough, but annoying trebley guitar tones and virtually nonexistent bass bogs them down. Vinny Paul is a decent drummer but hardly the skin-master many make him out to be. <br />This aside, there are some killer songs here. Cemetary Gates is a great ballad, and probably Pantera's finest moment. Domination and Cowboys From Hell showcase Dimebag's aggressive playing, but much of this CD leaves something to be desire.
0316666343|4.0|I am usually not a fan of the bestseller racks but was given this book by an acquaintance and found it to be a worthwhile read. Though I would not put the book on my top ten, I found the characters compelling and real. I read the book in just a few hours (very rare for me).<br />I think the author takes a very big risk and (mostly) succeeds. I really loved the compassion and honesty of Susie, and the book never becomes overly sentimental. After finishing the book, I still felt my mind drifting back to the characters and story, always a good sign.<br />I know some reviewers have complained about the meanderings of the narrator, the sexual content and the book's conception of heaven, etc., but I think a lot of these complaints are unfair and misrepresent the book. I personally didn't have a problem with any of these things, but I guess it just depends on your expectations and how literally you interpret the book. It is more about life than the death, more about compassion than judgement and more of a coming-of-age than crime novel.<br />I am definitely glad I read it, but it is not for everybody. If you like plot-driven books (or Touched by an Angel), Lovely Bones is probably not for you. But if you are open to unique and fresh storytelling, I would definitely recommend it. You don't have to agree with any perceived \\"agenda\\" by the author to enjoy it. Just be ready to stay up late because it is hard to put down . . .
B00006G8G1|4.0|Since we're STILL waiting for a \\"Live After Death\\" dvd, I guess this one should hold over most Maiden fans for now. The performance is great. They've aged a lot since Live After Death and Maiden England, but the energy is still there. My only complaint is that the camera angles change too often and too fast. Sometimes that gives me a headache. Other than that, there's no reason a Maiden fan shouldn't get this dvd. At least it's better than that awful \\"Raising Hell\\" dvd.
B000069CWE|5.0|really cool CD, i love all the remixes, especially the H! Vltg3 remix, and the Krwing remix, although there should be a LOT more singing in Aaron Lewis part in that remix, but aside from that, IT RULESS ALL!!!!!!!!!
B0000028M7|5.0|This is one of those cd's that wear out before the you get sick of it.  I love this CD and is one of my favoite, and pull it out about every 3 or 4 months and listen to it.  The best Alice in Chains ever did!!!
B000056BP4|5.0|This is a beautiful transfer to DVD. I remember when it was released in 1959 at a Real Movie Palace. The seats were reserved - beautiful programs were available ( they were like books ). The theatre was like a fine symphony hall! The sound was fantastic as this was one of the first multi- channel sound presentations. It is still breath taking today! A treasure for the generations to come as it looks great and sounds great as if it were recorded today.
0609610570|1.0|I'm a frequent reader of Management books, and bought this book on a whim because of the promise of its title.  Big mistake.<br />While these gentlemen may have had success in their respective professions, and may be well respected by many, I found their examples to be less than stellar.  This book is littered with vague, boring, and over-simplified, almost-cliche examples of how to make a good business work - Hold people accountable.  Compare them against budgets.  Challenge them with questions.  <br />By the time I finished this book (which was much longer than typical because of the above), I found myself feeling that the authors had written this because they wanted an avenue to brag about their accomplishments.  Perhaps the book would be better if they had spent more time identifying what worked and what didn't, instead of acting as if everything they touched turned to gold...the real world is not that way, and I can't imagine that Bossidy's career has been that way, either.<br />As a comparison, I would recommend that any reader pick up Good to Great (by Jim Collins) rather than this book - this book pales in insight, and as a source of fresh, applicable ideas.  I learned much more from reading 'The 7 Habits' than I did from this book.
0446677450|5.0|EXXXXcellent book. I feel cheated because my DAD did not have access to this kind of information to teach me when I was young. As a matter of fact, this book is bang on on its depiction of how we all grow up feeling about money. It should be listed on whatever booklist says most influencial book of the decade or whatever. I actually am about to read it all over again, cause I want to cement its ideas in my 34 yr old brain!!<br />PAtrick ( BArbados).
B00003CXE7|2.0|This has to be one of the very worst films to acquire an Oscar for Best Picture. I haven't seen many of the other contenders in that class -- I hear \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" is worth avoiding even more -- but this must have been a quirk of how the voting split that year. I figure the Politically Active types split between \\"Brockovich\\" and \\"Traffic,\\" the Art for Art's Sake vote went to \\"Chocolat,\\" leaving a bare plurality voting for this over \\"Crouching Tiger...\\" because it wasn't subtitled. Or subtext'd.<br />My first exposure to this was on video, so perhaps I missed something that's more evident on the big screen. I can't imagine what it would be, though. The battle scenes are impressive in a testostorone-charged way, I guess. The Colosseum is very lifelike, and so is Mr. Crowe. I almost believed that he wanted his warriors to \\"Unleash hell.\\" (And yes, I recognized that he was a soldier by duty, not desire, and therefore not a kill-em-all type.) He fought well enough in the gladiator scenes, which I suppose is the point...<br />That's as well as I can do for compliments on this. The setup is obvious, the payoff is transparent -- I stopped watching halfway through and I was able to guess 90% of What Happens Next. I didn't care how Maximus plotted his revenge, if Commodus was served with appropriate justice or ... or pretty much anything  else. Nobody is interesting enough to be likable. Commodus is almost creepy enough to be disliked, and that's as much of an impression as anything in the film made on me.<br />Just don't bother. If you want a revenge-fueled battle-focused period piece, see The Patriot instead. ....<br />Two stars, because I don't care enough to give it one.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|...This movie is goofy and ridiculous on the surface but the mode of humor definitely scratched my itch!  Will Ferrell and Ben Stiller really milk the over-the-top fashion industry with a python-esque poke at our society.<br />Thanks for the delicious, clever and off-the-wall satire.  Loved it!  Christine Taylor is NOT hard on the eyes either...
0441003257|4.0|An hilarious satire of apocalyptyc doomsayers of all time. Pratchett and Gaiman tell us that humanity,what whit human potential for greed,hatred,bigotry,violence,stupidity,terrorism,egoism,indifference,shortsightedness,pollution,is still too crazy to really destroy herself. Even the horsemen of the apocalypse are confused. I liked it!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's new CD debut Let Go is totally awesome!!! It takes about what she feels and thinks about with out boring you. She is also so pretty and i love her new CD!!! My friends Jassmine and Edward (especially Edward) really like this and listens to it often. We have good taste...<BR>l8er and as Avril says \\"rock on\\"
B00005RY7X|3.0|Many people say either you love this guy, or you hate him. I'm living proof that it is not necessarily true. Altough I do like what he does, half of the songs on this record don't really do anything to me. But the real reason I call myself a fan of this guy is just for the pure concept of his work. Instead of following a trend or writing the kind of lyrics that will guarantee him a following mostly composed social outcasts (much like Korn), he simply does his own thing. His &quot;followers&quot; won't just be people angry at &quot;the world&quot;, but people who just want to have a good time. On top of everything, most of these songs have a retro feel to them, making them refreshing to listen to. For the most part they sound like a metal band that, instead of going to the limits of heaviness, add keyboards and hooks to make the songs more accessible and catchy. Most (if not all) of the songs are anthem-like, which explains the simplicity of the lyrics (something alot of people seem to complain about). So, what we have here is the near-perfect party album for rockers and people who aren't really into dance music. <br />If you're not into either of his 2 current sinlges (&quot;Party Hard&quot; and &quot;She Is Beautiful&quot;, then it?s very likely that you?ll be disapointed with this.  <br />The album also includes a new and retitled version of Girls Own Juice (available on the EP, AWKGOJ) I just wish they would have included &quot;We Want Fun&quot;.<br />I like to end all my album reviews by naming a song for those who wish to download a good representation of the album, without spoiling any suprises. In this case, I name &quot;Got To Do It&quot;. It's my least favorite song on the record, and in comparison to the rest, has an unfortunate &quot;filler material&quot; feeling to it. So if you like that song, you?ll LOVE the rest.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series represents ten of the most riveting hours of television that I've ever seen. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg gave us a stirring elaboration on what was begun with \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" I feel that what makes any war movie worth its weight is the ability to transport the audience into the meatgrinder of combat. \\"Band of Brothers\\" does more than that. The mini-series format allows us to see ALL human dimensions surrounding war:...<br />To see more, I highly recommend watching this dvd set. The most poignant parts of the series are the comments and recollections<BR>of the real heroes of Easy Company. In our post-September 11th<BR>world, we needed a reaffirmation of what it means to be a hero.<BR>This series gave that to me. I hope viewing it will give you at least that much.

Sebastian finds a greater challengein the pure, faithful Annette, the new school headmaster's daughter played by Reese Witherspoon. This is an excellent movie with a great plot and suberb acting, espeacilly by Sarah Michelle Gellar. The ending is a different twist to the movie, but it is perfect in everyway and the best ending to a movie I've ever seen. If you have not seen this movie yet, buy it.
0790733226|5.0|It seems to me that the only people who didn't like this movie either have short attention spans, were expecting Star Wars, or are offended by the very idea of atheism.  If you want more than the usual Hollywood [stuff], watch this movie.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This movie was great! Ryan Phillipe acted well, Sarah Michelle Gellar looked beautiful as always, Selma Blair was hysterical, Joshua Jackson, well let's not talk about his character, and Reese Witherspoon was typical superb. Watch it!
B00005JKWJ|5.0|I feeling Dr. Snipes is doing great work in Hollywood as a man of color. He is proud of being an African American. Vin Disel is ashame to admit he's African American, I feel that is the reason he wears the bold head. I will alway support Dr. Snipes throughout his career as an actor. Go Wesley! I can't wait for  Blade 3. God Bless You!
B00001PE4D|5.0|This movie has it all. It does not play just one sex because both sexes continue to upstage the other. From the very beginning it is hard to tell who is the puppet and who is themaster. I highly recommend this movie. One of the a few good movies made this year.
B00005A46T|1.0|I only gave them the 1 star for trying to make a good album. I just think they tried way too hard on iowa.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This remake is very good. Gellar, Phillippe and Witherspoon are great actors and the ending is sad. Very enjoyable movie.
1878424319|5.0|The four agreements is an astonishing book that can change your life if you understand the underlying message.<BR>Some of the greatest truths are from simple concepts.  When you are pondering about the essence of life, the last thing you want to be is confused over wording or foreign concepts. Mr. Ruiz does an excellent job at communicating his truths with brief, easy to understand language. And although the concepts seem simple, they are very difficult to follow. However, Mr. Ruiz offers a way to improve your life - a simple, yet powerful way, to become stress free and happy! I would also recommend The Power of Now by Eckhard Tolle.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This film was incredible and yet intriguingly naughty. Great for all audiences who are of age.
B000068TPN|4.0|war movie, starring Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott as a pair of Air Cav bosses who successfully rattle up a much larger Vietnamese force in the early stages of the war. Occasionally trad, naive and cliche, but very moving film that reminds us of the home front battles that soldier families must endure, and that we didn't always lose in that fateful war. I haven't read the book yet, and now virtually nothing about Col. Moore or Ia Drang, so I'll avoid the military criticism, and say overall it was enjoyable and you won't feel the two and a half hours go by.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I THINK EVERYONE MUST SEE SEVERAL TIMES, BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND EVERYTHING IN THIS MOVIE; FUN, LOVE AND CRUELTY. RYAN PHILLIPPE WAS GREAT!
B000065U1N|4.0|If you want a good action movie, this one is for you.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I have seen this movie 3 times. Oh! I love that so much. I love them, Sarah, Reese, Ryan and Blair. So now I want to have that. If I were you, I would see it.
B000002KET|4.0|Way before IRON MAIDEN,DEF LEPPARD and VAN HALEN,there was BLACK SABBATH,the group that really created the genre.Songs like the title track,SABBRA CADABRA and KILLING YOURSELF TO LIVE remain timeless.We've got to credit the group for trying to get a little fancy with the instrumental FLUFF.The rest of the stuff simply does not work at all.However,there are a prelude to the next lp who will fulfill the ingredients missing here.Don't you think that the sleeve look a lot like many IRON MAIDEN discs?You can resume BLACK SABBATH well with WE SOLD OUR SOUL... or PAST LIVES,but as the man say it's fun to have originals instead of those endless repackaging that make the industry roll.Just start with SABOTAGE.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I saw the sequel (Crue Intentions 2)before I saw the original and I was disappointed. But the original is a phenomenal erotc-thriller. Gellar is really talented! Which of course she proved that in 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'... I've never saw her so evil. She can play any part great! Good character, the helpless victim, and the evil villianess! I loved this movie (don't watch the second!)
B00000I3JM|5.0|The Blue Nile got their break when an Edinburgh hi-fi company, Linn Products accidentally heard a demo of Tinseltown in the Rain (which is on this album), and was so impressed it gave the band money to record an album. Everyone who was fortunate enough to hear this debut album, Walk Across the Rooftops, in 1983 became fans for life. Alhough Stay was a minor hit, the Blue Nile were never really a singles band and their fanbase remained small but devoted. The Blue Nile are particualrly good at slow ballads. The rhythm section is just a steady pitter-patter of drum machines, on top of which beautifully orchestrated horns, strings and synths spiral upwards, lifting the listener to new heights of musical wonder (yes itâs that good). This is not rock: think Sim ple Minds circa New Gold Dream or even  Frank Sinatra (with Nelson Riddle) or the soundtrack to a really classy 40s movie - lots of strings, low-key ambience and the jewel in the crown, Paul Buchananâs achingly beautiful vocals. I predict Blue Nile will u ndergo a revival - Walk Across the Rooftops and the follow-up, Hats are just the kind of thing people today would think was great â~trip-hopâ or chill-out music.<br />Some of the tracks are more ambient pieces than songs  (Automobile Noise), but for my money Stay, Heatwave, Walk Across the Rooftops and the astounding Tinseltown in the Rain are four defining musical moments of the 80s.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Phillipe gains my respect as an actor in this movie. Kumble has directed a great movie here that was the one of the biggest surprises. Gellar is teriffic as Katherine and Reese Witherspoon is great, as usual. This movie is funny, and the end, it is a story about redemption that ranks it among my all-time favorites.
0316666343|4.0|Its an excellent book.  At times it does drag a bit, you're curious to see what happens to the characters, but overall, I really thought this was an amazing book.  The narration of Suzie was extremely interesting, just from a completely different point of view.  I enjoyed the fact that she was separate yet a part of everyone's thoughts. The frustration of her not being able to do anything was evident as well as the interesting concept of the struggle of whether to be involved in the lives of those she left behind.  I highly recommend this book, it will make you go through several emotions and you'll be left to ponder some interesting questions when you finish it.
0316666343|1.0|A beautiful idea wasted. It looks more like Susie did not actually die, she was too involved with the eartly things, the sex, and the mundane characters. I thought we will be taken to a new level of understanding from the heaven, but Susie never left the earth. The book is hard to read and teaches nothing
B00005Y228|3.0|I had never heard one of Kylie's albums before this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a good pop record with some really catchy songs. The only song I don't like is &quot;Give It To Me&quot;, which is just filler in my opinion. The 2 bonus tracks are good, especially &quot;Boy&quot;, however, &quot;Butterfly&quot; doens't really fit in with the rest of the songs as it is more of a hardcore club song, which sounds like a remix. I understand it's from one of her past albums. It's still good though. Anyway, I give this album a solid B+
B0000025DT|5.0|Outstanding, outstanding, outstanding.<BR>This is ELO's masterpiece. Jeff Lynne is a genius behind the production chair. There is not one bad song on the record. Any time that I play it, I play the entire record. This record set a standard for the synthesizer and how to apply various unorthodox sounds in a cohesive manner. I never get tired of listening to this.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I've downloaded a few songs from Tatu, and I must say that I really love them. The only problem is having to wait until this CD is released. I rated it the five stars based on the songs of theirs I have heard, so I'm hoping this CD won't be a flop. ^-^;
0789723107|5.0|Don't Make Me Think is like an operator's license for web site building software.  An internet developer shouldn't be allowed to \\"turn the key\\" until they've digested this book.  <br />Steve Krug's book is a quick read (190 pages) filled with insightful, entertaining and practical prose for those involved in internet development.  He shows us what does and doesn't work, and then explains why.  His extensive research into usability permeates every page.<br />The book itself is a stellar example of usability.  Every graphic adds value and every paragraph amplifies the point.  Color is effectively used, but not exclusively.  Steve practices the techniques that he preaches.  For example, the chapter called Omit needless words [The art of not writing for the web] is only 5 pages long.  <br />Finally, he presents practical ways to perform usability testing (huh, what's that?) into the development process.  Imagine knowing how user's will actually use your site.<br />I recommend this book to everyone involved in internet development.  I've even assigned it to my children (ages 10 and 13) as they start their journey into internet development.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|Ryan Adams in The Real Thing.  I hate to admit that because the hype-machine worked overtime in plugging him as such, and &amp; I am by nature reluctant to cozy up to the spin cycle.  Plus, I'd never been overly impressed by his band Whiskeytown, nor had his &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; album stuck with me, even though I certainly listened to it a while lot -- still can't remember a single song off it, though. I wanted to write him off dismissively as a punter, on the List of the Over-Rated, behind Lucinda Williams [and all of my ex-lovers!].  <br />But a few weeks ago, I bought a copy of his &quot;Gold&quot; album and the more I listen to it, the more excited I become by it.  The opening track, an ode to New York (no, not the Frank Sinatra one!), wow!  What a song!  Every time I hear those opening guitar strums and the swells of the organ, I am made happy beyond any reasonable limits.  It's potent, &amp; it's organic -- just an &quot;energy&quot; there in the grooves.  Yeah, sometimes he comes off as being over-confident, like an over-indulged suburban punk, but man!, when he hits it, he hits it.  And on &quot;Gold,&quot; he hits it more than he misses.
B00005HYH5|5.0|For those used to the later Pink Floyd, this will come as a complete surprise.  But after a few hearings, the musical fun will come through.  And while it is Pink Floyd with all that implies, it is more of an exploration of the groups musical tastes and boundaries.  <br />If you like rock as opposed to dance music, this is a must-have album - first in that it contains some truely classic and ground breaking music and second in that (however obscurely) the music has managed to leave its imprint on almost everything to follow.  <br />The live tracks are grand - and deserve (though it isn't necessary) to be played loudly.  For me, the introduction to &quot;Astronome Domine&quot; and &quot;Saucerful of Secrets&quot; have the power to drag the listener in with little effort.  Unlike many similar pieces, the variety of sounds and dynamic range make the music unlike much you might hear outside a concert hall - in a couple of tracks the music fades to a very quiet contemplative mood only to swell quickly into a loud, noisy contrast.  <br />The studio tracks are wildly different sounding almost completely different -much quieter (though far from always quiet) with odd vocal backgrounds (and a few surprising add ons).  &quot;Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict&quot; is a delight and completely unexpected and &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; is a quite and rich track featuring acoustic guitar, voice and birds.  <br />If the pieces on this album were played separately, a casual listener might well conclude that they were played by entirely different people with very different musical interests, but played together, its clear that there is a strong commonality and that these four disparate musicians capable of going in very different directions are still somehow forging a sound, mood and presence that is unique and unforgettable.<br />Not all of the music here is a success - but even the tracks that are less strong are worth listening to and thinking about.  <br />An album strangely and sadly underheard and underestimated.
B000062TU1|4.0|It is Harry Potter no doubt.  The production is fine and the caracters, one of the book's good points, are well represented.  My kids loved it and I did to, so it is a familly happening.  A nice way to spend a rainy evening.
B00005YW4H|5.0|i do not normally listen to jazz style, but i wanted a slower jazz-style album to supplement my collection and i bought this cd just after it was released.  <BR>norah's voice is just beautiful.  her intonations are throaty and mature.  i was surprised to find out she was so young!  <BR>her rendition of cold cold heart is better than the original, by far.  i'll admit that her own music could use more variety and pick me up but overall it's a wonderful background relaxation cd.  i definitely recommend this for any person who appreciates good sound and smooth music, with an intimate tone.
B000068PQ0|5.0|A friend of mine was playing this album at a barbecue a few weeks ago, and I thought the sound was fresh and pleasant, and I knew I hadn't heard it before. I inquired if this was the new Coldplay album... &quot;Oh no...this is the new Flaming Lips&quot; he responded proudly. <BR>I had heard *of* the band, although I hadn't actually heard their music...but knew I had to get the album for myself. A few weeks later I purchased the CD and immediately unwrapped it for a listen at work. Within the first five seconds of &quot;Fight Test&quot; I was smiling and thoroughly enjoying the groove. Ever since, I've been recommending this album to everyone I know. Well, I guess the joke's on me, because their are &quot;Lips&quot; fans coming out of the woodwork all over town!
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth's fifth 'observation' is a chilling and emotional journey through various textures and colours.  This (and previous releases)has some of most unique and jarring songwriting to ever materialize.  The highlight of this album is the fourth track, 'The Drapery Falls'.  This 12 minute epic is well worth the price of admission from start to finish, particularly at the 4:30-6:00 min mark.  As a music fan I highly recommend this and after exposure, you will probably ignore your Korn and blink 182 albums as this album is untouchable.  The songs take hold and never let go, even hours later.  Buy this album!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was unsure of what to expect when I purchased this album...I don't usually buy something just on the strength of one single. &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; has been all over the radio, and I found myself liking it more and more.<BR>THEN I bought the album. Wow. The entire thing is just hypnotic. It's just lovely, melodic, romantic, and even a touch old-fashioned, but then it's completely fresh.<BR>Ever feel like your ears are clenching when you hear the shrill and brittle tones of some female pop stars? (And wonder why they're still so successful?) Well, Norah Jones is a complete departure from these whiny women. She's sultry, soft, vibrant, and all-around enthralling. <BR>This CD seems to be on constant rotation at my house, ever since I first unwrapped it. She's a hipper, more acoustic, more earthy Diana Krall, with crisp arrangements and lovely phrasing. She really takes you with her on all of her songs. <BR>I love &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; &quot;The Painter Song&quot; and of course, &quot;The Nearness of You...&quot; All classics. But then, I never skip over the other songs to get to these - the entire collection just flows, and you don't want to miss a moment!<br />Buy this album! You won't be sorry...
B000002LRX|5.0|Everything has been said about this album already pretty much. It is no question my favorite album of all time.  The only thing I can really contribute is that this is music you FEEL; the album is so high on emotion and so moody that it will strongly influence how you feel when you listen to it and will bring back memories of most likely sad or depressing times.  Even so, there is much beauty in Angel Dust.  Best words to express the mood is: Regretfulness, Depression, Hope, Anger, Lust and Insanity.  I would demand that EVERYONE purchases this album.  It is still in my heavy rotation 10 years after it came out.
0316666343|3.0|This was a very touching story but very hard to read. The author will start out decribing someone or something and spend several pages and just when you want to know more she skips to another character or characters and does the same with them! A few chapters later she goes back to the characters she left a few chapters ago and spend a few pages on them and jump around again I had to read parts of the book over again in order to remember who was who. As it was we have no clue if Susie's Mom and Dad got back together again or not. There was no closeure to that part of the story. Susie never mentioned  why her mom and Len her lover broke up. We only know that one minute she was hot after him both in the hospital and again the back room of a shopping mall. The next mention of them is that she is moving to California and that whatever they had, had evaporated in thin air. Many trists do, but it would have been nice if the author could have covered the end of their relationship at some point in the book. Instead she did the same as she did with Abie and her husband &quot;Im here now&quot; she said in the hospital and very little is mentioned about it again. When Susie had began to speak about the future years&quot;her grandmother passing&quot; etc. would have been the perfect opprotunity to mention that &quot;Mom and Dad renewed their vows and are living close to their new granddaughter&quot; Or &quot;Mom and Dad faced the fact that thier marraige was over and Mom moved back to california and len soon followed.&quot; But as I say it was a hard book to keep up with all the characters, when the story is so broken up with lots of other stories. I would also loved to see more dialouge surounding the children and their mother and how they cope with her now and renew the relationship that she had broken by leaving. Because this is what would happen if this were to occur in real life! Does anyone see my point?
B000068CNX|5.0|This collection is better than the first one. It contains all second season episodes. The special features could still be better but they are stepped up a little bit. There is optional commentary for the episodes, The One With The List and The One With The Prom Video, as opposed to just the commentary on one episode from season one. Like the first season's look into Central Perk, there is an interactive view of Monica and Rachel's apartment. There is a quiz on how well you know your Friends and after completing the quiz, Phoebe's Smelly Cat music video plays. There is Friends of Friends which shows clips of guest stars that appeared during season 2. A new feature is What's Up With Your Friends? This shows clips of each of the main six characters. Not a great feature, but some of the best clips are included. P>Season Two of Friends has many key episodes, such as when Ross and Rachel get together, Richard is introduced, and Joey moves out. The factors of no commercials, extra footage seamlessly edited into all the episodes and some special features added to all the great episodes of season two are enough to make any Friends fan buy this collection.
B000068PQ7|5.0|Spare and stark, with mystical and opaque lyrics, Gene turned in another winner.  This is an album for the ages, by turns brooding, peaceful, joyful, but always thoughtful.  Buy it for \\"Spanish Guitar\\" alone.
B00004Y87O|5.0|This is the best movie ever made in my oppinion. I am 32 years old and have been an avid John Carpenter fan since I saw Escape From New York when it was released in 1982. Kurt Russell is the ULTIMATE Anti-Hero! Although he does his best &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, he is the coolest. Movies that are made now, do not even hold a candle to this movie. There is not the typical, generation X, action sequence one after the other. It is a spectacular movie about a man named Snake Plisken who is a decorated war veteran, who has lost all of his faith in society after the entire country has become a hard core police state. It takes place in 2002, which was the future in 1982 and the Whole Island of Manhattan is a prison. Snake has to go in and rescue the President in 24hrs, before the mini exploseves that were secretly logged in his arteries explode. You will LOVE this movie and if you are like me, will see it over 200 times.
B00006EXDM|5.0|Like that other 60s Titan, The Beatles, the Stones are hard to nail down with a greatest hits set.  But Hot Rocks hits all the highlights, at least for their 1960s work.  It is an excellent introduction to the group, I first bought it on vinyl in 1984 at the age of 18 and was hooked on the group from that point forward, as well as a historical overview of just how much they grew musically over a relatively short period of time.  The sound is a vast improvement over what came before on CD.  In particular Mother's Little Helper and 19th Nervous Breakdown which sounded on previous releases like they were copies of copies.  You can hear the sound of the tape stretching on one point during 19th Breakdown.  That is all fixed here.  This is essential.
B0000687L5|5.0|I have never in my life seen a movie in that,after watching it,would inspire me to thnk upon my own life and the direction it is going to take as this movie.The Legend of 1900 has touched me so deeply that it is indeed hard to even come up with the words to say that would show how much this movie means to me.The story of this Piano player,the greatest in the world.Abandoned on ship in 1900,he quickly gains the name of that year as no one else knows what to call him.He grows into a man on this ship.His only escape however is playing a piano.Everyone who sees him knows how good he is.But while the fans are cheering and the people are worshipping 1900,he is secretly battling himself.Trying to overcome the fear of the true and real world,while knowing he is someone on this ship.I cannot tell you everything because I would ruin the story.But I will Highly reccomend this movie to anyone and everyone who has not seen it.It truly will touch you.In many ways 1900 is more like you and I than we care to think.He is a man who is good at what he does and content where he is,yet knows there is so much more to life than the ship in which he abides.
0679411585|5.0|About a week after the movie was released, I received a call from my 32 yr old son late one night. He was still having a hard time talking, after watching the move, but just wanted to call and say, &quot; thanks dad, I never had a clue.&quot; I think this book,  should be required reading for all high school students, and especially their teachers. If they &quot;had a clue&quot; it might have turned out different. Hate the war, not the warrior.
B0000640VO|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I left smiling. I looked around at the rest of the audience and could tell that everyone felt like I did. I took everyone I knew to the theater to see this movie, and everyone felt the same. It is not a girl movie or a boy movie. It's about anyone who appreciates life, or needs to.<br />The DVD is amazing. It comes in a wonderful package that can show a grown or young Amélie. Not only is it a visually stimulating package inside and out, but the 2 disc set comes complete with a very enjoyable commentary (can you say you've sat through any other commentary besides the Simpsons?) and the audition tapes are worth the DVD on their own. I won't waste your time telling you what's on this DVD, since it tells you below. I'll just tell you that if you have a DVD player or plan to get one, get this DVD.<br />If you don't, get the VHS, because this film will make you feel a goodness that won't leave you.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spellbinding tail By a Master storyteller and Artist! This film elevates Animation to a true ART FORM. Miyazaki has now become a \\"Living National Treasure\\" for Japan. This film is The Winner at the Berlin Film Festival and the all time, top Grossing film in Japan. This has to be the pinnacle of achievement in a lifetime of producing masterworks. I can only pray Miyazaki Sama is well aware of this and will banish any thought of retirement.<BR> I watched the Japanese region 2 DVD in both Japanese and French with the English Subtitles. <BR> The Animation is wonderful, the facial expressions and body language of Chihero/Sen, are exceptional. The Color is outstanding, the scenery is as usual captivating. The music and sound track are wonderful. The \\"camera work\\" rivals Kurosawa's. The \\"Sets\\" are filled with astonishing detail; each re-viewing allowing new delightful discoveries, such as a framed picture in the cottage at the end of the film which is obviously \\"Kiki\\" in the style of a Whitman sampler box. (or the credits of the film Nausicaå) The film seems much shorter than it is, the dubbed version should be well tolerated by youngsters.<BR> The whole effect is Fanciful and should be amazing to all viewers; even Japanese have told me that the \\"Bathhouse of the Gods \\" looked strangely Korean to them. The inhabitants of the bathhouse however, look to be straight from Hokusai's Manga. You see? I am spellbound.<BR> Miyazaki has remained true to himself, this is again, a film which delights and warms the heart of both adults and children. <BR> BTW: The Male lead is a \\"River Boy\\" or Kappa, so well known, he is hardly viewed as mythological.<BR><BR>    <br />     Update/Edit: I have since viewed this Film at the Baxter Ave. CiniPlex in Louisville. This is a very nice \\"Art House\\" theater complex. Viewing Spirited Away in this theater was in itself a treat.<BR>     Acting: I have to give credit to the voice acting for Chihiro and \\"big sister\\" Lin; it is very well done. I foundthe \\"little girl\\" voice of sen charming. The music was excellent, and matched the mood and action well for my sensibilities.  Viewing on a large screen was another treat. See if you can spot the zipper in the father's fly! Also watch Chihiro's fluid movements as she skips down the last three steps to the door of the Boiler room, and her movements on inside to see Kamaji, the boiler man.<BR>     The name of the Bath House seems to be Abura-ya as stated over the main door. This, I am told, is a reference to old time places of entertainment identified by the paper oil lanterns hanging outside. <BR>     The shops in the street have names ... one, passed by the \\"stink monster\\" is called \\"Fairy Soup Counter\\" The characters on the ground floor elevator door reads \\"Upper\\" the next one \\"second heaven\\" and the top floor reads \\"Heaven\\"<BR>      I viewed the film twice, once alone and then with my elevenyear old Niece; for full enjoyment always view a Miyazaki film with a child in accompaniment. <BR>    DEVI****
0446608955|4.0|This is a charming little book you will want to cozy up with and devour in a single sitting.  Goosebumps of humor and melancholy occur as you immerse yourself in this nostalgic essay.  But, not to give anything away, three-quarters of the way through the &quot;light bulb&quot; goes off in your head and you'll find yourself detached from the finale as it goes through its predictable story-telling paces.  Unfortunately, we have seen and read too many of this genre not to be jaded.  Sparks, however, is a gifted storyteller with a wonderful ear for dialogue and a clever wit.
B000002JOH|5.0|Man, Cowboys From Hell was great, but they really outdid themselves here.  This is one of my favorite albums ever, and I own alot.  If there's one thing that can be said about this album, it's that it's alot heavier than CFH, but just as listenable and solid.  Songs like \\"Mouth For War\\", \\"Walk\\", and many more will just kick your ass.  The part in \\"Rise\\" where Phil screams \\"What's wrong with their minds?\\" just rules.  Phil screams his head off here, but it doesn't sound bad, it sounds great!  Dimebag Darrel's riffs are nothing short of amazing, and his solos! WOW! Then listen to Vinnie Paul.  His double bass is just insane.  Rex has always done a great job with the bass, and you can hear him pretty well too.  There are a few ballads, which is nice.  I like \\"This Love\\" better, but both of them are pretty good.  Basically, if you like your music heavy with GOOD musicianship, you can't go wrong with this.  I also recommend Cowboys From Hell.
1892065290|5.0|I cannot stress enough how superior Martin's writing is to the typical or even the exceptional fantasy author.  I have read hundreds of fantasy authors since my teenage years (I am now 33), and NO ONE has come close to Martin's ability to draw me in to his world, into the minds and hearts of his varied characters, and unknowingly, into the complex, intriguing, and hellish vortex of events that chronicle the disintegration of their society.  I have spoken with many fantasy lit. fans and most agree that Martin's work is shockingly good, usually the best they have ever read.<br />As other reviewers here have noted, Martin is a master of character development.  He grabs hold of your imagination and has you pining woefully after the distasteful and ambitious characters, reviling the altruistic ones, and changing your mind once per volume!  There is a proliferation of characters, each an intriguing mixture of human traits, and somehow you eagerly remember them all.<br />It is also true there is much violence, though you would not suspect so at first.  Martin cleverly draws you into an enticing, peaceful, snow-covered kingdom, seen through the eyes of the royal family's children.  The story unwinds carefully, ominously, and fiendishly.  It wasn't until the third book that I realized this deception!  The layers are complex and sophisticated.  Don't be surprised if you are up all night reading.<br />What else can I say?  Except to throw your \\"Wheel of Time\\" series in the garbage.  You will be embarassed to have it on your bookshelf after reading this series.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This is the best album ever. At least of the ones I've heard, and thats about 400 to 500 albums. Okay, some of you may think I'm some sort of Creed freak, however, they're not even my favorite band, they just make good albums. Human Clay is an album full of great songs with lyrics that people can relate to. Heres my song to song review:<br />Are You Ready?: The albums opening track was supposed to sound like Led Zeppelin, but it doesn't, still a great opening track.(9/10)<br />What If: The original reason I bought the album. Heavy with an awesome instrumental part in the middle.(10/10)<br />Beatiful: A song about betrayal. Great rocker.(9/10)<br />Say I: Another good rocker, but not as good as the last two.(8.5/10)<br />Wrong Way: Used in the End of Days Soundtrack. Like What If, has a good instrumental part in the middle.(9/10)<br />Faceless Man: Best song Creeds ever written. Read the lyrics to figure out who the Faceless Man is, shouldn't be hard.(10/10)<br />Never Die: Great track. Cool middle part.(9.5/10)<br />With Arms Wide Open: The megahit. Overplayed, but still pretty good.(8/10)<br />Higher: Spent 18 weeks at #1, not bad. A good solid song, but also overplayed.(9.5/10)<br />Wash Away Those Years: Softer song, with passionate vocals. One of the best on the album.(10/10)<br />Inside Us All: Good song, but the solo at the end makes it better.(9/10)<br />As you see I've given all the songs good ratings. They're all good. This was the first album I, bought. I can count how many times I've listen to it, but I've never gotten bored of it and probably never will. Worth ever penny.
B00005JKWJ|3.0|First was new, original, and exciting.  We didn't know in the first one that Blade could destroy a room full of 500 vampires by himself, but in the sequel we pretty much get the idea that he is like that dude 'michael'.<br />For those geeks who keep talking about Donnie Yen, yes he is awesome.  He actually gets about 10 minutes in this movie before he is the first killed off.
0385720920|4.0|Chuck is an awesome writer.  i have loved everysingle book of his that i have read.
B00003CXFG|4.0|This is actually a good sci-fi movie. although the plot may not be the most original, a small group of people stranded on a deserted barran planet with scary creepie crawlies in the dark, however it truly makes up for it in suspense and characters. Like the original &quot; Alien&quot;, this movie builds up the tension by only giving you glimpses of the creatures. A flash here, a flashe there, some noise...it all works to build up the suspense. The plot may contain some contriviances, but they are pretty irrelevant. After all this is a popcorn flick, a movie to be watched and enjoyed but not broken down into believability. <BR>The characters are what stands out the most however in this movie, espeically that of Riddick, played by Vin Diesel. The first time I saw this film, his performance stood out the most. Riviting and suprisingly showing depth, Vin made this criminal more than a cardboard cut out. By the end you find yourself voting for him, the convict and murderer. of course it helps, that he is built the way he is, with that voice.....<BR>This is a good movie, go and treat yourself to it. Definately worth adding to your home collection too.
0618164413|5.0|My sister recently saw this book at ... and asked me if I could get it for less on Amazon (of course!). <br />If you love Curious George, this collection of stories will not let you down.<br />My nephews are ages 2 and 5 and they both love it! Although, I think my sister likes it more!
B00005QCVY|4.0|I know, I know, this movie is easily a five star movie.  Hands down one of my all-time favorites.  However, I want extras on a dvd.  This has a few, but a few more would have nice for a motion picture of this magnitude
044022165X|5.0|There's something about southern drawls and humid summer afternoons that intrigues loyal Grisham readers to \\"The Rainmaker,\\" but it's a thought provoking plot which keeps them.  <br />A young Missipppi lawyer named Rudy finds himself in dismay after learning the hard and fast cut-throat world of law.  As the apprentice of a slick, ambulance-chasing veteran he feels ready to give up his chosen profession when he stumbles upon the case of a lifetime.  A young man of the surounding town is diagnosed with terminal cancer and has spent countless dollars on medical treatment which has provenitslef useless.  Medical insurance, which he paid faithfully, is denied and the young man is left with little more than a death sentence.  Rudy, despite contradicting advice, takes on the case of proving the inhumane treatment and negelct of the insurance companies.  He proves the companies unlawfully denied medical expenses to the ill man and won his family millions.<br />I enjoyed the witty writing style and the frank nature of the book.  Grishman probed into the real life those with medical problems and the harsh realties they must face.<br />I highly recommend this book to all those who love legal drama.  Just have a tissue handy for the tears guaranteed to be straming down your face.
B000005IRG|5.0|You will probably not like this album when you hear it first.  I didn't.  I didn't even like it the second or third time.  But gradually, ever so gradually, i realized that this is one of the best punk albums ever made.  Actually, it's one of the best albums ever made.  It's like nothing else.  Tom Verlaine's voice grows from annoying to absolutely gripping.  And, of course, Marquee Moon is possibly the best song in the history of music.  I don't even know if this is punk, per se.  They just have a bad picture of the cover.  But it's music done right, and done best.  So guide yer frickin' light over to Marquee Moon.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Love this CD.  Can't even put into words how much I enjoy listening to this.  I would recommend it to anyone &amp; everyone.
B00004Z459|5.0|I think Linkin Park is awsome and they are the best band on earth.   BOOYAH.
6302765536|5.0|You can't really make a second movie much better than this! It has all the excitement and fun as the first, and even way more. This time, Kevin (Culkin) runs into the same two burglars, this time in the Big Apple. But he tries to hide out in a hotel by using his dad's credit card, after he loses them in the airplane of course. He goes into the wrong plane, and the rest of the family are off to France. He finds out how scary the city is, including drunk bums and an old, ugly pigeon feeding lady who later becomes his friend. When the burglars finally catch up with Kevin, he manages to escape to his uncle's old, beat up house and do an encore of tricks there, too! When Kevin gets chased to Central Park, tth pigeon lady and some fireworks help the cops to catch the burglars, maybe once and for all. But again, it's up to his mom to find Kevin. Beautiful sequel to the first one!
B000066NW0|5.0|I LOVE this CD!! It is so great!  The songs are awesome and i just love her voice!  My favorite song is Sk8ter Boi.  Dude, that song is the best!  I hope she comes out with more CD's eventually!
B000007T2Z|4.0|I'm not sure how to rate this album.  It defies rating.  The first track, \\"Dead Flag Blues,\\" is so affecting it's scary.  This is not an album (or a band) that you can merely listen to.  You have to experience it.  This is why I give it four stars, instead of five.  Godspeed You Black Emperor! is not an accessible band by any means.  Pop this baby in on a very dark night when it's snowing and everything is quiet, and you're away from home, and become lost in it.  \\"F#A#(Infinity Symbol)\\" is like listening to a three-act documentary filmed directly after the end of the world.  It is a lonely, haunting, desolate album.  You probably won't listen to it in its entirety more than 10 times, but when you do, it'll change the way you think for a good while.  Get high on Godspeed.  Good Luck.
B00005QIPH|4.0|So... WHAT if they're simple; like the Ramones weren't. These boys ROCK. It'll be interesting to see their follow-up cd IS THIS IT is one of the few cds listenable in its entirety, a rare find. It's raw, it's uncomplicated, it's FUN and hey, folks, it's ONLY ROCK 'n ROLL ...lighten up.
B000000WHX|5.0|When people criticize this album I don't think they're putting it in the context of when it came out.  In 1991 this was pretty revolutionary, different stuff.  MA's more recent albums aren't nearly as forward thinking as this one, they're good but not nearly as genre defining or progressive as Blue Lines.  This album was the basis of Trip Hop.  I haven't seen anyone mention the song &quot;Lately&quot; which is the best in my opinion.  Many of these songs are timeless, liek they still sound as fresh today as they did 11 years ago.<br />If you're into trip hop or other similar genres, you'll probably like this, and its a classic anyway.
6301442962|5.0|This is one of the most liked holiday films of all time! And I can see why. The Santa Claus is hilarious in this film, and he gets saved by a wonderful acting lawyer. Throughout the film, you'll see that everyday people are thinking of Santa as a crazed maniac. But it all turns out great at the end. And it gets better in 1997!
B000022TSW|3.0|It's easy to list the pros and cons of this film.  On the positive side, the scenes with Saddam Hussein and Satan carrying on an affair in hell are quite funny.  Satan is just a misunderstood, sensitive, New-Age guy who worries that he is being used by Saddam and for eventually taking over the world.  (As the devil, wearing reading glasses, reads self-help books on relationships while in bed with Saddam, the latter keeps belittling his worries by pulling out dildos and suggesting that they have ...)  Also on the positive side is that the songs are clever parodies of syrupy musicals of the past 20 years.<br />On the negative side, the animation stinks, the language is offensive, the humor is often juvenile, and the movie stretches a thin plot to the snapping point.<br />Watching the movie's raucus combination of the clever and the sophomoric is like listening to an precocious, funny teenager who's had too much caffeine and just learned a bunch of dirty words: some times you're in awe of the raw creativity and nerve, and other times you're exhausted by the peurile humor.  These pluses and minuses combine to form a score straight down the middle: 3 stars.
B00000064G|5.0|Quite possibly.  This is a heartbreaking, simple, beautiful, haunting, strangely comforting piece of work.  This album was recorded when Nick Drake was so depressed that he couldn't talk.  This means that the voice you hear on this recording is the only time Nick used his vocal chords during the depression that killed him.  As the listener, you are learning and sharing more with Nick Drake than his family and friends did at that time.  <br />This is probably my favorite album of all time.  &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is one of the best songs of all time, along with &quot;Place To Be,&quot; &quot;Road,&quot; &quot;Which Will,&quot; and &quot;From The Morning.&quot;  When I hear &quot;the movement in your brain sends you out into the rain,&quot; I am reminded of the complete truth and utter beauty of this music.  Nick Drake was a genius, and this album proves it.  It goes with any emotion, any rainy evening or sunny morning.  And it's less than a half-hour long.  &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is a timeless work of art.
B00006AW2F|3.0|This June 1975 release, which appeared just as The Stones kicked off that year's North American summer tour, was an oddball collection of previously unissued tracks covering 1963-1969.  Similar in concept but not quite as good as The Who's \\"Odds & Sods\\" (released a year earlier), this album received almost no commercial radio attention and soon found its way to the cutout bins-and out of print not long after that.  I bought my vinyl copy back in August 1978 for about $3, with the lower left corner of the jacket neatly shaved, and it's still around here.  Hence I was pleased to learn it was finally being released on domestic cd for the first time, and further pleased to find on purchase that it had been restored to its original UK 16-track form (the U.S. album contained just 14 tracks.)  OK, this ain't The Rolling Stones best album by any stretch of the conscience, but it has its moments.  Two of the big problems cover eight of the first nine tracks: First, they are not actually performed by the band, but rather by Mick, Keith and a bevy of studio musicians hired by producer Andrew Loog Oldham.  Second: Many of these recordings are hurt by some exorbitant electronic reproduction for the purpose of similating stereo.  Nonetheless, most of this material is composed by Jagger-Richards--and there are a few gold coins among the copper, such as the poppy but catchy \\"I'd Much Rather Be With The Boys\\" (with an affectionate nod to Phil Spector), the very early Jagger-Richards ballad \\"Each And Every Day Of The Year,\\" and a surprisingly good alternate version of \\"Heart Of Stone\\" which, session sheets indicate, features a lead guitar break by then 20-year-old Jimmy Page, already an in-demand session player around London by that time.  As you move on to tracks 10-16 (side 2 of the album), however, you'll find more familiar sounds, if not songs, hitting your ears-as each of these tracks are performed by The Stones all together.  \\"If You Let Me\\" is a nice holdover from the \\"BetweenThe Buttons\\" sessions, while \\"Family\\" and the Bill Wyman-penned \\"Downtown Suzie\\" come from the \\"Beggars Banquet\\" period.  Then there are four tracks which landed on the chopping block when the initially-conceived two-record set \\"Let It Bleed\\" was pared down to the single album you all know.  The killer here is a blistering cover of \\"I Don't Know Why,\\" an emotionally-charged yet sadly obscure jewel from Stevie Wonder's early catalog.  There's also the funky \\"Jiving Sister Fanny,\\" \\"I'm Going Down,\\" and the actual Rolling Stones recording of \\"Memo From Turner,\\" as opposed to the somewhat better-known \\"Performance\\" film soundtrack version credited to Jagger.  While Mick delivers a bit more of an impassioned lead vocal and Ry Cooder adds some nice guitar licks to the soundtrack version, The Stones version has considerably more musical punch, paced by Keith's apparently Hendrix-inspired slashing rhythm guitar and charlie Watts' fiery, fill-drenched drumming style heard frequently during the \\"Beggars Banquet\\"/Let It Bleed\\"/\\"Sticky Fingers\\" period.  This is clearly the superior version, and I hope more people notice it now.  In a nutshell, then: If you are the casual Rolling Stones fan, content with the hits, I couldn't recommend \\"Metamorphosis\\" to you with a straight face.  If, on the other hand, You're a true fan and connosieur of The Stones' golden years (as opposed to the golden-tooth Rolling Stones Grampaw & Multiple-Source-Offspring Corporation years in which the band currently resides): This album has its ups and downs, but plenty enough ups to justify a place in your collection.
1563896656|5.0|Although Promethea's recent forray into preachy Sandman lecture style format has turned me off to some of Moore's writing, the League proves that he's still one of comics most formidable writing forces.  This collection offers an excellent introduction to Moore's craft, and Kevin O'Neil's art really grows on you if you give it a chance.  Whether you're looking for high drama or smart comedy, this collection kicks....and the next collection looks to be just as worthy of repeat readings.  I've already gone through this one three times, and I'll probably read it again soon.  Worth hunting down the online annotations also, sure to add depth to your enjoyment.<br />And if you like this and want more Moore, I recommend Watchmen, Tomorrow Stories, Top Ten and From Hell.
B00006EXDM|1.0|kinda <bad> that they remixed and added unecessary effects to really brilliant songs.  Kinda cool to see Ruby Tuesday sped up to it's original speed, kinda <unfortunate> he faded his voice so far back in the chorus.  all around sad, remastering a disc that didn't need it.  reminds me of the aweful re-release of starwars.<BR>late<BR>-d
B000001FI7|5.0|No matter what genre of music floats your boat, this album will become one of your favorites.  It is a masterpiece.  I don't know how they did it.  Geoff and Beth went into the studio, slit their wrists, and bled into a microphone.  There is so much emotion here.  It almost seems like a violent, beautiful battle between Beth's incredible (so good it's scary) voice and Geoff's monumental trip-hop beats.  &quot;Roads&quot; is a song that will affect me for the rest of my life.  When you play this song, it will make the whole room reverberate.  It's a natural high.  Be careful, though.  I discovered this track when I discovered depression.  And of course &quot;Glory Box,&quot; a work of genius.  This is an essential album.  Every track is a standout.  I think I will go turn out the lights, sink into my waterbed, and let Dummy overwhelm me.  &quot;I got nobody on my side, and surely that ain't right.  Surely that ain't right.&quot;
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album--the Beatles had had enough with the experimentation of Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, and Revolver. Abandoning the pop feel of their previous albums, the Beatles did what they did best--they wrote and played what they liked. The White Album represents The Beatles as well as any other album they produced. All four wrote their own songs in their own genres. From paradies on the Beach Boys (Back in the USSR) to social commentary (Piggies, Everybody's Got Something to Hide...) to old western (Rocky Racoon) to hard rock (Helter Skelter); from ballads (I Will) to fun rock (Birthday) to experimentation (Revolution 9--terrible in my opinion) to blues (Yer Blues) to heartfelt songs (While My Guitar Gently Weeps), this album has everything, even a lulluby (Goodnight). <br />There are countless other great songs, including Happiness is a Warm Gun (a great song), Cry Baby Cry, Blackbird (a classic), The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill (another parody, this time on Buffalo Bill from the American West), and Why Don't We Do It in the Road (banned from radio as the entire song is about having sex in the road). <br />This multi-genre album marked the beginning of the end for the Beatles. Conflicts about the vast array of music added to the rift that was growing between the Beattles (around this time John and George got in a fistfight during recording). The White Album certainly shows each Beatles' individual preferences (Paul despised John's Revolution 9 while John hated Paul's Ob-La-Di Ob-Da-Da). The While Album represents the Beatles at their best, even while they were beginning to split up. I truly feel that this is the world finest double LP ever produced.
B00006C7G9|5.0|I watched this mini-series from Episode 1, when it premiered on HBO, and catch it everytime that it's rebroadcast on HBO. Most episodes I've seen several times and I never tire of it. The cinematography is incredible, and the story of Easy Company keeps your interest throught the entire series. <br />I ardently recommend this to anyone: For those who served bravely for their country, for those with family members who served, for the younger generation, and for the older generation. My grandfather served in the Army in World War II and I never quite understood what shaped him into the man he became until I saw this and Saving Private Ryan. It gives you such a glimpse into heroism, sacrifice, and honor and made me respect my grandfather and all who serve/served our country so bravely in the military to defend our freedom. <br />Some people may be put off by how intense the fight scenes in this series are... and some (especially from my generation) may not see the need for a \\"war mini-series\\". But this brings you the harsh reality of what goes into defending democracy and freedom. You can't walk away from it not bringing a piece of it with you. So, in summary: Buy this mini-series! You won't be sorry and I hope you will be changed by it.<br />I add one final note to all veterans and all servicepeople who may read this: I salute you and thank you. I can practice my first amendment liberties in writing this review because of your bravery. God's grace and peace be with each of you.
0316666343|4.0|I didn't have any expectations for this book as I hadn't heard of it. It was recommended to me by a book store owner as I was browsing.  I loved it! From Chapter One I couldn't put it down.  I think it will give great inspiration and a good laugh to anyone who reads it.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I was at work a few days ago, and I happened upon that new Blue Pepsi stuff that's out right now.  Me and my friend had never seen it advertised before, so it kind of took us by surprise, and, naturally, we felt obligated to give it a try.  On the first sip, I remember thinking, wow! This is great!  I could drink this stuff forever!  However, I proved to be jumping to conclusions, and after finishing roughly half the bottle, I began to reconsider my opinion on this blue stuff.  Every sip afterward that followed got progressively worse, and by the time I was on my last sip, it tasted like garbage.  What was wrong with it?  It tasted like carbonated gatorade.  Pepsi took two flavors that, while they work well by themselves, DO NOT work well together.  I was initially excited by the taste on my first sip, because it tasted so different, but by the end of the bottle, I realized that just because something is different doesn't always mean it's GOOD.<br />That got me thinking.  I realized that Limp Bizkit is a lot like Blue Pepsi, in many ways.  For one, they both..., but that's an unjust example.  For another example, they both combine two separate things, which could presumably work well together, but in the end don't, just because they're weren't matched very well.  In Limp Bizkit's case these two things are rap and metal, two things which COULD presumably go great together, but do they manage to pull it off?  No.  As experimentation has taught us, combining two different things together CAN sometimes work well, as there have been good, or at least decent rap-rock bands before.  However, Limp Bizkit cannot pull it off, and neither could Pepsi with their Blue nastiness.  Another important similarity is that Blue Pepsi is a drink which essentially hides behind its flashy logo, crazy color, and cool advertising to hide the fact that it tastes like junk.  It has no substance.  Limp Bizkit also has this same quality.  They hide behind their pizazz and in-your-face attitude, have good media coverage, advertising, and crazy and weird album covers, but yet, they have no substance beneath all of that.  They taste terrible.<br />So what else do Limp Bizkit and Blue Pepsi have in common?  Why, the same method to put an end to their existence: don't buy them.have good media coverage, advertising, and crazy and weird album covers, but yet, they have no substance beneath all of that.

B000002UB3|5.0|I love Abbey Road. The Beatles were the greatest band of all time, period. And &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is (in my opinion) easily their best album. This album contains many of my favorites, from hits &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;Oh Darling&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; to my personal favorite songs of all time: &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; and &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;.<br />I have never found another album by any artist (including the other Beatle albums) that has the feel and power of Abbey Road. No matter what mood I'm in I can always listen to this unique album. Many songs are simply fun to listen to (even if not the most well-known songs). Several of the tracks have become well-known classics.<br />Abbey Road also features the &quot;Abbey Road Meddley&quot;, a set of 8 songs linked together. This is one of the revolutions the Beatles brought to the music world in the mid-to-late 60's. This album is a piece of music history--besides being incredibly entertaining. This is definately a must-have for any fan of the Beatles or 60's music in general. For whatever reason, Abbey Road just seems to fit.
B000002UB3|5.0|&quot;Abbey Road&quot; is the top of the heap, the ultimate pop rock album.  Unsurpassed before or since, this is the most perfectly arranged Beatles album.  Also it ROCKS!  Witness the alternating giant steps of &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;, the driving rhythm of Lennon's guitar on &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;, the chugging free-for-all on &quot;The End&quot;, the deep-diving hypnotic circular &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot;, the ultimately tasteful hired-hand-Clapton guitar on &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;.  Of all people, Mr. Sinatra called &quot;Something&quot; the best love song ever written -- who can deny?  Isn't that the essence of love -- &quot;something in the way she moves attracts me like no other lover&quot;?  The ethereal harmonies of &quot;Because&quot; and &quot;Sun King&quot;, beyond the wildest dreams of Brian Wilson.  The perfect lullaby of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, and the perfect way to greet the new day after a night of meditation, in whatever flavor you choose.  The mysterious synth behind the vocals that belies the humor of &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; (one of the best original headphone moments).  And &quot;Come Together&quot;, the apogee of opening songs that is still the coolest bass line in rock.  What doesn't this album have?  It's got it all, it's the alpha and the omega of studio music.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Once again Wesley Snipes has done it again with this action pack, non stop violence, kick ... movie.  If u loved the first one then you will want to marry the second one.  If u have to see one movie this summer this is the one to see.
B00000I8BX|4.0|I first bought this album quite a few years ago on the hype attributed to it alone.  For an American death (essentially) metal band, this band had recieved quite a bit of acclaim from critics and fans and this was enough incentive for me to fork over the cash and pick it up.  The only FF song I had ever heard before that time was Zero Signal off the Mortal Kombat soundtrack of way back (that movie ruled!) and though at the time, the song was a bit much for me (I was like 12!) it had begun to grow on me over the years.  I also thought that the band's blending of extreme metal with an industrial influence was an awesome idea.  <br />It is only now, several years later, in the wake of the band's still recent demise, that I find it justifiable to share my opinion on this album, mostly because I am only now realizing the large contribution they have given to rock and roll, and just how much larger that contribution could have been, had they continued.  <br />Fear Factory was always a unique band, and this was a very important album for them.  Although the band had always upheld their whole Man vs. Machine, Terminator-esque vibe before, this was the first time they had ever committed an entire continuing story to one album, and explored the not-too-fictional reality of a world dominated by machines in depth.  Each track continues the story of a society which has been suppressed and dominated by a unique race of machines, and a rebel who takes it upon himself to try and put an end to the mechanical holocaust.  The music within supports and blends with the story incredibly well, as do Bell's unique vocal stylings.<br />Although Fear Factory took a bit of a turn away from their death metal direction with this album, this is still extreme stuff.  Burton C Bell possesses an incredible growl which could split ear drums, Dino's shredding guitar could crack concrete, and Raymond Herrera's speedy double bass gets you pumped.  However, the growling, screaming, and shredding of their two previous albums begins to take a backseat here, in favor of a more melodic singing and playing style.  For most death metal bands, this could easily spell disaster, but for Fear Factory, it works remarkably well.  Bell has an absolutely spellbounding voice; it practically induces you into a trance, and only adds to FF's unique tech-metal sound.<br />With all this praise, why the four stars, you may be asking?  True, the album's story is incredibly cool, the music is catchy and heavy, and the production is awesome.  The only flaw to be found here, (which unfortunately is a pretty big one) is that the music loses some of its magic with repeated listens.  One can only listen to this album for so long before it becomes a bit redundant, and you'll find yourself needing to take a bit of a break before you can come back.  Like I said, it's a pretty big flaw, and it chips away some major points from a potentially phenomenal record, but it doesn't, by any means, negate the wise decision you would be making to purchase the album.  These guys were definitely a band ahead of their time, and with a bit more fine tuning, could have become one of the biggest bands of the new millenium.  Hopefully the band members will continue to make worthwhile contributions to music in some way or form in the future, because a band like Fear Factory will be tough to replace.
B000006FNX|5.0|Yeah baby, this shagidelic film of 80`s is absolutely fantasic, it`s Sean Connery`s best performance as James Bond and his final!<BR>God blind me, if you compared this film with some of Moore`s films, I`d bet you`d see that this film is more Bondish than those were.Of course, somethings in Thunderball were a bit better, like Largo having the eye patch, and SPECTE HQ seeme a bit better, but still....this epic is a great one!

6300246787|5.0|It's 1890, and Dolly Levi (Barbra Streisand) is matchmaking for Horace Vandergelder (Walter Matthau), a well-to-do Yonkers businessman. Horace wants a wife, but Dolly has her eye on Horace for herself.  His two naive shopclerks (Michael Crawford and Danny Locki) are along for the ride as they pay their first visit to New York City and vow to fall in love.<br /><br />Forget the silly plot and the odd casting; Striesand is way too young for her part and Matthau is too old for his. But the movie is all about the lavish musical production numbers:  Streisand, Crawford, and Lockin sing and dance their way across an idyllic New York City, joined by hundreds of cityfolk. The songs are sweet and lovely and the choreography is energetic and dazzling. Some standout numbers are \\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\\" and \\"Look! I'm Dancing,\\" and my favorite, \\"It Only Takes a Moment.\\"<br /><br />Gene Kelly's film  definitely rates 5 stars for the grand musical numbers; just overlook Babs and Walter and the plot.

B000001F3C|5.0|War was my first U2 album, which means nothing in the scope of this band as I bought in high school, and just graduated.  War did one thing better than any of the other albums.  It appealed to a more hard rock audience.  This was exactly why this album caught me.  I was (and still am) a huge fan of heavy metal, but I've always enjoyed a lot of punk and hard rock.  This is the hardest U2 album, and certainly the angriest.<br />As far as songs go, there isn't a misfire on the whole album. Refugee does seem a bit out of place, but it's still a good song, and I'm not sure if it would have seemed comfortable on any other U2 album anyway.  Standouts include the obvious Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day, as well as lesser known title such as Like A Song and Surrender.<br />If U2 seems a little too 'light' for you, then give this a try.  It could reel you into the world of overpriced U2 masterpieces.
0618001905|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it - I'm not done with the book yet...but I'm already here giving it five stars and ordering it to send to other people.  It's that good.  The story it relates is one of unimaginable horror, all the more horrible because it has largely disappeared from history.  How can we forget so easily?  The early dissenters emerge as amazing figures of integrity in an age blighted by greed and racism.  The writing is gripping, and flows along with intertwining tales where the research is evident, but never hits you over the head in an academic way.
0792842723|5.0|Synopsis: James Bond is investigating a Russian crime syndicate, known as Janus, when they steal a Russian first-strike weapon, code-named Goldeneye. Assigned to find the weapon and discover what they plan to do with it, the trail leads Bond to a beautiful Russian computer programmer, a traitorous General, and the head of Janus, formerly 006.
B000063V8T|5.0|This was a great season of the next generation, in fact it was the season that got me hooked on the show.  It did have a few stincker episodes like 'imaginary friend' and 'the perfect mate', but i don't want to get into them.  I want to talk about the episodes that left the rest of tv-and science fiction, looking at what was possible.  <br />First off there was 'Cause and Effect' similar to the theme behind Stephen King's the 'Waste Lands' as the Enterprise gets caught in a causality loop, throwing it back and forth in time, always to end in the same devistating outcome.  Great cameo by Frasier Crane to boot.     <br />The next great episode was 'Unification parts 1&2' they brought back Spock with an amazing, Spock worthy tale.  He is still fighting for what he believes in and he still has his damn vulcan stubburness.  Great sparring matches with Picard while they try to develop peace between the Federation and Romulons.   <br />'The Next Phase' is a personal favorite of mine as it looks at the relationship between Ricker and Ro, in a subtle fashion.  Ro and Geordy seem to have died and as the crew try to put on a wake, while helping the devious romulons get back into romulous space, Geordy and Ro try to stop the Romulons plot and bring their lives back together at the same time.   There were holes in the story, like how did their shoes retain contact with the decks?  But other than that it is lots a fun.  Other not worthy eps include 'Ensign Ro', \\"Cost of Living', my personal season ender(behind Best of Both Worlds) was Times Arrow.  <br />The episode that i really want to talk about.  If you haven't seen it, i won't give any of it away, but to this day, this episode has a deeper effect on the way I think than any TV show I have ever seen, it introduced me to brilliant Sci/fi and radical thinking,  \\"The Inner Light\\".  This episode starts with the crew finding a derilect satillite floating through space.  Well Picard gets trasported  \\"Somewhere else\\" and the greatest journey begins.  It asks us to open our eyes, look around and appreciate what we have, but nothing is forever-NOTHING.  Not even diamonds.  Our memories fade, loved ones die, and worlds collapse.  It is perspective and dream recall, amalgamated into posssibly the greatest short story since \\"Plato's Allegory of the Cave\\".  Enjoy
630560973X|5.0|Star Trek IV The Voyage Home, in my opinion, is clearly one of the best out of the TOS six.  Although not as high in the suspense aspect, like Leonard Nimoy says, it was good to lighten up a bit and have a good time with Star Trek.  While other reviewers might feel the humurous aspects of this film wearout after repeated viewings. I understand that statement, but don't feel the same.  I can still get a laugh out of these scenes even though I've seen them more times than I can remember.  I especially love the scene with Scotty being handed a mouse and him trying to talk to it.  Again, one of the best Star Trek films out of the original six.  If you're one of the few people who've not seen this or are new to the genre, I definitely suggest you add this DVD to your collection.
B00003CXB6|2.0|Ok, look... its a given, isn't it, that the inexplicable, insouciant, stow-away black daughter of Jeff Goldblum lays waste to this movie in much more savage fashion than the T Rex does to San Diego?  This girl is pure liability, put on earth, apparently, to torture Goldblum, the rest of the cast, and everyone remotely connected with the movie.  She is expressly told to get lost, next thing you know she's stowed away and is living the dream on Dinosaur Isle along with the rest of them.  She contributes nothing, spends her time oscillating between mouthy pre-teen rarefaction, abject fear and utter dependence.  After a gruesome T Rex attack, when the group had better beat it for anywhere but here all she can find to say to a battered and shellshocked Jeff Goldblum is &quot;...Carry me.&quot;  I found myself actually holding my hand over the part of the screen that she occupied, wishing there was some sort of V chip that accompanied the DVD that expressly was supplied to block her out.  I can only imagine that the writers somehow got it into their heads that they would drag some obscure demographic into theaters with this character.  But what?  Bi-racial family enthusiasts?  Mouthy pre-teen enthusiasts?  WHAAAAAT?!?!?  I agree with the other reviewer: if only the dinosaurs could have gone after the writers of the movie... then we would have something.  But since that is impossible, I find myself reduced to a single, lingering question:  does anyone on earth find mouthy pre-teens palatable?  ITs kind of like a nightmare of vicarious parenting where one is debarred from giving the kid a good sound spanking.
B000069AUI|5.0|This CD is fantastic, it has not left my player since I bought it.  As much as I love Parachutes, this exceeds it.  I cannot name a favorite track, they are all great.  If this CD does not receive a nomination for album of the year, it will say something about the sorry state of most music these days.  Bottom line---buy this CD, you will not be disappointed.
6304383827|5.0|I highly recommend this version of Emma it's great.  Gwyneth<BR>Paltrow is ecellent in is as Emma.  It is colorful, the costumes are absolutley beautiful, and so is the scenery.  it's a must see for all Jane Austen fans or fans of the regency era in general.
B00000I2VF|5.0|I have the Australian import, but that only has one bonus track, a demo of \\"Uninvited\\".  The Japanese one may have one or two more (common practise to keep the Nikkei going).  The original version should have been on the album, but there must not have been room.  As for the one I have, I found it in the bargain bin.  I listen to this one more than the new or first ones combined.
B000007SPU|5.0|This CD has not left my stereo for all that long lately... It serves as exquisite chill-out music, yet forces you to pay attention to it... All the tracks on this album are of stellar quality, but the ones that most readily leap to mind for me are \\"Tarantula,\\" \\"Firebrothers,\\" and a quite sinister cover of the David Byrne-written \\"Drugs.\\" I can honestly say there's nothing on this that serves as filler, and that Ivo Watts-Russell and John Fryer picked an impressive array of collaborators, as well as gathering a unique eclectic selection of cover songs (Van Morrison and Judy Collins, for example).  I must admit that this is the only This Mortal Coil CD I own... but that'll be remedied soon enough, to be sure.
B000067CPX|4.0|This album is good, don't get me wrong, but its not on the level of BloodSugarSexMagik or Californication.  THe Peppers have lost something, an edge that they had, they seem slightly bland.  Their music is still great, but it has lost some edge.  There seem to be recording issues as well.  I love anthony kiedis's voice, but it is overly piercing on this album.  It goes straight through you.  The new idea to have somebody in the band, I don't know who, sing very high background vocals was also a bad idea.  The songs can get a cheesy quality which I never thought the Peppers could have.  But this album is still good.  Don't forget me, BY The Way(which is one of only a few songs that have the funk RHCP) and Venice Queen are my favorite songs.  Cabron also has a great Flamenco guitar part.  If you're a fan of slower, softer RHCP, this album is for you.  If you're a funk RHCP lover, keep listening to By The Way on the radio.  Still a good album though.
B000069I5W|3.0|The negative reviews and folks who I new saw &quot;Showtime&quot; who did not like the movie pretty much cancelled my plans to see the movie. But when the movie hit DVD I took a chance on it. I love Deniro and Murphy plus Russo who appears in the movie. Overall, there were moments that dragged here and there but the movie pretty much is a &quot;rent me&quot; movie and NOT a to buy title. The climatic ending I do have to say got me at the edge of my seat.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Most of us have seen The Parent Trap many times.  What is interesting about the DVD feature is the commentary by Director/Screenwriter David Swift and Star Hayley Mills. This is one screen commentary that is as entertaining as the movie. Check out the extra DVD features such as the interview with the twin you can't see. We applaud Disney's release of The Parent Trap and Pollyanna and hope that they will continue to release all of the Hayley Mills collection.
6303402348|5.0|Forrest Gump is the '94 mega-hit based on Winston Groom's novel that remains both a well loved and widely misunderstood film. Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) is a slow-witted (perhaps mildly retarded) southern boy with \\"crooked legs\\" who has two great gifts - the first is always looking for the good in any situation or in any person he meets, and the second is the ability to so totally focus on the task at hand that he completely immerses himself into whatever he takes on. His childhood friend and the later object of his affections, Jenny (Robin Wright) is a woman of average intelligence who is very unfocused, or \\"into everything.\\"<br />The computer generated newsreel footage that splices Gump into so many archived moments is worth seeing this film for, but the gentle humor and poignant story of a love that endures great divides of time and distance make it an awesome experience.<br />Both Robert Zemeckis (Best Director) and Tom Hanks (Best Actor) won Academy Awards for this film, which I still think is one of the most powerful movies of our time.
0790743507|5.0|I don't claim to be a movie aficionado.  Growing up in the pre-VCR days meant that about the only movies I saw were the few on network TV like &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;.  I first saw this movie about 20 years ago at a college old-film festival and I loved it.  I bought it a few months ago and happened to insist my 12 year old watch the &quot;Make 'em Laugh&quot; number.  To my surprise, he loved it so much that for weeks after he would bring down a friend and insist they watch this old movie that had this funny song in it.<br />Excellent and enjoyable family fare with no profanity or violence.
B000066NW0|5.0|I can't stand Avril Lavigne...i think she's obnoxious and has a bad attitude...but she has a GREAT CD. Almost all the songs are really good, and even though it's not really punk, (sounds more like pop) she has great songs. Complicated, Things I'll Never Say, My World, and others are catchy, and fun. This CD is one of the best I have listened to...too bad she has such a bad personality.
B000006NXP|5.0|This DG performance of Brahms's symphonic swansong is one of the best versions of this powerful, heartfelt and life-affirming symphony ever recorded. With Carlos Kleiber at the helm of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the experience that can be gained from listening to this fine performance is akin to the experience gained from listening to his Beethoven. Kleiber conducts the music with a keen sense of purpose, and he never fails to elicit a peerless and rapturous sound from the Viennese players. And to top it all off, DG gives Kleiber its typical top-drawer recording quality, with ample bloom and ambience on the sound.<br />Kleiber opens the first movement quietly and somewhat plaintively, setting the stage for the tragic destiny that the symphony is to present. This opening builds into a densely-argued movement, with the various strands of the argumentative thread tightly woven together and the contrasts in the quieter lyrical secions well brought out. The tensions of the first movement give way to calm and serenity in the second movement, with a rich and rounded horn sound, shimmering strings and lush woodwind contributions. When Kleiber lurches into the scherzo, he conducts it with a jubilant thrust that I have not encountered in many other recordings, even in Szell, and this is all the more so when the tempo of the music is driving and propulsive enough to bring out the rythmic spring. But in the passacaglia finale (which pays homage to Bach and, to some extent, the finale of Beethoven's Eroica symphony), Kleiber enables Brahms's passionate expression of tragic discourse speak for itself. The music has a driving force and emotional intensity that overshadows the quieter wind sections, and this is particularly so towards the end of the movement where the music displays the destiny that must be stormily confronted. The glory of the orchestra in these last few moments is enough to cap an excellent performance of a popular and life-affirming symphony.<br />On thewhole, I find this performance an excellent version of the last Brahms symphony, and this is sure to be a basic staple in any beginner's classical music library.
0553106635|5.0|There is only one way to describe the book \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" ingenious. With its intriguing plot and its repertoire of characters, I found it impossible to put the book down. I loved the deceit and murder which courses through the book. My favorite part would have to have been when Robb was dining with the \\"late lord\\" and the Rains of Castamere began to play. It was probably the highest point a piece of literature has ever reached.<br />Probably the best part of the Song of Fire and Ice series is the characters. Each one has a feeling of realism about them. Individually, they are impossible to forget. Every little action they do defines there character even more. Even the heroes have character flaws. Lord Eddard Stark doesn't take initiative fast enough. Lady Stark is to controlling of her son, Lord Robb Stark. Lord Robert is a glutton and a drunkard, who can not even see his wife's betrayal.<br />You can see George Martin's genius by the character of Jamie Lannister. In the first and second book, he is evil incarnate and the reader hates and reviles him with all there soul. But in the third book, you begin to understand and even respect him.<BR>I would go so far as to compare George Martin to such fantasy greats as R.A. Salvatore, David B. Coe, and David Drake.<br />I would highly recommend this book and I hope many people will read it.
B000003TAR|1.0|I bought this and discovered it's not Nirvana, it's some whiny band from seattle who do a bad MTV-version of Mudhoney. I also can't see why they need an \\"explicit\\" version and a \\"clean\\" version when you can't understand a single word. Two thumbs aiming downwards.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold chose an unusual perspective from which to tell Susie Salmon's (like the fish) horrifying tale.  Perhaps the story makes such an impact because it comes on a spate of other similar stories of unsuspecting children who have been recently lured or abducted and who have been subsequently robbed of many, if not all, of the developmental life stages Susie so poignantly desires for herself.<br />Susie is viewing her portion of the earth from her own piece of heaven.  It seems that heaven is very much a designer place, a creation of each decedent's own creation.  There is no religious vantage point, no deity in residence.  The deceased can pretty much come and go as they please, appear or almost appear to family members and friends and observe life as they left it.<br />Holly for example, one of heaven's inhabitants, still loves to assist people in her new heavenly home because on earth she was a social worker.  There seems to be some unspoken transition from life on earth to getting settled in eternity.  Susie has not yet found her niche, though, because she is still very much pre-occupied with the devastation caused by her own disappearance.<br />The reader knows, step-by-step, what occurred and who the perpetrator was but her remaining family members are suffering because of what they don't know, other than the fact that the amount of blood found would indicate that Susie is dead and a body part was unearthed by a neighborhood dog.<br />Sebold's description of Susie's abduction is chilling, perhaps because she was the victim of a brutal crime herself.  Interestingly, she also seems to have a knack for describing how lives are subsequently changed, how some survivors become stronger, how others suffer to the point of illness and how still others are resentful of the unspoken ghost that pervades family life in the ensuing years.<br />Though very clever, the story at times becomes extremely fanciful and syrupy as Susie keeps wondering what her romantic life would have been like.  It was abruptly ended right after she had experienced her first kiss.  Her post mortem seduction of the now grown and college educated student who had given her the first kiss is just one of those \\"far out\\" moments!<br />Susie has also had an unexpected impact upon another earthling, Ruth, one of the proverbial unpopular high school girls to be found in most adolescent settings.  Susie's spirit literally bumped into Ruth as it was escaping her body following the abduction, rape and murder.  Since that time Ruth has sensed the spirit world and often can tell what murder or brutality happened in any given area in which she passes.<br />Overall, even with the New Age touches, the story is well told and often humorous amongst the agonizing pain, suffering and disruption experienced by the Salmon family.

B000065U1N|4.0|The best equipped military in the world is not supposed to end up with soldiers being attacked by an angry mob in broad daylight.<br />Yet that is just what happened in October, 1993, to the United States military's special forces stationed in Mogadishu, Somalia.<BR>That day, hell erupted with the suddenness of machine guns fired  into a crowd of starving Somalians who had lined up for bags of food.<br />The road to this particular hell had been paved with all the best intentions.<br />Hundreds of thousands of Somalis had been starving to death, a systematic strategy of warlords determined to take over. A horrified international United Nation force led by the US went in to distribute food and aid, but instead found themselves in the midst of a rabid, hate-fueled conflict between rival warlords.<br />In an attempt to squelch the fiercest and bloodiest of them, US special forces staged a bold daylight raid on the warlord's headquarters. The goal was to capture two of the warlord's lieutenants in an effort to tighten the noose around him.<br />However, what was to have been a 40-minute surgical strike into the heart of the warlord's stronghold in Mogadishu went tragically wrong, almost from the start.<br />Botched communications, mishandled situations, untrustworthly local intelligence, and lukewarm support from alleged allies all contribute to the horrific result:<br />Two Black Hawk Helicopters crash in the middle of hostile Mogadishu, and the few dozen ground troops left there find themselves surrounded by armed citizens who are storming down the streets by the hundreds, eager to kill US troops.<br />The resulting firefight saw Americans in the bloodiest combat since the Vietnam war. Instead of 40 minutes, the fighting lasted a harrowing 22 hours.<BR>We are spared nothing. <BR>There is no unqualified happy ending here, no phony romance as in <BR>Pearl Harbor to blunt the simple horror of bullet hitting bone.<br />This movie is NOT for children.<BR>The violence is incredibly graphic, yet appears quite realistic, not over-blown.<br />We see how the best and the worst of people emerges in times of crisis, and how heros are sometimes people who just hand in there and keep doing their jobs. Although some of the events will bring tears to your eyes and ball up your fists, it isn't a depressing movie at all.<br />If you don't already know the ending, (This IS a true story) I won't spoil it for you, but I kindly offer this advice: Get your beverages, snacks, walk the dog, turn on the phone message machine, and take a bathroom break before you pop in this DVD. <BR>After it starts, you aren't going to want to stop watching until the end.

6304411448|4.0|I am not a fan of many movies post 1966 or so... in fact, this is one of the scant few I can say is good enough to watch more than twice. I saw it at a friend's house last summer twice and I would definitely watch it again. It was nothing very deep or meaningful but it was very fun and the dialogue was just great.<br />I have a hunch that pretty much all aspects of the story have been covered by other reviewers so I'll just tell about what stood out to me. From the first moment it was good. Johnny Depp's character (his name escapes me - Sam, was it?) peering over the top of a book with Buster Keaton on the cover and he looks just like the picture. He almost never says anything, and when he does he's so solemn about it that you can't help laughing.<br />Joon takes things pretty seriously too. Her idea of an emergency is running out of super-crunch peanut butter.<br />Sam does such funny things. Especially the spinning the hubcap and doing the dance with the forks and hot dog buns. He and Joon talk so seriously about the strangest things - how sad raisins are (they're nothing but humiliated grapes, says Joon), and whether grilled cheese should be cooked on the wool or rayon setting. (Sam toasts them with an iron.)<br />The scene when Sam and Joon are leaving on a bus is about the saddest part. Joon starts having one of her scizophrenic fits and Sam in his slow brain hasn't a clue what to do for her. But of course everything ends up OK.<br />Overall I found it a very sweet, light movie good for many laughs. I also appreciated that there was really no violence, only one bad word that I can remember, and the love scenes were not too overbearing - you just saw them kissing. I thought the balloon music serenade was too weird to be true - can you really play music with a balloon?<br />Anyway, for me to say that a recent movie is good is a pretty high recommendation... You should see it - I can't believe you wouldn't like it.

B00004RJ74|3.0|Quentin Tarantino said it himself:  &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; is PURE exploitation--no bones about it.  If you're not in the &quot;Fangoria&quot; crowd, then you'd probably try to stay away.   I'm not usually in that crowd either, so I'm giving it a mediocre rating.  But, the first half of the movie picks up where &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; left off.  Great dialogue throughout the whole movie.  Still, if you're not into monster flicks, you're probably better off watching another Tarantino or Elmore Leonard film.
B00003CXXR|2.0|The end of the Lost World (a sequel 5 years after the original, most of us forget), a majestic mix of new and already seen dinosaurs move around in their natural habitat, leaving the story successfully finished with most of the loose ends tied up. We've had lots of monsters, lots of good lines, time to go home.<BR>   But no. Hollywood won't let an idea die if there's money in it, and the first Jurassic Park was a minor turning point in cinema history - it's sequel was gory and fun enough to bring millions to the cinemas. So what the Hell, they figured. Make another one.<BR>   This time, there's no complex Crichton book as a basis, so the plot consists of the following: Grant is brought to island to find kid; we see some new/old dinosaurs; various team-members get chomped; Grant finds kid, parents/kid re-united; everyone goes home, happy and safe. It isn't brain taxing stuff, and the film is all the weaker for it. For drama, Director Johnston depends on zoom-to-Niell shots for some stating-the-obvious-in-a-dramatic-fashion moments, e.g. \\"He's calling for help\\" or \\"It's a birdcage.\\" A good device first time, but it's re-used throughout the film. Johnston's direction, also comprising of sped up action shots, looks cheesy and unsubtle, much opposed to the decent direction of the first two films.<BR>   Then the special effects. Certainly not better than before as somewhere stated, the dinosaurs are in terrible shape. The T-Rex is green, the raptors are blue, when they're CGI they look CGI, when they're animatronic they're jerky and different to their computer counterparts... it's all very messy and seemingly unfinished, like some rushed B-Movie sequel. The much-talked-about Spinosaurus, like the Raptors (who get their own silly subplot of having an advanced system of communication which Niell has only just noticed) comes and goes with such lack of cohesion that you could forget he's in it. In fact, the only dinosaur that is in any way impressive is the Pteranadons... thescene on the \\"birdcage\\" is atmospheric, the only one of it's kind in the film.<BR>   Aside from Sam Niell, Alessandro Nivola and the cameo-bound Laura Dern, there's only B-List actors here, and again it only increases the straight-to-video feel of it all. It's stricken with sequel-itis, promising only some new dinosaurs and a returning character, as we could have guessed. Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, the film still feels padded and overlong, and it is, comprising one \\"characters run from dinosaurs\\" scene after another. Yawn.<BR>   The movie simply didn't have to have been made, and there is nothing fresh or surprising about it. Direction, casting, effects, and ripped-from-the-previous-movies music all add up to make this a lame second sequel, that truly only fans will get anything out of - and even they will simply long to go and watch one of the two far better originals. Avoid.
B00003CWL6|3.0|American Beauty is truly a fine movie. In vision, insight and execution--few movies can compare with it. Visually stunning, and with an exceptional cast, there is little wonder that it received both critical acclaim and a wide audience. Yet to my mind, this movie is a showcase from the first to the last for the wonderful talent of Kevin Spacey--possibly the greatest actor of our time.<br />Spacey plays the doomed protagonist/anti-hero: Lester Burnham. Check that--Spacey BECOMES Burnham.<br />In this film, more than any of his others, the impact of Spacey's friendship with the great Jack Lemmon is very palpably felt. Not only are there echoes of Lemmon in Spacey's portrayal of Burnham, but one might argue that Spacey's courage in taking on the role of Lester was inspired by Lemmon's own courage in role selection.<br />Spacey's transformation from the beginning to the end of this movie is nothing short of remarkable. Lester becomes a person reborn...spiritually and physically.<br />The supporting cast is also exceptional. Bening, Birch, Bentley and especially Cooper contribute performances that may well prove to be the greatest of their careers. Cooper in particular is chilling, and almost unrecognizable, in a role unlike any other that he has ever played.<br />All that said, what I admire most about American Beauty is its timely message. We live in a world of intense business and illusion. How tempting it is to forget that all of life, no matter how painful or mundane, is a gift. This is the lesson that Lester finally learns. If we stop to look deeper, beyond mere appearances (like Ricky and, ultimately, Lester), Beauty is there to greet us.
0800141326|3.0|Initially, I was very hard on Godzilla. I couldn't see it as anything but cheesy and annoying, a true idiot's blockbuster of a film. However, that was before I'd seen what it was based on. The 70's Godzilla movies were cheap and cheerful, oozing with cheese and aimed squarely at kids. So it's no real surprise this big-budget adaptation is a little daft, it's supposed to be.<BR>   First, the niggly negative points. The story is pants: Godzilla goes to Manhattan, destroys a few things, is killed. The convoluted original movies had thicker plots than that, even if they were totally ludicrous. The cast are the film's biggest letdown, with a hideously poor lineup led by terminal-nice-guy Matthew Broderick, Hank Azaria and various B-List actors. Only Jean Reno is fun to watch, as a French secret agent trying to cover things up. <BR>   The script is a waste of time. Oozing with cheesy lines and with it's \\"a stiff breeze would break it\\" plot, you'll end up not caring who dies or how... in fact, you're mostly likely to care about Godzilla himself.<BR>   And instead of Godzilla fighting the good fight as once he did, he's merely King Kong here, beating up a few buildings, hiding here and there and getting killed on a landmark. When he dies, so does the movie's only spark.<BR>   And boy, is Godzilla himself good. Looking awesomely better than he used to, he's a tower of special-effects perfection, complete with original roar and various interesting abilities, such as swimming and fire-breath. He's great fun to watch, but spends far too much of the film in the background. There is simply not enough of him, and we're not really placated with the \\"Gosh, looks like there's a sequel on the cards\\" ending. <BR>   But what the Hell, the film passes the time provided you're in the right mood. Lots of roaring, lots of explosions, a few nifty effects and a few good lines courtesy of Reno. Just bear in mind it's meant to be cheesy, go along with it and it's quite fun.
B000002AEN|5.0|Album time: 38.17<BR>This is the best sound I've ever heard on a solo record from this era. Sound as in recording quality. The most minimal white noise you could even ask for. Nothing gets blocked out at all. This man played rythm guitar with his thumb, and melody with his fingers. This is one guitar but often sounds like two or three even. The rythm and Lead are often both perfectly seperated and skillful. This is a perfect distillation of blues, country and what we call folk. It is just amazing that this man came up with the style basically by his lonesome. It just flows like water. I can't even believe it myself listening. I can hear the influence very often in much country/folk music today. It is a distinct and clear sound. You have some great story telling here with Stack O' Lee [Stagger Lee] and Spike Driver Blues also. And Frankie is of course the old Frankie and Johnny Ballad done by most anybody who carries or carried the folk tradition of songs. For instance - Champion Jack Dupree, Johnny Cash, Lonnie Donegan, Charley Patton, Merle Haggard, Jimmie Rodgers the Blue Yodeler and for God's sake even Elvis Presley. It is a popular song after all. This playing is so rich and creative. It is complex not just because he plays rythm and lead at the same time either- Many have done that in some form or another. It can also have a very complex and mesmerizing melody alone. Or just interesting rythm[s]. There is something unique and sincere about John. He can make these sexual inuendos while sounding very saintly. He can mention the common blues theme of ''shoot my baby'' and then do a religious number! He is an interesting personality at the very, very least. His voice- worryless and strangely wise sounding for a 35 or so year old. His voice is quite similar as an old man and his guitar through out the career never falters. This is great for the time that it captures but there really isn't a hurt record that I would call bad. Hurt is just naturally skilled and unique. He's all good I think. This is about one of the most important records I have in the grand scheme of American musical history anyway. Highly suggested.
B00006ALGL|5.0|This is an incredible album. Listen to it and realise that this lad is going to be bigger than David Gray, far more meaningful and certainly a better craftsman.
B000002B35|5.0|David Gilmour is amazing on the vocals as well as his incredible guitar playing. The songs on these discs are more &quot;alive&quot; than the studio versions. There's so much more feeling. This is an absolute most for any Floyd fan. Even if you're not a fan, you soon will be!
6305078181|3.0|Though there is much to admire here, this is not an entirely satisfactory retelling of the Dracula legend. The film suffers from a tendency to take itself far too seriously. Laurence Olivier, as Van Helsing, really hams it up with some utterly banal dialogue of the sort that simply cannot be uttered nowadays without tongue firmly in cheek, which has the effect of turning him into a delusional and laughable old man. The attempt to turn the Dracula story into a lavish, sumptuous, sweeping romantic-drama does not sit well with the risible script. What was needed was a less grave (pardon the pun) approach, which would have enabled the film's darker and more poignant aspects to have deeper impact.<br />On the other hand, there are a few things about the movie that shine. Visually, the film harks back to the Hammer Dracula movies of the '50s and '60s. Even the woodlands in and around the castle could be the very same location at which most of Hammer's output was filmed. Langella's Dracula, as he is filmed walking swiftly along, his cloak flapping behind him, has more than a touch of Christopher Lee. At the same time, however, Langella has a character of his own as the dreaded Count, at once as charming and romantic as he is dastardly and terrifying. Dracula's demise is one of the most memorable in the history of Dracula movies: in his death throes he is a struggling animal, a demon fighting death to the last, even managing to elicit a certain degree of pathos in his attempts to resist the inevitable. For these excellent touches, this is worth viewing.
B000002MFE|5.0|This MTV Unplugged session is not only one of Clapton's greatest performances, but one of MTV Unplugged's greatest performances. &quot;Layla&quot;, &quot;Old Love&quot;, &quot;Running on Faith&quot;, from start to finish it's one of my top 5 favorite CD's.
B00004XONN|5.0|The greatest record of all time is, without a doubt, Kind of Blue by Miles Davis.  Not since that record has anybody reinvented music to the extent that Radiohead does on their masterpiece Kid A.  All of the arguments leveled against Kid A are made either by people who are scared of anything that isn't made on the rock radio assembly line or people who never want Radiohead to be anything more than 'that band who played &quot;Creep&quot;'.  For example, one reviewer said something to the effect of &quot;it lacks emotion&quot;, i.e. saying that their music has to spoon feed them its meaning.  Well, the album is not an emotional one in the traditional sense.  For example, &quot;Idioteque&quot; attempts to combine paranoia and angst along with complete and total ecstacy, while &quot;The National Anthem&quot; just takes the paranoia and puts it on free-jazz amphetamines.  Complaints about the lyrics are ridiculous; this is an album that takes place between the meanings of words, one that attempts to describe the human experience in fragments of emotions, images, and words, hence the often experimental nature of the music:  you can't very well express emotions that don't have a name in the English language with conventional drum, bass, vocal, and guitar rock now can you?  Not anymore at least.  To this reviewer, Radiohead is up there with Bob Dylan, The Velvet Underground, and Fugazi in their sheer honesty of expression and seemingly limitless ability to say exactly what they mean.  In Radiohead's case, however, they have a much more complex view of the world than most people, and therefore they have to express themselves in an original fashion in order to tell their version of the truth.<br />This record is pure genius, and anyone interested in seeing what the world's best band can do when they're at their most experimental owes it to themselves to check out Kid A.
B000002L3P|5.0|\\"While We Cry\\" makes the album worth buying. He was only 17 when he recorded that song LIVE! Then throw in \\"Deja Voodoo\\", \\"Only the Good Die Young\\" and \\"Shame, Shame\\" make it a must-have album. The man is awesome!
B00000K29E|5.0|I can't honestly say that I'd give 5 stars for this effort, in and of itself, but rather for what it ushered in. This first effort to package the then unknown Big Brother into a kind of &quot;Spanky And Our Gang&quot; mold, to make them more commercially appealing, was not  successful. B.B. was just too WEIRD for mainstream top 40, and never flourished there. They were at their best  not in a studio atmosphere, but live, where all their un-restrained stream of conscienceness playing could be best captured, like the wild animal that they were (are.) Though Janis was just one of the group when this album was recorded, her legendary explosion soon followed, and it is interesting to hear her on this recording. Though her searing voice is featured as the lead in several songs, she was close to being a back up singer on many here, and, considering what followed, it is thrilling to hear her in her then almost anonymous glory. I still have an original copy of this album, with the wonderful psychedelic cover art by Stanley Mouse, it is one of my cherished possessions. I would recommend this more as a curio piece rather than a great listen, a precursor not only of the mythical Janis, but to one of the best, under-appreciated groups ever.
B000002P86|5.0|This is an outstanding CD. One of my all time favorites! &quot;The Thrill is Gone&quot; with Tracy Chapman...amazing. &quot;Baby I Love You&quot; with Bonny Rait...amazing. &quot;If I Love You&quot; with Van Morrison...amazing. If you like the King at all, check this one out.
B00004TDTO|5.0|I don't think there is anything I can say about Jaws that you probebly haven't already heard. I mean, everyone knows that this epic tale of carnage is one of the most difinitive films in history! I know of no other film that can put a hurt on the whole beachside tourist industry! People were actually afraid to go in the ocean after this flick came out! Jaws had quite an impact on people when it came out, and, I believe, it still does.<BR>   I didn't think you could improve upon Jaws, but they have. The wide screen dvd version of this movie was so clear, and if you have surround sound, all I can say is WOW! The soundtrack will just pop! I believe that John Williams is just as responsible for this films success as Spielburg!<BR>  All in all, the dvd version, I believe, is worth the price you have to shell out for it. Jaws is clearer, sounds better and has some great extras!!
B000002L5I|5.0|Kenny's playing gives me chills. It could be the worst day of my life but &quot;Blue on Black&quot;, &quot;Slow Ride&quot;, &quot;(Long) Gone&quot; and &quot;I Found Love&quot; make everything right in the world. The man is awesome!
B000003TAR|5.0|This is one of the best CDs ive ever owned, by far Nirvana's best. Nevermind is Nirvana's most popular and famous CD with Nirvana's 2 biggest hits \\"Smells like teen spirit\\" and \\"Lithium\\" along with 3 of there lesser hits \\"Polly\\", \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Come as you are\\". Yet In Utero is overlooked, altough it has 2 farley big hits \\"All Apologies\\" and \\"Heart Shaped-Box\\" it still has plenty of less popular songs wich are still better than those on Nevermind such as \\"Dumb\\", \\"Scentless Apprentice\\", \\"Rape me\\" and \\"Frances Farmer will have her revenge on Seattle\\". In a nutshell, i think that In Utero is over shadowed by Neverminds popularity and i think is even better than Nevermind. Kurt Cobain really poured his soul into this album and is very unique and has a large variety of songs. It's a great CD and definitly deserves 5 stars in my book.
B00005NB8J|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. If you are a fan of Star Wars or Lord Of the Ring or X-Files, this is just the movie for you. These movies might seem very different, but this movie has combined the futuristic special effects of Star Wars with the Fantasy of Lord Of the Rings and the suspense of x files. This is a must-see.
B00005QG9J|4.0|You can look at Incubus from 2 views.<BR>1. A band that is STILL trying to find themselves, and make a name.<BR>2. A band that is very diverse.<br />The first option seems to be the more familiar outlook. Every CD, it seems they are trying something new, or, selling-out (I use that word VERY loosly). I remember my friend owning &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; and me listening to them for the first time (this was before SCIENCE) and I thought to myself, &quot;Hey, not bad.. atleast there trying something different, being funky, DJ emulations, and not sounding mainstream&quot; and I actually thought they would stay that way. Then SCIENCE came out, I thought to myself &quot;Nooooo... not ANOTHER, fast paced rock CD.. :(&quot; but then it grew on me, thinking to myself &quot;Well, they are GOOD at doing music this way...&quot; so I figured, this is there style. Forget funk metal, Incubus can rock. Then &quot;Make Yourself&quot; came out, and I thought &quot;Oh my lord.. what have I stumbled upon thee... ?&quot; This CD blew me away, but in a positive way. At first, when hearing Pardon Me on the radio, I instantly thought &quot;God, Incubus has really sold out.. for real this time too!&quot; and yes, Pardon me, till this very day, is still not my favorite song on that CD. But when I downloaded the song &quot;The Warmth, Out from Under, and Nowhere Fast&quot; I then convinced myself this CD was worth buying, and I didn't regret it. I loved every song on that CD, except for the dreadfull song &quot;Drive&quot; which till this day, is still a track I skip over.<BR>Now this CD, when I heard &quot;Nice to Know you&quot; on the radio, I thought.. &quot;Man, Incubus has changed again..!&quot; then I heard &quot;Wish you were here&quot; and thought to myself &quot;Not very original.. oh boy...&quot; but I bought the album despite my first impressions, and loved it. &quot;Circles, Under My Umbrella, Echo&quot; were the songs that made be give this CD a 4. The only drawbacks from givingit to a 5 was the 2 accoustic songs - I don't care for accoustic, one bit. It's nice Incubus is exlporing, but they should really stay away from accoustic. Not that they arn't good at it, it's just they would be better off spending time making more harder songs that go along the lines of &quot;circle&quot; &quot;blood on the ground&quot; to make it a better album.<br />This album is great, defintally reccommend it. Somethings I have learned: <BR>1. Don't go by first impressions on Incubus ;)<BR>2. Let Incubus grow on you, there music can change you in so many ways.<BR>3. I have learned to look at bands from a &quot;diverse&quot; view, instead of the common &quot;sell out&quot; view.
B0000584V3|5.0|that was funny hearing that other guy said he didnt like the heavy part coming in on dirge of november cause thats the only problem i can see with the CD too, amazing, awe inspiring, seriously get it
B00005QZWI|5.0|I love the music. It goes so perfectly for the film. I can listen to the cd and see the scenes of the movie. Mr. Shore as done a wonderful job of making you feel as if you are in Middle Earth. <BR>One of my favorite songs is &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;. It is a very peaceful and playful song. &quot;May It Be&quot; is also a great song. Enya voice is very beautiful and matches the feel of the song.<BR>The only thing I don't like is when it is over. I could listen to this cd, forever. I don't know what I want first to hear the music or see The Two Towers.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Many of you sci-fi buffs out there realize the ups and downs with the success of a good vampire movie!Personally,i am very picky about the intelligence of the plot,acting,and special effects.Blade2,is a 5 star movie,delivering exceptional graphics,to a story that will leave your hands in a fist,&quot;The entire movie&quot;!!I am a proud owner of this movie,and personally, i have not wanted to purchase a movie since the extrordinary movie the matrix.Go out and get blade2 today.It will stimulate you to see it again,and again!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie was nothing like I expected.  That's good, because I really had no desire to see it and so didn't expect to like it.  The first couple of minutes, I thought it was gong to live up to my shallow expectations.  As it continued, I found it growing on me.  By the end, I was hooked.  I love the music, the costumes, and the story line.  <br />I realize this movie isn't for everyone (my boyfriend was unimpressed), but if you haven't seen it, I recommend that you give it a try.  You may be pleasantly surprised.
0790730960|3.0|When it comes to the Batman films, most fans love the first and care little for the latter two, but this installment always gets mixed reviews.  I like dark films (Edward Scissorhands) but as much as I wanted to like Batman Returns, it just didn't fully work for me.<br />First off is the problem that the Penguin never really becomes realistic.  Even at his birth, we have to suspend belief for a bit and take in that he is so deformed his parents would dump him in the sewers and that penguins could raise him to be a diabolical mind.  Then we have to believe that such a crazy figure would run for mayor, and it's never quite clear what his state of mind is.<br />Think of all this film could have been.  The Penguin could've been an example of a damned figure, Max Shreck the embodiment of pure evil, Catwoman a symbol of seduction who somehow makes Batman feminist in the end.  But the story is too rushed and no one gets developed.  Penguin and Catwoman team up half way through but then break ties.  Why?  The two sublots hardly fit together.  There is a big final climatic scene with her and Shreck, but then the Penguin's death feels completely anticlimatic.<br />The real problem here: TOO CARTOONY!!!!  I understand if Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfieffer come off cartoonish since they are supposed to be that way, but even Christopher Walken looks like a cartoon character (what is suppose to be his corpse at the end with the bugged out eyes is an insult to visual efects everywhere).  What about such lines as \\"I was their number one son, but they treated me more like number two\\" and \\"Honey, I'm home.  Oh, forgot.  I'm not married\\"?  Do real people use these lines.  These little things are distractions and it's harder to take the tragic story seriously.  Yes, the first film was a bit like that too, but that one was essentially an action film and delivered fine.<br />Batman Returns was not a flop, and it does have its fans.  But Burton has done much better.
B000066NW0|4.0|I am a Michelle Branch fan, but after listening to Avril I almost switched over immediately.  She pretty much tells how she feels at this point in her life through this album and it is very good for listeners who &quot;keep it real&quot;.  A lot of people are mad because she's called &quot;punk&quot; and others because she's called &quot;pop&quot;.  No one knows who or what they are in this country anyways so..  Without the label, this is a good album and worth listening to, because once you hear it you won't stop.
B00002Z88D|3.0|Its funny how alot of people think this is so amazing. I mean, they basically just did a show with a symphony playing with them. Metal and classical music combined, very nice. But many bands can have this same exact sound with just keyboards. There are of course loads of flaws on this cd. First off, metallica shouldnt even have a crowd out there, it ruins this beautiful concept. I think if they wanted to make it a live show too then sure, that would be cool, but first off they needed to just make this a live studio album, because it would sound better, when the songs close you dont have to hear the crowd the entire time screaming during the end of each song. <br />They add two new tracks which one I like. No leaf clover is a cool song. Good melody, an ok solo, excellent drumming, vocals are nice too, bass is missing again as usual, but we get used to that, and it isnt jason's fault because the bass is missing. Its hetfield's and lars who call all the shots, that is yet another reason why he left the band. <br />Lets face it though, metallica pretty much have ran out of ideas, I mean they havent even made a studio album in almost five years, instead they make the garage inc. album, covering old covers, and now we have this right after. OK, it has talent required yes, but come on, metallica knew that after re-load, anything new and inventive, people would dislike even more, oh but James and Lars, you gotta keep making more and more money then you even need, so you have to remain sell outs, and cant just go back to the real metal style you once had 11 years ago. I once respected metallica when they played better music. Metallica still is metal even though they betrayed the metal scene supporting all these poser nu metal bands, still some bands can mature, these guys failed miserably. I mean what is up with this new vocal style hetfield's got going on, all trying to sound demonic, wake up!!! And Hammet doesnt play really good solos, its just too simple the way his styleis, he stole Mustaine's style in the 80's, then found his own on load, not that great. <br />Ok, I know this review will be hated because im saying metallica is thru, I admit metallica still have talent, but its a waste, time to retire boys, and go on with your lives, maybe do some solo stuff, hell maybe kirk could be Limp Bizkit's new guitarist, and hetfield could play guitar and sing with method man. WHo knows, this album has a beautiful concept, but a tragic waste, it doesnt fit. Your thru guys, its over. Damn traitors of metal!!
B00005YXZH|5.0|It's really sad when a person can't sit down and take the time to explore something new. Especially since the reward is such a rich one like it is with Wilco's new recording. When I first listened to this CD I was on the road for what was intended to be a short trip. It turned out to be a bit longer one because I couldn't stop listening to the music! It was truly amazing.<br />This CD isn't for every body that's for sure. It won't appease those who revel is the same tiresome and boring rock routines, bands with different names but essentially the same. Wilco is doing the music world a big favor by exposing listeners to a new style of rock/pop and, yes, it proves to be too much for some listeners. It's their loss.
0679720200|3.0|While looking through the, what seemed to be never-ending, list of summer reading books for my senior year honors' English course, I came across The Stranger, by Albert Camus. The caption for the book read, \\" Camus asks whether there is a God or just a cold, indifferent universe in this story of the trial of a man who commits a pointless murder.\\"  I thought that the synopsis was relatively vague but it captured my interest enough to make it one of the five books I would indulge in during my summer vacation. <BR> <BR> However, after reading The Stranger, I felt as if I had barely indulged in anything.  The plot and the main character, are, to say the least, simple. The novel  follows the story of Meursalt, an Algerian clerk.  The book is divided split into two parts.  Part one is basically page after page of Meursalt's daily routine, which includes his going to work, his coming home, his dining at his friend Celeste's restaurant or occasionally fixing dinner himself and sleeping. Even on his day off, Sunday, he does nothing.   He lacks any relationships of substance. He has his mistress, Marie Cardona, his fellow apartment dwellers who he only knows through rumors or watching them and a couple of co-workers with whom he shares about one word each.  When he befriends apartment mate, Raymond Sintes, a reputed pimp, there is hope that Meursalt's life will take on some excitement. Disappointingly, their friendship is almost as dull as Meursalt's life.  However, in becoming friends with Raymond, Meursalt manages to get himself involved in Raymond's affairs and kills a man. <BR> <BR> This brings the reader to part two, the trial of Meursalt. During imprisonment and trial, Meursalt seems not to care that he is undergoing a trial or that the end result of this trial could be  death.  He simply lives life in prison much like he did at home, uneventfully- almost uncaringly. As his trial proceeds, it seems that it is not so much a trial about whether he committed one of the worst crimes but rather a trial of his inadequate character. <BR> <BR> Monsieur Meursalt's character is so dull and indifferent that it is almost impossible to finish the book. Everything he does and everything he says is so matter of fact, there is no emotion behind anything. He does not waste any time of his insignificant life with emotion with small or large events. This can be seen with the very first sentence of the novel, \\"Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure.\\" How can one not be sure when their own mother died?!  When his mistress, Marie asks him if he loves her he indifferently replies that it doesn't mean anything but that he probably doesn't.  Moreover, he fails to show insight into other characters or share any internal feelings.  Meursalt's behavior and lifelessness is a major annoyance which is present throughout the novel.  <BR> There is further meaning in this novel under all the dull descriptions of the main character's actions and thoughts. Camus is trying to say something about society and fitting in. Yet it is difficult to plow through the boring and unexciting plot and life of Meursalt to get to the heart of it. In order to get anything and everything out of this novel, one has to have a great forbearance for pages filled with simplicity and indifference.
0765342294|5.0|Ender Wiggin is one of the children chosen by the world government of Earth.  For the last three years, from age three to six, he's worn a monitor-a device designed and used to watch him day and night, so finely tuned that he'd started to believe that it could read his thoughts.  Then, when he was six, the device was removed.  Ender's whole world changed.  Hated by his brother Peter, loved by his sister Valentine, Ender suddenly became prey for the bigger boys at his school.  After an altercation in school and a display of viciousness and cold cruelty on Ender's part, he's told he made the program for the International Fleet, the first line of defense against the Buggers, an alien enemy encountered nearly fifty years ago that came short of destroying the planet.  Graff, the man from I.F., tells Ender that he qualified for the Battle School program, where Ender will learn how to fight Buggers.  The downside is that he won't get to see his family for ten years.  And Battle School doesn't turn out exactly the way Ender had envisioned it would.<br />Orson Scott Card is an award-winning science fiction and fantasy writer.  In addition to the Ender Wiggin series (ENDER'S GAME, SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD, XENOCIDE, CHILDREN OF THE MIND, ENDER'S SHADOW, SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON, and SHADOW PUPPETS), Card has also written the Homecoming series (THE MEMORY OF EARTH, THE CALL OF EARTH, THE SHIPS OF EARTH, EARTHFALL, and EARTHBORN) and the Tales of Alvin Maker series (SEVENTH SON, RED PROPHET, PRENTICE ALVIN, ALVIN JOURNEYMAN, and HEARTFIRE).  HOMEBODY, TREASUR BOX and LOST BOYS are three of his works that heavily involve the supernatural in today's world.  He's also written two novels about women from the Bible (REBEKAH and SARAH), and several stand-alone novels and other trilogies.<br />ENDER'S GAME is a wonderful read for old-time science fiction fans that cut his or her teeth on Robert Heinlein.  The same depth of character in a young protagonist that Heinlein was noted for is present, and the world-building skills are sharp.  At the same time, Card embraces the younger readers of SF by laying much of Ender's story in action and gameplay.  Every young reader out there is living in an SF world when he or she plugs into a PlayStation game, and Card entices those players by showing how much fun his vision of the future is with null-gravity and gameplay.  Ender comes across always as a real person with real problems.  The pacing is quick, always pulling the reader into the next situation, providing tidbits of information that locks in the bigger picture by the time the reader gets there.  Card's creation of words, situations, and tech-and the ease with which his characters (and the readers!) interface with it-is amazing.<br />This book is heartily recommended for readers already familiar with SF through Heinlein and Asimov, and to new readers who want a deeper and more immersive experience than the world presented by the latest video game.  Well-written books are the closest things to virtual reality that exist at this time, and ENDER'S GAME is one of the best.nt, and the world-building skills are sharp.

0887308589|4.0|If there's a mascot for Internet users, it's the nerdy engineer Dilbert from Scott Adams' comic strip of the same name. No other character in the mass media combines the feelings of technological superiority and wage-slave hopelessness present in the lives of most computer users. But the play of computer users versus management is only part of Adams' comic ouevre; his hilarious take on everyday blue-collar workers touches not only on computer use in companies, but the combined forces of Total Quality Management, endless meetings, doughnuts, cubicles, business plans, and all the other aspects of working in a modern office. Although most of Adams' strips play on the plight of the nameless cubicle worker against an uncaring and oblivious management, he also covers the flip side of work where managers are unable to motivate employees beyond using the office LAN for Doom and the fine art of making sleep look like work. Given all of this familiarity with business, and the increasing popularity of business books, it makes sense that Adams' most recent book, The Dilbert Principle isn't a collection of Dilbert strips but a incisive look at the frailty and foibles of self-help management books under the guise of being one itself.<br />Business books were overdue to move from the bestseller list to the parody shelf. What was once simply just a few \\"feel-good\\"self-help psychology books for managers like Stephen R.Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and Kenneth Blanchard's The One Minute Manager is now a plague, including books like The Management Secrets of Attila the Hun and The Star Trek Guide to Management. What these books spend so many words doing that Adams deconstructs so brilliantly is to take what is common sense to anybody else and grafting the buzz words of business schools and management training on it. Take, for example, this wonderful bit of normal business communication that might have come straight from Management 101:<br />\\"Perform world-class product development, financial analysis, and feet services using empowered team dynamics in a Total Quality paradigm until we become the industry leader.<br />Take out the double-speak, and what you have is a mission statement that says:<br />\\"Do the best work to provide the best product with the best people until we become the best in our field.\\"<br />Unfortunately, the first statement probably took ten people who get paid in the high five figures (if not more) at least three days at an exclusive resort in Florida to write. Even more than mission statements such as this, business double-speak of the nineties has centered around terms such as \\"downsizing\\" and \\"re-engineering\\". By putting a different spin on the timeless tradition of firing and re-organization, today's companies act more like politicians than producers.<br />Ninety-five percent of Adams book is examples such as this, cartoons illustrating the examples, and email from Dilbert readers telling how their companies have fallen into the Dilbert Zone. All of this is great reading, although sometimes disconcerting when you see your own company being portrayed. The last five percent of The Dilbert Principle is Scott Adams' own philosophy for managers. He says, in the introduction to unveiling his company model OA5 (standing for \\"Out at Five O'Clock\\"), that:<br />\\"In this chapter you will find a variety of untested suggestions from an author who has never successfully managed anything but his cats. (And now that I think of it, I haven't seen the grey one for two days.) ... I doubt that anything you read here will improve your life, but I'm fairly confident that it won't hurt you either, and that's better than a lot of things you're doing now.\\"<br />Although humble, his suggestions have much merit because they return the business of work to common sense. When a company remembers, as Adams suggests, that it has three main reasons for being (its customers, its employees, and its stockholders), and treats all three fairly,then the rest will fall into place. If all the management consultants and business book authors condensed their theories into brief summaries such as this, it would be tough to charge [amt]an hour and [amt] per book for it. Which means that there will always be consultants and treatises for the clueless, and an endless supply of material for Adams' cartoon., then the rest will fall into place.

0452282152|4.0|Everyone has been talking about this book. My co-workers, my family, and my friends all said this book is a must-read. I was skeptical, but took it along on a long car trip. I read the whole thing in one setting. It was charming. <br />The fictional account of the Vermeer family made me like the artist even more. Adding the feelings and life of one of their maids made it even better. Consider me charmed.
B000068QY7|5.0|This is probably their best album since the absence of the guitarist and bassist.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Maximum enjoyment of the first viewing of this film requires NOT KNOWING previously something which I won't divulge here.... although wise and experienced movie critics such as Roger Ebert went ahead and &quot;spilled the beans&quot; in their reviews.<br />That being said, this film is a modified account of the life of Nobel winner John Nash, and I can think of no film that does a better job of &quot;getting inside the head&quot; of one of the world's great thinkers in a way that a regular joe like me (and presumably, YOU) can understand.  It's also a fine love story, and though John Nash wins the Nobel prize, Alicia Nash easily takes the noble one.<br />The DVD comes with many extras with the two highlights being separate commentary tracks from director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman.  The film, in a remarkably time-efficient fashion, ably demonstrates that genius is not only frequently tortured, but that it consists of epiphanal moments of inspiration interspersed with hours of hard labor to &quot;flesh out&quot; the inspiration.<br />Bravo John Nash, Alicia Nash, Ron Howard (directed), Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Christopher Plummer (principal cast), Brian Grazer(produced), James Horner (composed a wonderfully appropriate score).<br />See the best picture of 2001.
B00000J6AG|4.0|Let's be real: if I were Eminem, I, too, would hate Moby.  The Detroit rapper could learn from Moby's examples of creating nuanced, expertly crafted tunes of mellow electronica.  Unlike most dance artists, who have one or two good ideas and stretch them on an album, &quot;Play&quot; weaves together different genres and textures on this fine disc.  It's a pu-pu platter of blues, soul, rock, and pop set to warm vocals and light synth touches.  For quite some time, I have resisted the work of Moby, whom I suspected was just another hyped-up one trick pony.  Was I wrong.  &quot;Play&quot; is a fine disc that won't look out of place in your CD collection.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is unbelievable.  It is good enough to beat off to.  The two albums together are the greatest 93 minutes of music ever recorded.  5 stars and the invitation to everyone to but both Parachutes and A Rush of Blood To The Head
B00005JL96|5.0|It really bothered me that so many people took the portrayal of Mr. Bubbles the social worker as that as a \\"bad guy.\\" He was seen as bad through the experience of Lilo and Nani, because he was a force that would separate them. His character was a counter-balance to the concept of ohana. I think the portrayals of all of the human characters were wonderful - they were more realistic than the idealistic, stylized performances of characters in other Disney movies. I think this was a wonderful movie for older children, teenagers, and adults. I am so glad that the Disney animation team is finally breaking out of the corner they drew themselves into (pardon the pun). Lilo and Stitch is a movie that pushes the envelope a bit, while still retaining the old family spirit of the classic Disney films. This movie is more than what you see on the surface. Don't be afraid to look for the message.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I say \\"Life is Beautiful\\" in seminars and classes (during introduction) when asked what is my favorite movie. This is without any doubt the best movie I have seen. I saw this movie 18 months ago when my daughter was just born. It influenced the kind of parent I became. I believe I would have been a different kind of father if I hadn't seen this movie.<br />Roberto Beningni is probably the only film maker who can make you laugh with tears in your eyes. He has portrayed the atrocities of the Holocaust very well without a single violent scene.<br />A must see !!
B000069AUI|5.0|When I first heard \\"god put a smile on your face,\\" I though- boring. One listen later that changed, and I realized that this was not an album to over-analyze. There are no epics like yellow or trouble. The mass appeal has been toned down a notch in favor of a more sincere witting style. The album flows from song to song nicely with never a need to skip a track. Finally a return to such albums..bands that are original and are not trying to screw around. With rush of blood, Clodplay sat in the studio and made music unbound, unwound, a free from the tainted influence of contemporary music.
B00006FXB6|5.0|While I do love the instrumentation in QOTSA's music, what really makes it shine for me are the vocals. There's this unique high timbre to them that's been present on all three albums, and on Deaf they introduce some extremely ear-pleasing vocal harmonies. These are simply great songs. This is easily my favorite album of 2002, so far.
B00005R1N3|5.0|I saw Black Christmas for the first time on a little b/w Tv which made it all the more scarrier, now its on dvd not a lot of extras just the movie and its well worth the wait. This was <BR>Bob Clarks (Porkys) first movie he directed and done very well, it leaves you guessing right till the very end. I dont want to give away the ending.
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has the &quot;sweetest&quot; voice, I like the cd a lot, but my daughter absolutely loves it. It's nice to listen to music with my daughter, that is actually &quot;about something&quot;  some of the songs sound like stories. We like!  :)   P.S. the music is beautiful!
B000068QY7|5.0|Great Songs.  Heathen Chemistry is a great album with songs such as &quot;the Hindu Times&quot; and &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot;.
B00006FXB6|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Songs for the Deaf,&quot; I was completely floored.  It is a truly remarkable record, complete with both mind-bogglingly heavy instrumentation and a well-developed concept.  All the songs here revolve around Josh Homme's crazy-eyed guitar, which sounds something like a black hole--it draws in countless metal and grunge sounds, synthesizes them, and spits them back out in a hyperkinetic fury that is so loud it can rub calluses on your ears.  Nick Oliveri's bass sounds like a monster's heart beating with hellacious fury, while Dave Grohl's atomic drumming ensures that there is never a dull moment.  <br />The songs--written by Homme/Oliveri and sung by Homme, Oliveri, and former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan--are incredible in their structure, complete with light-speed time signatures and more false endings than a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert--check out the pounding, endless &quot;Song For The Dead&quot; or the the deliriously hilarious &quot;You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar But I Feel Like A Millionaire&quot; (awesome title as well).  <br />The Queens develop their radio-centered concept with a variety of false transimissions which are read by DJs.  The sampled Christian pastors on the &quot;Do It Again/God Is In The Radio&quot; medley and the woman's voice on right before the commencement of &quot;Song For The Deaf&quot; are quite humourous, but they also serve to communicate the Queens' ultimate message: this is what radio should really sound like.  <br />The sounds of these deafening songs are so intense and--even better--unique that they put most other bands of the Queens' mold to shame.  Homme and Oliveri meld metal-grade riffing with speed-punk rhythms to create a distinct genre all to themselves.  Furthermore, the appearances of Grohl and Lanegan--both grunge icons--do not veer this record in the grunge direction but instead yield to it the cunning pop aesthetics of the grunge revolution.<br />Definitely a must-have, especially if youlike non-mainstream, more revolutionary music...
B00000I0XW|3.0|Most of her songs in this CD are good, the rest not that much
0316666343|3.0|This novel began, as many others have pointed out, with a very interesting premise. Interesting enough to keep me reading until the end just to find out if there would be any other unique surprises, concepts, etc. The subject matter is initially difficult and disturbing. Sebold handles the rape and murder sequence well in that she balances our need for detail with our abhorrence of the crime. I found myself very moved in the first few chapters by the thought of a young girl's life stopped so brutally and suddenly.<br />But that's just it: it stops, and although our attention as readers is meant to mostly shift to the lives of those left on Earth, we want to know more about Susie Salmon, her heaven, and what comes next. I realize Sebold does not want this to be the focus of the novel, which is why she does not develop Heaven and the characters that inhabit Susie's version of it, however, this does not erase the fact that some plot lines are left undeveloped in favor of somewhat plodding descriptions of Susie's friends and family. The ending, as others have noted, is very pat, although not as much as some authors would create. Kudos to Sebold for this, and for her courage in addressing some difficult issues without sensationalizing them as she might. All this said, I do think the movie will probably be a bona fide tear-jerker, although I don't know how well it will translate to the screen.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Christopher Nolan's impressive follow up to his Indie film Following, Memento is a mindbending film with a twist... you see the ending first, then slowly work your way back to the beginning. I have no problem admitting that this movie messed with my head. The main reason that I rented it the first time was because I am a big Guy Pearce fan, and I would have been happy just to see how much depth his acting ability has.. But by the time the opening credits were over, and you slowly watched a polaroid &quot;undevelop&quot; (turn from a picture to a white fuzz), I knew that I was in for more than I bargained for. Never have I seen a movie that manipulated my feelings more, especially about the characters. When you first meet Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss, you are given one impression of them, which you figure is the right one (because you've already seen the movie end). However, as the movie progressed, I found my opinions changing completely, until who I thought they were turned out to be completely wrong. With a fast paced and intelligent script, and great performances by all of the leads, this is definetly the mindbender of the year. This is the movie you watch if you enjoyed Fight Club, and want to reach the hallowed &quot;next level&quot; of plot twists and character development.
0316666343|5.0|I picked this book for my neighborhood book club and we all loved it.  I found it hard to put it down....I even read it at stop lights!  They way she takes the focus off the murder and puts it onto the family is what makes this book a great read.  She gets into how they deal with Suzie's death, each in there own way.  For having a sad start to the book, you will find yourself smiling by the end.  I can't wait until she comes out with her next book.

630469654X|5.0|This is a movie that i have grown up with, so i am probably much more forgiving than some other reviewers. The musical score is very much the 80s' stereotype; bouncy, happy, and up tempo, but i personally think it works. Everyone gives good performances, and there is blessedly a lack of cheesy special effects. I'm sure that people coming home from \\"attack of the clones\\" or something will be disappointed, but the lack of eye candy meant that the actors had to actually act, instead of letting stupid computer animated creations take the attention off of them. <br />Overall, a good fantasy movie with fun performances and a decent plotline. Magic, religion and matthew broderick - somehow it all pulls together for a great movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini-series (the moniker seems too trivial) is perhaps the greatest war movie of all time.  I cannot possibly do it justice in less than 1,000 words, so I won't try.  Yes, this movie is definitely not for the squeemish - then again, neither is war.  This movie will make you cry, make you think, make you cheer and make you appreciate the sacrifices of a previous generation.  With all of the evil and other problems in the world today, this movie will inspire you to do what you can.  It will also make you wonder - would I have what it took?
0316666343|5.0|I was so sorry for this book to end.  I must admit that I was intrigued by a book told from a dead child's perspective.  However, this was a terrific book from start to finish.  Excellent character development, and a unique story.
B00004RFFM|4.0|Sharks eating people. How can I lie? This is exactly what 90% of the movie is about. However, some  how the  director pulled it off in an intriguing and unexpected way. This isn't your average Jaws movie. There ain't no  music to tell you when it's coming! It  just comes!  and yes there are  times when you'll jump  in your seat. This movie is full of irony. There are many surprises. One major surprise, LL cool J makes it!Can you believe it! Finally  we are not the first to get messed up on screen. Yeah baby. You gotta see this movie. Don't  forget to sing along to LL cool J's  theme song at the end!
B00000JHAU|2.0|My first encounter with Belle and Sebastian came in '97, when \\"Sinister\\" rode a tsunami of ecstatic, sky-high praise. Bold comparisons were made. \\"The Go-Betweens! The Smiths! Felt!\\" Most people know not to toss those references around lightly. With these bands topping my mental \\"greatest bands ever\\" list, and being painfully aware how badly the 90s lacked something comparable to that genre, I immediately bought a used promo copy of \\"Sinister.\\" A huge sticker on the jewel case displayed heaps more gushing praise. My expectations were through the roof.    You can see where this is going: I get home, pop this puppy in my CD player, long story short - I'm a little let down. But, before digging up my receipt, I give it another listen. Okay, \\"Seeing Other People\\" is actually pretty cool; great piano, nice chord changes, a bit sophisticated. Ditto \\"Dylan in the Movies\\" with its glockenspiel. The title track is catchy, but nothing extraordinary. The simple, jazzy opening song is nice, although the over-long intro doesn't stir up the drama the band might've envisioned. But after repeated listens, the other songs failed to leave any real impression.    But wait! Sure, \\"Sinister\\" has its moments, but geez, the Go-Betweens and the Smiths? This pales next to them! Show me a B&S melody as melodic or emotionally stirring as \\"This Charming Man\\" or \\"Unkind Unwise.\\" Show me where the B&S rhythm section comes close to the inventiveness of Vickers/Morrisson or the confident muscle of Rourke/Joyce. This demonstrates the dubiousness of the Smiths/Go-Betweens comparisons. B&S are merely above-average twee-pop. The Go-Betweens and Smiths avoided twee with inventive chord changes and arrangements, and eclectic influences that went far beyond the insipid jingle-jangle of most c86. So, why not instead compare B&S to bands like Brilliant Corners, the Pastels, or the Close Lobsters? Those decent, yet sometimes faceless, pop acts that burst onto the scene, desperately - and badly - aping the Smiths and Orange Juice.    Where the Go-Betweens sang with heartfelt, unique voices of ironic tales about things that *adults* generally experience, singer Stuart Murdoch merely throws together trite, precious, self-aware lines about the more unsavory people in his puerile \\"scene\\". Even when he's critical of the scene, he still seems very much *a part* of it, like he's writing about all the petty dramas his pals got caught up in last week.    So, why all these comparisons to bands whom, after close scrutiny, B&S has little in common with? And do I really want someone to sound just like the Go-Betweens and the Smiths anyway? No, I merely want someone who writes songs that affect me as strongly; someone who breathes new life into pop music, who is daring, innovative, with their own take on those weak-in-the-knees melodies.     \\"Sinister\\" is their best album, and the one to start with; I don't have anything nice to say about the bland cack they've churned out since. But if you must own one B&S album, you know the drill...
6303402348|5.0|This was a very good movie. It made you laugh. It  made you cry.<br />It made you feel  joyful. Very inspirational. Teaches good life lessons. A movie you  will not and can't ever  forget. Tom Hank's best performance yet!

I've got the European version of this CD which includes an extra song/track called \\"Girl in the mirror.\\" My most favorite songs on this CD are, Stronger and When your eyes say it.

6300271145|5.0|Simply the best film about Jazz ever made. The acting by real life sax player Dexter Gorden, the sets, the mood, and most of all the music are pure Jazz.The pace is slow, but the story pulls you in. I knew little about Jazz when I first saw this at age 22, but since this movie I am a Jazz nut. There is incredible attention to detail of 1950's Paris, and of the Blue Note club. Most of the soundtrack was recorded right on screen, so you see and hear bebop being created before you very eyes.
B0000041TD|5.0|And it's legendary for good reason. Pavarotti's sweet, ringing lyric-spinto tenor voice wraps itself around the role of Rodolfo like the lover he is. This voice soars to the skies with Rodolfo's love for Mimi, sung here by the lovely and affecting Mirella Freni. Here is a Mimi who can melt hearts of solid ice and her performance with Pavarotti is irresistible. <br />We come to the voice of Nicolai Ghiaurov, a man with an instrument worthy of a god. What does he do with the very human role of Colline? He sings it magnificently, bringing to life dimensions I have never heard out of any other bass, with the possible exception of Giorgio Tozzi. Colline's farewell to his jacket, in his pitiful and touching attempt to save Mimi, brings tears to my eyes when Ghiaurov sings it. How such a gigantic voice can sound so sincere and sentimental is a mystery to me, but Ghiaurov pulls it off superbly. This is no fluke. Listen to Ghiaurov as the tortured Boris Godunov says farewell to his son as he is dying, and you will come to appreciate what a master singer Ghiaurov was. <BR> <BR>Everyone here pulls together to give us a spritely yet tragic Boheme worthy of the ages. This is a worthy companion for the classic versions with Gigli, Callas and di Stefano, and Beecham conducting Bjoerling, Victoria de los Angeles, and Robert Merrill. If you love Puccini and this opera, you owe it to yourself to get this performance. Do yourself a big favor and buy this!
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is my favorite album in my collection.  When asked what three CDs I would take with me to a desert island this is the first one that comes to mind.  I look forward to rediscovering it in 10 years and forcing my children to listen to it.  :)
B00005JKJA|5.0|A mind-bending and misunderstood film primarily because the story is revealed out of sequence, and includes dream and real elements.  We are allowed to encounter two disparate worlds here, both the signature Lynch too-vivid-to-be-true style (like Blue Velvet), the stuff of dreams, where time and conversation and color and humor are skewed; as well as the brutally-honest world, where tired characters must face the depressing truth that Hollywood flattens more dreams than it uplifts, love is hard to find, and girls who win jitterbug dancing contests may not be headed for easy stardom.  This is vintage Lynch with all the images, color, double-meanings, and twists of plot you expect.<br />This campy and visually delicious film shows a re-imagined story where everything and everyone is transformed, and the story is interesting and enticing.  A mystery is unfolding; a mystery of identity, love, reality vs. dream, and life vs. death.  All lines are crossed.  Then the film reveals the sad reality, completely changing the tone of the last third of the film, and causing us to reframe the whole story.<br />The acting is sensational, especially Naomi Watts, who transforms herself into two different characters, barely recognizable as the same woman.  Those who enjoy symbolism will be occupied for hours, analyzing the blue key(s), nametags, the meaning of \\"Silencio, no hay banda,\\" the cowboy's speech about our attitudes shaping our lives, recognizing what is dream vs. reality, and discovering numerous links between them.  If you enjoy complicated movies, you will chew on Mulholland Drive for hours after the credits roll.
0684833395|5.0|This is a great book that should be re-read annually. It is a mordant and sarcastic black comedy that shows the folly of war and the foibles of that most bureaucratic institution of all, the U.S. military. In this time of a never-ending &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;, this is a book that should be read by everyone.
B0000019PA|5.0|I just bought this album a few weeks ago and I have been listening to it constantly. I have never heard something so expressive and emotional and weird and catchy. Jeff Magnum has done the impossible in making a concept album about Anne Frank while keeping it so immediate and intimate. The lyrics are weird on a first listen, but they have so many layers of meaning to different people on further inspections. And &quot;Oh Comely&quot; is a 8 minute masterpiece and a high point among high points. This album is amazing. Everyone who cares about great music should have it.
0441008356|5.0|I came to Alastair Reynolds after reading several CJ Cherryh books (Cyteen, Devil To The Belt). I was interested in more SF, but was kind of tired of the soap-opera and political wrangling of Cherryh's books. Don't get me wrong, I love her books, but sometimes I just want to read a book about spacey traditional SF stuff.<br />Alastair Reynolds' first book, Revelation Space, offers a rich story weaving several complex independant plotlines into one whole story spanning many hundreds of years, with the very fate of humanity at its epicentre.<br />Its mature, grown-up fiction. People are ugly and dishonest. Ships arent gleaming chrome arrows flying through space at faster-than-light speeds, and there arent hundreds of benevolent alien races out there working hand in hand. Reynolds paints a dark but plausible future for humanity.<br />What I most appreciated about the book was the seeming determination of the author to \\"keep his feet on the ground.\\" Only once or twice does Reynolds spin off into the SF mumbo-jumbo that often pollutes other operatic SF novels. Reynolds is an astronomer, and that, perhaps, is the root of his reserved prose.<br />Overall a wholly enjoyable book. When you finish, you might want to pick up the other books he has written. Amazon.com does not sell them in the US, but amazon.co.uk does sell the three other books -- two of which are sequels, and the other takes place in the same universe.<br />Highly recommended.
0553573403|5.0|Let's put it this way, I'm ordering the next in this series.  One of those books that you just CANNOT put down!  After going to sleep at night, I'd dream of the characters in the book, and could not wait to read more about them the next day.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Yes cool!  You've got to be on your toes to watch this fast paced, fast thinking, fast talking, comedy/suspense/gore-fest....written and directed by none other than Guy Ritchie.  It is smart and back and forth and sideways, but it is incredibly entertaining, now I'll try to explain it somehow.  Del Toro steals a diamond, Pitt gets into a fight, everyone want the diamond back, no one understand Pitt when he talks, and then there's the squeaky dog.  If that didn't make sense, watch the movie....you'll be lost too, for the first half hour, then it'll all be coming together, then everyone gets their own in the end and I can't say everyone lives happily ever after, but it works out.  It's well worth the ride, I hope you enjoy it....there's bungling robbers, the Russian guy who won't die, and that boxing promoter from hell who owns a pig farm.....trust me watch.  Ritchie has some imagination!
0380799006|5.0|I have three children - the oldest are girls ages 8 and 6 and boy age 3.  This book was wonderful.

B000002IPZ|3.0|Felt rushed and uninspired. While &quot;The end of the beginning/Faces in the sky&quot; is a pretty good combo song, and the bass intro to &quot;Souls of Black&quot; is very catchy, the rest is kind of bland. Actually &quot;the Legacy&quot; is also a very good song (I seem to really enjoy Testament ballads).<br />A better choice is their first 2 albums, especially the New Order. Practice what you preach aint bad either.

I love how she speaks her mind and does it with so much talent! She stands for what she believes in! I want to be like her. I dont understand how anyone could hate her. She is sooooo awesome! Better than Metalica! YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD TODAY!!:)
0440180295|5.0|I checked this book out of a USAF base library 20 years ago specifically because it was a perennial on local school district banned book lists when I was growing up.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have given it a second thought.  I ended up reading most of the rest of KV's books, which in turn, had a great deal with the shaping of my political point of view.  To the school districts of Long Island N.Y who banned this book during the 70's, thanks for showing me the way to the best reading experiences I've ever had.  What good is this book? Well, I'm no literary critic, but I will say to younger readers out there, this book was the first I read that married comic and tragic elements in the same instance.  KV may not have invented this concept, but he certainly knows how to use it.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album deserves at least a handful of spins in the stereo before it /really/ sinks in. Old fans will recognize the distinct QOTSA sound instantly, while new fans probably would like to compare it to Foo Fighters', Screaming Trees' or both. Which <BR>wouldn't be fair to any of the bands.<br />As always, Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri carves their own niche in the more mainstreamed music world of today. This record is not an exception. Nor will it dissapoint you.<br />The album is presented to you like you were listening to someone who is listening to radio. You get the feeling you're not in control. I don't wan't to give away too much, but it's a cool approach to catch the listeners attention.<br />'Millionaire' is a great opener for the album, it gets you started right off. Nicks fierce singing is taken to the very edge of what he handles best. Fast songs, with a lot of energy.<br />The order of the songs are very important to this album, not only because of the 'Radio theme', but also because they melt togehter, almost as good as on &quot;Blues for The Red Sun&quot;. It's sort of a rollercoaster ride. Fast - Slow - Fast again. A sudden stop. And then a moment of intesity followed by that mellowy stomach feeling you get after a really great ride.<br />The songs are as simple as always, and the simpler they are, the more outstanding they become. 'Go With The Flow' and 'First It Giveth ...' are excellent examples of this. Almost too simple sometimes, as in &quot;Six Shooters&quot;. But QOTSA gets away with this. It's sort of an intermission on the album, or rather like a:<br />&quot;- Wake up, did you think it was over already&quot;. But it's not.<br />The length of the album is perfect. You'll have time to forget the first song when the record hits the last.<br />This album has it all: Old, new, borrowed and blue.<BR>Well maybe not borrowed. But there are songs which hardcore fans will recognize. Some of the songs appeared in a different form on various 'Desert Sessions'. Just like they did on 'Rated R'<br />This album is as good as 'Rated R'. In fact, they'd make a great double CD. They complete each other in some strange way. The only problem is, it would be too many good songs at one time.

B00005JKDR|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy of this DVD, and I highly recommend it. The extras will take you through a plethora of Monster info, including behind the scenes \\"flubs\\" and \\"outtakes\\", an Academy Award winning short by Pixar, and even an extra Monster Inc. short for good measure.<br />The film itself was one I missed in the theater, and I'm glad I got the chance to see it on DVD. From the opening segment, I was hooked. The title sequence is a wonderful throwback to the 1960's, with colorful collages of doors and monsters playing with the titles. Hollywood was always doing that sort of thing in the past for their musicals or comedies, using models, sculptures, and even cartoons for animated title sequences. There's a quaintness about it that is sorely missing from today's movies.<br />The animation is flawless, and far better than Pixar's breakthrough feature, \\"Toy Story\\". The monsters are all quite cleverly designed, and there are a wealth of subtle visual gags and jokes that will keep you in stitches. Best of all, adults will enjoy the feature just as much as kids if not more. The creators leaned away from saccharine syrupy sap and went right for the funny bone.<br />There are quite a few interesting elements, from the closet door storage system and \\"launch\\" center, to different facets of daily monster life. The idea of monsters collecting the screams of scared kids as an energy source is pretty clever.<br />The performances are perfect. John Goodman as Sulley and Billy Crystal as Mike play off one another as if they were an old comedy team still bantering after a long and successful career together. Steve Buscemi is suitably slimy as Randall, the evil chameleon, and James Coburn lends his voice as the boss of Monsters, Inc. John Ratzenberger pops up as a strikingly Bumble-esque Yeti, and Frank Oz and Bonnie Hunt round out the team.<br />This is a great animated feature, and you'll love it even more on DVD.

B000002GWN|3.0|Most of Joni Mitchell's albums merit a 5* rating--she's that good. Unfortunately, this 1974 joint effort with Tom Scott's jazz/rock fusion band is not one of her better albums. The band's sound is too polished, with predictable, dated riffs and electronic hooks (as if Ms. Mitchell needs any of this). Most of all, the band insinuates itself on Ms. Mitchell, rather than complementing her. Fortunately, much of the album is Joni without the full band.<br />The two opening tracks, \\"You Turn Me On I'm a Radio\\" and \\"Big Yellow Taxi,\\" get things off to a bad start. On 'Radio,' there is, at least, one good section where Ms. Mitchell accompanies a slide guitar: The two voices don't seem to be competing for attention. However,\\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" is mostly terrible. The band's often praised \\"jazz/rock\\" styling lays down the backing with the subtlety of Las Vegas. Though it doesn't last too long, Tom Scott's prototypical jazz/rock 70's sax, the kind of sound you've heard ad nauseum opening \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" sounds so dated that you'll go outside expecting to see feathered haircuts.<br />The band lays back more on \\"Rainy Night House.\\" Although it's not one of Ms. Mitchell's strongest songs, at least we can hear Joni with minimal distraction (until the guitar enters later). \\"Woodstock\\" is played fast, opening with a guitar solo, but the dated, clich&eacute;d guitar lines and bass riff overpower the song. Obviously, I'm not impressed with the band's sound-they haven't worn well with time. But it's more than the arrangements, it's the way they call attention to themselves. You don't use such a preeminent singer as a mere addition to your own bravado playing, especially when that playing seems so calculated and trendy. This is the style that gave jazz/rock a bad name. If you want to hear Joni, listen to \\"Blue\\" or any other great album; if you want jazz/rock, listen to how Miles Davis does it.<br />Now the good news: Beginning with Track 5 (\\"Cactus Tree\\") the band lays out more, and the album is rescued. Tracks 5 and Track 6 are more restrained, with Track 6 (\\"Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire\\") the better of the two. There's a good blues edge to it, and the violin solo adds texture. Ms. Mitchell stays up in the high register on \\"A Case of You,\\" there aren't quite as many of her captivating high/low tone vocal transitions, but it's still a compelling performance, and her guitar is a masterpiece of dazzling understatement. \\"Blue\\" is quietly powerful, with beautiful singing and exquisite accompaniment on piano. It's one of the best cuts on the album. Ms. Mitchell has some playful and interesting talking with the audience on \\"Both Sides Now,\\" and the sing-along on the chorus works. Still, she's a bit overmiked, and the resulting sound is a little cold. \\"All I Want\\" features some excellent percussive guitar. Vocally, we get a fuller range and beautiful liquid singing; it's quintessential Joni Mitchell.<br />\\"Real Good for Free\\" is all right, and a soft, reflective \\"Both Sides Now\\" with just Joni on guitar and minimal comping is satisfying until Robben Ford almost ruins the mood with a showy ending. This signals the reappearance of the full band. \\"Carey\\" is rocking enough without the electronic flash and wa-wa effects blaring here; it sounds like \\"Joni on Parade\\" at Disneyland, all electric lights and feel-good, sanitized power guitar. Ugh. \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\" features the same bubbly guitar and electronic effects. They're distracting sounds that neither add to nor complement the song. I have the same complaints about the last two songs, especially \\"Love or Money,\\" with Scott's wailing sax and Robben Ford's indulgent solo bringing things to a close.<br />Obviously, I don't like the arrangements or the orchestration here! If you happen to like these, then do get the album. However, I think it's a failed experiment-the band and Joni Mitchell never really coalesce, and the result is an overbearing and distracting sound that almost never mesheswith the vocals. The best songs here have the least accompaniment, they're the ones in which we can hear the magical Joni shine and soar.h the vocals.

0805062971|5.0|Palahniuk's \\"Fight Club\\" is an amazing story that leads one through the depression of our lives and gives us an answer...Hitting bottom. What this book offers is new insight to the world and challenges or social conventions as well as the more important problem - ourselves and what we perceive as \\"normal\\", \\"cool\\", and \\"good\\". This novel has a hero that cannot delineate the world around him, fact from fiction, and reality from fantasy. A nihilistic theme and a quick paced novel, the chapters throw the reader from haunting truths to outrageous humor. This is a great read and a handy novel to caution the pursuit of a material life grounded on social norms of behavior, especially the definition of beauty - in magazines, televison, and through tradition. Throw out the old and begin again, lost in oblivion without hope there is peace and a little club that we cannot talk about.
6304493711|1.0|As my mother once had to be cut from a car wreck due to another vehicle's irresponsible driver, I found the opening to this film less than amusing. <BR>Am I behind the times or did anyone else find the fact that MacDowell's character was prepared to cheat on her fiance the night before her marriage repellent? Likewise, Grant's character's acceptance of this as perfectly normal behaviour? We are meant to go on finding these two promiscuous wretches cute. MacDowell then has the nerve to blame her husband for the failure of her marriage. Cringe.<BR>I also find it odd that a gay man would want to give a speech in church when the 'good' book has hardly been welcoming towards homosexuality. The film then gets terribly maudlin over the fact that this man believes his life is no more because he will never meet another fat, loud, hairy man again. Er....<BR>Now, before you say this review smacks of someone whose got out out of the wrong side of the bed this morning and hasn't had any lurve or sack action since we went decimal, I'd just like to say I have no bed and you can always pay for it.

B00006FXB6|5.0|The long awaited album, Songs for the Deaf, is as far as I'm concerned, the best thing to be sold in a record store since the last QOTSA album. These guys are amazing. My suggestion to you, buy Songs for the Deaf and I promise you won't be sorry.
B00005JCA9|2.0|None of this rings true, a sentiment apparently endorsed by Roberts who did not believe in a lot of her character's actions, especially over the old photographs. This may explain the lack of chemistry between the two stars and Robert's curiously stiff and un-attractive performance. I didn't believe in the press scrum outside Grant's front door, either. For a start, the police wouldn't accept an obstruction in a narrow street like that, but I won't carp on. There's the odd laugh.
B0000024IE|5.0|First the good...  This album sounds incredible!  Rap's best (in my opinion) and it harkens back to the day when rappers were able to talk and keep their hand off their crotch at the same time.  There is a positive message to be found, such as the virtues of self-reliance and having respect for women.  <br />Having said that, it is unfortunate that PE pushes such a strong racialist message.  I don't know whether they are truly separatists or just sound like such, but the hate speech and self-victimization are really unnecessary and non-conducive.  Imagining their own enemies seems to be an obsession for PE.  Their follow-up to this album contains the song \\"Can't Truss It,\\" with a strong anti-slavery message (presumably to discourage those who are considering it as an avocation).<br />This is still one of my favorite albums.  There is a lot of genius behind each song and the way that the collection unfolds from beginning to end.  Not having to hear women talked of in terms of their genitalia is an \\"old-school\\" feature that modern hip-hop should consider emulating.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Which is translated to \\"A Good Beginning\\" in English. Not only is it a good beginning but one of the most solid and complete debut albums that very few artists can match up to. This album is astonishing, Powerful, and Inspiring. At about the 5th through 10th listens, I had a few thoughts. I thought maybe a few things on this album are just a 'gimmick' such as the 'deep' sounding guitar playing with a cello bow, the abstract cover art, the singing all in Icelandic, and even the vocal style itself, just so it seems mysterious or something. Well, that is certainly not the case. I can listen to this CD from beginning to end with immense enjoyability, even if the songs seem to drag on a bit. Sigur R&oacute;s manage to get a sort of 'unearthly' and very creative type of overall sound (with the characteristics I mentioned above) which will keep you coming back for more, even if it seems very unusual on your first few listens.<br />Sigur R&oacute;s uses a variety of instruments, such as pianos/keyboards, violins, and the occasional trumpets. The sweet piano melodies in \\"Viðrar Vel Til Loft&aacute;r&aacute;sa,\\" \\"Star&aacute;lfur,\\" and the title track are unforgettable. The melodies played on every song is just brilliant. The violins in \\"Star&aacute;lfur\\" are the most emotionally conveying instrument and are used in most other songs too which bring such a warm feeling. The lyrics are very unusual, and I don't think i fully understand them (when translated) but they certainly aren't immature or meaningless.<br />This album will require a very open mind and a listener who can appreciate what the band is doing. It can seem very overwhelming at first. To start off, the songs that amazon[.com] has avalible for download are good, especially the title track. \\"Svefn-G-Englar\\" might seem slightly repetitve on first few listens, so it's not really a good impression of the album as a whole. But Overall, the album should be appreciated as a whole more then an individual song. Some complaints are it sounds too repetitive or boring. It is atmospheric. Sigur Ros is a band that pours heaps of feeling into what they play and are actually true musicians who love what they're doing. Keep an open mind and you shall be rewarded and suprised.r boring.

B00006FXB6|5.0|Queens continue where the Desert Sessions records end.  More ploished, but this record has the same eclectic feel with lots of different styles, sounds and singers.  Oliveri and Grohl sound great together giving this record the best foundation out all three releases.
B000002HJA|5.0|Many observers, particularly music critics, felt that Kyuss had lost sight of their consistent songwriting here and produced a sub-standard record. I beg to differ. Kyuss managed to sound like they were progressing, always smashing musical boundaries on each release, and here they adopt a more experimental, expansive sound with stunning results. They retain their signature sound, but wander down other musical avenues. Where opener 'Hurricane' is a short, sharp nod of the head to their colective past, containing all of the earth rumbling bass, fuzzy guitars and raw vocals we would expect from the band, 'One inch man' , the second song, employs wah-wah effects from Homme, an almost guitar free verse and explosive, catchy chorus, as well as a rare guitar solo.<br />Also, we have some high quality instrumentals here, with 'Thee ol' boozeroony' and 'Jumbo blimp jumbo' extending the trend of ludicrous song title and excellent instrumental work that was practically expected by then. 'Phototropic' and 'Spaceship landing' are very ambitious and different in sound and scope, with the former a psychedelic, repetitive dirge which unexpectedly blossoms into vocal life late in the song, and the latter a multi-sectioned tour de force, heavy to a fault, containing excellent lyrics and more superb riffs in a single song than most bands churn out in a lifetime. Elsewhere, 'Tangy Zizzle' is the stoner rock blueprint, the Kyuss sound and attitude personified, being a short, super heavy explosion of noise. 'Size Queen' and 'Catamaran' are wonderful songs to throw at Kyuss' detractors: they are different and superb, with soulful lyrics and touching melodies. Ive heard a lot of songs by a lot of bands, but Ive certainly never heard anything quite like 'Catmaran', making it very difficult to describe in words.<br />All in all, a superb way for such a talented band to bow out. essential for any Kyuss fan, and while its not the best place to start for new fans, certainly well worth the time to discover fully.<br />Superb.iscover fully.<BR>Superb.
B00005OAIE|5.0|When I first bought Room For Squares by John Mayer I became somewhat of a skeptical critic, thinking that \\"No Such Thing\\" and \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" would be the only good songs with the rest being fillers but I couldn't have been more wrong on that assumption. Songs like \\"Why Georgia\\", \\"Neon\\", \\"City Love\\" and \\"Back To You\\" surpass the singles by a long-shot, making his radio hits seem trite in pale comparison. I just hope that John Mayer can dish up more than just 2 hits and actually stick around the music industry long enough to say \\"I made it!\\" instead of vanquishing into oblivion like so many artists of his status tend to do. As for the Dave Matthews Band comparisons, I just don't understand it! I'm a pretty big fan of D.M.B. and I don't find them at all similar in sound. What I really find interesting about this album, however, is how it skips track 13 and goes straight to 14. He must be superstitious or something. Either way it shouldn't really matter because this album will make you feel good and is guaranteed to put you in a better mood, which is a great thing when you're having a [bad] day.<br />This, along with David Gray's White Ladder and Jack Johnson's Brushfire Fairytales, is highly recommended.
B000002MQ9|5.0|I must confess that I was quite late in becoming familiar with Dead Can Dance, and missed their glory days by a longshot. Considering that I was listening to a number of their stylistic contemporaries, I'm not sure how I missed out for so long. It's very unfortunate that Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry are no longer making music together, but the material that they did create easily stands among the finest and deepest in the past couple decades. To me, Within the Realm of a Dying Sun represents their first true (and arguably purest) masterpiece. Everything they made from Spleen and Ideal onwards was unique and rich both in melody and content, but this particular album sends shudders down my spine like few others can. Although this is far from being a bright and pretty work, the growth between it and their rather unexceptional, Goth-style debut in 1984 is really quite an extraordinary shift.<br />The arrangement of the songs is a bit peculiar from the very first listen; this is the only album in which Brendan and Lisa evenly split the vocal/songwriting responsibilities, and - in particular - each respectively get one half of the album. As awkward and unnatural as it may sound, it works perfectly, with the two halves complementing each other like they were meant to fall in that order. Still, there is a heavy medieval and Gothic tinge to the songs, intensifying more and more as the album progresses. The atmosphere is only charged further by the addition of strings, tympani and horns, which accent the music beautifully. Brendan's songs are dark, but not quite depressing, with lyrics focusing more on a spiritual and philosophical plane than a dreary and nihilistic one. Each song of his seems to be part of a gradual crescendo, slowly becoming more urgent and intense. It all comes to a head on \\"Dawn of the Iconoclast,\\" a downright unsettling piece that heralds Lisa's entrance as the primary vocalist. The tension loosens a bit with the beginning of \\"Cantara,\\" but thunders upagain after a minute into the song, continuing until the chimes and orchestra of \\"Summoning of the Muse\\" take its place. The grand finale is \\"Persephone,\\" which begins with Lisa's incredibly rich lower register, moving into a stirring string section that then segues into a thoroughly beautiful vocal performance. Her singing becomes increasingly powerful, building the song up more and more before finally letting it collapse down into a bittersweet and disquieted ending.<br />Within the Realm of a Dying Sun is probably not the easiest introduction to Dead Can Dance's work (try Aion or Into the Labyrinth), but it is likely one of the most rewarding after repeated listens. The subsequent effort, The Serpent's Egg, begins a steady shift away from their heavier and darker work, so in a way this release marks the final climax of their early period. It is without a doubt one of their finest moments, however, and should not be neglected in any fan's collection.
0618129022|5.0|When you think fantasy, one man comes to mind and stands above all others:  J.R.R. Tolkien. His genius can not be overstated, and this was his shining moment. What he did with this work is extraordinary in that it forever defined the fantasy genre. Who can mention wizards without having an old man with a long beard and pointy hat come to mind? The same could be said for Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs--when you mention the name, you picture them in your head the way Tolkien defined them. This is how you can say he was revolutionary; his creatures, races, and ideas have been used over and over again since these books first made their appearance.<BR>Every genre has it's pioneer, the one who established the boundaries to be used for generations after. In the fantasy genre, this pioneer was J.R.R. Tolkien.<BR>As for the books, they are set in middle-earth, a world so elaborate and intriguing that you would never be able to explore it all, though you have a great desire to. The characters are many, and they are all masterfully developed, each having his role in this classic depiction of good versus evil. While some aspects of the reading (poems, extensive detail, etc) are a little heavy for children, this is a timeless story, infinitely intriguing. If this book has a flaw, it is that you will not be able to put it down, and it will quite possibly disrupt every other aspect of your life until you finish it.<BR>This book is a must have for anyone's library.  The field of literature will be forever indebted to Tolkien for his enormous contribution to the world of fiction. This is a classic which will endure the strains of time and entertain for generations to come.

B00004SVID|5.0|It's true, the music of Pink Floyd is somewhat of an acquired taste. Despite that, some of their classics, such as 'The Wall' and 'The Dark Side of the Moon', have built up a huge following over the years.  This album is a live version of 'The Wall', performed in it's entirety.<BR>Let me say that this is one of the greatest live albums you'll ever hear.  The performance is flawless, and this version is arguably better than the studio.  Roger Waters' voice is even more menacing than on the studio version, and he sings with all the passion of a twisted, tortured soul.  There definitely is more emotion in his vocals, and that in turn makes the whole concept of the album more real.<BR>The best track on this album is the beautiful version of 'Comfortably Numb', with the chilling voice of Waters and the sweet, serenading voice of David Gilmore intertwining over a rhythm of guitar and drums.  <BR>The sound quality on this album is excellent, and both the voices and the music are crystal clear. <br />This is a great addition to any classic rock collection and a must have for fans of Pink Floyd.

From the news story at the beginning- to the church bells of Do You Love Me, you know you are really listening to a great piece of art, by a band that never really set out to do artsy records.On the first few albums, the band stayed in one area, and didn't stray from that sound.They made up for that with Destroyer, because every song is entirely different, thus broadening the horizons and keeping things fresh.Throughout the 80's, they did a lot of stuff that wasn't wonderful, but tolerable.Oddly enough, I didn't like another one of their albums this much until Revenge came out in 92-which I can praise almost as much.

B000003TAR|5.0|This is a massive work of art.  Everything that you hate about phony rock & roll can be wiped clean by one listen to \\"In Utero\\", one of the rawest, cathartic and most emotionally-truthful experiences in all of rock music.  A recent issue of GUITAR WORLD described the production on the album as \\"a bad root canal\\", which should be taken as high praise.  Songs like \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" and \\"tourette's\\" kick out the jams in high punk fashion, but with a fury that is too often missing from current-day 'moderate rock'.  Sure, you can hate Cobain for giving in to his demons, but be sure to thank him for one of the greatest ... albums ever created.  I'd take it over \\"Nevermind\\" any day of the week.

B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is The Beatles masterpiece.  The album is flawless from every note played to every word sung, it's seemless and timeless.  Sgt. Peppers may have gotten more press for it's psychedelic overtones and concept form.  But it falls short in comparision to Revolver.  What makes Revolver so great is the way the songs flow through out the album.  From the opening track &quot;Taxman&quot; to the closing psychedelic &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; it never lets up once.  I believe this is the last true album John, Paul, Goerge and Ringo played together as a band.  Every member compiments the other.  Take a listen and let your mind float down streem.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I have listened to this album so many times I lost count. It is utterly essential listening for anyone into this music scene.

Some of my favorites are<br />Fly like an eagle, Take the money and run and the window.<br />If you buy this CD you won't be disapointed.

B00005A46T|3.0|I don't mind telling you: this album is not for Christians! It is very heavy, devilish, and rather intimidating------every song on this album sounds just about the same. But if it's heavy metal you want, it's heavy metal you're gonna get. And Slipknot does once again deliver in this loud & noisy album. I wish they would've quit seeing who can scream the loudest and sing us some real music. However, the opening theme, [515], is guaranteed to creep you out! It sounds like an imitation of people screaming in hell or something. It's a very realistic sound effect and frightning as well! Also, song # 5, Everything Ends, is the best song on this album (in my opinion). \\"You are wrong, ..., and overrated, I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault\\" is how the chorus goes. Also, song # 14, Iowa, is also pretty good (in my opinion only). \\"Relax, it's over. You belong to me. I fill your mouth with dirt.\\" is how it goes. Iowa is the name of the last song on the track and it's also the longest, infact: 15 minutes long! But I like it anyway. <BR>This album isn't for everybody but if you like heavy metal and loud singing and devilish lyrics, then go ahead and get it.
B000002OX7|5.0|Due to some positive comments made, I would like to elaborate on the \\"Spruce Goose\\" comment present in this review for those unfamiliar with that particular bit of history.<br /><br />In the 1940s, Howard Hughes, the famous aviator and notorious recluse, built the largest \\"flying boat\\" ever built.  The plane has the largest wingspan ever.  Martin Scorceses produced a film called \\"The Aviator\\" with Leonardo Decaprio playing Hughes.  The airplane was so massive and so unwieldly that only one flight was ever conducted, with Hughes behind the controls, on November 2, 1947.  After that, the plane was permanently grounded, and no other subsequent models or additional planes built to the specifications of the Spruce Goose were ever built.  The plane is still in existince today.<br /><br />The whole \\"Lifehouse\\" project is analogous to the famous airplane.  \\"Lifehouse\\" was unwieldy, impractical to implement, and no one really knew what Townsend was trying to accomplish with the project.  Ultimately, it was too big for its own good and became doomed due to its size.<br /><br />Mike London 9-10-2012<br />---------------------<br />The Who have always been overshadowed throughout their career by other, more `relevant' trends.  The Who persisted, however, and in the end created a body of work, largely penned by Townshend, which has become stands in the rock canon, but they've always had to fight for the spotlight.  In the mid 1960s they had to contend with The Beatles and Stones and the rest of the Peace movement.  From the early 1970s they had to deal with the singer-songwriter influx, and in the late part of their recording career they had to contend with punk (much of that relationship is dealt with in the highly underrated WHO ARE YOU album).<br /><br />However, in a three year span, The Who was THE center of rock and roll.  From 1969 to 1971, The Who had the world in a spin with ferocious live shows, a whole new idea of what rock and roll could do (TOMMY), and the sheer power and velocity of them live was absolutely amazing.  The Who were at the top of their game, and took the live performance of TOMMY on the road for two years.  Everyone was wondering what their next move would be.<br /><br />WHO'S NEXT was the next move.  Coming from the failed LIFEHOUSE, the album suddenly changed the direction that The Who had been established in.  This is the turning point in The Who's career as far as sound goes.  Townshend went from writing mod anthems to more album-oriented rock.  When listening to albums like TOMMY or SELL OUT or QUICK ONE and then the later albums such as QUADROPHENIA, this one, or WHO ARE YOU, while you can tell it's the same band they've changed their sound drastically.  Although they've always been loud, now The Who were playing genuine hard rock, and boy did it ever rock.<br /><br />The source material for WHO'S NEXT, LIFEHOUSE, a multi-media extravaganza about how rock was going to save the world, has become, like Brian Wilson's SMILE, one of the great mysteries which everyone wonders what would have been had it come to completion.  In The Who's case, I think it benefitted the work overall to not come to completion.  Although it always escapes me why \\"Pure and Easy\\" was left off the album (as well as \\"The Naked Eye\\"), over all WHO'S NEXT plays very tightly, concise, and extremely focused.  Townshend sometimes let the concept bog down the music, although not nearly as much as, say, Roger Waters.  To his immense credit, Townshend always made sure that the songs were very catchy, and TOMMY has some of the band's best music, but taking it outside the context of the \\"concept,\\" the music does not stand up as well as WHO'S NEXT.<br /><br />That's the main difference between TOMMY and WHO'S NEXT, and that's what makes this record such a fascinating listen.  If you know the plot of LIFEHOUSE*, then each song makes sense within its context.  However, what makes WHO'S NEXT so powerful is the fact that, taken out of the LIFEHOUSE context, the music becomes an entirely different animal, which cannot be said for TOMMY.  With LIFEHOUSE failing, instead we, as the listeners, have to take it on the basis of each individual song, and this gives the tracks from WHO'S NEXT more power than they ever could have if Townshend's second rock opera had been fully realised.<br /><br />The best example of Townshend's songs working better outside the LIFEHOUSE plot is, of course, the last track on the album, \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\"  Instead of it being that great finale where Bobby and all his friends have escaped and are playing the final Lost Chord, it acts as excellent social commentary, and coming at the very beginning of the 1970s, after seeing the turbulence of the 1960s and all the tumult we were going through, Townshend manages to pen one phrase that blows the entire free love, hippie generation mentality, and with this one blow they never recovered.  \\"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss,\\" the very climax of the song, hits so hard and so fast it left the culture reeling, making that song the single most powerful statement made against the 1960s.<br /><br />Much of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again's\\" power would have been deflated had LIFEHOUSE been completed.  Another excellent example is \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" which is about the villain of LIFEHOUSE.  Instead of being about one specific villain, it instead becomes about the villain in all of humanity.  The same can be said of \\"Bargain.\\"  Instead of talking about some esoteric Lost Note that will crumble the Grid, Townshend gives us a very spirituality-driven song.  To those who interpret the song about a man and a woman, that's their right, but I've always taken it as more of man's relationship with God.<br /><br />In the end, WHO'S NEXT becomes The Who's most powerful statement, not in spite of LIFEHOUSE's failure, but BECAUSE of LIFEHOUSE's failure.<br /><br />*There are several places on the Internet where you can get in detail LIFEHOUSE's plot.  Essentially, it's a science fiction piece about rock and roll saving the world.  Everyone is plugged into this Grid, and it reads kind of like Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD where they're kept doped up in the fact that they realise nothing's wrong.  Bobby, the main character, decides to instigate a revolution, founds this place called the Lifehouse, where a band is playing music.  When you go to the Lifehouse, people take all your personal data, everything you are, and then you are given your own personal musical identity.  The climax is everyone gets caught up in the music, and everyone's information is fed into this computer which then produces everyone's identity into one single note.  The rebels play the Note, everything is put right in the world, and they live happily ever after.  Townshend was going to actually do this, and The Who would play rock concents and everyone's data would be represented musically.  Can anyone say Spruce Goose?<br /><br />Good science fiction; hard as hell to pull it off in any other format other than the novel.  No wonder it never got completed.<br /><br />P. S.  Stop acting like the bonus tracks are part of the album.  It's unfair to deduct stars from an album because of the bonus material.  They are bonus tracks, simply that.
B000021YQV|5.0|I bought this CD a few months ago and when I heard it I loved it! The Prison Song is great and kind of funny too: \\"I buy my crack, I smack my b***h  RIGHT here in Hollywood!\\" is one of its lyrics. Also, their most popular song entitled \\"Chop Suey\\", is no doubt my favorite song on the CD. The Cd also includes the songs: Bounce,Aerials, Psycho, Forest, and Toxicity. I love it! Try it, that is, if you love hard rock and metal.
B000002OX7|5.0|The Who's definitive album, WHO'S NEXT, came out in 1971, along other such seminal works as Zeppelin's fourth album. Coming off the heels of TOMMY, it probably struck some of the rock fans who were following the band as rather strange, as there was no hint of any overall conceptual idea behind the work. And there's a good reason for that.<br /><br />WHO'S NEXT is the rubble of Townshend's ultimate unrealised project, LIFEHOUSE. A science fiction rock opera, it proved for too unwieldy for the band to pull off, as it was a multimedia project that was never clearly defined by Townshend. Most of the songs from WHO'S NEXT are taken from this project.<br /><br />Fortunately, because Townshend wrote his music and lyrics as much more self-contained and not so narrative driven as TOMMY, the songs work very well outside the context of LIFEHOUSE. Stripped of the rather cumbersome LIFEHOUSE meaning, the songs are allowed new life and new context, totally separate from its original intention. Because they are not tied to LIFEHOUSE, the songs are given a much more universal appeal, with a much broader emotional and intellectual scope incorporated into the writing. The brutally devastating lines \\"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss\\", the single best indictment against the 1960s counterculture and the whole revolutionary mind-set America had taken onto itself, would be stripped of much of its meaning had LIFEHOUSE succeeded. There's spirituality (\\"Bargain\\", \\"Baba O'Reilly\\"), black comedy (\\"My Wife\\"), social commentary (\\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\"), etc.<br /><br />Another notable feature of the album is this is one of the first rock albums to really incorporate synthesizers into the sound.<br /><br />This is one of Pete's best. This is where The Who went from being a mod band to a hard-rockband, and it is here on this album that The Who drastically changed their sound from their previous LPs.<br /><br />Ultimately, WHO'S NEXT just goes to show that, even though Townshend could geta little pretensious with all this rock opera talk, what The Who was really about was kick-ass rock and roll, and WHO'S NEXT has that quality in spades.<br /><br />Mike London<br />October 26, 2007<br /><br />[Somehow, a duplicate review posted on my profile with the WHO'S NEXT review back in 2002. I decided to replace this duplicate review with a new review.  I posted this new review on Amazon.co.uk back in 2007 but never released it on Amazon.com.  Mike London, 9-12-2012]
B000005QH3|5.0|But this movie is for cars and car chases what Top Gun is for fast flying.<BR>Barry Newman is superb as the emotionally haunted hero of this cult classic film.<BR>I saw it in the theater when it came out, own the VHS and can't wait for the DVD. It's stirring, poignant, and makes you want to go find your own Mopar Muscle car and drive like the big boys!<BR>Gillian
B00006FXB6|5.0|Queens of the stone age songs for the Deaf...<br />Its not but every great moon where a buncha stars line up and you have just the right amount of libations flowing in your bloodstream and the music you hear is just so that you are able to levitate.<BR>Thats how I describe this new album. Yep, It is diverse enough to make you want to wreck your car at 120 mph (Track 1* you think I aint worth a dollar but I feel like a millionare)  or float on a wine river whilst making sweet love ( Hanging Tree, secret track) <BR>This album posseses a true diversity and is all about good music, I have missed that for about 10 years now I liked not seeing what clothing brand they were sponsored buy in thelinear notes as well!<BR>I have not stopped listening SONGS FOR THE DEAF sence I bought it there aint a track I skip, I dont want to compare this to other great albums it always gives the wrong impression, Lets just say history repeats itself, Back in 89'-90' music and radio had stagnated, in 91-93 a bunch of bands came out and for a while a lot of music was really good I mean good...this album makes me say \\"here we go again.\\"<br /> <BR>do yourself another favor buy the album quick for a bit it comes with a nice DVD ( sweet bonus )<BR>AND on Sept 9th they will be on Letterman. Watch and convert my friends
079073804X|5.0|What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said ?<BR>Thank heavens they ended up with the cast they did ! Would this movie have been anywhere near as good with the original choices of the late Dana Plato playing Regan or Shirley MacLaine, Audrey Hepburn or Jane Fonda playing the role of Chris ? Surely not ! One of the wonderful things about this film is the cast, after all. They all play their roles to perfection. Linda Blair especially displays brilliance in the role of the sweet as pie pre teen girl who becomes possessed by a demon, wreaking havoc with her mind, body and surrounds.<BR>Even though the movie starts with a slower pace, it holds your interest, right from the opening scenes through to the nerve shattering finale. This film was a masterpiece of special effects way before they were common place and still easily holds it's own today.<BR>The version shown on this DVD is the 25th anniversary re-release with a few extra scenes. They include earlier scenes of Regan's appointments with doctors, which alters the story quite a bit from the first release. This time, by the time she is peeing on the floor and having her bed shake, we already know she has been suffering mood swings and the like. A few extra super-imposed images of the demon pop up in this version also. However, the most talked about addition is the amazing &quot;spider walk&quot;. This is where Regan flips over doing a bend back and scuttles down the stairs in this manner, somewhat resembling a large spider. This act brings to the fore the menace the demon poses to those around Regan earlier into the film.<BR>Also on this DVD release is an insightful directors commentary, an abundance of TV, radio and theatrical trailers, as well as the much hyped documentary &quot;Fear Of God&quot; about the making of the Exorcist. The DVD would almost be worth buying for this alone.<BR>Overall, I recommend this timeless masterpiece to anyone not too squeamish to watch it. Bound to stay a masterpiece forever.
B000066NW0|5.0|i recently got Avril Lavigne's Let Go, and I LOVE it. The songs are great, and her voice ROCKS!!!!! I also love the fact that she came from a small town like she did. It's proof you can make it no matter what. I REALLY do recommend this CD to anyone and everyone.  GO AVRIL!!!!!!
B00006FXB6|5.0|Once again Qotsa have made a truely outstanding album and this one is by far the most truely outstanding of the three. What more is there to say then F**king awesome!
B00006FXB6|5.0|QOTSA have out-done themselves yet again with this record.  I just read an interview where Josh Homme described it as &quot;schizophrenic.&quot;  I think that fits pretty well.  The album is all over the place, but it flows really well at the same time.  I don't know how to explain that paradox other than to say that it's QOTSA and they can pull something like that off.  This is easily the best album I've bought this year.  It's incredibly diverse, as was their last record.  There's no repetition here; each song is unique.  This to me makes QOTSA such a great band and Songs for the Deaf such a great album.
B000069AUI|5.0|I was NOT a big fan of Parachutes.  But I have to revisit it now.<br />\\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is THE best album of 2002 so far.  It will be hard to top.  <br />I know some people hear some U2ness in Coldplay, but I never really have (U2 is my favorite band).  What I do hear is a cross between the best of Radiohead, Moody Blues and Pink Floyd.<br />The songs just envelope and lift you away.  It is so easy to be swallowed up by them.  It just sounds like an instant classic.  It feels like I've always known these songs -- that's how quickly it grabs you.<br />I really don't have too much to add to what's already been said more eloquently by other reviewers.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I'm a Yes's fan from 20 years later. This concert is a perfect concept of musical harmony between one Group and a Sympnonic Orchestra. The sound (DTS) of this DVD is incredible!! and the image was do it perfectly.<BR>This is the better Yes Concert in DVD. Really is an ideal inversion. Although Rick Wakeman (the Best!!) was absent, Tom Brislin serve a good place.
B000005S0V|5.0|When you're dealing with Elton John, it's impossible to fit two decades of hits into a two-disc compilation. For the most part, the song selection is superb. &quot;Your Song&quot; was Elton's first major hit and the obvious choice to lead off this collection. Elton's versions of &quot;Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; were inspired and compare favorably to the original versions, done by the Beatles and the Who. Elton's studio version of &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; was never released as a single in America, although his live version from an Australian concert reached number 6 on the charts.  Nevertheless, the original version has gone on to become one of his most recognizable songs, and definitely belongs among his very best. &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot; is a personal favorite of mine and a welcome inclusion here.  The first disc ends on a high note with his sizzling version of &quot;The Bitch Is Back.&quot;<br />Disc two is more problematic. It starts out strong with his duet with Kiki Dee, &quot;Don't Go Breaking My Heart.&quot; In addition to being a number one single in America, I believe it was Elton's first song to reach number one in England. Many more hit songs follow, but a few curious choices are included. &quot;Song For Guy&quot; is a pleasant enough instrumental but hardly an essential song. &quot;Passengers&quot; is an average album track and does not belong on this compilation. &quot;Easier To Walk Away&quot; is a rarity, but should have been left exclusively on the box set (the aptly titled To Be Continued). &quot;You Gotta Love Someone&quot; is an overlooked classic that closes out disc two on an upbeat note.  There are a few major omissions I would like to mention. Going strictly by chart position, this compilation should have included the top ten songs &quot;Island Girl&quot; (#1), &quot;Mama Can't Buy You Love&quot; (#9), &quot;Little Jeannie&quot; (#3), and &quot;That's What Friends Are For&quot;(#1).  Maybe they will be included on a second volume of his very best songs.  Elton certainly has had enough hits since 1990 to warrant the release of a second volume. &quot;The Very Best Of Elton John&quot; is an essential purchase for Elton's fans who already have all of his albums, and an excellent starting point for those just beginning their Elton John collection.
6304080921|5.0|12 Monkeys is a unique type of film. It's the type of film that comes along only once in a long while. The type of film that you have to cherish every minute of. Of course, we can always count on bizarro god Terry Gilliam, creator of Brazil, to bring us something a little less ordinary than your generic Hollywood drivel.<BR>   12 Monkeys is the uncanny tale of James Cole, an incarcerated sociopath in the year 2035 and a survivor of the plague that wiped out 99% of the population in the years 1996 and 1997. This plague was supposedly spread by \\"The Army Of The Twelve Monkeys\\". James was to be sent back to the year 1996 to investigate it and gather information by a team of eccentric scientists, but something went wrong, and he was sent to 1990. He is then arrested and put in an insane asylum because of his talk of time travel and the lethal virus he was sent to investigate. In this asylum he meets Jeffrey Goines, another patient who also happens to be the son of a famous scientist and expert on viruses. Jeffrey helps James escape, but he is captured and put in an empty room strapped to a bed. He is then brought back to 2035 by the group of scientists. He's sent back to 1996, as originally planned, and kidnaps his doctor at the insane asylum. Things escalate. I don't want to spoil this intriguing story for you.<BR>  I strongly suggest all thinkers go out and rent yourself a copy of this great film. I would also suggest the above mentioned Brazil, City Of Lost Children, Mulholland Drive, and Lost Highway to those who enjoy this. Check it out. <br />Twelve Monkeys<BR>Released In 1996<BR>Directed By Terry Gilliam<BR>Starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt<BR>Rated R for violence and language.
B000069HKH|5.0|I'm not good at reviews but i just wanted to say this is a classic album. I have listened to it just about everyday since it's come out. Many of the songs seem like simple little songs until you realize that he's not being wordy because he doesn't need to be. These songs will linger in your head; i caught myself singing pieces of these songs frequently.<br />i felt &quot;my city of ruins&quot; was the weakest song on the album whereas my favorite songs were: nothing man, empty sky, the rising, and paradise.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath, tells the story of the pain and rebirth of a young girl.  We learn so much about her and her perspective of life.  Although she's not trying to persuade you into believing her beliefs, she is trying to make your perspective on the real world open up.  After reading this book, I am now opened up and enlightened. This book has brought me to ponder all aspects of life.  It is truly a rush. This novel was filled with so much, there was never a dull moment! Take my advice, and read this book!!
B00001OH7P|5.0|I believe this is one of David Bowie's best creations, the music, the fantasy, it's like an on stage play.  Great addition to a true Rock collection, a must have CLASSIC!
0790743507|5.0|This MGM's best musical. Gene Kelley fantastic especially the scene where he sings the title song in a down pore. The movie is about the begining of talking movies at the end of the silent era. The movie contains many of the innocents that were portrayed in the early years of Hollywood. Dennis O'Connor's ruitine \\"Make them laugh\\" is a classic.
B00004RF9G|5.0|Great entertainment for the whole family. Everything Scotland and th Scots are supposed to be like is in here. The music is memorable. All you have to do is believe for a while that there could be a Brigadoon.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I originally wrote Mayer off as a Dave Matthews clone, but now that I've listened to more of his stuff, the dude can play! If you can get past the sticky, humid pop music on this album, you'll soon realized that Mayer has serious guitar chops. <br />After seeing him on Autstin City Limits with Buddy Guy, I just wish John would finally come out of the guitar hero closet.
B00006G8G1|3.0|Iron Maiden and AC/DC are my favorite bands. When AC/DC's \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" DVD came out, I borrowed it from a friend. The quality of the audio and video was excellent but I was disappointed with the video editing. Using a gazillion cameras, the video jumped from camera to camera barely resting on any one artist for a few seconds. After watching for 30 mts, I got a headache and swore never to buy this DVD.    When I saw Maiden's \\"Rock in Rio\\", I was hoping that the video editing would be better but I was disappointed. It is worse! I got a headache watching the DVD within 10 minutes and it wasn't from the loud music, it was from the trigger happy STEVEditor  who seemed to be playing drums on the button which switched between camera feeds (Maybe NICKO really did the editing!)    Its unfortunate when multiple cameras are used to make the user dizzy. I don't understand why the editor cannot focus on an artist for more than a second or two. If I went for a live concert of Maiden's (and I did), I wouldn't be whipping my head round and round trying to look at every artist at the same time.    Want to see better editing? Watch King Crimson's VRROOOM DVD. They have used multiple cameras to give the user multiple viewing angles with each angle (mostly) focusing on a different artist. No headaches here and very sensible editing.    Rock on Maiden, you are still my favorite band. I just won't buy your DVDs :-)

B00006FXB6|5.0|Wow - A truely great release from The Queens of the Stone Age. After dropping all our jaws with 2000's Rated R. the boys step it up a few more notches with Songs For The Deaf. The entire record simply rocks. From the sheer rock muscle of tunes like Millionaire and Six Shooter, to, dare I say pop fare like the great, No One Knows. The whole album works together to really just give a kick the pants to today's bland rock music polluting the air.<br />this time out they have brought aboard Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees) and a little known drummer named Dave Grohl. Each adds depth and focus to an already near perfect effort.<br />Other highlights for me include the amazing Sky Is Fallin' , the strangely sweet Mosquito Song and the dark, Song For The Deaf. I am extremely pleased with what Josh and Co. have achieved on their latest. Far surpasses all expectations
B00006FXB6|5.0|You know how sometimes when you anticipate a CD's release, then become disappointed shortly after the laser hits the aluminum?  Well, what Queens Of The Stone Age have done with this album, is deliver a much needed dose of QUALITY ROCK AND ROLL (if you happen to be in Creed, keep reading.)  Loud guitars, rumbling bass, and crisp drumming have finally become more important than leather pants and whining about life.  Don't forget Josh Homme's vocals, which demonstrate the ability to be strong, and at times, sound weary and distant.  &quot;Millionaire&quot; has a great intro, and at exactly 59 seconds, you find out what you're in for.  Not to mention the hand claps, which brings the listener along with the band for the rest of the CD.  &quot;First It Giveth&quot; features stop on a dime staccato drum and acoustic guitar (!?!) breaks, and &quot;Song For The Dead&quot; has the best breakneck beginning since &quot;Achilles Last Stand.&quot;  With songs like &quot;God Is In The Radio&quot; featuring Sabbath-like guitar tones, and &quot;Mosquito Song&quot; using bizarre string arrangements for the comedown, Queens Of The Stone Age have produced an album that will become a major influence in the future, and have drawn the proverbial line in the sand for every single musical act that thinks they have what it takes to rock and roll.
0804106304|5.0|The Joy Luck Club reflects back and forth between the lives of four Chinese women and their struggles with their past in China in1949. As they relate their lives to their daughters who are Americanized they tell about great struggles and inner strengths that made them who they are. The novel kicks off at a mah jong table where June takes her late mothers place in the Joy Luck Club with all her mothers' friends as they celebrate June going to China to meet her twin sisters and tell them about the death of their mother. <br /> Through out the novel, the mothers tell their stories of horrible tragedies and inner triumphs as they each envy the lives of their daughters and teach them about their past. Tan does a great job in describing the depth of misery that brought these women to find strength that they would have never known they had if it hadn't been for the circumstances given. Tan makes me feel that I am right there feeling the characters pain and then rejoicing in their glory of freedom of spirit! <br /> It is sometimes easy to become confused on which story connects with the other. Despite that, each story is interesting. The book deals with all types of real life struggles mothers and daughters face now and have faced in the past. Although many of the stories deal with Chinese customs, many of the other stories are universally experienced by all women at one time or another. The characters deal with issues such as rape, divorce, failure and abandonment. The mothers and daughters experience love and hate, happiness and despair. Amy Tan introduces all of the characters in the present, but then takes them back to their childhood through their memories. Each woman eventually becomes related to the other women as the stories become more complex. It explores old Chinese customs in detail, as well as the responsibility and honor the Chinese hold for their family. The way she ties in Chinese culture with the adaptation of American life gives the reader a chance to seehow other cultures are. I like exploring into different unique culture because they are unique, interesting and mainly because I am tired of witnessing the American culture and that I thrive for something new.<br /> I enjoy playing mah jong on the internet. It is widely played in Chinese culture. It is a game of skill and wits. The mothers and daughters played the game with actual pieces. Overall I like the book it tells about the Chinese being discriminated in the U.S.A. I think any feminist hesitate to reading this book. This book taught me sometimes how cruel this country can be.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I was never a fan of NO DOUBT, but after seeing some of the videos for the tracks on this album I decided to buy it. I'm very happy with my decision. This is an awesome cd. I can honestly say that I LOVE nearly all of the of the songs here and the rest aren't terrible either. My favorite is track 5-- with Lady Saw--this in one cd you won't tire of quickly. Needless to say I, highly recommened it!
B00000DHTF|5.0|The albums that never were...<br />There is so much to embrace here. My focus as a fan especially of the E Street Band's earlier work (saw many of these same songs performed live in the early 80's, and then they never saw the light of day), is the GREAT stuff left off of \\"Darkness...\\" and \\"The River\\" and the famous unreleased whole album, the Born in the USA-circa \\"Murder, Incorporated\\"...standouts like \\"Bring on the Night\\", \\"Don't Look Back\\", \\"Dollhouse\\", \\"Loose Ends\\", \\"Wages of Sin\\", \\"Take 'Em as They Come\\", \\"Cynthia\\", \\"Frankie\\"...<br />\\"The Rising?\\" Forget it. Go here for the REAL stuff...just like it was back in 1980, 5th Row, Kiel Opera House...4 1/2 hours of hope, faith and glory. And that ain't no Glory Days \\"sir\\"...

B000069HKH|2.0|Bruuuuccccce, buddy...yup, I was disappointed with this effort on many levels, especially after the wait. Yes, there's a certain &quot;sameness&quot; to everything here, but even with that, no real standout material. I like the haunting &quot;Paradise&quot; and the risk taking with &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, but even the most hardcore fan will tell you that &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; or &quot;The Rising&quot; would be throw-away songs off any earlier E Street effort. The weakness of some of the more mid-tempo material is REALLY exposed Live, in concert...it's boring and pretentious, and I hear just a little &quot;chalk squeaking on the chalkboard&quot; with the 9/11 theme visited over and over. I know...people (and artists) DO change, but Bruce for me stands for the passion, excitement and redemption of that (sometimes hopeless) &quot;life on the edge,&quot; and that doesn't ring through here. &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and 9/11?...I'd prefer to forget it, not re-live it. This is a HUGE step backward for an artist that I never thought (but who came close with his non-E Street, double-lp fiasco in the 90's) would sell out. The core fans at recent concerts didn't get up and go to the bathroom during the new material because they had to; they were just too bored to sit through songs that will NEVER stand the test of time with lps like &quot;Darkness...&quot; and &quot;The River.&quot;<br />And all this from a guy who named his fantasy football team the &quot;E Street Angels...&quot;

B000059XXZ|4.0|It's always been known that originals are always better than their sequels because the first has the best villians, the best fights, the most suspense, and many other things. But after watching the three dreadful sequels to Batman without actually seeing the original, I was ready to give up on the superhero and his films. Luckily, my friends told me to forget the horrible sequels and see the very first film. And I was pleaseantly surprised with what I saw: Incredible fight scenes, an unbelievable villain, and a whole lot of thrills and surprises.<br />I ended up buying the film and have enjoyed it every time I watched it. It's one of those films that might be boring after a few views but still is something you want to watch.<br />Batman proves the theory that all originals are far more superior than their sequels. Unlike the violent Batman Returns and the boring Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, Batman has a bit of everything, which holds the film firmly together. The film that would make Tim Burton the most sought after director in Hollywood and actually end up with an Academy Acard despite its violence.<br />Batman, is of course the story of Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) who by day is a multi-millionaire and by the night the crime-stopper Batman. In this original, Batman is forced to take on the Joker (played amazingly by Jack Nicholson), the man who killed his parents. Enter Vicki Vale(Kim Basinger, LA Confidential) a reporter who tries to piece out the man behind the mask. She's determined to find out who the superhero really is and that leads to the film's romantic story.<br />One of my favorite characters is the old butler Alfred (Michael Gough) the only real person who knows Batman's identity. He brings a distinct feeling of comedy and intelligence to the film and establishes himself as a likeable character who you want to see in every scene.<br />Michael Keaton will always be the best Batman (Val Kilmer and George Clooney were horrible) probably because he's a bit different from the others. Joker will probably be the best and most terrifying bad guy because he acts at though it's all a game and all he wants to do is have fun playing it. Kim Basinger will probably be the best lady (Michelle Pfeiffer was not good, Nicole Kidman was good, and Uma Thurman was dreadful) because of her style. And Michael Gough (I think he's the only person who remained for all four movies) is brilliant. Batman is a must get for all superhero, Keaton, action, and Burton fans. It is sure to be a classic and to be remembered in decades to come. Buy it now.<br />Rated PG-13 for some scenes of violencee he's a bit different from the others.

B000062TU1|5.0|You know, they say you can't wear out a CD, but my kids are trying to wear it out anyways. They know the scenes and lines by heart, I can't count the number of times they've watched this movie. The trick getting to the deleted scenes, while it took a while the first time, the kids can get to the deleted scenes now in less than a minute. Some game you have to play, collecting stuff before you can see the deleted scenes. Very good movie, I can still count the number of times I've viewed it on one hand, but I have watched it more than once (the kids must like it better than me).
0971855110|5.0|Of the 4 books on organizing I got I would say this is by far the best.  It's easy to understand, you can work at your own pace, and you get LOTS of support if you sign up on their website for their email list.  My house is clean, and my life more peaceful/relaxed since I read this book and started using it's ideas in my home.
0195117298|5.0|Of course people may have trouble with this book! It grapples with one of the most counter-intuitive hypotheses ever pondered. Unsurprisingly, befuddled readers will readily point fingers at the author's &quot;poor exposition&quot;. When someone fails to understand Joyce or Faulkner, it's the reader's fault, but when someone can't understand a science author, then it's the writer's fault....<br />The fact is that if the author (or anyone else, for that matter) understood the nature of time well enough to spoon-feed us with a crystal-clear, airtight argument (together with its attendant implications, as some readers demand) such insight would already be in the news as the single greatest breakthrough in the history of physics. As it is, the ideas presented in the book are speculative and unstructured. They may even be flawed. So what? To date, they constitute one of the few (if not the only) non-technical discussions of current thoughts on the most baffling aspect of physical reality.<br />This book is clearly meant for those who want to &quot;read about it first&quot;, whenever some interesting idea first appears in print, no matter how undigested. As for those readers who would rather wait for the Discovery-Channel version of everything, their stance is legitimate, but can hardly be blamed on a book.
0385484518|3.0|Mitch Albom, a nationally syndicated sports writer for the Detroit Press, has a chance to visit his old mentor and college professor Morrie Schwartz while he is in the midst of dying.  This book captures that experience.<br />I had such expectations of this book due to the widespread attention and sales this book garnered that anything short of a life-altering experience would be a disappointment.  I thought it would be a transcendent meditation on life, on dying, on the human spirit.  It tries to be these things, but tends to fall short leaning towards the over-sentimental.  It is a noble ideal to share with the rest of the world the wisdom gained from a cherished person.  The author does so with honesty, but I find after reading this two years down the road, the observations, life lessons, philosophy, wisdom gained just hasn't stuck with me.  I would look to other books for life-altering wisdom.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I bought this CD on Mon. it is my new favorit CD and I've had it for 3 days!
B00006950W|5.0|I was sceptical of this film, like everyone else out there. But having been a fan of the brilliant and acclaimed Capcom game series, I gave it a shot. MY GOD. The story, the acting, the effects, the pace of the whole works...all incredible. The film's slow build-up sets an eerie, haunting atmosphere that has an interesting undercurrent of what could go wrong in this nation over the next decade or so, if we let it go on. While Jovavich is again subpar in her mediocere tough-girl acting skills, the gorgeous Michelle Rodrigeuz is a wonder to behold. This movie, disturbing and dark, upsetting but intriguing, is a trans-gender shocker that took my breath away, and the plot was complex and kept you guessing until the end. It also lacked predictability, thankfully. I can't wait until the sequel!!!
B000067DNC|5.0|I have waited a long time to see Season 2 again.  This is where I first came into the show when it was in syndication on my local Fox station.  Now I can see them whenever I want.
B000002W3R|5.0|Just got the Moody Blue cd. It is a very good album. Anyone thinking about getting this album i would say go for it. On a 1-5 5 being the best i would rate it a 5.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Millionaire,\\" the first song on Songs For The Deaf may be familiar to some because it's listed on the WWE Tough Enough 2 Soundtrack.  This song slyly introduces the listener to what's to come with the muffled guitar cranking into full volume less than a minute into the track.  The lead vocal position rotates among the album with Nick Oliveri going first, doing his best Iggy Pop impersonation, which is pretty much him screaming at the top of his lungs.<br />\\"No One Knows\\" has Homme doing lead vocals with his smirking wise-ass style.  \\"No One Knows\\" lets Dave lead the way with boogie style drums.  Oliveri and Homme harmonize over Josh's Ace Frehley-like riff.  This is most likely the first single from Songs For The Deaf, as a video has already been made.  <br />After a funny intro from a Mexican radio jock, \\"First It Giveth\\" comes chugging along as the third track on the album.  Josh remains the vocalist.  It's nice to hear someone involved in \\"metal\\" actually sing instead of growl and groan.  Next is \\"Song For the Dead\\" which let's Grohl do some cool fills on the drums before Homme thuds in.  Oliveri does lead vocals while Homme backs him up.  <br />One of the most interesting elements in Songs For The Deaf  are the smaller touches, like Homme and Oliveri harmonizing, Grohl's stop-start drumming that enforce Homme's tractor-beam like guitar.  In \\"Song For The Dead\\" there are at least three different riffs.  In most metal songs nowadays you get one riff and it wears itself out quick.  <br />The rest of the album gets even heavier if you can believe that.  \\"The  Sky Is Falling\\" is a six minute song that expands and contracts like a black hole.  \\"Six Shooter\\" lets Oliveri vent some anger in two minutes of his screaming.  \\"Hanging Tree\\" Mark Lanegan comes to the forefront with his whiskey soaked voice to a spacey psychedelic type song that is all over the place, but in a good way.  \\"Go With The Flow\\" and \\"Gonna Leave You\\"  go back to that fun boogie sound like \\"No One Knows\\" And  \\"Do It Again\\" sounds like a sports anthem with its \\"Rock and Roll Part 1\\" by Gary Glitter type riff.<br />The last four songs of the album are by far the standouts.  After some crazy radio static complete with revival like radio preachers, we go into \\"God Is In The Radio\\".  This Doors-esque song has one of the best guitar solos I have heard in a long time.  \\"Another Love Song\\" is another trippy psychedelic song complete with organ.  The title track \\"Song For The Deaf\\"  is introduced appropriately by a dominatrix type DJ because this song is dark and primal.  The hidden track on the CD, \\"Mosquito Song\\" is a acoustic number complemented with a horn, piano and string section, reminiscent of earlier power ballads by Led Zeppelin (\\"Going To California) and Black Sabbath (\\"Laguna Sunrise\\").  At the end of the song you can hear something that sounds like the opening riff to \\"Feel Good Hit Of The Summer\\" from Rated R. A nice little surprise.<br /> With nothing but complete objectivity and sincerity, I can say that not only is this QOTSA's best album,  not only one of the best albums of the year, this is one of the all time best.  This ranks up here with Appetite For Destruction,  Reign In Blood, and Superunknown.  This album is a must purchase for anyone who loves it loud, is tired of the modern day rap-metal and poser metal scene or just wants to hear something new.  Stop reading and go buy it.
B000059QY2|5.0|It is awesome masterpiece. There are no words to be adequate of quality of this magnificent performance. I'm 35 old, and thanks to this one I've realizes some things about me. The actors, yes, the actors, because I cannot say that they're singers only are on their top form. The music quality and recording quality make you freezing and detaching out of everything. What can I say? I run on my lunch time to home (I work next to home), for only reason to watch again \\"Bella filia del amore\\" and Rigolleto's song!!!!<BR>I even can't say that somebody here is better! All are better! I thing it is really pearl in opera's history. <BR>If someone will capture like this in the future? First thing I will disagree with some cameraman who cut out Wixel's hands during his highly emotional song. As well in the same area, later they cut out heads of duke's court people. In the \\"bella filia\\" Pavarotti face is out of focus for Gilda's emotions, but Pavarotti's face at the moment is reach by emotions as well: both of them should appear sharp in my opinion.<BR>Finally it is one of the glorious and exciting operas on DVD. Here is nothing mediocre about it: just story of perfection and talent.
B00006AW2O|4.0|Despite being their second American album, 12x5 *completely* outshines the rest of the Stones' early work in the sound quality department. A good part of this album is made up of the '5x5' EP that had been released in the UK; recorded primarily at the legendary Chess Studios, the EP's tracks sounded far, far better than the material the Stones were recording in the UK at the time. Yet while previous issues of 12x5 included the Chess tracks in mono, this new disc presents their inaugural appearence in stereo on CD. Heck, as an extra bonus, the &quot;long&quot; version of 2120 South Michigan Avenue makes an appearence. Cool, eh?<br />...however, there is still a problem, here. This is still just 12x5, which I personally have never been too impressed by. The version of &quot;Time&quot; here is the organ-intro version, which I prefer less than the guitar-intro version, and the rest of the material is the &quot;standard&quot; that the Stones were performing at this point. And with no liner notes (and only 12 tracks), buying 12x5 AGAIN might test someone's patience. That said, the vastly improved sound quality makes this the preferred album introduction to the &quot;early Stones,&quot; and it's definately a valuable entry in the new reissue series.
0812550757|2.0|&quot;Speaker For The Dead&quot; suffers from the same sophomore-outing problems M. Night Shyamalan's &quot;Unbreakable&quot; movie did--too much exposition of not enough plot.  Whereas &quot;Unbreakable&quot; would have made a great 30-minute Twilight Zone episode, stretching it to fill an hour and a half was a bad idea.  Same with SFTD.  The big mystery isn't all that mysterious, and there aren't that many possible resolutions, yet it drags on for hundreds of pages longer than it should have.<br />If you want more of the Ender Saga, skip the SFTD/Xenocide/Children of the Mind branch for now, and go with the much more Ender's-Game-like &quot;Shadow&quot; branch.  THEN come back and pick up the other, and you'll be more satisfied with it.

These are real people in real time; Duke cheering Gonsalves to keep holding the long note near the end; the argument with the manager to &quot;just let me tell them goodnight&quot; that leads to another set of music; Woodyard's adrenaline draining solo that subdues the crowd -all are priceless. You are swept up in the momentum and drive of the band. This is emotional stuff for them and us. How the stereo re-mix was created is a wonder unto itself.

By all means then, buy this CD. You will not be let down by it.<BR>-CDK
B00005221M|5.0|Michael Mann was primarily a television director who revolutionized the police series with exciting music, impressive visuals and fascinating stories.  Of course, the name of that series was &quot;Miami Vice.&quot;  His foray into the world of motion pictures is one of the most exciting motion pictures of all time.  Again, he employs exciting music, impressive visuals and intense performances, this time on an American classic.  I was especially impressed with his ability to capture what it must have felt like in the forests of early America.  Starting from slow beginnings, he builds the film with ever increasing intensity into a total assault on your emotions and your nerves.  When I saw it in the theatre, the audience did not move as the credits appeared.  We had to sit there and recover before we walked back into the outdoors.  Mr. Mann has gone on to make other fine films, but this is his masterpiece.  Hollywood must have hated him for having come from television and created such an incredible experience, because the film deserved the Oscar for Best Picture.

0446678430|5.0|I feel as if this book has been given a lot of unfair reviews...<br />It seems to me that many people that read Robert's books feel like they should simply be answers on how to get rich.  We don't want to hear about how to think, we want to learn how to take our $25K income or whatever and turn that into millions.  Of course, as Robert has mentioned in his books, the answer isn't the same for every one of us.<br />The point of this book, as well as the other four in his series are to introduce to us new ideas about our own financial goals, and then allow us to decide which route we will take to reach whatever our goal is.  This book, while repeating some of the same lessons learned in the other books, further explains a lot of the concepts that we have been shown.<br />The bottom line is, if you want a book that for ($$$) tells you exactly how to make millions, this is not it.  If you want a book that will help you to grasp the concepts required to start yourself on a path towards becoming rich, this is definitely it.
0425098532|4.0|The outcome of the whodunit pales next to the very well drawn characters although it's best to remember that everyone Poirot interviews is, in their own way, lying to him. Christie writes nicely during the court room sequences and the story moves briskly, but Poirot is almost an after thought here. He's not in a great chunk of the plot. Admire for the people dotting the landscape. Agatha has had much better resolutions in her long career. I was hoping for a much different ending.
006092988X|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the coming of age story of Francie Nolan, an Irish-American girl growing up in the early 1900s.  This book gives the reader a look into the daily lives and struggles of Francie's traditional, if not sterotypical, early Irish-American family.  Poverty, alcoholism, and struggling to survive in a harsh urban environment are major themes in this book.  Betty Smith's well-structured and detailed narrative helps the reader to experience the day-to-day hardships, emotions, and triumphs of the Nolan family, and is peppered with interesting details about life in early 20th century Brooklyn.  Although the Nolans are poor and struggling, their intelligence and humanity never fails to shine through.
B00006FXB6|4.0|This is a terrific record, due in no small part, one suspects, to the talents Homme and fellow Kyuss expat Nick Oliveri had on hand.  The other Queens on this album are former Screaming Trees singer Mark Lanegan (Homme spent some post-Kyuss time playing with the Trees) and Foo Fighter Dave Grohl. This album is a marked step forward from 2000's Rated R.  It's more fully formed - stylistically, it runs the gamut from metal to pop, from prog to glam, but starts like a runaway train with the shredding &quot;You think i ain't worth a dollar, but i feel like a millionaire&quot;, the walls of shearing guitar making Rated R look paper thin.  It sets the scene for most of the album; it's Queens with extra beef, and lush vocals from Homme, Lanegan and Grohl.  Standout tracks are the anthemic &quot;First it Giveth&quot;, the glam rock stomper &quot;Do it again&quot; and &quot;The sky is fallin'&quot;    Homme takes the lead on most tracks, but Lanegan is unmistakable on the Trees sounding &quot;Hangin' Tree&quot; and the boogie crawl of &quot;God is in the Radio&quot;, and that may just be Grohl singing the poppy &quot;Another Love Song&quot;.  Song of the Deaf is a loud and clear winner.
B00003CXI1|4.0|J.K. Rowling knows how to spin a scene from the pages of a book right into your imagination, without you lifting a finger. In the same way, the movie takes you into a delightful version of Harry's world.    The adult actors are quite good - all known to be solid performers. Alan Rickman as Snape is perfect, as is Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid. The kids are noticeably new to this (they improve with each successive movie), but fortunately, the roles aren't all that demanding.  The kids play kids.  The three leads playing Harry, Hermione, and Ron are warm and appealing.    What limits the movie isn't the bringing a fantasy world to life (the special effects are marvelous), but adhering so closely to a literal interpretation bypasses all those subtle hints of things to come that Rowling slips into all her books. So Malfoy is *only* a bully and Hermione is *only* a brain - there is little texture to their characters.    I like the fact that the actors are all British. It makes it feel more authentic and less forced. That being said, it's another thing to look at the scenery. The London scenes and the interiors of Hogwarts looked wonderful. The Quidditch scenes themselves were fine, but the backdrop - ugh! It's too bold, flat, and not realistic enough. Instead of creating it all digitally, as it appears, they should have just shot a real location and put it into the scene.    So, all in all, it's a good movie that can be rewatched when you're in the mood for something charming and adventurous.
0743201140|5.0|This book quite simply can change your life.  Since I took the StrengthsFinder test, I have dramatically increased my effectiveness in my current job.<br />Donald Clifton has spent twenty years monitoring and discovering patterns of strength in the best of the best.  This testing and research shows in the accuracy and precision of this test.  <br />Whether you have achiever, context, futuristic, emphathy, restorative, or whatever, this book and test is going to dramatically change the way you look at the world. I currently work in the field of Leadership Identification and Development and this test time and time again shows students and young adults ages 18-30, a new way to approach life.<br />If there is a weakness in this book, it is that is does not go deeper. Clifton does a great job showing how he and others developed this process over years and years of study. Personally I want to be compared against the best, and this is what the book and test do. Have you ever wondered why you always size yourself up against everyone else and if you knew you could not win you did not even play? --Competition. <br />The beauty of this book is that your personal combination of strengths can put you as unique as 1 in millions, and the chances of meeting someone that is your exact double is next to impossible. How great is it that we are all so unique? Does not lend much credence to the theory that we are all here by some cosmic accident. <br />Our society, educational systems, businesses, and so many other institutions always try to build us up where we are weak. I worked at a company in Washington, DC and was utilized as an office manager and executive assistant, a job I was clearly not wired to do. With the the themes of competition, achiever, activator and significance, how could I ever handle ordering pens and pencils and organizing a contact database? I could not! I want to change the world, and now I know why-- I was wired to do it. <br />Do you know instantly how peopleare feeling when you walk in a room? I cannot, and I know my emphathy is low or non-existent. My dreams of becoming a counselor were misguided at best. This book, and the test will help you find out how you are wired and what a perfect job for you would be.<br />Can you wake up and say, I am doing what I was created to do and enjoying it? If not, I suggest you read this book and meditate over the information you receive back from it. Thanks to Donald Clifton for an excellent and cutting edge work.
B000002KKS|4.0|This album definately put Sabbath back on the right track. When I first heard about it, I had no idea who Ronnie James Dio was, but when I previewed this on a website, I was stunned! I was even more impressed when I bought it. \\"Neon Knights,\\" my favorite track on the album, gets it off to a roaring start. \\"Children of The Sea\\" begins is a slow-paced ballad before exploding into an array of heavy metal. \\"Lady Evil\\" is a mid-paced rocker with a catchy beat to it, and \\"Wishing Well\\" is a quite similar. The title track has one of the heaviest guitar riffs Iommi ever did, and \\"Walk Away\\" is a good melodic rocker to close the album. If you Sabbath fans think that this band died after Ozzy left, think again. This album is definately worth the buy.

AT some pints in the novel you may feel as though she is consoling some of her deepest, most inner feelings with you. The Bell Jar is a great novel with an amazing turn out<BR> The Bell Jar is a very cynical book. I appeals to many young women because of the problems the characters,mostly women, face. It's a book dealing with loss, depression, success, madness, and happiness. It is a great book and I recommend it to women, particularly young women. If you have read and enjoyed Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger I think you will enjoy The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath
0316666343|5.0|I didn't write this book so I don't know the author's true intensions, but I think this book is missunderstood.  When I read it and finished, I got the impression that it was about the grief process for the living and dead.  A refreshing new point of view, not nessacarily a \\"belief\\" on how the after life truley is.  The book is haunting and makes you think of any love ones you might have lost.  Then there's warmth and hope.  It made death feel not as final and tragic.  I love how Susie lives vicariously through her sisters life.  Helping her deal with being an ever-child with such wisdom.  The charectors were so well rounded.  There were points when you even began to understand the killer.  I would love to see this book be interepted into a screen play.  It would be interesting to see how they would put it together.  This book is comforting like a warm blanket made for you by a grandparent.  Alice Sebold's words are like poetry or art \\"painted\\" with vivid words.  I'd love to see what comes next from her.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's second album is a big step forward from their first album.  I bought their first album about a year ago and I liked it alot, but I couldn't really get into it.  I usually did not listen to that album all the way through because not every song would capture my attention and not let go.  This album does that.  It sucks you in from the opening drum beat of \\"Politik\\" and doesn't let go until the last words of \\"Amsterdam\\" fade away.  This album is different from \\"Parachutes\\" in that it has less of a rock'n'roll feel with more piano and acoustic guitars rather than electric guitars.  The songs are similar but they are played in a different way using different instruments.  The songwriting has gotten alot better.  The lyrics are very straightforward and not very abstract.  Chris Martin's delivery is passionate and evokes feeling and emotion from the listener.  I found that alot of the songs lyrics I could relate to very much, especially with relationships with women.  And, of course, all of the songs reminded me of my present girlfriend.  This is very good because the album will become a part of you if this happens (it probably will).  You can listen to the album all way through without skipping a song.  Every song is good.  The only weak song is \\"A Whisper\\", but it is still very good.  The standout tracks are \\"In my place,\\" \\"God put a smile on your face,\\" \\"clocks,\\" \\"daylight,\\" \\"green eyes,\\" and \\"warning sign.\\"  You see there are so many.  So, do yourself a favor and buy an album that is from a band that was not manufactured by a record company like so many others.  Buy an album that has artisctic creativity dripping off of it.  Just buy this album.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I love this CD, you don't have enough stars to give it the rating it deserves.
B000069AUI|4.0|The britpop world is all abuzz over the sophomore (but not sophmoric) release from the seminal (and sentimental), Coldplay. With Doves missing the mark at creating a follow-up on par with their debut, a certain degree of anxiety must be admitted to as I first lifted the wrapper from A Rush Of Blood To The Head. That anxiety has now been replaced by addiction, with a complete lack of control of once again dropping the disc on the tray and allowing it to play yet another time.<br />The disc begins with Politik. Any superstar needs a soapbox, and seeing how Coldplay now are, they are now 'really concerned' about making international trade more fair. Apparently this song is about that, but regardless to whether this is something you frequently lose sleep over, the song is outstanding. An incessant pounding of guitars and percussion gives way to Chris Martin's lilting vocals only to take over them again. The effect is new to a Coldplay album. The experiment works and the song is welcome. What follows is probably the finest song Coldplay have recorded in their short career, introductory single In My Place. It is the song the band started writing the record around and therefore most responsible for the rest of the material being so strong.<br />Without going over each song individually (because I would bore you and you would stop reading) the cliched truth is, there isn't a song you'll chronically skip on this record. All eleven tracks seemlessly lead you to the next until the cd is over and you find yourself pressing play again without replacing the disc with one you haven't just listened to.<br />There are highlights, though you might differ in opinion as to which tracks they are. Since this is my review, I'll tell you Clocks is a likely single. It features atmospheric effects on a piano line as catchy as the one that accompanies Trouble off of Parachutes but it is slighty uptempo. On Warning Sign Martin croons 'I miss you' earnestly enough to make a steadfast man weep and Amsterdam closes the disc with only Martin and his piano. The track underscores ROBTTH's strengths, few frills, lush melodies and honesty.<br />Even if each song is credited equally to all four Coldplay members, RBTTH sounds like the work of a single singer-songwriter, obviously being Martin. This quality gives the album that crossover potential that most britpop records never have. As wonderful as Parachutes is, it is surpassed here and the record erases any doubt about the groups staying power. Coldplay are in the majors now. They are in the same place U2 was after the release of Unforgetable Fire. Which is to say, they are one record away from being among the most important bands in the world.<br />For now, lets just enjoy the music...and Amsterdam closes the disc with only Martin and his piano.

B000069HKH|5.0|This is the best music CD I have ever heard and the best of Bruce given the already timeless classisc like Born in the USA or Tunnel of Love.    May be we all like this CD more because of what it is written out of.   The lyrics on this CD are truly brilliant.  How could Bruce picture it so perfectly and make you feel every emotion?   This CD has definitely made me come to better terms with Sep 11th.  Until now many of us were truly grieving.  Now we can grieve but still smile, laugh, and dance.  If their was a Nobel Prize for rock lyrics this is the first one.  <br />Combine that with the perfect band in the world and you have a masterpiece that will last for decades, may be centuries given the digital media.   This is an album that like Mozart or Monet people will admire and cherish 200 years from today.  Of course,  I will for the rest of my life.<br />Every word, every note of the guitar,  the saxaphone, is truly well thought and composed with Bruce's perfection.  Put on your headphones (most big stereos are not able to reproduce the notes), turn off the lights, and listen to the background saxaphone in the &quot;Nothing Man&quot; or the guitar in the &quot;Paradise&quot;.  And of course's Bruce's harmonica in the &quot;Empty Sky&quot; and you will know what I mean.<br />Bruce,  you are truly a hero, a guiding light to so many of those families who lost their loved ones, and to those who did not lose a loved one but grieved with those who did.   I cannot wait to see your concert when you come to town in Dec provided I get the tickets!
B00003CXCK|5.0|Along with Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare in Love, and Braveheart, Schindler's List was one of the only movies I thoroughly enjoyed in the 90's. In fact I would wager that it is the best and most substantive American movie released during the 90's. To say anything else about this visceral testament to the Holocaust is cliche. <BR>     Let me put it to you this way- Spielberg's mother was being interviewed about raising him and her experiences with his films. She was talking about this movie and what she felt was the most emotional scene for her. As soon as she mentioned the shower scene involving the newly deported Schindler workers, she cried so hard that the interview had to stop for a few seconds before she could regain herself. And that's not even seeing it....
B000069AUI|5.0|Wow! If anyone has ever listened to the first album by Coldplay(Parachutes), and you probably have, you will understand why it was named, by a few sources, as the best album of the year. Well, you wll be glad to know that they have done it again! <br />If you remember, &quot;Parachutes&quot; had a slightly depressed or slower feel to some of the songs, which seemed to fuel the album. In &quot;Blood&quot;, they have created the same magic, with a bit of a lighter feeling to the songs.<br />Seeing as the album came out in stores the day before my first day of school, I have had little time to listen to the whole album. I have listened to the whole thing all the way through twice. After the first time I listened to it, I often went back to some of the songs I remember listening to and that made a real impression on me. After the second listen, though, I realized that every song was amazing! I now just listen to as much of the whole album as I can at one time.<br />Here is my short rundown of each song on the album:<br />-Politik: This is a great song. The first 2 minutes and 52 seconds are, at first listen a little more chunky than I expected, but after that, It goes to a stunningly beautiful section of the song, which end it.<BR>-In My Place: This is the first song I heard off the album. Starting out with a rocky sound, It quickly goes into that smooth guitar often expected from Coldplay, and then into a slightly acoustic, slightly rocky melody. Also a very good song.<BR>-God Put A Smile Upon Your Face: This song, while still up to the high colplay standards, is not my absolute favorite song on the album. It starts off with a simple acoustic strumming, quickly going to a strange-feeling, but never the less catchy rhythm. Be careful, though. The Drum intro is a little startling the first time you hear it.<BR>-The Scientist: I like this song a lot. It is very slow and very acoustic. With a very romantic sound, it is a very beautiful song. (A word to the wise, it does have a little bit of that saddened Coldplay feel, but is still great).<BR>-Clocks: A very nice song. It starts off with, and continues with a very smooth and fast moving piano melody, slightly reminiscent of skating across ice. When the drums come in and when the piano eventually stops, the same skating feel is still kept in the song by the smooth flow of the song.<BR>-Daylight: This is a very different sounding song. It uses some very unusual and very creative eastern string sounds in the beginning, then moves to a quick-tempo, upbeat rocky sound. The two styles together are very interesting. A good, creative song.<BR>-Green Eyes: A very classic, simple sounding song. It starts out with a simple acoustic guitar background and a nice melody and, eventually, introduces the drums and a feel much like an old classic rock song.<BR>-Warning Signs: Another simple, classic song for the first bit, then it breaks into a romantic melody and carries that through the song, alternating between the two sounds.<BR>-A Whisper: This is probably my favorite song on the album. It is a little bit rock, and a little bit acoustic, and is very Coldplay. It moves very smoothly through the song and, quite simply, just sounds good!<BR>-A Rush of Blood to the Head: My first impression of this song: great lyrics. It really does have well thought, meaningful lyrics, not to mention being a very good song, like all others on the album.<BR>-Amsterdam: &quot;Another incredible acoustic piece&quot; could very well describe the first four minutes of this piano and vocal song. Like many Coldplay songs, it does wait a while to bring in the drums, bass, etc., but while they are not in the song, there does not seem to be anything missing.<br />Overall, this is a plainly amazing album. If you liked Parachutes, buy this, without hesitation. If you had never actually heard them, just heard a buzz, I sincerely recommend that you go to check it out right now. And if you needed just a little more convincing before you bought this album, I hope that my review made you take that enormous step and spend all of a child's weekly allowance.

0140149295|5.0|I read this book after seeing the movie the Hurricane.  I was thought that this would be a more in-depth telling of the movie; boy was I in for a pleasant surprise.  I could not put this book down, each time I picked it up I was drawn into the struggle that Rubin Carter faced in his life.  As a man in America, this book touched me on many levels; I could feel the pain and Rubin struggled against odds that were always against him.  <br />But more important is the message that is held deep in the pages of this book.  One should never give up on what you believe to be right, and that life is full of obstacles.  You have a choice, either let those obstacles destroy you or find a way to get past them.<br />Read this book now!

6305878323|5.0|I bought this dvd as a goofy gift for my husband since he loved this movie as a kid.  It has now become a Sunday night tradition at our house to watch it with our 3 and 2 year old sons.  My oldest loves the singing and my 2 year old loves to dance along.  And no scary scenes to fast forward through.  We do skip all the bank scenes as the kids don't get the jokes.  All in all a great film.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Before the Academy Awards a couple of years ago, I had only seen one of the several movies nominated for best picture of the year award: the movie \\"American Beauty\\". I vowed after the awards to see some of the other movies included in various categories.The first movie I picked up for my new DVD player was the film, \\"The Insider\\". Russell Crowe, with whom I first became acquainted in \\"L.A. Confidential\\", is positively Deniro like in his depiction of the major protagonist. Crowe's performance was much meatier than the Best actor performance of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. The film itself was also far superior to \\"American Beauty\\". Michael Mann delivers here as he did in the movie \\"Manhunter\\" where we first meet the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lector. Why this crew didn't receive its \\"props\\" from the established motion picture industry I'll never understand (tongue in cheek). Of course we know that the answer really is that \\"Hollywood\\" like the tabacco industry is quite happy to avoid controversy when it serves big business'interests.  <BR>\\"The Insider\\" is a great motion picture with riveting performances by all of the actors. This movie is a must for your permanent collection.
B000063UR2|4.0|This is a beautiful fantasy film.  I remember when I first saw this movie and it really did take me to another place for a couple of hours.  The sets and costumes are wonderful and a young Tom Cruise is just as appealing then as he is now.   Tim Curry is brilliant as the evil horned demon and quite appealing to boot!  Obviously if you like 'show's' like Dragon Ball Z, this movie might be a bit complicated for you, but for everyone else it is a valuable DVD for you collection.  The extras are fantastic!
B00006FXB6|5.0|With all this American Idol stuff going on, it's refreshing to see there is actually a band putting out great music that means something. No Homie The Clown lookalikes, no skanks with blond streaks in their hair wailing at the top of their lungs, just rock and roll the way God intended. What a concept, that 99% of the music industry has been ignoring for the last 8 years. It may sound cliche, but these guys fit in with the greats of the rock and roll era. Starting out in the ground breaking Kyuss, Nick and Josh have been kicking serious booty for years. If you didn't know Kyuss started a whole genre of imitation bands, who have been on the \\"stoner rock\\" bandwagon since the Kyuss masterpiece \\"Blues For The Red Sun\\". Chris Goss from Masters Of Reality fame(another great band, check out Blue Garden) has quietly been in the background since then, helping Nick and Josh evolve into the much more diverse and multi- dimensional Queens Of The Mother... Stone Age. The first album was a refreshing slab of rock and roll decadence that arrived towards the end of the 90's. Sparse production and great songs caused a huge word-of-mouth status on the band, which brought them to their major label debut. Rated R was a great leap forward soundwise, and it firmly set them up in the UK and most of Europe. America of course, was still trying to rock out to the horse poo rap-rock that everyone thoroughly despises now. Now comes their greatest opus, \\"Songs For The Deaf\\". This album is going to be HUGE. They had no limitations on this CD. They give you what you want, and things that challenge you on many different levels. These songs seep into your mind and will not leave. You'll be humming \\"No One Knows\\" for at least a month. \\"Millionaire\\" rips your head clean off, and the great Mark Lannegan sings songs that make you feel like it's the last song you'll hear before you go into the next world. Of course, a lot has been said about Dave Grohl playing on this album, and to his credit, he delivers his absolute best performance. Even the cynics have to admit that Dave's the man. Finally, when you buy this incredible CD(and bonus DVD if you hurry) you'll have a work of art that would fit in with other ground breaking CDs of the rock and roll era.

B000068CNX|1.0|Its a sad state of affairs when a show like this becomes a phenom.  What does it tell you about the taste of a large number of Americans?  This is one of the most wretched shows to ever have been aired.  I've really tried to get into this show but just can't stand to watch it for even 5 minutes.  I don't know anybody as stupid and annoying as the characters of Friends and don't think I want to.  While I'm sure the DVD quality is top-notch I would consider extensive dental surgery more appealing than this so called hit.
B000067CPX|5.0|Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from I did not really like any Chili Pepper disc until Californication. This one surpasses Californication and by a stretch. I've listened to the CD maybe 25 time or so and it just keeps getting the rotation in my CD player. The 1st 5 songs are really good and when you hit Zephyr on track 6 that is the best song on the CD. There is some filler on the back end but hey there is 16 songs on this CD and I think 12 or 13 of them are really good. If you liked Californication you will love this CD if not then maybe not
0316666343|5.0|I usually don't read other people's reviews before writing my own, but I was curious as to other people's reaction and interpretation to \\"The Lovely Bones\\".  Most people seem to focus on the novel being the story of Suzie Salmon's afterlife in her personal heaven.  I saw that as a subplot mainly designed to allow fourteen year old Suzie to serve as the narrator of events before, during, and especially after her rape and murder.  To me, the book was not about Suzie's life after death but rather the life of her family, her friends, and even her killer after Suzie's death, and how those lives were changed by Suzie's death.<br />By using Suzie as the narrator, the novel does provide an amazingly unique point of view.  Author Alice Sebold provides an extremely original vision of the afterlife and different insights into how the people \\"left behind\\" deal with tragedy and grief.  Suzie is a very memorable and well-drawn character who is surrounded by characters that are equal to her in their literary worth.  All in all, this is a well-written novel.  If there is a misstep, it is in the shoddy police work that allows Suzie's killer to escape arrest, but then, this isn't a detective story.  \\"The Lonely Bones\\" may not be for everyone, but then what novel is.  However, it clearly has broad appeal by telling its story and providing it's message, that life is both for living and for the living.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath, tells the story of the pain and rebirth of a young girl.  We learn so much about her and her perspective of life.  Although she's not trying to persuade you into believing her beliefs, she is trying to make your perspective on the real world open up.  After reading this book, I am now opened up and enlightened.  This book has brought me to ponder all aspects of life.  It is truly a rush. Take my advice when I say, read this book!
B000069HKH|4.0|Bruce Springsteen's \\"The Rising\\" is a very good album.  It is not nearly as good as some of the rest of his work, but is still a very worthy listen.  <br />Let me just get over my complaints in the first portion of my review.  I respect good musicians experimenting with ethnic music.  On \\"The Rising,\\" Springsteen tampers with Middle-Eastern music without much success.  He seems fairly uncomfortable working with it, and he should.  He is definately not the guy to be doing this!  Just skip through the few tracks incorporating ethnic music, and you've got a great album.<br />A fair amount of the album's songs are about the events of September 11th.  Springsteen handles this flawlessly.  These songs aren't about revenge or just being (upset).  They are about how our nation and the people in our nation were effected by the tragedy.  Judging by Bruce's songwriting and delivery, it seems like he experienced the event.  He speaks for the people, not about the people.<br />Some of the cuts have nothing to do with Sep. 11th, and seem completely out of place during the first listen.  Take the very upbeat \\"Waitin' On A Sunny Day\\" for example.  After a couple times through, the album flows beautifully.  If \\"The Rising\\" consisted only of somber songs documenting Sep. 11th, it would not have the strength that it does.  It would just seem obsessive and repetative, two traits that Springsteen are not known for.  He is smart enough to keep a balance, while your average amateur would record a depressing album ideal for a funeral.  <br />While \\"The Rising\\" does not compare to \\"Born To Run\\" \\"Born In The USA\\" or \\"Nebraska\\" it is still worth listening to.  For his most risky and ambitious work to date, he has done a damn good job.
B000069HKH|4.0|I can't understand the people writing reviews of this record, downgrading it because it isn't Darkness or Nebraska etc.  I am a dedicated Bruce fan and the emotional value of this record scores high marks with me.  I can go from happiness and hope, to playful romance and despair, moving between all of these emotions as the album plays.  No the tracks aren't terribly complex but do they have to be?  The lyrics are straightforward and the messages clear.  I admire Bruce for staying committed to his style and giving us music that comes from his heart.  It isn't possible to recreate the early classic Bruce.  While I still listen to all of the great, older stuff and still will often prefer it, I appreciate and like this album.  What's not to like?  Sing along, reflect, be inspired!  Enjoy it!  I needed it and with all of the &quot;artists&quot; preaching hate and just rehashing other peoples music, I am thankful that we still have people like the Boss.  This record is what it is, and it is definitely in my CD rotation for a long time to come.
B000069HKH|5.0|In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Bruce says thay before he made this album, he was driving down the street in this hometown in New Jersey and someone yelled out the window, \\"We need you.\\" <br />How true.  For who else in rock music has the ability to make a record that deals with the tragedy of September 11 without making everyone groan?  U2 might have -- they have done well with weighty material in the past and their tribute at the Super Bowl was touching, but they are at least disadvantadged if not disqualified because they are Irish, not American.  Their best perspective is an outsider's.  Bob Dylan might have 20 or 30 years ago, but while he's still making good music, he's not the voice of the people he once was.  That title falls to Springsteen -- and to him alone.  And happily, he has risen to the challenge.  <br />The sound of this album is the characteristic sound of the E Street Band, and that's an appropriate sound -- it is as American as rock n roll gets.  The songs, are big, anthemic selections (Into the Fire, The Rising, Empty Sky) interspersed with slower songs reminiscent of Springsteen's solo albums (Paradise, Nothing Man) it is a full, well-balanced album that is good from beginning to end.  <BR>I applaud Springsteen for his wisdom as he wrote this album.  While he works to deal with the incredible loss, he avoids the anger and desire for revenge that we all felt after Sept. 11, seeiming to know that such things only lead to more destruction -- even of ourselves.  There are only a few muted reference to desire for revenge, almost like admitting that feeling is there.   He avoids trying to explain what has happened or why, again seeming to know that explanations do not ease the pain.  And he calls us out of mourning and into life again -- the main theme of the album is, as the title suggests, rising -- perseverance, getting back up, moving forward.  Much as our President advised us after the event, Springsteen's message is to rise up, to keep moving, the show the evil men that have done this that they have not won by continuing to live our lives, and love each other.  Like the firefighters who kept working as the world collapsed around them, our best virtue as Americans is our endurance, our ability to keep going and let adversity make us stronger and better.  Springsteen voices this with skill and beauty.   <br />The album kicks off with words I find in my prayers often:<BR>Once I thought I knew<BR>Everything I needed to <BR>know about you<BR>Your sweet whisper,<BR>your tender touch<BR>But I didn't really <BR>know that much<BR> <BR>It's a song about getting through, about surviving the bad days, knowing good ones will come.  \\"This too shall pass...a little vengeance and this too shall pass.\\"  <br />The second song is a tribute to the firefighters and paramedics who dove into the places everyone else was running away from - <BR>I need your kiss<BR>but love and duty called you someplace higher<BR>up the stairs, into the fire<br />and the chorus is a prayer of sorts:<BR>May your strength give us strength<BR>may your hope give us hope<BR>may your love give us love<BR>may your faith give us faith.<br />Probably the most daring and interesting song on the album is Worlds Apart, which beautifully and hauntingly incorporates qawwali wailing (think Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn) and speaks of a love that crosses cultural barriers -- literally loving your enemies.  My only complaint with Springsteen's writing is here, as he writes<BR>Sometimes the truth ain't enough<BR>Or it's too much in times like this<BR>Let's throw the truth away, we'll find it in this kiss.<br />The truth, no matter how tough it is, will set us free.  But the subject of the song is intense -- loving an enemy goes far beyond tolerating and not striking out against one -- and so Bruce's buckle under the weight of it is understandable.  Not commendable but understandable.  <br />My favorite song on the album is Paradise, a quiet and somewhat hauntingventure into the mind of a victim, facing the last moments of his life in the smoke and disaster.  It is beautiful and sad and in my opinion the best tribute that could be offered to those who died.  <br />This is a truly great album and I am thankful that Bruce Springsteen was around to make it.
B0000636UN|1.0|Well, I know a LOT of you have been waiting for my review of this one, so here goes:<br />cheryl, cheryl, cheryl....tisk tisk...This is pretty bad, and I'm a fan from waaay back.  It jussounds liek she's tired and maybe didnt have any ideas and didnt really want to record an lp, but was forced too.  The melodies are weak and teh lyrics aren't there. they aren't anywhere, IMHO.  IMHO this sounds like it was done by some woman who was a really big cheryl fan and decided to do an lp in her style, but couldn't.  Once again, don't all get mad at me. That's just my IMHO!<br />Now I know your all waiting for my Famous song by song review, but I'm just going to focus on a few.  I'm tired from my trip to Little Miami.<br />&quot;Steve MCQueen&quot; opens it and it completely rips off Steve Miller band.  Anyway, I'm sick of cheryl whinning about how she cant be loved cause shes famous and mizundastood (get it?) and picks teh wrong men.  Why not next a song about Clapton?<br />&quot;You're an Original&quot; yeah, well this song aint!<br />&quot;Hole in my pocket&quot; sounds like she just did a version of Alanis' Hand in My Pocket, a much better song IMHO.<br />&quot;Soak up the sun&quot; is beneath her. a play for pop radio.  Will be used for Sunny D commercials in 4 years.  and cheryl will cry her lonely heart out all the way to the bank.<br />&quot;Wether Channel&quot;  Why do the people here like this one?  It's just a copy of &quot;Ordinary Morning off of Cheryl Crow and a half a dozen other songs she alredy did before.<br />So ther it is.  FINALLY!  It's not that I'm mad at cheryl, its just I expected more from her first cd in four years and didnt get it.  oh well, maybe in 2006 she'll put out a better one.
0066620996|5.0|I will keep my comments short and simple. Pound for pound, this is the best business book I have ever read<BR>This book is essential for any business person who has significant say in any company. The &quot;lessons learned&quot; from this book will either save you years, stop a nasty decline or best of all help you grow.  It's a no holds barred look on what makes a company great.
B000002UAC|5.0|The first record album I ever owned was &quot;The Beatles Second Album.&quot;  The songs are ingrained in my mind, but, of course, the only way to listen to that particular album today (beyond actually owning both the record and a &quot;record player&quot;) is to but together an MP3 playlist or burn your own CD or make an audio cassette, because &quot;The Beatles Second Album&quot; was an American creation.  While most of those songs can be found on &quot;With the Beatles,&quot; the rest are scattered on a couple of other Beatles CDs, including &quot;Past Masters Volume 1.&quot;<br /><br />But I digress.  Almost as an ideological principle.<br /><br />&quot;With the Beatles&quot; has a nice black &amp; white formal portrait of the Fab Four as the cover art.  This album actually features more original Lennon/McCartney tunes than it does cover songs, but there is also George Harrison's first songwriting effort, &quot;Don't Bother Me,&quot; which is still my favorite early Harrison song.  The best songs by Lennon/McCartney are the first three tracks, with &quot;It Won't Be Long&quot; being one of my favorite songs to hear open the album.  The covers range from Chuck Berry's &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; and Smokey Robinson's &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; to Meredith Wilson's &quot;Till There Was You&quot; from &quot;The Music Man.&quot;  That last one has got to be the oddest cover the Beatles ever did (even more than &quot;Besame Mucho&quot;).  Note: &quot;Please Mister Postman&quot; is probably the song the Beatles sing that most surprises me it is not written by the Beatles.<br /><br />I probably listen to Early Beatles albums like &quot;With the Beatles&quot; and the soundtrack from &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; more than later Beatles.  I do not think this is because I think their early work represents their best songs, but simply because these are the ones that are most fun to sing to even if the later &quot;serious&quot; Beatles were the better musicians.
B00001ZU4D|4.0|i think its just as good as short bus was, but the thing is, i borrowed a copy of this album, it was bought in brazil, but has no extra tracks, but that alright, i remember waiting for this album to come out when i was in 9th grade, and loving the loud guitars on the leadoff single. i thought it was so cool, i didnt like all the &quot;newbies&quot; buying the album, cause they heard take  my picture on the radio, but oh well. i recommend borrowing it from somebody, or buying it in the bargain bin, cause it isnt essential stuff, but good stuff to listen to if you listen to nine inch nails or other stuff like that
B000069AUI|5.0|I have generally noticed that people that write reviews about a CD immediately after it is released are fans of that band. Subsequently, those that write immediate reviews often suffer from bias due to their fondness for the band. However, after listening to this album multiple times and even exposing several friends and co-workers to this album I can honestly say that this album kicks serious butt. With each listening I pick a new song that is my favorite. There are few albums that you can say that about. \\"Politik\\" reminds me of both the Beatles and Pink Floyd in a way. \\"Clocks\\" has beautiful piano work. I could go on and on, but enough has been said on this site. Believe me and all the others, this album is excellent and hopefully people will listen to this rather than the prepackaged crap that the radio stations play repetitively. You will not be sorry if you purchase this album.
B000069KE0|5.0|&quot;Chicago II&quot; is Chicago's masterpiece, and it is as vibrant today as when it was first released.  The horns are solid, the songs are dynamic, and the vocals are unbelievable.  Every song is so tight, so well constructed, that it is nearly an emotional experience listening to it.  Actually, it is.<br />&quot;Movin' In,&quot; with Terry Kath on vocals, is an upbeat proclamation of Chicago's intents on the album.  &quot;Poem For The People&quot; carries Robert Lamm's social messages from &quot;Transit Authority&quot; a bit further, and his vocals are extraordinary. &quot;The Road,&quot; and &quot;In The Country&quot; add to make &quot;side one&quot; memorable.  &quot;Wake Up Sunshine&quot; is one of the best ballads Lamm ever came up with, and it is a great lead-in to James Pankow's &quot;Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon,&quot; which includes &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; and &quot;Colour My World.&quot;  What more can be said about this?  Kath at his vocal best, and just fantastic song-writing.<br />&quot;Fancy Colours&quot; and the classic &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; lead off the &quot;third side,&quot; both of which are Lamm compositions, showing him at his song-writing best.  Kath's guitar work on &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; is legendary and well deserved so.  The surprise is Kath's &quot;AM Mourning&quot; and &quot;PM Mourning,&quot; which lead into his soulful &quot;Memories of Love.&quot;  The strings and horns in these insturmentals are so finely designed that they can bring one close to tears.  Outstanding.<br />The album closes with the opus &quot;It Better End Soon,&quot; and Peter Cetera's first composition, &quot;Where Do We Go From Here.&quot;  &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; is Chicago at its finest.  Again, Kath on vocals, and tight horns, building up and punching the listener to and fro... it never got any better than this.  Cetera's song is a mite weak, but it is acceptable because it ties the fury of &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; into a hopeful prayer.<br />This album, in my opinion, stands up to the scrutiny of time just as the best Beatles' albums do.  The only down factor of listening to it is knowing what the original Chicago seven was capable of... and how sad it was that it all culminated into sappy pop ballads, and Bill Champlin.  Listen to &quot;Chicago II,&quot; and you're swept back into the magic of the best of the early 70s.
B000067DNC|2.0|I've eagerly awaited the second season and have spent any free time going over any episodes I've missed. I've noticed several places where the DVD skips or picture breaks up. I've tried on all systems in the house and it must be the DVDs themselves. I figured MGM would do better as long as we had to wait.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Buying the first three albums from Slayer is more a matter of either completing your collection or showing your age/savvy in finding them before they obliterated the scene with this 1986 masterwork.<br />You'll hear or read that \\"Master of Puppets\\" is the finest thrash album ever recorded.  No.  A fine effort by Metallica, a true high water mark in metal, but all I ask of anyone making the comparison is to do the following:  listen to the bridge of \\"Raining Blood\\".  If that isn't the most incredible, neck-snapping, pure and unadulterated distillation of metal in its highest form, then you are possibly from Hell itself.  That bridge is probably the single most powerful riff of the past 20 years of metal.  It is the perfect musical phrase to describe this genre.  It *is* Metal.<br />I get chills just thinking about it.  And that's a single bridge in a single song off this album.  \\"Angel of Death\\" opens in a way you could never do in any other band.  Tom Araya's scream establishes exactly what you're in for, and when Dave Lombardo is drilling the double-bass into your head, even the most dense listener will get it.<br />And here's the ultimate tribute: this album holds up in 2002 better than Metallica's last five albums.  And Slayer was just getting started with this album, way back in 1986.<br />If you don't own this, you're only hurting yourself.
B000002LVB|4.0|This album is a classic, but it falls into the clutches of the mainstream much more easily than the other studio albums.  The songs are radio friendly:  &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, etc., and no avant-garde quirks like there were in the other studio albums.  The song most reminiscent of the power of VU's earlier period might be &quot;New Age&quot;, but even that buckles under sentimentality.  However, if you do have any of the other three VU studio albums, then get this one now, because every man, woman, child, and goldfish needs all four.
B00006FXB6|5.0|if u liked rated r then u gotta buy this gem its a stunning album<BR> with a wide variety of tunes from start to finish there are no fillers,ive been listening to it a week now it just gets better and better from god is in the radio a killer track to millionaire its blistering go buy
B00005JLDW|3.0|This film had its strong points and weak points. I think the question on people who have seen this movie's minds is \\"what is the point of this movie?\\" The dragons were very real-looking but were not in enough of the scenes. I find it hard to believe that in 18 years from now, our world will be taken over by dragons. What about those plot holes? Where did that Van Zan guy and his crew fuel up? Matthew McConaughey's (The Wedding Planner) character needed some work. It wasn't his best performance. Izabella Scorupco's(Vertical Limit) character comes into the movie as a dragon-slaying helicopter pilot. Christian Bale's(American Psycho)character was sympathetic. He did a good job with the emotional scenes. Matthew McConaughney doesn't need to be so breathy when he speaks. All in all, I give thie movie 3-3.5 stars. Its action scenes are worth going to see the movie for but don't expect much more than that.
1573228737|5.0|A thriller set in Victorian England, I stayed up late into the night finishing this one. There were many twists & turns and the ending was a total surprise, the ending actually left me feeling outraged. I will read this again sometime soon to see what little details along the way I missed the first time. <br />The story is of a high-strung spinster who becomes a regular \\"visitor\\" to a women's prison where the conditions are wretched. She meets a woman inmate who was a practicing spiritualist before being imprisoned and is still apparently in touch with the world of spirits.<br />I have also read Sarah Waters' \\"Tipping the Velvet\\" and enjoyed that as well, another Victorian setting, but more \\"bawdy\\", a lesbian coming out story. \\"Affinity\\" is for anyone who enjoys occult thrillers, historical novels or the spiritualist period in Victorian England.
6304806426|5.0|In this story about borders and the differences between...we find combatants engaged in more immediate struggles, for the right to be regardless of boundaries. Count Almasy, one of the inadvertent architects of drawn lines on maps...finds himself seemingly on the wrong side of them as his whole world comes crashing down around him and the decisions he makes at this time would lead to devastating and violent events for people he holds in high regard...for people too he has never met, but will.<BR>This is an anti-war story as I have never seen one told. Forget 'Saving Private no-mates'...this is beautiful. This is surely the eulogy for the ordinary mortals: Those men and women called upon to be more than they knew...all who cared enough to 'Never give in', all who fought racial supremacy, tyranny and calculated malignancy, FROM ALL OVER OUR WORLD, would perhaps , might just, in their hearts appreciate of we...the succeeding generations. Truly really marvellously masterfully beautiful. A worthy monument indeed.
B000005DQR|5.0|A disc that started, and in my opinion, ended the Trip Hop genre.<br />Its done so well here that anyone else is just imitating.
B00006G8G1|2.0|The concert had potencial to be one of the best Maiden concert<BR>around but it was poorly edited. The main problem is the sound<BR>level that fluctuates all the time and the fact that they<BR>don't have a 2-channel stereo soundtrack. The image quality is<BR>good but it is poorly edited. We don't have a chance to see<BR>a single second of any of the band members. The image<BR>keeps changing from one to another every second. <BR>I'm disappointed.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is extremely talented and her debut, &quot;Let Go&quot; is outstanding. If you like punk rock, or just rock, then absolutely get this cd!  Avril wrote all of these songs herself and she is just fabulous. She is definitely worth listening to and will be around long, long after Britney Spears will.  Avril keeps it real, does not show off and is really cute. &quot;Let Go&quot; has excellent songs like &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;.  If you know good music, get &quot;Let Go&quot;!
B000062XE1|4.0|I got this as a mother's day present for my mother and she loves it. If you are an oscar wilde fan this is the collection to get. The bbc does a superb job beinging his characters and settings to life. They also stick very closely to the books unlike some other versions of his works. The dry wit and intriguing storylines which are so typical of Wilde pull the viewers into his world. A definite must for any bbc or Oscar Wilde fan!
B000069HKH|4.0|alot has been said about springsteen being the only artist who  could handle the topic of sept. 11th and people wouldn't be outraged. bruce has always written for and about the average man so to ignore this would be a difficult thing to do.  i believe he touches on most of the emotions felt because of that attack on our people- first ofcourse the great sense of loss, the  awe and gratitude for all of those who risked their lives to save others,loneliness, the empty skyline, the problems in our world, the need to rise up and live your life again,and in &quot;mary's place&quot;  the joy of living.everyone has a reason to go on and live their life and this cd reflects that.listening to bruce has always given me an enormous sense of strength and comfort, i hope this cd does the same for those who need it.
B000066I6N|5.0|Ah!!! This CD is just so fabulous!!! Mysterious and subtle, original and sooooo beautiful! I just love it! It seems I really recognise Robert Plant's personality in it, and he is very well backed up too!! And always this so deeply sensitive and incredibly delectable voice...! I've been a fan of Led Zep for 33 years now, and still listen to it with more and more passion. Now this album to me is close to the essence of who Robert Plant really is now, faithful to his roots, with all his magic.<br />The band is fantastic too! I love the atmosphere of it all...!<br />I wish I could pass him the message; a real thank you from the bottom of my heart! Now let's just wish he will think of visiting Montreal?... You lucky guys from the States and from England! sigh... Enjoy!<br />Indigo
B000002UV9|5.0|Queensryche are an awesome band.  I'm surprised I didn't get into them beforehand.  I've always heard of them and loved all of their singles, but I was hesistant to buy one of their albums.  That is, until my good friends Korey and Lord Chimp told me about the 'Ryche's 1990 album EMPIRE.  Both of them said that it was their favorite album by the band, and that was enough to get me to buy it.<br />This is a truly remarkable recording.  It's a very commercial album, but really there's nothing commercial about it.  The lyrics are intelligent, the musicianship is precise and on fire, and Geoff Tate is one of the best singers in rock.  His range is unmatched (only Bruce Dickinson and James LaBrie can compete with him) and he sings every note with passion and precision.  An amazing vocalist for sure.  Let's not forget the awesome melodic guitar duo of Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton as well as the solid progressive rhythm section of bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield.<br />Anyway, onto the songs!  There's not a bad track on here.  Every song is perfect, and even better than the one that preceded it.  &quot;Best I Can&quot; is a killer opener with inspiring lyrics, a catchy keyboard riff, and engaging energy.  &quot;Jet City Woman&quot; is a realistic love song with an incredible melody and emotional vocals.  &quot;Della Brown&quot; is an ambient 7-minute piece with hypnotic guitar melodies, jazzy bass and drum interplay, and a powerful message about fame and homelessness.  Speaking of messages, both the title track and &quot;Resistance&quot; discuss social issues and their effects on life.  &quot;Empire&quot; in particular is about the rising cocaine business and how the government spent more money on other things rather than helping the people.  Tate sings the lyrics with a lot of attitude and almost sounds disgusted with the government when he does.<br />&quot;Silent Lucidity&quot; is the band's biggest hit to date, as well as their most-known song.  It's still a great ballad after all these years.  The gentle acoustic riff, Tate's passionate vocals, and the dreamy subject matter are what making music is all about.<br />The highlight of the album for me is the brilliant closer &quot;Anybody Listening?&quot;  This song is the most haunting and slashing commentary on the record business ever written.  Not even Rush's &quot;Limelight&quot; can compare.  As a matter of fact, I think &quot;Anybody Listening?&quot; is better than &quot;Limelight&quot; because it's darker and it fits the lyrics perfectly.  &quot;Limelight&quot; was too upbeat to be a commentary on stardom, so Queensryche have answered my prayers with this song.  The constant shift between light acoustic touches and heavy crescendos show that what may look good on the outside has dark undertones on the inside.  I say again -- amazing!<br />This album is just too good.  I love every minute of it.  Although I haven't warmed up yet to &quot;One and Only,&quot; EMPIRE is a real keeper.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Finally, a hard rock 70s-influenced band whose main influence is NOT Black Sabbath (not that that's all that bad). Think Alice Cooper's \\"Halo of Flies\\" during the midsection of \\"No One Knows.\\" Think prime Jimmy Page during the guitar solos in \\"Song For The Dead.\\" Think prime Zep during \\"Mosquito Song.\\" And \\"Another Love Song\\" could be Buck Dharma singing a bonus track on Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Agents Of Fortune.\\" All cooked-up together in a non-blantant-rip-off, modernized way. No cookie-monster or rap vocals here - singers who actually sing! What a concept. This music grows on you. If you're lukewarm about it on first listen, try keeping it out of your CD player after 10. (Take the mad waltz of \\"Song For The Deaf\\" for example.) For rockers who prefer \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" to \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\" THE band of the 21st century.
B00005RRG9|5.0|The Mary Kate and Ashley have nothing on Haley Mills as Sharon and Susan. There have been remakes and sequels to this Disney classic but none can hold a candle to the original. Yes, Haley Mills plays both parts but even though this classic is decades old you would swear it was played by twin sisters. The camera and special effects are just that good. This is a must own movie for any family that likes to get together to watch good clean fun movies. The Parent Trap is sure to be a winner in any household.
1402521154|4.0|With each turn of the page, this book made me reflect on a lot of different issues: rape, grief, and religion. With every chapter, there is a new idea about the afterlife, new information into the mind of a serial rapist/killer, and new insight into how different members of a family handle the loss of a loved one. But the biggest issue that touched me was divine justice.
B000000132|5.0|Probably the best album Renaissance ever released. It contains such classics as 'Black Flame', 'Mother Russia'. 'Things I don't understand', 'Running hard'. These tracks are essential Renaissance. Good sound quality/packaging.
B00005JKWJ|3.0|I saw the first Blade when it was released in theaters and enjoyed it. Though perhaps it would be more apt to say that I bought into it. Being a vampire aficionado of a sort, I was willing to accept the idea of Blade and found a chuckle or two in the idea of vampires being able to walk in sunlight after a good dose of sunscreen was applied. What supported the first installment of Blade so wonderfully was the atmosphere. (That and perhaps Stephen Dorff who pulled off the smug vampire villain quite well.) Blade II, however, was missing that key ingredient as well as a couple of others.<br />The whole of Blade II is based on exaggerated violence. That's about it. The story plants a series of \\"mysteries\\": who's the traitor inside the Blood Pack?, being the primary. Unfortunately, it's not all that difficult to figure it out and once that falls into place so does the rest of the plot. It really shouldn't have been that predictable. The basic idea, a new mutation of vampire bent on wiping out the original strain, is not necessarily a bad one, but the unexplored  psychological motivations behind their attack reduces it to mediocre at best. And, really, the task force, known as the Blood Pack, that is formed in order to hunt and destroy the Reapers must be the most ineffectual group of vampires I have ever seen. With the exception of possibly two members-- where's the speed, the grace, the unparalleled strength? They show no signs of heightened senses whereas Blade, half mortal that he is, knows all and sees all.  And as I've said, the atmosphere in this installment is lacking. It doesn't seem as charged and energized. It isn't as sophisticated as the original and it isn't conducive to the violence that is presented--with, again, perhaps one exception. But even then it harkens back to the original Blade with its strong sense of the night club scene and the abandonment that the vampires find in their immortality.<br />The action sequences, the ones involving Snipes and somereally snazzy martial arts moves, were very good. The ones involving blood and turning vampires into ash and bone were pathetically overdone. It was a case of special effects overwhelming everything else. And the very amount of fake blood they used alone must have severely taxed the budget. They were going for gore, that much is obvious, but it seems much too foolish to be realistic.<br />Overall I thought that the original Blade was much better, much more interesting and fresh, but if you've seen the first one you should see the second one as well. There's enough action to keep one satisfied even if the storyline is lackluster.
B000003TA4|5.0|Never a dull moment with this cd!!!
B000067DNC|5.0|Stargate sg-1 season 2 is one of my favorites, now I'm counting down until season 3 is released.
B000068TPN|4.0|Most movies I've seen about the Vietnam War have been depressing. \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Hamburger Hill\\" come to mind, as they are there to remind us that Vietnam was a real shock to us back in the 60's and 70's. Yes, we remember we pulled out, lost if you want to say, but I don't go to a movie to get depressed. Randall Wallace's \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is not a depressing movie by any means, but shows that heroes were made in a war we look down on even today.<br />From the book \\"We Were Soldiers...And Young\\", the main character is Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a family man put in charge of, for the most part, green officers and men. The film also stars Sam Eliott, Chris Klein, Madeline Stowe, Keri Russell, and Berry Pepper. The majority of the movie takes place in Vietnam, where Moore and his 7th Cavalry fights 4000 NVA's while there are only 300 with Moore.<br />The battle scenes (which comprise the movie pretty much) are gory. Now, this isn't the goriest battle sequences you've ever seen, but it ranks number three in my book (\\"Black Hawk Down\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" taking the other two) for realistic wounds and such. The battle is hot and exciting, featuring infantry, air force, artillery, the whole deal. Some of the most frightening scenes come at night, when we see how close the NVA's really get to the lines. Wallace effectively knows when to change scenes at different places of the battle, and the changing it to back home with the soldiers' wives.<br />Gibson of course performs admirably here. He plays Moore to detail as not only a father of seven, but a father of three hundred. Sam Eliott was casted brilliantly as the gruff Sgt. Major, Barry Pepper as the journalist who would write the book along with Moore, Klein as an upcoming platoon leader that meets his demise, and Russell and Stowe clean up at home. Once again a great ensemble cast, and a great film. A little lengthy, but this film makes it worthwhile. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is a rather positive look on Vietnam,thankfully conveyed by Wallace and Gibson.<br />I knew that Wallace had written the flop \\"Pearl Harbor\\", but the last time that he and Gibson got together was \\"Braveheart\\", and we all know how successful that movie was. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is no different, with intense battles, emotion, and the reminder that heroes can just be ordinary people.
0316666343|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful, moving books I've read to date. Alice Sebold is an amazingly talented writer with a true gift. The story is not only gripping but it's laid out poetically. I highly recommend it!
B00006FXB6|5.0|I love this album... so i know you reading this do know me or what i like so this does little to help you decide if you want to buy it but trust me, you do, i know this. listen to the clips you will see.  anyone who isnt drownding themselves in nu-metal(wtf? anywho) and some of you (guys) :) that are are gonna realize the rock-beauty this album is dripping with. never mind dave grohl is the best freaking drummer in the world or that josh homme is a hottie...he is, i had to say it, doesnt detract from the music, i simply had to say it...plus if your lucky you get the free dvd, a must have for even pseudo-fans. you get to see the guys in the studio and live performances.
0671027344|5.0|I found this book to be poignant and at once both realistic and idealistic. Charlie was sophisticated and spot on in his insights into human nature. In many ways I identified with Charlie and he brought me back to my own awakenings into the adult world. He voices feelings that can't be put into words in the best words possible, somehow pulled from the depths of his experience. I never expected the root of Charlie's problems at the end, just as we never really realize the root to our own problems. Everyone should own a copy of this book!
B000002KDB|5.0|Emmylou's first major label debut, and what a fantastic way to start what has become a great career! *Pieces of the Sky* is an excellent blend of down-home country, folk, and rock. For the most part, the album is pretty off-beat, containing several mello country folk ballads and a few honkytonkers that pick up the pace in between. My favorite track is the shattering \\"Berfore Believing\\", which features a heavenly acoustic guitar hook and a serpentine melody.  Another favorite is Shell Silverstein's \\"Queen of the Silver Doller\\" and Harris' self-penned \\"Boulder To Birmingham\\".  Harris also takes her cracks at more up-beat stuff with Merle Haggard's roudy barroom classic \\"The Bottle Let Me Down\\" and the bouncy strut of \\"If I Could Only Win Your Love\\".  However, it's the wistful, pensive  ballads where her vocal beauty gleams the brightest.  Just take one listen to the romantic, sweeping sound of \\"Too Far Gone\\"! Emmylou Harris and her band keep these songs relatively simple and acoustic. Just a little electric guitar and snappy drums here and there to give the album a contemporary touch. Emmylou rarely writes her own material, but her pasionate vocal interpretations make the songs seem as if they're her own. Definitely worth the admission price! <br />Thank You
B00003CXI1|4.0|.<BR>Summary:<br />It was interesting, but not \\"stunning\\", \\"incredible\\" or \\"fantastic\\" like I expected.<br />Review:<br />A very good movie.  Kids enjoy this movie quite a bit.  I enjoyed the movie, but was not enamored with it.  I almost feel as if I am missing something because the J.K. Rowling books are unbridled smash hits by any measure. <br />The movie is well done, acting is good (for child actors), the script is well written and maintains good cohesion, and the story line is solid with a lot of good imagination, the music is interesting, etc., etc.  But, it isn't the incredible movie I expected.<br />DVD Value:<br />The DVD was ok.  It has an interesting self guided tour of Hogwarts Castle, but it sorely lacks the Director's Commentary and didn't really have much in the way of games and other extras for the kids. (which I believe is essential for a DVD). <br />Scare Factor:<br />It isn't scary, except for two scenes towards the end. These two scenes warrant concern for the young viewers (under 7 or 8); <br />Also, the beginning of the movie shows Harry Potter being abused by his \\"adopted parents\\" (his aunt and uncle who force him to sleep locked in a closet under their stairs) and I really didn't like my young kids seeing that. This should not be shown to very young or very sensitive viewers.
B0000039LE|5.0|This one is far the best of the Halloween series, it contains every single element that build a classic: good acting, good direction, good story, good special effects, and the sets are simply outstanding. The second film has a good story, but the other elements are gone including the suspense and the scares which turn the film in a silly and boring sequel. Halloween 3, 4, and 5 are just below average horror sequels and added nothing to the series at all. Halloween 6 is far, really far, the worst film not only of the series but probably of the cinema history. It's frustrating to admit, but this movie has nothing, absolutely nothing that makes worth seeing it. Three years after H6 comes H20, a good entry that, at least, retrieved some respect to the series.
B0000048YM|5.0|Barbra Streisand stars as Fanny Brice who goes from a poor but ambitious girl in the slums to famous Zigfeld star in the early 1900s.  Omar Sharif costars as Nicky Arnstein, a professional gambler who woos, marries, and leaves her.  The movie is all about Barbra; the screen is filled with close-ups of her unusual and beautiful face and her pitch-perfect voice. She is simply fabulous.<br /><br />The scenes of Zigfeld shows are cute and funny, and Streisand hams it up in grand style singing songs that have become classics.  She's extraordinarily talented and a joy to watch.  Sharif is a 10 on the hunk scale and the two make a beautiful couple, but he is miscast as the New Jersey-born con man.<br /><br />\\"Funny Girl\\" is truly an iconic movie that mesmerizes and delights, thanks to the wonderful Barbra Streisand.  Her glamorous costumes, hair styles, and make-up became world famous and she absolutely deserved her Best Actress Oscar.
B00006FXB6|5.0|The reason i pity the deaf is because they will never hear this truley wonderful album. From Nick's opening screams on You think i ain't worth a dollar, but i feel like a millionaire to the closing notes of Everybody's gonna be happy this album never fails to surprise and delight. Opening with .....Millionaire Nick sets the pace following with the very infectious No One Knows. Another Love song and Everybody's gonna be happy are 2 tracks that take a more retro taste to them, which sits in nicely with the Queens balls to the wall rock that is First you giveth. All in all a fantastic album that just gets better with every listen.... one that certainly won't leave my cd player for a long time!<br />PS. The limited edition DVD is well worth it too, having 6 live tracks which are all first rate quality.
6305537321|5.0|Here are 7 good reasons (in random order) to see &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot;:<br />1.  This memorable movie convincingly transports viewers into the jazzy, tacky, and hilarious beatnik era of the early 1960's.<br />2.  George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn have a tender, believable romantic chemistry, and they are both gorgeous to look at.<br />3.  Holly Golightly is one of Hepburn's finest roles.  In her performance, Audrey captures all of playgirl Holly Golightly's contradictions:  Holly is worldly, yet naive.  She projects the insouciance of a swinger, but underneath she longs for a home and family.  Holly appears indifferent to love, yet love is what redeems her.  Hepburn's performance is perceptive, sensitive, and captivating. She IS Holly Golightly.<br />4.  The achingly beautiful, melancholy Mancini/Mercer song &quot;Moon River&quot; and Mancini's lively score.<br />5.  Blake Edward's stylish direction.<br />6.  Audrey's elegant clothes.<br />7.  Last but not least, cat.<br />These reasons alone will warm your heart and make you forever glad that you saw &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot;.
B000065LZK|4.0|A must have for any fan of U2.  Early stuff smelling of punk and raw energy.  Breathes also of thier roots in the Christian faith.  They almost kicked Bono out of the band and in this CD you might see why.  But it has some great songs from when they were mere lads back in the homeland.

0316743003|5.0|Ben Rich started off as a bright new engineer at Lockheed Martin.  He never imagined that taking a job under the famously fearsome Kelly Johnson would lead to a career that took him to the top of the aerospace defense industry.  He has an interesting story to tell and does so with style.  We catch a glimpse into the inner-workings of the United States defense industry.  It's a spellbinding tale about legendary airplanes interlaced with amusing anecdotes.  Being an engineer in the defense industry myself, I heartily recommend this book to engineers and anybody else interested in technology.
B000002U82|5.0|\\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" - the title says it all, and needs no introduction. Hence, no title name appears on its opaque black, prism dominated cover. If one were to take a copy of this landmark LP (in any of its forms, be it vinyl, CD, 8-track, cassette, etc.) out in the street (presumably of a large urban area) and show it to a random sample of, say, 1,000 people, I'd be willing to bet a year's salary that at least 750 of those randomly sampled people (3 out of every 4, or 75%), if not more, at least know this album by name, yet countless others know \\"DSOTM\\" for its sticker-shock musical and lyrical value, and with good reason. From the introductory heart pulsations of \\"Speak To Me\\", all through the hard-heavy footsteps wading their way into \\"On The Run\\", going full-steam off the beaten path into the schizoid universe of twisted logical minds that is \\"Brain Damage\\", back to those hard-pumping heartbeat rhythms to \\"Eclipse\\" this highly-rated, intellectual head-trippy melange of artistic delights. There are lots of delectably tasty hidden treasures neatly tucked away in-between, so it's best to listen to \\"DSOTM\\" all the way through to achieve maximum musical pleasure. The credit for making \\"DSOTM\\" the brainchild it has evolved into over the course of the past 29 1/2 years of this legendary album's existence rightfully goes to Roger Waters, whose varied, texture-laden lyrics and guitar dramatics, including the able assistance of David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, (all of whom) really pushed the musical envelope one note further and higher, thus bringing this project to its artistic knees, as \\"DSOTM\\" uses just about every audio-technical device known to man in ANY dimension. If there is even the slightest downside to this unique work of art, it would be the \\"commercialized\\" sounds of the album's only Top 40 single, \\"Money\\" (although it is a brilliant \\"ka-chinger\\", with the cash register sound effects and all), which probes the \\"dog-eat-dog\\" society in which we are accustomed to living, which catapults Waters' observations, in that society as a whole is \\"one day closer to death\\", as probed in \\"Time\\". This awakening to the realization of death is cause for \\"alarm\\" (as noted in the timepiece sound arrangements carefully augmented with magnificent timing and precision in the CD's middle section), since striving for all the excesses of life is bound to make a majority of the populace insane (except me!), as documented in the closing \\"Brain Damage/Eclipse\\". With all the style and substance of musical ambience contained in \\"DSOTM\\", it's no wonder this album has sold some 30 million copies (and rising) worldwide, making Pink Floyd one of the all-time versital and innovative acts of progressive-rock, and perhaps rock history. Even though Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" LP may own the all-time record in terms of sales (in the neighborhood of 50 million units sold and counting), it will never, ever match \\"DSOTM\\"'s musical and artistic prowess, which is sensational (although \\"Thriller\\" works well as an outstanding pop album, nevertheless being somewhat dated). It's no wonder \\"Dark Side...\\" haunted the Billboard album charts for fourteen consecutive years, which makes it all the more a very fascinating and special body of work craftfully executed by one of the ambassadors of prog-rock: \\"The Floyd\\"! If the above statistical information still doesn't sway you to get off that sofa and make the all-important purchase of an infinite lifetime, well, all I can say is... \\"I'll see you on the 'Dark Side Of The Moon'\\"!e are accustomed to living, which catapults Waters' observations, in that society as a whole is \\"one day closer to death\\", as probed in \\"Time\\".

B00004SU5J|4.0|I've been looking into new forms of jazz for the past few years.  In particular, I wanted something that was both new and fun to listen to.  That's TOURIST.  Jazz that is breaking into new rhythmic textures and that translates well across most all music listeners.  St. Germain has almost too easily mixed live and sampled music to the point where it's hard to tell which is which.  Listen to the brushwork on Rose Rouge. It's not sampled.  You can hear the slight variations that don't repeat here and there.  That's just the drums.  Check out the bass playing it out with the drums.  Now THAT'S in the pocket.  It makes me want to buy a turntable &amp; set it up by my drums &amp; experiment.  That's inspiration for you.  Great album.  For another foray into DJ's and jazz check out DJ Spooky's album Optometry with Matthew Ship performing or Tim Hangan's Re-Animation.  I love and admire the old standard jazz, but this music makes me want to see where it can head towards into another genre.  Electro-Jazz is the new daring music.

0140277447|4.0|I only had a few problems with this book, so I'll touch on those problems rather briefly:<br />This book does seem to create alot of moral arguments, but I'll touch on the two that seem most significant to me; namely, the atomic bombings and the persistent Japanese denial/apology argument that seems somewhat pervasive.<br />Is the Rape of Nanking any worse than the bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Maybe.  Does Chang insinuate that the Rape of Nanking has precedence over the bombings?  Maybe.  Is that your decision to make?<br />Undeniably, yes.<br />I feel Chang doesn't touch on the topic because, quite frankly, she doesn't need to.  We all know that we firebombed the hell out of Tokyo and dropped nukes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Does she need to give you a lecture on the A-bombings?  I don't think so; apparently, neither does she.<br />For alot of the book, Chang does seem biased, and her exclusion of any major discussion on the Nagasaki/Hiroshima bombings could be seen as bias.  However, I think she was correct to refrain from touching on this topic.  If you want to know about the bombings, there's ALOT of material available out there.  Whatever opinion you formulate from that material is exclusively yours.<br />On the subject of Japan's persistent denial/apology complex, that's again another arbitary decision. There are people today who think the Germans should have made different reparations as a result of the event they perpetrated.  There are people today who deny the Holocaust ever occured.  Do I think Chang is biased on this subject?  Yep.  Do I think she's right? Somewhat.  Do others think she's wrong? Yep.<br />I'll be blunt, I don't know jack about \\"picture fabrication\\".  In my opinion though, denying the validity of this book and it's pictures is about paramount to denying the Nazi-perpetrated holocaust, which in and of itself strikes me as a little... ridiculous, if you ask me.<br />All in all, Iris Chang wrote a sound book.  I do agree that some ofthe statistical figures are most likely exaggerated and that Chang (as well as most of the other reviewers here) shows a great deal of bias, but I don't believe that necessarily makes \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" any less significant.  To my knowledge, this is one of the few books available on the market discussing the events that transpired, which in and of itself makes this book important.<br />In terms of information, the only parts I find seriously flawed are the statistics.  The realistic number for the deaths at Nanking is probably somewhere in the 20,000-50,000 range, although I have no doubt that the casualty number could easily have been equated to the number Chang provided.<br />To conclude, I highly recommend this book, but I also suggest you take it with a decent amount of skepticism.  It's an excellent read, but as my topic (and several other people) stated, it is \\"somewhat\\" biased and \\"somewhat\\" exaggerated in terms of figures and events.
B00006HBUA|4.0|\\"Did he just write the words 'smart' and 'witty' in reference to the new 'Scooby Doo' movie?\\" you might ask. Well, yes I just did! I saw this film in the movie theatre on a blind date, and we both had a great time...and mind you, we went at a matinee on a Sunday. The theatre was swarming with kids, and you know what? Still had a good time.<br />The film's greatest strengths lie in its screenplay and in its amazing cast. The screenplay wisely spoofs the \\"Scooby Doo\\" cartoon gently, while at the same time paying loving homage to it. This is not a mean parody, but obviously the work of a writer who understood \\"Scooby\\" and, as a fan, is better able to crack jokes about everything from the purported drug subtext to the detestable Scrappy Doo. A \\"Scooby\\" project that will actually admit what a horrible creature Scrappy is...well, you just have to respect that. No, this movie does not have a deep plot...but, IT'S SCOOBY DOO! IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO! How many \\"Scooby\\" cartoons have you seen that have changed your life? Ummm? Did you just say \\"None\\"? Now, you get the point!<br />I will say that the film breaks the \\"Scooby\\" rule only in one area. The \\"surprise\\" ending where they reveal the identity of the bad guy...is actually a surprise. Which is really quite surprising in and of itself.<br />Now I have to rave about two particular cast members...Sarah Michelle Gellar and Matthew Lillard, who were so pitch-perfect in their respective renditions of Daphne and Shaggy that you would swear that the cartoon versions were ripped right off the animation cells and brought to life. SMG has proven her comedy chops and brilliant sense of timing in \\"Cruel Intentions,\\" and on special comedic episodes of \\"Buffy.\\" Well, this is her first full-out comedic role in a film that you'll actually want to see (I'm discounting \\"Simply Irresistable\\"...Ugh!), and she is a joy to watch. In one particularly great scene, she and Fred's souls switch bodies. Her jubilant expressions, when she, as Fred, touches Daphne's breasts, are an absolute riot. And there's Matthew Lillard, who captures all the sweetness, innocence, lovability and doltishness of Shaggy. He is not only funny but actually touching at times.<br />Freddie Prinze and the girl who played Velma are not quite as good...but they're more than passable.<br />The computer-animated Scooby, however, is wonderful. It perfectly mixes the look of a \\"real\\" dog with cartoonish expressions. In fact, from posters and TV commericals, I thought Scooby looked not so great, but when you see him in the movie for extended periods, he looks absolutley perfect. He is far better than most CGI I've seen in any film (leaves \\"Harry Potter\\"'s pathetic attempts at CGI in the dust), except for, perhaps, \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"<br />With all of this said, I'm not sure how well this movie would play for someone who is not a fan of the cartoon or has just never seen it. The movie is very dependant on in-jokes, so my review is from the persepective of a Scooby-phile. If you are one, I promise you will dig this movie. If you aren't, you might still enjoy it, but not quite \\"get\\" all of it. I'd recommend a weekend spent watching reruns on the Cartoon Network before you watch this film.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Rock is back, and im not talking about that over saterated rap rock cr@p! The Queens are back and better than ever.This album starts out like a bomb blowing up in your face! BAM! Then it takes you on a ride you dont want to end. I cant say enoughe good things about this album, plus if you buy it now you get a free DVD to boot!I recomend this to anyone who loves music. The talent within this band is freaken endless. Take it from this Young Tough, You need this album, youve been fed this regurgitated cr@p on the radio for far too long, this album WILL save your soul!  <BR>this review has been brought to you by Natas_Foetus Young Tough for life.
B00005T30L|2.0|It's about two anti-social high school girls who thinks almost everything and everyone are stupid.<br />The movie wasn't entertaining, wasn't funny, and had no character to sympathize with. Perhaps it was made for an anti-social audience.<br />It's not a sloppy film or badly made film. It's well made, just not my cup of tea.<br />The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it managed to keep my attention until the end of the movie. I guess I kept expecting something to happen which didn't.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I just want to start out by saying, I shouldnt have to write a review on this masterpiece of an album. Queens of the Stone Age should be a household name by now and Everyone and their mom should already own this jem of a disc.<BR>The songs on &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; all very in mood and style. The first song is sonic blast that should snap you out of the music coma that the music industrie has put us all in over the last few years. The second song on the album is the bands first single of the CD, and I have to warn you, Its so catchy that after listening to it youll have the tune stuck in your head the rest of the day. One of my favorite songs is &quot;Another Love Song&quot; Its totally retro! I could go on and on about this album but Im runnin out of time so dont wait another minute BUY this album. Your ears diserve it after all the years youve put them to work, do something nice for them and pick this CD up!
B00006FXB6|5.0|This is a gem that I hope does not get lost amongst all the slop that is being passed off as music these days!

1556154844|5.0|Every office I've been with has systems with bad code.  (Bad Visual Basic code, I'm surmise.)  The more programmers I meet the more I believe that, if I can have my way every &quot;introduction to programming&quot; course in every school in every country will have this as required reading.  <br />It's people who have not heard of this book that cause stress in my team, life and my project.  So, in interviews I always ask, &quot;When have you last read 'Code Complete'?&quot;  Unfortunately some candidates reply, &quot;Oh sorry, is it a novel...?&quot;  It's sad.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I'm not even sure where to begin.  QOTSA have been a band in my Top-5 since I first heard them and their amazingly dense music that is, in fact, actually surprisingly simple.  It's a case of playing all the right things so that, as the listener, you're not forced to weed out the (bad stuff).  It's beauty in simplicity at it's finest and is ever-present in their sound.<BR>     Songs For the Deaf is an incredible example of how this loose-knit collective of inspired musicians can come together and spit out a little bit for everyone, while all the while not alienating a single musical soul.  For the hardcore punk fans (no doubt crossovers from bassist Oliveri's punk outfit The Dwarves), there is the all-new version of \\"Millionaire\\" (originally on the 5th desert session) and \\"Six Shooter\\", the latter of which comes in and hits you like a ton of bricks, and then is out as quickly as it came.  For the 70's rock revitalists, there is \\"The Sky Is Falling\\" and the ironically listed 'hidden track' \\"Mosquito Song\\".  Finally, for the fans of the self-titled first album, there is the fantastic \\"First It Giveth\\".<BR>     I could go on about the diversity of this record, but that would be pointless, as it only makes sense when you hear it.  It's radio concept really holds up when you hear the diversity exhibited by this band, and regardless of what scene you're digging currently, you'll be able to somehow fit these guys in - that is, unless you actually are deaf...<br />   ...then just buy it for the artwork!
0790736039|5.0|Do you remember everything that you were afraid of as a child?  Stephen King captured the fears of a child in his classic book &quot;It&quot;, while I have not read the book (no one has that kind of time on their hands), I enjoyed this movie very much.  &quot;It&quot; has everything: blood, gore, skeletons, mummified creatures, werewolves, decaptitated heads talking, and good, old fashioned fright.  <br />The story revolves around a small town called Derry, Maine (which I'm not sure even exists), that is oblivious to murders committed by a resiliently hidden creature that occasionally makes itself visible as the dancing clown, Pennywise (Tim Curry).  Unfortunately, only seven kids in town really know what's going on, and they're 12!  Pennywise visits each of the kids and drives them to attempt to get rid of him for good.  &quot;The Lucky Seven&quot; as they refer to themselves, go down into the sewers to eradicate the menace, and they suceed, or so they thought.<br />Of course, as in most horror movies, the killer returns, exactly 30 years after the previous murders.  A now middle-aged group returns to the sewers once again, and what awaits them would frighten the wits out of most anyone....
B000066F6H|5.0|I felt compelled to write a brief review of this album based on some other reviews I read here at Amazon.  To start off, if someone is going to judge an album for it's length, then I think they have NO merit whatsoever.  I'd rather have a strong & tight 30 minutes of great music versus some long 2 disc set of GARBAGE.  Not to mention successful punk rock bands of the past like The Ramones also had short song lengths.<br />Are they original?  No.  Has it been done before?  Yes.  Should we care?  NO!  I don't understand why people poke at artists for stealing ideas, when that's really all the entertainment world is FILLED with.  Come on, everything has been pretty much done, and those things that work are worth revisiting.  Look at the motion picture industry.  How many of the blockbuster films are rehashed material?  Retro sells.  And personally I find the return refreshing.  If the Beatles were great, they can't entertain youth on stage today, so why not bring them back?  Look at the Squirrel Nut Zippers for example.  They write in a style of a completely different time period, but they expose a new crowd to a sound that once worked.  I think most people that are complaining about \\"they sound like The Rolling Stones\\" or what have you, are just bitter because they have a personal attachment to something from their youth, and feel like they are being cheated, or they're jealous that today's youth is giving credit to the \\"new sound\\".  Personally when I first saw The Hives' music video for \\"Hate to say I told you so\\" I noticed the white ties tucked in and thought, \\"wow,\\" Duran Duran did that in the early 80s.  Cool.  Then I was hooked instantly by the catchy riffs and high energy.  I also enjoyed the fact that all the band members aren't some corporate creation of pretty pop boys, but rather they are an odd mix of sizes and heights.<br />But enough of that, how about the music?  If you've heard ANY of their singles, then you can expect MORE of the same on the album.  And I mean that in a GOOD way.  High energy, catchy, and fun.  Lead vocalist Pelle Almqvist is not the greatest singer in the world, but I think that's part of the appeal.  It's like the neighborhood rock band jamming in their garage; edgy, playful, and promising.  If you're debating if the album is worth your money, it IS.  Especially the enhanced version which contains 3 spectacular music videos on it (\\"Hate To Say I Told You So,\\" \\"Die All Right!,\\" and \\"Main Offender\\") gives you great bang for the buck, as The Hives have a strong image presence.  A great surprise track is track 8 \\"Find another girl,\\" which contains the swooning percussion and sound of a 1950s song.  Sweden has won me over again.d I mean that in a GOOD way.

B00005RRG9|5.0|The Parent Trap was made back when Disney could still be counted on to always deliver a good movie. Hayley Mills plays twins (and probably no one could have done the part better!), separated in babyhood by divorced parents, who find each other by accident at a summer camp.  They concoct a scheme to reunite their parents and procede to do just that.  The DVD also includes behind-the-scenes footage that is fun to watch as well.  The movie itself has some classic scenes (the fight at the dance being probably the most famous) that make this one you'll watch again and again and your kids will like it too!
6305358613|4.0|This is a semi-fictionalized account of the reign of Elizabeth 1, and the story itself is interesting, but Cate Blancett absolutely steals the show!  How she didn't win the academy award for this, I can't fathom.  Her performance alone ranks as one of the best you will ever see.<br />While the story plays fast and loose with some historical bits, it's still an interesting look into the 'rebirth' of England and the influence of the Catholic church on it's rulers.<br />Geoffery Rush is also excellent as her faithful advisor and 'bodyguard.' He is sheer evil that you can't manage to disdain.<br />Great movie, well worth the price!
0767020308|5.0|This movie (like the modern version called &quot;Clueless&quot; several years ago)was made from the book by the same title and remains pretty true to the book.  It is extremely well done and has an excellant cast.  There are many times in the book when Emma sits and daydreams about her schemes.  These are handled wonderfully in the movie and make her actions much easier to understand.  The story concerns a young woman of good (and wealthy) family in England in the early 1800's who spends her time making matches among her friends and manages to mess everything up thoroughly before she's finished.  It all works out in the end and the telling of it is a delight.  Her father, a hypochondriac in the extreme, is also a delight.  The scene where he tells an elderly lady at great length that an egg will not harm her, yet won't give it to her to eat, is especially well done.  Action lovers will not like this, but if you are a Jane Austin fan or like movies about old English society, you'll love it.
0684833395|5.0|Catch 22 is a war book for people who love war, people who hate war, people who fear war, and people who don't particularly care about war. But most importantly, this is a book for people who have a sense of humor. Catch 22 is filled with ridiculous, unbelievable situations that make perfect sense. For example, a commander who wants to move up and therefore orders his men to fly more missions than are required - therein lies Catch 22 (or one version of it) - a man can leave because he finished his required missions, but he has to stay, otherwise he would be disobeying orders from a commanding officer. There is Milo, the self-perserving capitalist, Orr, who constantly crashes his plane, the Chaplain, who is afraid of everyone, and unsure about God, and many more. Basically, this book is about survival - living to tell the tale. And Yosseran does his best throughout the book. In his words, \\"he had decided to live forever or die in the attempt.\\" So far, he's doing well...
0060900075|5.0|\\"The Doors of Perception\\" is probably the most popular non-fiction work on the subject of psychedelic experiences; it is based on first account records of the author's decision to experiment the consequences of intake of small amounts of mescalin, in an attempt to reach enlightenment and escape world's boredom.  Being who he was, the result is a very interesting narrative in which the author expands on his not only scientific but also philosophical, religious, and artistic ideas.<BR>The philosopher C.D.Broad suggested that our brains are genetically programmed to screen perceptions, selecting only those that are necessary for survival.

Only through the use of chemical substances can a human being free himself from his inherited limitations, experience the realms of supernaturally brilliant visionary experiences, and obtain total freedom from the ego.  In this new stage of consciousness, spatial and time relationships cease to exist, whilst intensity, profundity of significance are augmented.  Our everyday reliance on language petrifies perception because \\"however expressive, symbols can never be the things they stand for.\\"  There is a need for a less exclusively verbal system of education and \\"an occasional trip through some chemical Door in the Wall!\\"<BR>Huxley's work is highly controversial and paradoxical.  How are we to develop a science of perception if our language is not equipped to express that same perception?  How are we to explain the differences in reaction to mescalin intake, ranging from peaceful and mystical to schizophrenic behavior?  How are we to define individuals \\"with open minds and sound lives\\" who would be normally allowed to use chemical substances (drugs) with no risk involved?  Let the reader keep in mind that this book was published back in 1954 and nowadays science is till dealing with these issues.<BR>In order to give an anwer as to why individuals react differently to drug intake, Huxley worte \\"Heaven and Hell.\\"  According to him, for some \\"the ego doesn't melt like an iceberg in tropical waters, but expands to the point of suffocation;\\"  only those who are free from negative emotions (fear, hatred, anger) have the door opened to visionary experience.<BR>Aldous Huxley raises a number of interesting issues, not be taken as \\"chicken-soup for drugs,\\" but rather as intellectual exercise for further thought and consideration as to what we most commonly refer to as \\"reality.\\"  His opinions and explanations may sometimes be considered \\"naive\\" and not fully elaborated, but merit goes to his audacity in exploring an area which to this day remains open to further understanding.
6303014100|5.0|Hell, they couldn't really have used a better book than &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; and they got great actors for the principal roles.  One of my cousins was a recreationist used for the film, and that just adds to my love for this movie.<br />Well done, well acted, well-PERFORMED, period.  Truly captured the essence of the battle.
6305350205|5.0|Star Trek V The Final Frontier, while not being the best of the TOS movies, is not a bad story at all.  It primarily focuses on friendship and family.  The family of course being the three main characters.  The story could've used some tweaking up here and there, but it still works well.  The producers could've paid a little more attention to details though, I do not think that the Constitution class starship had in excess of 78 decks.  What would've made it a little more interesting is if Sean Connery had been able to play the role of Sybok.  Unfortunately for Star Trek and fortunate for Tom Clancy fans, he was busy filming &quot;The Hunt for Red October.&quot;  Overall though, in my opinion, Star Trek V is a good Star Trek movie and in good keeping with what Gene Roddenberry wanted out of Star Trek.
B00006FXB6|5.0|songs for the deaf is a rollercoaster ride, of bluesy desert sounds and euphoric vocals. as soon as its turned on the dj sets the tone for the whole album, a laid back storm on the horizon waiting to explode and about a minute later it does, with the screaming vocals of one 'nick oliveri'.<br />throughout the entire album the tempo changes with every song, riffs that stick in your head like a fish hook. and at the very end when the mosquito song is playing, it almost feels like after youve had a hard game of basketball, and are walking home, completely knackered and just chill out, preparing for the time when you press play and you go through the journey again.
B00000K19E|5.0|Most computer hackers use they're computers to escape the confines of reality.  In 1999, Andy and Larry Wachowski took this idea, and completely flipped it on it's ear with this surprise box office blockbuster that some of us love, and others love to hate.  Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Anderson, an employee for one of the largest software companies in the world by day; but by night he is Neo, a computer hacker who sits in front of his computer all night long, waiting.  What he is waiting for he does not know, until one day he receives a message from a man called Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and from that moment on, everything Neo knows to be real is turned upside down, as we find out that our day in, day out world is all a computer generated hoax to keep all of humanity enslaved.  Hell of a concept eh?  We all know what happens from there on, so I'll get to my thoughts on The Matrix.  The first time I layed eyes on this film I loved it, I loved everything about it, the idea (even though it mirror's 1998's Dark City, a superior film and another one of my all time favorites), the special effects, the costume design (tell me that Neo, Morpheus, and crew don't look just plain cool), and how the Wachowski Brothers inject kung-fu style fight scenes almost flawlessly.  Love it or hate it, no one can deny that The Matrix is not a landmark film in action and science fiction, and at the time it came out was the much needed sci-fi epic that fans have waited years for.  If you've never seen The Matrix, stop reading this and follow the white rabbit to the Add to Cart button.
0316666343|2.0|this is so not the best book of the summer. The great writing is all that saves an overwise dreary and unbelievable tale. I liked Susie's view of heaven. I did not like the &quot;body-snatching of a former friend so she could sleep with a boy&quot; scene. That completely lost the book for me. It was compelling enough to read, but it is not compelling enough to be the must-read book of the summer!
B00006G8G1|1.0|The concert was fantastic, the song selection was very good. The editting of the video is terrible.  Iron Maiden or the producers should have hired a pro to do the editing.  I agree with Chris Glenn 100 percent. This kind of switching angles back and forth is very distracting. I watched a little over half the show with the hopes that I could find a rhythm to the editing but no such luck. I finally had to turn it off because it was to hard to follow. As for sound, the fact that they did not give uyou the choice of 2 channel sound is reason alone not to buy this disc set. The fluctuation in sound levels are very apparent. I have yet to hear a live concert recording(heavy hitter rock/roll) which sounds better in 5.1 digital than in 2 channel stereo.<BR>I also purchased the Judas Priest-Live in London. If you only could buy one of these DVDs-Iron Maiden or Judas Priest-select the Priest, you will not be disappointed.
B000002INJ|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Manowar, ever since I was 13, and I can say that this is definitely their best album.  Scratch that, this might be the best metal album ever recorded!  The album opens with the amzing Wheels of Fire, and the party never stops!  My personal favorite track is Hail and Kill, a truly rockin song.  Some other highlights are: The Crown and the Ring (a ballad accompanied by a massive organ and a full choir), Kings of Metal (a take no prisoners rock song) and Heart of Steel (another good ballad).  All the songs on this album are great so I really reccomend buying this cd.  If you have never heard of Manowar before, this is probably a good one to start with.  This is the album I started with, and now I own them all.
0060527099|5.0|A S Byatt's Booker Prize winning novel, \\"Possession\\", isn't just the literary sourcebook for the current movie of the same name. It is SERIOUS LITERATURE for SERIOUS READERS, so Movie Tie-In fans expecting a compactly written synopsis of the film are well advised to stay away. But if you're a literature aficionado, and wading knee deep in long flowery poems, obscure verses, beautifully but wordily written letters and journal entries isn't a problem or better still, your cup of tea, there's much in \\"Possession\\" that will delight and enthrall you. <br />Subtitled \\"A Romance\\", \\"Possession\\" is more than the coupling of an ancient with a contemporary love story, though the movie adaptation may have you believe that. Victorian poet Randolph Ash didn't just have a dirty weekend with fairy poetess Christabel LaMotte. Their secret liason did however result in an awkward outcome that should not surprise readers. In Byatt's hands, their love affair is cloaked in mystery and cerebral splendour and though it may be hard to fathom the foundation of their mutual attraction, its credibility doesn't suffer because the affair isn't played out in real time but reconstructed and deduced from fragments of evidence from the past. It's like examining a black and white print through frosted glass. As for the coupling of modern day academics Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell, those who have read the novel but not seen the film may be surprised that their relationship has been characterised as a romance. That to me is surely the crudest way of depicting Maud's and Roland's journey of self discovery as they collaborate in their research into the murky past of Ash & LaMotte and then join up in their undertaking to secure ownership of the invaluable evidence they have uncovered. <br />The flowing poems and verses may be the novel's styling, the romance its subject, but \\"Possession\\" is above all a thriller and a breathtakingly exhilarating one at that. No violence, bloodletting or shootouts, onlytreachery of the kind practised by learned men of letters. They're all so civilised yet undeniably vicious in their scheming and stalking of one another, it's like having one's throat slit by paper. So fine and fatal. Byatt's enactment of the final scene at the graveyard, where she calls upon the elements to unleash their destructive power, is a dramatic coup de grace that would translate perfectly on screen. <br />A S Byatt is a difficult novelist. Not surprisingly, \\"Possession\\" - her grand opus - doesn't make easy reading but a more finely crafted entity drawing upon a tapestry of subgenres you will not find. Truly a modern masterpiece. It'll be a tragedy if younger readers remember it as the book that inspired the film. Don't let that happen. Go read the real thing !
0449227545|3.0|I've read about a half dozen of Mr. Folliet's stories. . .<br /><br />1) I listened to the audio book version of this and afterwards felt like it was the better choice than actually reading the paperback version.<br /><br />2) The audio book version was well presented and well acted by the reader<br /><br />3) The story seemed to have the following flaws<br />a) formulaic plot - I knew what was coming before it happened<br />b) one dimensional characters...except Priest - leaving a lot to be desired from the rest of the cast<br />c) had to suspend belief in the whole earthquake theory<br /><br />I thought it was enjoyable on cassette tape I picked up at the library. Because it was so far fetched and predictable at the same time, I've enjoyed some of his other stories much better.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Forget you may have come to beleive, and what the critics have been saying. Rock is definatly not dead.<br />Proof:  Queens of the Stone age songs \\"songs for the Deaf\\"<br />This album kicks major ...pardon my french.  It is perfect from start to finish, and I am not embeleshing.  It has everything a great rock record should.  Ther catchy hooks and heavy distortion, while at times being very melodic, and heartfelt.  Just listen to the whole album once and you will be hooked.  Just a couple songs even.  THis songs are so good.  I can't stop humming them in my head.  This is a must buy.
0792164903|4.0|\\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" loosely based on the Washington Irving tale of the headless horseman, maintains an eerie atmosphere from beginning to end.  Set in a rural village in colonial New England, this tale of suspense and Halloween-type horror will nail you to your seat.<br />  Johnny Depp is surprisingly good as the earnest young Ichabod Crane, summoned from New York City to investigate the bizarre happenings in the village.  Christina Ricci's nuanced performance as his romantic interest is well performed.  The dreamy, greyish lighting and the haunting music contribute to the constant spooky feeling this movie conveys.  Highly recommended.
0930289234|5.0|I started this book three times before I could penetrate its dense style.  Once I got going, I found it to be a work of extraordinary literature.  The artwork isn't my style, but the story combined with the unique narrative structure, finely-crafted characters and complex views of good and evil and time make for a remarkable book.  You don't have to be a comic book or graphic novel fan to appreciate this book.  This is great work.
0790729628|4.0|I really love this movie a lot. But the DVD is just plain awful. I really wish that they rerelease this moviewith some special features like commentaries from Ridley Scott and some featurets and the most important thing a 5.1 Digital audio track.<br />I won't need to tell you about the story but just RENT this movie DONT BUY THE DVD. Just pray that a rerelease will come.
0380789035|4.0|I really enjoyed how the story unfolded. each chapter held a new piece of evidence, each a surprise and wonder. Neil Gaiman is one of the most vividly imaginative writers i've come across. His words reflect colorful, and sometimes disturbing pictures. It put my over imaginative mind in heaven!!!
079073804X|3.0|I held off on watcing the Exorcist for quite some time because anytime someone says a horror movie is so scary and makes people puke I know they don't know what good horror is (check out some of the classic itallian horror movies by Fulci! sure the acting isn't the best but it's a horror movie for crying out loud and Fulci is the master of gore). Maybe this film was something to be scared of back in 1973 but some 30 years later this film doesn't do much to scare me. I will admit that the images of Captin Howdy are quite creepy and his time on screen, which are a few seconds makes him one of the most creepiest horror creatures in history. The acting in this film is ok, Linda Blair does an amazing job for a 12 year old in her first major role but the other acting isn't the greatest. I also found there to be way too much dialouge for a so-called scary movie (there were way more scenes without Blair than there were with her). I also got annoyed at how they showed a scene with Blair and then not even 2 minutes later the scene was over (most of her scenes lasted under 5 minutes except for her excorcism scenes in the end) Being one of the most hyped and talked about horror films around i'm left confused after viewing this. What exactally made people run from the theater screaming or throw up or pass out? This film is very controversial I will admit and that was one of the great things about it but the movie in no way is one of the scariest ever. I will also admit that the make-up is excellent for a movie and the transfer to dvd makes this film look brand new and if it wasn't for the clothing and hairstyles i'd never believe that this was made in 1973! After finally viewing this I really can't see how films like The Sixth Sense (pg-13 horror...give me a break!)and the Others even resemble this film or can be compaired to this. Sure they aren't your typical slasher horror films but in no way are they good horror films. The Blair Witch Project has been called the new Exorcistand to me that movie is scarier because I like 10 minutes from Burkittsville and have been there many times and the town is very creepy at nighttime. <br />Do yourself a favor and go out and rent or buy some real horror classics that will really scare you and make you throw up. Try checking out Zombie, Cannibal Holocaust, The Beyond, New York Ripper, Hellrasier, Hellbound Hellrasier 2, Dawn of the Dead. and Day of the Dead. Also check out two of the most terrifying horror films ever, Night of the living dead and Bela Lugosi's Dracula! Both don't have the gore but the mixture of black and white and creepiness make them two of the greatest of all time. <br />The Exorcist is a decent movie but in noway one of the greatest horror films of all time. Sure it pushed the envelope and was something huge for it's time but that was 30 years ago and so much more gore has come out since then that will really scare the hell out of you!
B000069AUI|5.0|Easily, one of the best albums to be released this year and in my opinion, a strong contender for Grammy nominations (including Album of the Year).  Singer Chris Martin has repeated in many interviews that this was a difficult album to record and mix.  The results have paid off, big time.  I waited about a year and a half for the follow up to the multi-platinum Parachutes, and this effort was worth the wait.<br />The album starts of with the loud and thunderous Politik, and then goes into the usual fare with songs such as in In My Place, God Must Have Put A Smile Upon Your Face, and the wonderfully, moving anti-Yellow ballad, the Scientist.  The album's highlights start with tracks 5 and 6 (Clocks and Daylight).  The two piano driven tracks are helped tremendously by the Jon Bucklands's guitar chiming.  Another track highlight, A Whisper, is sort a &quot;follow up&quot; to High Speed from Parachutes.  The guitar rips open the track and is then followed by Martin's falsetto.  The title track is the beginning of the album's end, touching on the themes of war and then is finished by Amsterdam.  Definately worth looking into even if you have never heard of the band, or if you love the new bands coming out of the UK.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's new album, &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is a great album. It was a good album for her crossover and to show her style. All the songs are excellent. It includes nine songs in English and four in Spanish. The first single, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; or &quot;Suerte&quot; is a very cool song, but, in my opinion, it's not the best in this album. &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is a love song and it's the second single. Her third single &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; or &quot;Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)&quot; is one of my favorites. But there are a lot more good songs in this album. &quot;The One&quot; is a relaxing rock-ballad song to listen to. Another one of my favorites is &quot;Ready For The Good Times&quot;, which basically talks of how someone should never give up for a time they had problems or suffered. It has a cool danceable rhythm. &quot;Fool&quot; is a good song too. Another song I liked a lot was &quot;Rules&quot;. It's a fun song to listen to. I like the lyrics in it. Shakira interprets one of her past hits (&quot;Ojos Asi&quot;) in English. It sounds really cool. &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; is a good song, but not one of my favorites. It was the second single in Latin America. This album is excellent. I recommend it.
B00004XQP4|3.0|Once again one can see how easy it is for a band to sell out for riches and fame.  This record is a virtual about-face from the brash, obnoxious, loud Green Day that I'm used to.  Not sure what their intent was when the released this record, but it clearly is pop music, not punk.  They're almost contradicting the very reason for which they chose to be a punk band; to demur and ridicule popular culture.  Anyway, I guess they were trying to explore some new musical territory... and the songs aren't that bad; A few are actually quite good (hence the 3 stars).  But, the very least they could have done was release the album under a different name, so the bona-fide, long-time Green Day fans (if there are any left) won't get confused who is who.  Admittedly, I will always admire Green Day simply because of Slappy, 1,000 Hours; the early stuff (and some select other tunes not know amongst the general public).  I just hope they'll go back to their roots some time soon...
B00005OAIE|3.0|...especially since the guy's so popular now that you can probably borrow a copy to listen to before you buy it. I agree with quite a lot of what the reviewer from Connecticut wrote; the lyrics are never memorable and occasionally annoying, and he does sound kind of derivative. I like his guitar playing, especially on the second disc (the SRV tune is nice, though I think he shows poor taste on Hendrix's 'Wind Cries Mary' - compare to John McLaughlin's version and you'll see what I mean).<br />But as for throwing him to the wolves before he can 'mature', I just don't get it. The guy has something to say, he can write, he can play, why not let him say his thing? And if teenage girls want to buy that instead of listening to a real songwriter or a better musician, that's fine too. The songs probably won't stand up but then not many do. Bob Dylan released his first album when he was twenty one, and it wasn't great either, but no one was worse off for that.
0844663662|4.0|Reading Slaughter-house Five is nothing less than an adventure.  I've read many anti-war books and was expecting much of the same qualities in this one, but I was certainly in for a surprise.  Told through the eyes of a man who is completely unhinged from reality, this book - which is based around the bombing of Dresden - is full of symbolism and interesting ideas.<br />Billy Pilgrim is an optometrist.  He is the son of an optometrist and is married to the daughter of an optometrist.  He believes that he was once kidnapped by aliens and brought to their planet where he was put in a zoo and given a famous actress to mate with.  He believes he can travel through time to any moment of his life and that Adam and Eve can be seen in a pair of leather boots.  And he is a soldier in World War Two.  By living in a world which is so constantly unreal, Billy seems to perceive what is real (i.e. the horrible war which he is fighting in) to be fiction.  Because he believes that all moments of time coexist at once, death does not affect him.  Whether a bottle of champagne goes dead or a friend is killed by firing squad, his reaction in the same: \\"So it goes.\\"  As Billy drifts in and out from the real and the unreal, we can begin to understand the relationships between the everyday occurances of our lives and the extraordinary circumstances of a horrible war.
0967851408|3.0|\\"One of the old Hermetic Masters wrote, long ages ago: `He who grasps the truth of the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to Mastery.'  And these words are as true today as at the time they were first written.  Without this Master-Key, Mastery is impossible, and the student knocks in vain at the many doors of The Temple.\\"  This quote was taken from a book of Hermetic Philosophy called \\"The Kybalion\\" (pg. 28) which was published at the beginning of the 20th century and anonymously written by \\"Three Initiates\\" but is reputed to be authored or co-authored by William Walker Atkinson, one of the authors quoted by Haanel in his book \\"The Master Key System\\".  As a 32-degree Mason, Mr. Haanel was certainly familiar with esoteric philosophy (incl. Hermeticism and Kabbalah) and a comparison between Haanel's book and \\"The Kybalion\\" will reveal many commonalities, including an exposition of the causal, magnetic and compensatory Law of Attraction (like attracts like).  Haanel's maxim of \\"As Within, So Without\\" is reflective of the Hermetic \\"As Above, So Below\\" and those familiar with the Hindu Upanishads, some sacred writings of India, will see how this relates to the Hindu idea that atman is Brahman or, to use Haanel's terms, the individual (\\"below\\") is one with the Universal (\\"above\\").  Also, the Law of Attraction is reflective of the Law of Karma.  The Master Key of the Kybalion is the same as the Master Key of Haanel's book.  The Key is the understanding and practical application of Hermetic principles which are rooted in the foundational idea of the essential oneness of the individual and the Universal, Creative Source  (which some call \\"God\\").  According to Haanel, when this truth is understood and appreciated, one \\"will have come into the possession of the Master-Key\\" (Week Twenty-Four: Alchemy, page 197).  In the \\"Questions and Answers\\" section of Haanel's book, he doesn't really answer the question, \\"Is not the Master Key Idea of `God' Pantheistic?\\"  He basically just asserts that \\"this depends entirely upon your idea of Pantheism.\\"  Like the Kybalion, Haanel's idea of God is more bi-polar and panentheistic (All in God, God in All) than pantheistic (All is God) and both use the Bible's  New Testament reference which states: \\"In Him we live and move and have our being\\" (a quote from the Apostle Paul in Acts 17:28).  Panentheism (a.k.a. Process Theism) gained in popularity in the 20th century after A. N. Whitehead's book \\"Process and Reality\\" was first published in 1929.  Also, the New Thought Movement (of which Haanel is considered by some to be a part) has recently recognized the value of panentheism through the New Thoughters Anderson and Whitehouse.  See their book \\"New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality\\" where they acknowledge that pantheism underlies much of classical New Thought but see the philosophical problems of it and recommend panentheism instead by promoting Process New Thought a la Whitehead.<br />Hannel is one among many authors that were inspired by the nineteenth century's growing interest in esoteric philosophy and practical mysticism that spread throughout Europe and America.  Some of the individuals (R. W. Emerson, Thomas Troward, W.W. Atkinson, James Allen, etc.) referenced or quoted in Hannel's work reveal his influences and links to the broader inter-connected movements, including the Transcendental and New Thought Movements.  The 19th century also saw the founding of both the Theosophical Society and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, notable occult groups that explored the metaphysical laws of the Universe and eventually contributed (along with the other movements) to the current so-called \\"New Age Movement\\" with its Neo-Paganism and modern \\"magic\\".<br />With all that aside, one doesn't have to be a pantheist or panentheist (I am neither) to appreciate some of Haanel's insights.  God is indeed the Omni-Source of all power, and the power of the human mind (both the conscious and subconscious aspects) to influence one's perception of reality and even contribute to it (including psychosomatically) certainly needs to be taken seriously.  Also, the importance of self-discipline to one's overall success in life should not be underestimated.  Human responsibility is an important factor in the human situation as is education, and the application (including mental application via meditation), not just knowledge, is what will effect change for the better not only in one's habits but also in one's circumstances.scious and subconscious aspects) to influence one's perception of reality and even contribute to it (including psychosomatically) certainly needs to be taken seriously.

B000069HKH|5.0|Having been born in 1980, I only remember faint praises on &quot;The Boss.&quot;  Instead, kids in my generation were forced into music by Vanilla Ice, Salt N Peppa, and soon thereafer, the grundge movement followed by the R&amp;B movement that now dominates maintstream. That being stated, I want to thank Bruce Springsteen for giving my ears his latest cd. It is fresh and vivid, while still providing a few rocking tunes to appease all those who fell in love with &quot;Born in the USA&quot;(although young, I know I sure did).<br />This cd has powerful rocking tunes, soft and introspective tracks, and the entire cd is full of thought provoking lyrics that will carry Springsteen on for another decade or two. Thanks, Bruce, this cd was awesome.<br />Into the Fire, Waitin on a Sunny Day, Empty Sky, Nothing Man, The Fuse, The Rising, and Paradise carry this cd. You will love it, even if you were born in the eighties. LOL :-)
0316666343|5.0|What a fascinating journey between heaven and earth! The subject matter delivered from a 14-year old raped/murdered/dismembered narrator can be simultaneously disturbing, hopeful and insightful. The author manages to capture the victim's voice as she adjusts to her personal \\"heaven\\" while still watching her family, friends and murderer on earth. Will she be able to help her family catch her killer? How will her family heal? Can she reach out from the dead to contact them? How will she learn to \\"live\\" in heaven? These questions are answered but seem trivial to the author's chronicle of the journey for peace for both the living and the dead.
B00000255O|5.0|Ok, Headhunters gets the hype, and it deserves hype. Still, Man-Child contains arguably some of Herbie's greatest moments. Enough for my money, in fact, that it is my favorite Herbie album. I can appreciate the earthy, sophisticated groove of Thrust and the cerebral, spacey explorations of Sextant and the Mwandishi recordings. However, no Herbie fusion album simultaneously impresses, entertains, and funkifies as well as this album. With the exception of two tasteful, but slightly misplaced tracks, Man-Child incorporates everything that a good fusion album should (and I've heard plenty of mediocre fusion). The four up-tempo tracks alone more than make up for the two missteps. What sets Man-Child apart in my mind are the ferociously fast-paced changes. The beat and the entire band shift directions effortlessly, whereas sometimes the rhythm section members are the only ones employing constant changes on other Herbie albums. Another outstanding attribute of Man-Child is the style with which Herbie plays the keyboard stacks. Polyrhythms and richness seem to predominate Man-Child's atmosphere more consistently and more successfully than on Headhunters, Thrust, or any other Herbie 70s album. And I've heard them all! Suffice it to say that Man-Child, for all the respect it receives, deserves still far more.
0385484518|4.0|I had been avoiding this book despite hearing from numerous people that this was a great book because I was skeptical and because the biography of a dying man's last months was not exactly an appealing topic for a book.  However, someone gave me this book a couple of weeks ago and I read it in a couple of hours.<br />The book is a short work by Mitch Albom, a sports reporter in Detroit and on ESPN.  Albom heard on Nightline one night that Morrie Schwartz, his favorite college professor, one with whom he had developed a real friendship at school, was dying from ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease).  Albom had not seen or talked to his professor since then.  However, Albom called his professor, was invited over, and then, at the professor's request continued to visit him while recording their conversations to transform into a book, or as the two of them described it, a final thesis.<br />The story that emerges is a combination of Morrie's reflections of life, how to be happy, how to feel satisfied at the end of it, and so forth and Morrie's reflections of what it was like to know you are dying and watch your body wither away.<br />None of Morrie's ideas are particularly novel.  Morrie tells us that we should be good to each other and that we should care more about being happy than making money or buying things.  Morrie is sad about his body deteriorating, but he tells us that if you live a good life, you can go through even this horrible death without worrying that you didn't do enough in life.  However, Albom tells Morrie's lessons to us clearly and, as much as is possible, without lecturing us.  The story of Morrie's last months is, of course, tragic, but worth reading.<br />The only part I disliked was Albom's interspersed story of his own life.  Albom starts telling us a bit about his life in college, and that was interesting, but then Albom switches to the present.  I guess the point is that Albom wants us to know that he had lost his way but that he was taking Morrie's lessons to heart.  It seemed an unnecessary addition to the story.  Better to let Morrie's lessons speak for themselves.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I am disappointed. Coming from Blue Note, I expected a jazz album, but this strikes me as &quot;soft country.&quot; Norah's voice is too slow and mellow, with no real distinctive character - there is nothing here that would make you want to just sit down and listen to this music.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie is fantastic, of course.  Would you expect anything different from Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Farrell?  All three of these actors shine, as well as Jerry Stiller (George Costanza's dad in Seinfeld, and Ben's dad).This is an original comedy, that is short, but sweet.  Left me wanting more.
B000003S0P|5.0|i love King crimson they are one of my favorite prog rock bands!! my favorite King Crimson albums are from 70s (but i Haven't yet heard Constuktion of Light!). I love  Larks Tongues in aspic as well as Starless and bible black and this review Cd especially!!! Red is one of the best albums ever in prog rock. The songs are very complex and not without heaviness. I think prog metal was influnced by King Crimson.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|I knew, right off, when I heard they were making a sequal to Blade, I had to see it. Anyone one who loved the original is in for a treat.<BR>  Blade II is and action packed thriller, with great stunts and an AMAZING soundtrack! I believe, the special effects may even rival The Matrix!<BR>  This movie starts off with Blade, shockingly, taking sides with a group of Vampires, to fight a group of super vamps! The mission proves to be harder than they imagined. It seems this new breed of vampires has no known weakness, and loves to partake in a little vampire blood as well as human! And boy are they ever scary, they make regular vampires look like bunny rabbits!<BR>   The only reason I could not give Blade II five stars is because I found the story line a little lacking in comparison to the original. The special effects were great though and I highly recommend this flick!
0553275976|4.0|Pivotal in the characterization of this book is the accuracy in which every thought, action and even accent is described. The author leaves absolutely no margin for your imagination to alter the experience of the story. This is why you are living the satirical story of Mr. Wolfe portraying New York by its essentials: power, racial issues and money. That's all there is to it.<br />Sherman McCoy, whom you are given ample opportunity to hate, but really cannot hate completely, finds out that life is extremely fragile when you have everything everybody else wants. One misstep, or in his case one wrong turn in his pricey Mercedes, shows him literally and figuratively a more colorful New York than he has ever seen. Being terrified even on the 'safest' streets of New York, the Bronx appears before him like the nightmare he never had, accompanied by his mistress with the southern accent, Maria. Trying desperately to return to safe Manhattan, he is involved in a hit-and-run which is the start of a series of events that change his entire world. The mighty must fall, as seen from the Bronx. Justice must be done, seen from the assistant DA (who in fact has other motives). Headlines must scream, as seen from the press. All want a piece of McCoy, all want power, all want money.<br />Everybody who reads this book cannot deny finding many truths in it, about America, about wealth and about life all intertwined in an exiting story. Herein we find the strength of storytelling of Tom Wolfe. Read this book.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The best war drama/action that I have ever seen. A must have for any person.
6305280762|5.0|I remember first seeing this movie at a very early age. As a child, I loved this movie for it's spectacularity. As an adult (sort of), I love it for the acting performances of it's marvelous cast. <br />This is a disaster movie. During the seventies this type of movie was extremely popular, with timeless hits such as &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; and &quot;Airport&quot;.<BR>Disaster films seemed to have lost their appeal during the eighties but recent hits like &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; show that this type of movie is still very popular and here to stay.<br />In San Francisco, the tallest building in the world, &quot;The Glass Tower&quot; has finally been completed. An awesome superstructure and the new icon of the city. <BR>On the night of the dedication ceremony on the 130th floor a seemingly harmless fire erupts fifty floors below the partying crowd. When the situation grows out of control their pleasant happening turns into a nightmare struggle for survival.<br />With some of the best actors of that time (Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Faye Dunaway and Fred Astaire to name a few), true drama and an absolutely convincing inferno this movie deservedly took the world by storm!
B00004U8H4|5.0|What's this guy's problem? I'd be in heaven. Poor, disillusioned Patrick just needs to buy a house in the country, marry-up Reese, and lay down the law about being true to her man. And follow that advice himself by being loyal in return. Man, I'd be set! I mean, he'd be set. Anyways, where was I? Ah, American Psycho. Nothing short of mesmerizing. Patrick Bateman (our old friend, Christian Bale, from two personal favorites of mine, Newsies and Little Women) is a yuppie in the mid 1980's, extremely rich, and extremely messed up. He feels that \\"Patrick Bateman\\" isn't a real person, just an idea, a mask he wears. This is probably partly due to the fact that all the yuppies he works and plays with are so much alike, and so self-absorbed, that they can't even keep each other's names straight. Maybe that's what angers him so much that all he really thinks about is killing, dismembering, and even eating his victims. Oh, and '80's music, he's big on '80's music. You know, Phil Collins, Huey Lewis, the best of the '80's at least. As a matter of fact, he loves playing '80's CD's and talking about '80's music trivia as he performs his executions and murders. This is not altogether unnecessary, as it does help to lighten the mood during the violent scenes.<br /> Basically, the film takes us through a particularly difficult time in Patrick's life, when his obsession with killing begins to interfere with his facade of just another young hot shot business man. Competition is the way of life in Patrick's world, and he's beginning to feel the urge to use his hobby in the workplace as an effective tool of business. To put it simply, Patrick is losing control. The pressures at work, his frustration with his Yuppie girlfriend (Witherspoon), his hatred of his friends, and the inquisitions from a certain Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe), are causing him to be careless and deadly. Simultaneously, he is having to deal with the tiny bit of natural sympathy that still exists within him, mainly for his innocent and naive young secretary who has a serious crush on him. Things keep getting worse and worse for Patrick, so much that he somehow becomes the hero of the picture. No doubt, despite the fact that he's obviously nuts, he really becomes a very sympathetic and likeable character. I'm guessing that this is because everyone else in the film is just such a jerk. Of course, this disturbing feeling of sympathy for a psycho was purely intentional by the filmmakers, but it's fascinating nonetheless. The climax of the film is even more disturbing, and the resolution, downright confusing, but in a fantastic way. American Psycho is one of the best movies out there right now. Definitely a must see film, if not a must own.for his innocent and naive young secretary who has a serious crush on him.

B00003CX5P|3.0|Boy, what can one say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Very probably nothing. I was too young to really understand the impact of Star Wars when it first came out. I watched the trilogy later and got to love it. When Episode I was announced I had mixed feelings.<BR>Sure I'd go see it, and ofcourse it was going to look good. But I also believed this movie would never be able to live up to its expectations. <br />Now, three years after it's cinematic release I can't help but feel disappointed. As beautiful as it looks, Episode 1 is mercilessly let down by it's story and some of the main characters, like Jar Jar Binks and Anakin Skywalker, get on your nerves from the word go. <br />Yes, it looks good. But apart from it's gorgeous detailed landscape views and the spectacular showdown with Darth Maul at the end of the movie there's simply nothing much that will make you want to come back to this movie. <br />I admit the DVD has excellent extra features and the deleted scenes are indeed unique and special. But it doesn't change the facts; Episode I will go down in history as a remarkably beautiful yet somewhat empty showcase.
B00005JKG7|1.0|Can someone please tell me why this is such a well loved classic? It is sooooo silly and boring! Adrienne Barbeau is the KAB radio disc jockey in a pathetic little California village called Antonia Bay. Hour after hour, she plays stomach churning music to a town of people that would probably be better off dead. Meanwhile, Tom Atkins picks up unfortunate hitchhiker Jamie Lee Curtis, unfortunate because they are headed for that same dreary town. What they find when they get there is, well, nothing special. But a thick, low fog is rolling in from the ocean to bring fear, terror, and well, mostly just fog. Actually, the fog brings with it the ghosts of a ship full of lepers who were betrayed and murdered by the people of Antonio Bay 100 years earlier. The lepers are out for revenge, but for the first half of the movie their ominous fog does little more than cause poltergeist-like trouble throughout the village. Eventually though, they do start to inflict harm, and the heroes of the film drive their vehicles left and right, trying to get away from the fog that really isn't moving very fast. That's the problem with this whole movie. There's not much action, and most of the time you're wondering why people don't just leave town. They seem to find out through the radio reports that the fog is coming, and bringing death, with plenty of time to take action. But even the radio DJ making the announcements (Barbeau) would rather watch the fog roll in and stare in panic, than take any action that might save her life and that of her small son. Of course, everyone ends up trapped in the local church where the evil deeds of 100 years ago were first planned out, the place that the ghosts have been heading for from the beginning, and what happens next is,...well, you'll have to see that for yourself, if you're still interested for whatever warped reason. But if you're smart, you'll steer clear of The Fog. Unless you want to be BORED TO DEATH!
B00006CXSS|5.0|When I first read the book \\"Band of Brothers\\" is was moved. I was so touched by the bond of brotherhood of men through war and hard time. Thought all of them were not similar by any means, they pulled together and won as one united together. Together they made it through faithful jump, the square off a at Carenten and the blistering Winter at Bastonge. Then there were the good times in Germany, and the lady chasing Holland. There were good times and bad times, but they made it together!
B000021YQV|4.0|In terms of quality, Toxicity is like many other albums.  It has at least one excellent song (Aerials), a couple standout tracks (Chop Suey, Toxicity), some decent tunes (Science, Deer Dance) and the rest is largely filler.  System of a Down, however, does seemingly filler tracks like nothing else.  They generally follow a predictable pattern.  Discordant, stop/start guitars that refuse to fall into a melodic pattern and a paranoid rant of some sort.  While this does get rather annoying after a while, it provides for some unique, and ultimately interesting songs like Bounce, Prison Song, Shimmy and most recognizably, Psycho (who can resist a track with a chorus of \\"Psycho!  Groupie!  Cocaine!  Crazy!\\"?).  The rest of the songs on the album basically sound like the aforementioned filler tunes, but a lack of interesting lyrics or musical arrangement prevent them from being anything more than the same old, same old.  All told, though, Toxicity is definitely a unique, above-average disc.  I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if Amazon allowed it, but I'm feeling unusually optimistic at the moment.  Aerials is simply an excellent song, one of the singles of 2002.  Although I hated Toxicity at first, it's grown on me, and is generally a decent song.  Chop Suey lacks some of the better elements of Aerials, though it's the second-best song on the disc.  Psycho should be required listening for any music fan.  Toxicity is one of the better albums to come out recently, and is beyond a doubt one of the best hardcore / metal discs to be released as of late.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I have been a queens of the stone age fan for many years, i have all their albums and their underground material. ive read in interviews about with josh homme(guitarist and one of the volcalists) about his three album cycle, first was moving away from kyuss(hommes awsome predecessor band), second was expanding peoples minds of rock and venturing futher away and the third, now that he had opened the gates, was just to plain out playing what they like to play and rock out. And let me tell you, it rocks! Im not just saying this as a qotsa fan, but as a music fan. Qotsa have a ranging infulences from black sabbath to bjork, and this diveristy is emidatlly apparent with one listen. From the howling vocals on millionaire to the gentle singing on sky is falling, the sweet differnces from the cathcy and rythmic 'no one knows' to the speratic stamping of 'six shooter'. This is an album by music lovers for music lovers. The pinicle in the qotsa career so far.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Im a big Incubus fan. I have S.C.I.E.N.C.E., Make Yourself, and Morning View. The progression of this band since &quot;Science&quot; is astounding. They sound like a new band. Fortuneatly, Incubus hasn't sold out, or lost their emotion (unlike most pop today). They just sound like they matured as artists. Science was defineately a favorite album of mine, but Morning View is my favorite Incubus album. Nearly all their songs are well written, emotionally charged, and just awesome to listen to. Can't wait till they tour near my town again.

B00003CXBK|5.0|If you have a friend who has never seen an anime, this title works great for an intro to the genre. The onyl problem you might have is the story line, which can be a little confusing or strange to newcomers, but with such great animation, music, and a story that has great dept honce you understand it, Mononoke is still one of the best stand alone anime movies ever created.
B000069AUI|5.0|I'm happy to say I am not in the least disappointed with Coldplay's sophomore effort, despite my previous doubts about Rush not being able to measure up to Parachutes (which is an unfair comparison really). In fact, their style has clearly evolved from an acoustic-induced freshness to a more impassioned sophistication, if a little bit more synthesized. Their latest songs still resonate with that haunting and bittersweet quality which have become their trademark. There is an earnestness and articulation to the melodies that makes your heart ache with a certain yearning. Indeed, whoever thinks there is no beauty in sadness and reflection obviously hasn't heard Coldplay yet!<br />If I really had to pick some favorites off Rush (which is tough, since all of them are fantastic), I'd say the more outstanding ones are \\"In My Place\\", \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Green Eyes\\".<br />Anyway, I don't really know how or why, but Coldplay has done an incredibly brilliant job AGAIN. Well done, boys! While waiting for your next album, I'll be listening to you play come hell or water high on my CD player. Cheers  : )
B00004RF9I|5.0|This is one of my top 5 movies of all time.  The dialogue is funny and fantastic and tight tight tight.  Peter Finch's performance as the Mad Prophet of the Airwaves Howard Beale is maybe the best movie acting I have ever seen.  <br />Paddy Chayefsky presages the growth of reality/trash TV, whiner/hater shows in the media, and TV clowns like O'Reilly.  The fictional IBS network in the movie IS the Fox network of today.<br />This is biting social commentary about the vapidness and vacuity of our TV culture - 26 years old but still right on.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the pinnacle of animation. The *only* animated feature to be nominated for Best Picture, this film is a classic to both children and adults.<br />I saw the special edition of this film when it came out to IMAX theatres, and the added sequence was placed in so seamlessly that it is almost impossible to tell where the old footage ends and the new footage begins without a side by side comparison of the two films. The song that was removed, 'Human Again', was originally intended for the film, but cut and replaced with 'Something There' because Disney wanted to move the focus to Belle and the Beast, rather than keeping it on the living objects of the castle. The decision to put that song back *into* the film is one that I heartily approve of - it adds so much more back into the film, and it almost brought tears to my eyes to see it restored back to what it should be.<br />If you are a fan of the original, you will want the special edition.
B00005QB9A|5.0|BUY this one.  Rent something else. This is actually a slightly tragic story, but there is a scene in this movie that is so funny, that if you don't laugh, call the coroner, because you're dead. That scene alone could have carried the film if the rest of it were a dog. But it's not.  The piano music is stunningly brilliant. Except for three snippets shot at the dock, this entire movie is set on board the cruise ship \\"the Virginian\\". Yes, they do blow up the ship toward the end, with \\"six tons of dynamite\\". But there is so much more reason to see this movie!  Okay, maybe the actors aren't your big name over-paid familiar type people. The cast perform outstandingly, without a single instance of \\"bad actor\\" distraction! The roles are believably portrayed with the depth of character that might prove too challenging for the Mel Gibson sort of Hollywood actor. The sets weren't cheap, either. Only detectable reason for the \\"R\\" rating is the occasional use of the \\"F-word\\", when a \\"screw it\\" would have sufficed.  Too bad, really, because this is otherwise a great PG movie the whole family would enjoy. No nude scenes (but I liked it anyway!) Tech Note: DVD does not offer \\"English captions for the hearing impaired.\\" You will watch this (at least parts of it) over and over again.  The sound track is well worth a second and third listen, too. Five of a possible Five Stars.
B00006EXDM|5.0|This newly remastered version of HOT ROCKS is the best, even better than the vinyl. These songs are timeless classics, and is a must have for any music fan. The ROLLING STONES are awesome and I highly recommend this compilation.  Even if you have the older version of this CD set, you do not want to pass this up because of the superior sound. Get it now!
B000001E18|4.0|Apparently, when they wrote 'The Wanderer' they all agreed it sounded like a Johnny Cash song- so what else was there to do but get the old goat to sing it!  Very fine it is aswell.<br />'Zooropa' and 'Pop' made me a U2 fan.  They encompass everything that a band of their 'profile' should be aiming for: trying to mess with their audience as much, and as often as possible.  Few bands of their stature have really tried it and the fact that the sales declined while doing so is a great testamant to a job well done.  'Mofo', 'Mother', 'Lemon': top stuff.<br />Nice one fellows!
B00005RFAI|5.0|i bought this album and loved it. it's weird to like the same music as my kids! then we saw pink live last saturday night at the mandalay bay in las vegas. if you like her music and can get tickets, see her live. pink and her band put on an awesome show- we were blown away. she has more voice than you can beleive. i predict big things from miss pink- this party is just getting started.
B000002B2T|1.0|upon further reflection, this album really stinks. I dont care how many alice in chains fans dis my review, the truth is what i preach. This album is boring. I just find laynes attempt at the softer gentler side as phoney as a 3 dollar bill. It all seemed so much more real with 'jar of flies' and even 'sap'. Here, its contrived and banal. If you want to listen to a seattle offshoot that is half decent, go check out one of the albums by 'brad'. The bright spot on this wreck is mark lanegan. But even he can only help so much on uninspired drivel such as this. The heroin killed laynes talent long before it snuffed out his life.
B00000IMTF|5.0|Fantastic hard rock album. Produced by Martin Birch (or should I say not damaged in any way by Roger Glover the faget). Listen to Stargaser and let it grab you for a while, - this is really the essence of Blackmore's Rainbow!
B000002GYI|5.0|Considering when this was originally released (1981), I can't say enough about this CD; simultaneously kookie, foreboding, prophetic, silicous and ephemeral.  I was 12 when I first heard it back in '81 and I love it as much (if not more) now as then.<br /> If you are a fan of electronica, ala Autechre/Aphex Twin/Boards of Canada/Tarwater, GET THIS CD, TODAY!!!!  ESSENTIAL TO THE KOLLECTION.
B00005YXZH|3.0|Well, I don't believe I have bought a single thing that this site has suggested to me based on my purchases.  But, after getting hit over the head w/ this little jewel over and over as a suggestion, well... I went to the library and borrowed it.  And, sho-nuff its good.  My favorite song is Jesus, etc.  I thought the lyric in the middle was:  &quot;Two, two guitars.&quot;  Come to find out, its not!  All the other songs kind of sound like they were produced by the guy who did Beck's &quot;Mutations&quot; and Radiohead.  Sometime it works, sometimes it don't. <br />I'll admit I'm not at all familiar with this band's previous material (I thought that Uncle Tupelo was boring and amateurish way back when).  From what I have read the leader guy is some kind of jerk to work with.  Well, so was Paul McCartney, but you didn't see George quit did you? (I mean for good).<br />All and all, a nice little pop record.  Its the hummable melodies that will have you coming back for seconds, and thirds.  Well, I guess that's all I have to say.  I am now going out to buy this CD USED.  Given the number of upset reviewers it shouldn't be too hard to find to find a copy!<br />Good luck in 2003 Mr. Wilco!
B00006FXB6|4.0|Next to the other two qotsa releases, Queens of the Stone Age and Rated R, Songs For The Deaf is a strong album, but not their best.  Compared to Rated R, S.F.T.D., has the same mixture of hard rock riffs, mellow vocals and ear pounding rock that makes the band unique and awesome. Although the songs lack new and interesting musicianship, they still remain up to their potential. i do reccomend this album, although you should definately buy the others first.
0553579908|5.0|Just a quick note to add my voice to the chorus.  So far this entire series is wonderful.  It is well written and action packed with many surprises along the way.  Enjoy.
0060090367|2.0|I bought this book based on the glowing reviews I saw on Amazon. I expected a wildly funny book.  I don't get it.  I thought the book was slighly humorous but mostly very dull.  I finished it because I try to always finish the books I start, but it was really not very good.  It is written first person with conversations with the heroine's subconscious.  Some aspects were cute.  But the characters were just weird and the overall story was not very good.  It was a let down after the reviews.  After reading Watermelon I would certainly not read any other books by Marian Keyes.
B0000047EC|5.0|We jazz fans all over the globe know all the faces that Pat pulled out from his \\"magical bag\\" in the past years. Pat is known for having:<br /> 1)a straight jazz activity; collaborations with M. Brecker, O. Coleman, G. Burton and... you name it!<br /> 2)a \\"quite rock\\" occasional side; Joni Mitchell and possible others along the way<br /> 3)a more commercial, popular, but not to be overlooked at all, activity/production with the Pat Metheny group<br /> 4)a kind of \\"world music\\" side: \\"Secret story\\" tells everything already but listen to \\"A map of the world\\" soundtrack<br /> 5)an \\"experimental\\" side: \\"Zero tolerance for silence\\" reached my personal quite high tolerance threshold within seconds!...<br /> Now we can also add the<br /> 6) \\"Intimate-romantic-acoustic-melodic\\"  with this experiment in a duo with Bass-Master Charlie Haden. Obviously it might be mistaken as \\"bedtime music\\", at first, but once you realize the amount of concentration, the tight interplay between the two, the overall quality and (more important) once you're in the mood for this album, it will unfold, will open your heart and will stay there for quite awhile. If today you feel active, nervous, somehow \\"on the beat\\", please leave it on the shelf and get any other good mainstream jazz or crossover, techno, fusion music: you know what you like better than me! Spare this one, instead, for a quiet evening, maybe on a Sunday in which you just want to feel relaxed and cradled by superb music. No action DVDs, big orchestras or super expensive productions: just these two guys playing togheter and enjoying while creating an incredible piece of beautiful art. A MASTERPIECE. Don't miss it.

B000059H99|5.0|Rocky is a beautifully written script about a man who has nothing and gets the chance of a lifetime.  The beauty of this movie is it's not about winning.  Rocky just wants to proove to himself that he is not a bum.  The Quintisential line of the movie is when Rocky after not being able to sleep walks down to the Spectrum where the promoter essentially tells him that this is a show and it's not about him, and he realizes he can't win.  When he comes back to his apartment he tells Adrian that he can't win, but \\"no one has ever gone the distance with the champ. I want to go the distance, cause at the end of the fight when I hear that bell and I am still standing, I will know for the first time in my life, that I wasn't just another bum from the street.\\"  If that line doesn't get you fired up to see this movie, nothing will.  I recomend this movie to everyone, not just sports fans.
0061020680|5.0|My favorite Terry Pratchett books are always the ones that feature Death, and the fact that he is one of the main caracters makes this book all the more interesting.  I love the way it was written and how everything was detailed, it was not as funny as some of his other books but still, I think, the best of what I have read.   This is one of the earilier novels and so it is one of the best, once Death gets divided into a Death for each seperate creature everything changes.
0783229011|5.0|It seems like a silly idea, doesn't it?  A pig who can talk.  Oh, wait, isn't that sort of like &quot;Charolette's Web&quot;.  Aside from the talking animals this computer and live action film is quite different.  I was pleased by the complexities of the characters and surprised at how well the human actors interacted with digitally enhanced animal actors.  No really scary moments so little should be able to enjoy this too.
B00006AFUR|4.0|Space rock is a small, but growing genre of music that I am highly interested in and tend to like more than one person should.  Then, I hear about 30 Seconds to Mars, I don't give them much thought until I hear a great actor by the name of Jared Leto is their lead singer.  So, I give them a shot and download their single, not expecting much...and I was blown away.  This CD would be classified by I as \\"Space Rock\\" only because of the topics and the atmosphere it tends to create.  (Just imagine a rock concert in space.)  But 30 Seconds to Mars is a little different.  They have a cleaner sound, due to the being on a big label such as immortal, and that they have a lot of synthesizer influence in their music.  Normally, I don't find myself too interested in synth-rock, but this band is a little different, and a little better.  They blend, and do a fine job at it, smooth melodic rock with percussion section that is highly dependent on a synth.  But it doesn't necessarily take over the song, or ruin a song like most bands tend to have happen to them.  It intensifies the atmosphere of the song, and pushes it hard, giving it more feel.  Not to mention, Leto has a great voice.  If you're looking for a good CD, that lacks filler and brings you to places where normal music doesn't usually take you (think space, now), then 30 Seconds to Mars is the change you're looking for in today's mainstream rock.
0792839129|4.0|I remember this movie from when I was still a child.  It has some scary and sad moments, if you have a phobia of water or darkness that could be a problem at times.  But overall it is just a fun story about an inventor and his family exploring other worlds so they can better appreciate their own.  Yup, it has a message but the message is mixed with music and fantasy.  Not as good as Mary Poppins or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory however.

6303122647|5.0|It is very rare for me to watch a movie more than once.  Our video collection isn't what I would call very large because of this attitude.  Once again this is a movie my husband adored and so I gave it to him as a gift.  Turns out that I really like the movie too and we usually once it once a year either around Christmas or Halloween.  The songs get into you head and you find youself singing them for days afterwards.  Even though it is animated, I wouldn't let small children watch this, sort the same guidelines I'd use for original &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; movie with Judy Garland.  For teens and adults it is great fun but small kids might be scared by the antics.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|After reading the autobiography of John Nash, I discovered that there is so much more to his life that was left out of the movie. In the movie, they someone touched on the fact that he was homosexual, however, the book went through about 4 or 5 relationships he had with men prior to marrying Alicia. He also had an affair with an older woman and had an illegitamate son with her whom he did not acknowledge until his mother insisted he pay child support some years later. <BR>The movie, on an upper note, was supurbly done and Ron Howard should get much recognition!
B00006FXB6|5.0|I love this record. The first problem for me was that it's not quite 'instant'. It's very dense, it's heavily produced, the lyrics are disorientating and, disturbing sometimes, and the odd mexican influences make it quite an uncomfortble listen first time round. <BR>However, like most great records it unwinds itself to become a masterpiece, the songs slowly 'jump out' at you one by one until they've all pretty much become classics.<BR>Just briefly my highlights are 'first it giveth' (for the most awesome, fat chorus you've ever heard! 'Go with the flow' for just being an incredible uplifting groove, and 'gonna leave you' for being so unlike QOTSA yet so perfect for QOTSA. <BR>My only criticism is I would love to have seen a new 'in the fade' style song, simply because that was the most different QOTSA have ever strayed from their style but it was truely a magical, original rock song. <BR>Still an incredible album, give it a week and you'll love it.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I have been a Fan of Q.O.T.S.A. since their inception.  I first fell in love with Their first band Kyuss when I saw them open up for Faith No More in January of 1993.  As a fan, you may think that I am bias and would say that this album was good even if it were [bad].  After listening to the album consistently fora while, and I would say that this is just as good, if not better than their last album (the classic \\"R\\").<br />Usually I get sick of listening to the same album over and over again, but this is not the case for \\"Songs for the Deaf\\".  The reason I get sick of these albums that I listen to over and over again is because after a while all the songs begin to sound the same.  There is such a broad mix of styles that I have continued to stay interested in the album (the same was true with \\"R\\").<br />If you like all types of rock music (you cannot label QOTSA as any one type of music other than a broad \\"Rock and Roll\\") you will not be disappointed with this album.  Don't buy this record just because of Dave Grohl, buy it because it is just a great album!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|A modern classic indeed. When the record was finally released and I listened it left me mesmerized. If you focus on the technical side it's quite alright but the melodies are just outstanding. Politik, In my place, God put a smile..., The Scientist, Clocks, Daylight, A whisper...their melodies just couldn't get off of my head.<br />     One thing I've noticed is that this album has darker melodies than its predecessor like Daylight &amp; a whisper. Still you can see a lighter side in them unlike Radiohead's last 2 albums. With all due respect to Radiohead I know they're doing their best to push forward like what the Beatles did on their heyday. But, let's be frank, Radiohead is just pushing further to the dark side. I just pray that Coldplay would try to minimize exploring the way Radiohead's experimenting with their music.<br />     The song that hit me at my first listen was God put a smile upon your face. Great melody and song structure. But in the end almost every song are equal in beauty. I'm a Christian but I still listen to some secular music. I just pray that someday a Christian band like Coldplay will emerge and would mesmerize both Christians and the world. <br />     The cover art is really very simple yet quite inticing to the eyes. It reminds me of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures cover art.<br />     If you buy this record, try to listen to it again and again and I assure you it will become more and more beautiful and that you would agree and live up to my title for this review for this album as &quot;a simple-melodic-majestic-beautiful-modern-classic record.&quot; Does it deserve grammys, brit awards and other music awards??? YES IS THE ULTIMATLEY OBVIOUS ANSWER.
B000021YQV|1.0|Some things in life just rub you the wrong way.  Like System of a Down.  Massively popular as well as a critical darling (rare for a nu metal group), Toxicity was considered one of the better albums of last year.  Released on 9/11 (ironic given the band's politics are just a tad left of center), it was seen as both prophetic and mournful, an album soaked with political rage and musical \\"disorder,\\" as the title track aptly puts it.  <br />But even with all those accolades and signs of musical substance, it's hard to see Toxicity as anything other than a grating, awful album.  System ditches any sense of melody for bug chunks of operatic riffage that shift at any given moment.  Transitions are non-existent in order to unsettle the listener.  But rather than disturbing you, the album generally irritates you to death.  Lead singer Serj Tankian doesn't help.  He's either playing the dramatic tenor, or barking at you in rough staccato beats that make your eardrums beg for mercy (and not in a good way).  Are System's politics original?  Kind of, but like any other nu metal band, when you put angry lyrics and angrier music together haphazardly, the results are boring or, in this case, profoundly agitating.  Unlike their closest relatives, Rage Against the Machine, System seems more obsessed with the components of their songs than with the songs as a whole.  The result are songs like \\"Aerials.\\"  If you've heard it (and given that it's played on radio every five seconds, you probably have), you'll notice how hard System tries to make the song overly, ridiculously dramatic.  From the rhythm section (which could be mistaken for your local construction project), to the guitars (POWER! POWER! POWER!), to the vocals (\\"Look at my range!\\"), everything on the album is so far overdone that it can't even be considered humorous.  Other songs like the title track, \\"Chop Suey!\\" and \\"Psycho,\\" so clearly try to unsettle you, but are more likely to have you diving for the Stop button.  There's no melody to be found here.  No hooks.  And worst of all, no ideas.  This is a band that takes itself far too seriously, and here is the tangible result.  It's the most overhyped album in a long time, and easily 2001's worst.
B00006AW2E|3.0|While the US has long had an album entitled \\"Out Of Our Heads,\\" this marks the first legit US CD appearance of the UK version of the album (complete with Andrew Loog Oldham's portentous hipspeak liner notes, which inform us, among other things, that \\"in this world where minds have overtaken reason/and thought is potential treason/the only message about this new ellpee/is let's all live to enjoy it\\").<br />This isn't the best early Stones album--it lacks the raw R & B of their earlier records and instead replaces it with covers of then-recent soul hits and a handful of original songs, and Mick Jagger certainly wasn't yet up to the task of equalling the likes of Marvin Gaye.  Still, there are some excellent cuts here, including \\"Heart Of Stone\\" (the best of Mick and Keith's early songs), \\"I'm Free,\\" \\"Cry To Me\\" (in which Mick actually manages a little gospel hollering), and their version of Larry Williams' \\"She Said Yeah,\\" one of their best opening tracks ever--a one-and-a-half-minute blast of proto metal.  And if nothing else, you can note that Lou Reed outright stole the beginning of the Stones' limp arrangement of Gaye's \\"Hitch Hike\\" and used it in his (much better) song, \\"There She Goes Again,\\" on the first Velvet Underground album.  (The Stones themselves reused Charlie's drumroll at the beginning of \\"Good Times\\" on \\"What To Do,\\" an insignificant track from the UK \\"Aftermath.\\")<br />Finally, this being one of ABKCO's much-hyped SACD reissues, one would expect a huge improvement in sound quality (as \\"Big Hits\\" or \\"Aftermath\\" often show), but this disc simply doesn't sound that much better on a conventional CD player than the older discs--only \\"She Said Yeah\\" and \\"Heart Of Stone\\" show much of an improvement--and someone should point out to their packaging guru that it isn't kosher to label a CD \\"Stereo\\" when it is, in fact, presented in mono from start to finish.  I'm also not wild about paying full price for a CD that's a mere 29:35 long.  Still, the disc is worththe investment for any serious Stones fan, if only because the track sequencing makes a lot more sense on this version of the album--and then there's \\"She Said Yeah.\\"

0140186409|4.0|Overall, this book was fantastic. It was interesting with lots of backround information, and showed how people struggle in life, and even though I am only eleven, I know struggling is something even our modern generation can relate to.  My only complaint is that for the first one or two hundred pages it was very slow, and practically nothing happened. I put the book down for nearly a month before I felt like reading it again. Although when I did finish reading it it was very good, even if the ending was abrupt (that always makes me so annoyed!).
B00006FXB6|5.0|I bought this CD the first day it came out and it blows my mind.<br />Ive been a huge QOTSA fan since I first saw them open for WEEN<br />a couple years back. Then at Coachella they continued to draw me in with songs like &quot;Song for the Dead&quot; and &quot;No one Knows&quot;.<br />This is a definite must buy for those of you who are sick of<br />&quot;Clone Radio&quot;! BUY IT MOTHER F$$KER!
0316666343|5.0|I found this book to pull at my emotions on many levels.  Ms. Sebold's writing of Susie's heaven was so different.  She developed each of her characters extremely well and made the reader feel as though you knew them.  A terrific book.
6300214044|5.0|I first saw this movie because I have above-ametuer knowledge of Proteus Syndrome, which is what Mr. Merrick most likely suffered from. I saw the movie for the first time recently, and I expected to see just an ordinary movie. What I did see was by far, the most soul-touching movie I had ever seen. The plot of the story is that Dr. Frederick Treves views a man beyond deformity, and takes him into his hospital to further inquire about his case. As the story progresses, people begin to see that Mr. John Merrick is truly an intelligent and humble man. He does run into some bad times, but you'll have to see that for yourself. At the end of the movie, (not telling you what happens) I just cried. I must not have cried that much since I was a child. It was pure emotion coming from my most inner soul. When a movie is powerful enough to make you feel some pure emotion at the end that you have never felt before in your life, it isn't a movie, it's a masterpiece. So please, even if this type of movie doesn't appeal to you, see it. This is a masterpiece for all people to see and accept the message that we need to treat everyone equally and be grateful for who we are in soul, not in body.

B000002VRZ|5.0|BEST OF THE OUTLAWS: GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES is the ultimate anthology on the greatest band ever, and the best place to hear the Outlaws' special blend of sweet country harmonies and jam-powered Southern rock. Sure, I like many other hard rock, classic rock, adult alternative, Southern rock, jam, Heartland rock, and power pop artists, but the Outlaws take the pizza for being the best. All of the songs here, from &#34;There Goes Another Love Song&#34;, &#34;Song For You&#34;, and &#34;Green Grass And High Tides&#34;, to &#34;Gunsmoke&#34; and &#34;Ghost Riders In The Sky&#34;, are major guitar showcases for the band, and there are so many musical details here that it takes years of listening to pick up even half of what's going on musically here; in fact, some people may never pick up absolutely every detail in this rich music. Moreover, the remastering is warm, crisp, and thick, especially for 1996.  It's obvious that reviewer Roni Sarig doesn't have the ability to appreciate good musicianship when he/she hears it, and his/her negative review of this exemplary CD/cassette is a clear argument as to why I'm opposed to a federal journalist shield law, which would, in my view, allow any Generation X/Y/Z person who wasn't actually alive during the Outlaws' heyday to insult this great band while praising their favorite post-1990 poseurs as &#34;uniquely original, totally mind-blowing.&#34; People also don't realize that, except for a few songs, the Outlaws, unlike some other Southern rock bands, who did a lot of cover songs, actually wrote almost all of their own material.<br /><br />As to why the Outlaws didn't have the hits that Lynyrd Skynyrd or .38 Special did on Top 40 radio, that's a hard question to answer. Part of it may be that they were a bit too eclectic and talented for their own commercial good, blending sweet vocal harmonies with true-grit Southern rock, thus creating a unique, original sound that was too complex musically for AM radio. The other part is that, rather than attempting to write commercial, pop-oriented songs, they instead concentrated on simply making great music, picking up influences from blues to country to bluegrass to folk and classical, writing love songs with real feelings and no cliches, and adding numerous layers of slash-and-burn guitars to the mix. Moreover, their hawkish, tough-on-crime attitude was too much for teen-oriented radio stations. However, there is some consolation to be found in their popularity on FM &#34;album rock&#34; radio.<br /><br />As far as chronology is concerned, The Outlaws came between early Southern rockers such as the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd and Southern roots-rockers like Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, drawing inspiration from the former and somewhat influencing the latter. Their vocal harmonies are influenced by CSN (&Y), although a bit more down-to-earth and less ethereal. I am a somewhat guarded fan of the California country-rock bands, as their soft-on-crime stance has often caused them to be a bit soft around the edges, but these guys and other tough-on-crime country-rockers know how to please the ears without getting sappy, or writing paeans to picking up as many women as possible, something that's very hard to do. If you've found Natalie Merchant to be pushy and annoying, but can't stand Hank Williams, Jr.'s ultra-right-wing jingoism, the Outlaws are the perfect middle ground.<br /><br />The guitar sounds on this CD are just amazing. Besides stock country and rock influences including James Burton, Harvey Mandel, Jerry Reed, Dickey Betts, and Amos Garrett, there is also a strong bluegrass influence in much of the lead guitar work on this CD/cassette. Thus, for the rock guitarist looking to add bluegrass to his/her palette of influences, BEST OF THE OUTLAWS: GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES is absolutely essential listening material.<br /><br />Moreover, the Outlaws' fusion of Byrds/Buffalo Springfield/Eagles-influenced vocal harmonies with an Allman Brothers Band-style has been cited as an influence on the 90s &#34;jam band&#34; and alt-country sounds and styles, which, along with grunge, killed off the &#34;hair band&#34; rock scene, as well as the &#34;new&#34; Southern rockers who've been playing since the early 90s. Anyone who enjoys Phish, the Bottle Rockets, the Dave Matthews Band, Copperhead, Uncle Tupelo, Big Head Todd & The Monsters, Delta Moon, Old Union, Preacher Stone, Widespread Panic, Michelle Malone, and/or Indigenous MUST check out the Outlaws.<br /><br />Besides the outstanding musicianship and vocal harmonies, the Outlaws were, and are, a band of high moral integrity. They support the ideals of justice for both the innocent and the guilty. Past and present members' hawkish attitudes towards countries which unjustly imprison innocent visitors on trumped-up charges; support for for victims of horrific crimes in their quest for justice; advocacies of capital punishment for aggravated kidnapping and committing sadistic acts, police use of deadly force to rescue two girls kidnapped in California in 2002 (as well as praising the courage of both girls in defending themselves and the bravery of the police who rescued them), increased funding for law enforcement, high school community-service requirements, the right under the Constitution to use idiosyncratic speech and writing patterns, laws requiring that people who save the lives/health of others be justly rewarded for it, and major federal crackdowns on polygamy, as well as their belief that parents who make their children or stepchildren servants in their own homes should be sent to prison for life for child abuse, their lifelong position that shaming people about their appearance is a form of &#34;fighting words&#34; that's not protected under the Constitution, and their opposition to parents placing their kids in psychiatric centers simply for expressing their emotions make this or any other Outlaws CD/cassette an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|\\"Memento\\" is one of my favorite \\"hidden gems\\" of 2001, and similar to movies like \\"Fight Club\\", \\"The Usual Suspects\\", and \\"Dark City\\", it stands out as one of the most unique.<br />Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on a mission to find and punish those responsible for the murder of his wife. The problem is that after the murder, he is shocked into a state of short-term amnesia, meaning that his memory is very short term. He meets people, does things, and has encounters that he forgets almost minutes later. To counteract this condition, he covers his body in tatoos, notes, and carries a file full of information that he cannot afford to forget. Who are his friends? His enemies? It is a struggle to make that distinction.<br />What is most interesting about \\"Memento\\" is the style in which it was filmed. Rather than starting from the beginning and moving to the end, \\"Memento\\" is shown in reverse. The movie starts at the ending, and moves backwards to show how things got to this point. The experience one gets from watching \\"Memento\\" is similar to what Shelby experiences in the movie. A surreal trip, which leaves you dumbfounded at the end.<br />The acting in \\"Memento\\" is first rate. Guy Pearce is a very reliable and versatile actor, and this is his best role since \\"LA Confidential\\". Support comes from two very talented actors, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss (both of \\"The Matrix\\"). Joe Pantoliano, oddly enough, further pushes his trademark. I won't spoil what it is (it would kill the plot), but think of what happens to him in the end of \\"Memento\\", and rent his other movies and see how they end up for him.  Where the movie really stands out is the direction, which is a fresh approach on a very old concept (one man's revenge caper).<br />A lot of my friends didn't like \\"Memento\\", most likely for the reasons listed above. They were confused, and didn't like the way the movie repeated itself (remember, it moves backwards). True, you must pay attention while watching, otherwise you will get lost. But I encourage you to watch \\"Memento\\" with an open mind, it is a very rewarding experience.ching, otherwise you will get lost.

B0000640VO|5.0|This is one delightful film. And it is delightful for a number of reasons. The leading characters have considerable charm. The plot is pleasing, satisfying, and even cute. The film provides a lovely view of Paris (particularly Montmartre). The color is a sensual treat. The cinematography is audacious. But ooh, the color!<br />The film is a worthy successor to some of the surrealistic films of the French tradition. At one at the same time it is an adventure in realism and a peregrination through the dream state.<br />The subtitles do not get in the way of the film. They're carefully done.<br />AND.....the film depicts one of my own favorite themes in film...healing. Thanks to Amelie's impish plots, broken people get better, and happiness comes closer for all.<br />In just about every respect, this is a must see film!
0515127485|1.0|Someone told me this book was the greatest novel on  Communist Russia so I thought I'd give it a go. From the first time I saw the book (with it's title standing out on the cover), I realised this was nothing more than a book to read on an airplane. Boy, was I wrong! It doesn't even make a good airplane read! I mean, the story is very well researched, but the main character, Fluke Kelso, is made to look like James Bond, and the situations he faces are even more improbable and involuntarily funny than the ones Mr. Bond has to put up with. When I finished this book, I left it on the plane and erased my name from it.
B000068TP0|5.0|When you think of a good live musical performer, you will probably think of some of the greats within the past 100 years, names like Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra, and Madonna usually come to mind, but a new name should be added to this mix of musical icons. Shakira, the up and coming artist in the U.S. who has already staked her claim as one of the greatest latin artist of our time in the Latin American market, mentioned among other staple latin artists such as Celia Cruz, Gloria Estefan, and Julio Iglesias. This performance is just a taste of what an amazing performer she is.Unlike other artist who cannot seem to grasp the meaning of a true musical performance, Shakira has the ability to transform her music into not only a performance but an experience in and of it self, using not only her voice but also her body language to make a simple song into a story. A story of love, a story of joy, a story of struggle, a story of many emotions all mixed together. This particular performance was recorded in New York in late august of 1999 almost 2 years before Shakira's long anticipated English release laundry service. This shows how long she has been in the business and she is not about to let up, conquering the latin scene, she hopes to conquer the U.S. with her same formula, of lyrics true to herself, a touch of sex appeal, and performances that can only be described in one word...\\"Shakira\\"
B00003BDXG|1.0|Stone must be still laughing about all the fuss this \\"movie\\" generated. Why? Because this is lame. He swindled us all. Disguising all the badness of this movie as \\"director´s use of new angles, new filters, or whatever\\", he made of the worst films ever, with bad and over the top acting by everyone involved, with disgusting characters. <br />And all that for what? To make a point that midia and people love violence? Come on, he did not achieved that. The movie is just a gore feast, a disguised B-movie, and I´ll tell you what: he lost a fan here, because I´ve never watched another movie by him again after this turkey.<br />I say: This movie is pointless, absurd, generic, ultra-violent. One simply can not have the arrogance to say that he used violence of this level in a movie, to say that he is against violence!! Stone used it because he liked it, because all he wanted to do was shock the audience. Simply as that.

B00001OH7P|4.0|This, as far as I'm concerned, is thE highlight of David Bowie's career.<br />While the 'concept' behind ZIGGY STARDUST is rather mundane--a rock star acts rock starrish--Bowie's willingness to experiment with form and Mick Ronson's fantastic guitar work turn what is essentially a group of overly wordy poems into an iconic piece of Rock.<br />It's a slow start, though.  \\"Five Years\\" muddles along for nearly five minutes with no real point and \\"Soul Love\\" never makes it's point either.  \\"Moonage Dream\\" hits it's target from the get go (anyone who was lucky enough to see the Ziggy tour, or who has seen the Ziggy Stardust documentary knows what a powerful tune this was live).  Ronson's guitar solo is incredible.  And \\"Starman\\" is an absolute classic, a perfect piece of real 1970's Rock and, for my money, lightyears ahead of it's thematic sister song, the done-to-death \\"Space Oddity.\\"<br />The band kicks it up a step on \\"Star,\\" \\"Hang On To Yourself,\\" \\"Ziggy Startdust\\" and the killer hit \\"Suffragette City,\\" one of the hottest guitar tunes to ever ride the American charts.  Ronson is on fire for the second half of the LP, and thank god Bowie was smart enough to step out of the way and let Ronson go wild.  Between those hot rythm guitar parts, Ronson's wild lead, and the best horn section this side of the Beatle's \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" \\"Suffragette City\\" sounds like your highschool marching band jamming with Alice Cooper.<br />ZIGGY STARDUST also sports one of the greatest covers in Rock history; seeing it shrunk down to a 3x3 CD cover makes me wish LPs had never been supplanted by digital technology.

He tries to avoid contact with the other prisoners, which is next to impossible, and this leads to friction between Luke and Dragline (George Kennedy), the inmate leader.  The two end up in a fight where Luke refuses to give up and earns the respect of the other inmates for his toughness. However, behind this toughness there is also a very compassionate person who can sing and cheer up others when things are harsh.  One day Luke finds out that his mother has died and he suffers immensely from the close loss of his dear mom.  Could this be the turning point of Luke's toughness? Cool Hand Luke is a brilliant film experience with some very interesting shots and lines.
630305904X|5.0|Whether it was a mystical experience to watch because it pulled me out of the boredom of a dreary Sunday morning when it appeared on IFC, or whether it really is one of the most fascinating and hauntingly photographed films ever made...well, the jury is still out, and in fact it's probably both reasons. But I quickly obtained my own copy and have waited to watch it again because I so badly want to share this movie with someone. But it's a rare breed that will appreciate the story of a man who over time turns into a woman---a human being who tells a story of pain and obsession, heartache, war, and finally fulfillment in the truest love possible, across five centuries of different lives/same soul. A beautiful and artful rendition of the novel. I can't wait to unwrap mine one day and share it with the right friend... Could become an underground intellegentsia cult classic. (If it hasn't already and I'm really out of the loop.)

The writing is amazing the story goes a little something like this...  On the desert planet of Tatooine a young boy named Luke Skywalker is living with his Aunt and Uncle.  I don't want to give the movie a way so I guess I shouldn't tell you much of the story, that's just enough.  Lucas is a genuis, well a genuis at writing.  It is one of the coolest movies of all time.<br />  Next is the Empire strikes back, some say the best of the series.  that is a really good movie.  It is deeper and Darker than the original.  Luke is older,and the movie is scarier.  It begins on the swoy planet of Hoth on that famous battle called the battle of Hoth.  The special effects and writing are even better than the first, and tha's pretty hard to beat.  It is a wonderful movie.  Better than the first.  <br />  And lastly(my personal favorite of the series) Return of the Jedi.  This is a moving wonderul movie.  The special effects are better than ever in this one.  <br />  Well to make a long story short the SW series is the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy film ever to hit the market.
6303921248|5.0|Whether you have read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" before seeing this adaptation, or have been inspired to do so after viewing it, I am certain that in either case your appreciation for the skillful transference of this priceless tale from literature to screen, will only continue to deepen until you are completely consumed by pure delight and admiration! It as if the roles of Darcy and Elizabeth were specifically written for Colin Firth, and Jennifer Ehle respectively, or perhaps, the two were born for the roles! The only way to describe their chemistry is: MAGNETIC (with all that word entails)! Sometimes negative, being utterly repulsed by each other, and other times positive, being helplessly drawn to each other. As in the book, it is an emotional roller coaster with plenty of turns, curves and loops, and it is well worth the ride! Even the roles of sarcastic, if not indifferent Mr. Bennet, anxious, high-strung, and emotional Mrs. Bennet, kind-natured Jane, serious, pensive Mary, insecure Catherine (Kitty), and mischievous, wild Lydia, as well as the other contributing characters, were superbly casted. Once you have seen this movie, you will forever associate the faces and actions of these actors and actresses with that of the characters in the book! Even if you are one of those ultra-busy people who cannot find the time to read the book, please, spend a few hours to view this movie, which is equally as charming and memorable!<br />No one will ever surpass Colin Firth's exquisite portrayal of the arrogant, self-absorbed, and most prideful Mr. Darcy, who slowly but surely becomes enamored with the quick-witted, self-assured, and opinionated Elizabeth Bennet (flawlessly played by Jennifer Ehle), to his, and her surprise! No where is it more evident than in this tale that, the heart is truly unpredictable, for on his first introduction to Elizabeth, her family and her society, Darcy was most unpleased, even disgusted! How far beneath him they were (or so he thought)! However, contrary to the popular belief that 'first impressions are lasting' if not permanent, both Darcy and Lizzy soon learn that such can be overcome, though not too easily. In time, he could not fight his feelings (which he felt were out of character for him), that is, the attraction he had to Elizabeth, who herself was judgmental of him because of, among other reasons, his initial insulting opinion of her (on being encouraged by his friend Bingley to dance with her at a ball, he said she was \\"tolerable, but not pretty enough to tempt\\" him!)! On top of this, she received a very negative report about him from a childhood acquaintance of his, Mr. Wickham, which heightened her dislike of him. Yet, she too, on learning more of his character, and Wickham's, began to find him more attractive, and less \\"disagreeable\\" and \\"insupportable\\"! But, could she love him??? Could he love her???<br />This tale is a perfect example of the old saying \\"opposites attract\\", but though they were a seemingly contrary couple, in reality, they were not so different. They both needed to overcome obstacles to their love: PRIDE and PREJUDICE, which both displayed equally in their different ways. The bottom line is this: you will never find a more beautifully casted, acted, and directed adaptation of this priceless, timeless tale written by the grand Ms. Austen! From the beautiful English hillsides, to the costumes, it transports you back to the English Victorian era. Certainly it is worth buying and viewing over and over. Each time you view it there is something more to be seen, enjoyed, and appreciated until you find yourself memorizing the dialogue (Or at least I do)! And so, bravo! to Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle, the supporting cast, and A&E/BBC for this unbelievably inspiring portrayal, of an unbelivably beautiful story! And bravo! to you, if you purchase it for your collection! It is indeed one of the best movies I have ever seen!!! :-) I am sure you will agree!!!
6303965415|4.0|will motivate those who have not experienced it in literary form, to do so, and that is precisely what this movie will do to most who view it! Honestly, I have just ordered \\"Persuasion\\" in book form from this very site because of seeing this movie. And even if you are not so inclined, you will definitely be entertained, if not touched by the long-suffering of the two characters portrayed.<br />I truly adore Ciaran Hinds, who is one of the best actors around, especially when placed smack-dab in the middle of a romantic period piece! He is what some guys would call a \\"man's man\\", with just the right amount of strength and tenderness to make you love him just as much as Anne! Speaking of Anne, initially I was not impressed with Amanda Root in the role of Anne, but, I soon gave in to simply adoring her also. She played a very patient, long-suffering young woman, and her sweet, mild-temper really grows on you. <br />Even if you find parts of the movie dull (as I did truthfully) the storyline is truly one of the most touching you will ever know, and so allows you to almost completely forget about the less than intriguing parts. It answers so beautifully the often-asked question: 'can true love stand the test of time?' with an affirmative 'most definitely!' Ah, indeed true love can withstand miles, and years, and even the skepticism of on-lookers! Cpt. Wentworth and Anne are two very endearing fictional characters, and the movie itself is just as sweet and charming as they are! How wonderful to see those worthy of a second chance, receive it! I am sure that I will get just as much, if not more pleasure from reading the book. \\"Persuasion\\" is an essential addition to any Jane Austen admirer's collection... and certainly is a jewel in mine! I would recommend anyone to purchase! Enjoy! :-)
B00005OM4Q|5.0|There's little I can say that hasn't already been said by multiple reviewers.<br /> Almost Famous is now one of my all time favourite film's.  Cameron Crowe's screenplay is a beautiful thing.  Very funny and deeply moving.<br />Billy Crudup, Patrick Fugit, Frances McDormand, Jason Lee, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Kate Hudson are all terrific.<br />How Crowe could follow this up with the terrible Vanilla Sky is still one of the biggest mysteries of modern cinema.
B00003CXWV|4.0|\\"Blow\\" is neither the most innovative or well made movie about a the ups and downs of being a drug lord, but it succeeds as a docudrama about a drug dealer who's short lived success hardly made up for all the wrong choices he made. Johnny Depp, as usual, has the art of character acting down to a fine art.<br />Depp plays George Jung, an ambitious kid who became a drug czar in America in the 1970's and 1980's. He came from a working class background where his father (Ray Liotta) worked like a slave to support the family. The catalyst was when his father filed for bankruptcy, and there Geroge vowed never to live in poverty. He moved to California, made connections, including a flamboyant hairdresser (Paul Reubens, in a standout role), and started the drug trend in America that \\"exploded like an atomic bomb\\". The movie has it's share of ups and downs, and George learns that maybe drug dealing isn't a wise career choice. He only learns this through a series of betrayls and blunders.<br />\\"Blow\\" is directed in a retro style similar to that of \\"Boogie Nights\\". The wild music, the over-the-top acting and characterization, and the stylish dialogue. While heavily dramatized, \\"Blow\\" is based on a true story, and according to the real Geroge Jung, was pretty accurate. Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz both excell themselves in their excellent performances. Ted Demme, who died after \\"Blow\\" was released, did an excellent job. He was definitely a rising star in the Director's Guild.<br />The Infinifilm DVD package is a must own. The entertaining movie aside, it is crammed with extra features which are just as entertaining as the film. It has the usual featurettes, plus the examination of the story behind the movie. It shows the real George Jung, and the director's commentary is very insightful. In short, \\"Blow\\" is a fun and wild movie worth repeated viewings.
037540872X|5.0|I read the library's version - then went out and bought this for my own library.  I even bought a copy for my grandson, a teen, for his book report this year.  It is a clean book with a lot of good messages about life, love and death.  Vintage Sparks. It's in a class by itself. Don't judge the book by the movie, which I felt was an injustice to the writing of the book.<br /><br />The story is told by a 57 yr old man about the year he was a senior in high school in 1958, and about his little town in North Carolina where he grew up.  Nicholas Sparks is hilarious in his dialogue of the kids and how they tease, sit around the cemetery and tell jokes, etc.  You will laugh along with them, but it has a lot of insight as you see the main character, Landon, grow from a boy into a man as he befriends the preachers daughter, who his buddies all make fun of.  He feels sorry for her at first, then comes to care for her a great deal.  I can see my grandson in this role, as he has a big heart and always sees the goodness in someone, even if others don't.  It is a very fast read and one to discuss with your kids when you are done with it...lessons learned about friendships and loyalties, written in an interesting and insightful Sparks way.
B000001FTA|3.0|Well, I had never heard this talk about Thin Lizzy even having a remote resemblance to The Boss! (Springsteen). And I love both artists!!<br />Bad Reputation is not their best. All guitars are played by Gorham, since Robertson was abesent due to illness.<br />Not all the songs are fantastic, but there´s enough material here to remind us of the amazing quality guys like Lynott and Gorham and Downey had at those times, releasing a new album every single year, and most of those albums were better than anything mos of today´s bands release!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Without a doubt, \\"Band of Brothers\\" was a first-class production all the way. I first saw it compliments of a friend who taped it from the HBO telecast and I watched it over three evenings. It was one of the most moving and riviting experiences I have ever had from a television production ... one that truely portrayed the \\"sharp end\\" of war, and its effects on the individuals involved. Full marks to the production crew and cast. This is one series I can highly recommend to anyone with even the slightest interest in the events of World War II.
B000002BMV|5.0|Im not even a great fan opf melodic rock of Journeys type. Im not even a great fan of lead singers with soft tunes in their voices.<BR>BUt Journeys ESCAPE has all of that, and its simply marvellous. It has stood the test of time. It has feeling, rythm, energy, melody, great lyrics, all the the perfect proportion. Its one of those miracles we testimony once ina while in the music industry: a perfect album.
B00004YZT5|5.0|When this recording occured, Poison had acquired a great musician in guitarist Klotzen, their audience was maturing and glam metal was becoming no longer fashionable.<br />Given this and probably wanting to make a recording that would satisfy themselves (ala Ozzy Osbourne in making No More Tears); Native Tongue abandoned all the glam/&quot;bubble gum&quot; aspects that was normally integrated into previous Poison material.<br />As a result, this recording has fantastic songwriting, musicianship and integrity with a capital I.<br />Unlike, the Osbourne cd, Native Tongue did not sell because, like Kiss's The Elder, it was hard to accept such a glam band making such a recording as progressive as this.<br />While not as complex and musically wise; it does contain material the Diamond Head vein.<br />An undiscovered classic at a bargain price.<br />For a Poison Cd it gets a 10/10. For a cd in this heavy rock genre, it gets a 7/10
0446677450|5.0|If you buy own one book on finance, investing, or real estate this should be the one. Robert T. Kiyosaki, Sharon L. Lechter do a wonderful job creating a book that speaks to all of us.  It is a book that helps get yourself in the right frame of mind. I have recommended this book to everyone I know, and the feedback has been fantastic. This book should be required reading not only for adults, but for children as well.
B00005A1PR|5.0|SUPER CD! The songs are very &quot;woman empowering&quot;.
B000002MFE|5.0|I'm was a Brit working in Midland Michigan.  I knew the music channel TV broadcast of &quot;Eric Clapton - Unplugged&quot; was going to be on. After dinner, what else was there to do, I thought -- I then locked my eyes and ears into the broadcast, totally transfixed.  I did and do not think of Eric as the inventor of sliced bread, however I simply didn't breathe again until the broadcast was over.  I watched the publicly demanded repeat.  Then came the long wait for the CD.  The extra wait while sound techies &quot;fixed a few things&quot; was so frustrating.  Finally, I could buy it -- a first edition.  I play it often, and now watch the DVD, which adds back in that oh so important visual aspect.  Seeing Ray Cooper on percussion, looking like an accountant but displaying such musical talent and enthusiasm, the modesty of Eric's accommpanying guitarist Andy Fairweather-Lowe, the other musicians' brilliance, and the backing singers' oneness with the mood of every song.  All that as well as the style, musicianship and the tapping foot of Eric himself.  He took this opportunity to rethink every song to create an acoustic ambience.  He created a milestone, and a standard that everyone else still aspires to.  <BR>Buy the CD for the home and the car.  Get the DVD to feast on an acoustic and visual delight.
B00006AW2S|5.0|...available again after all this years. The album \\"Out of Our Heads\\" was released in 1965 and was the best album by the Stones so far. U.K. versions versus U.S. versions can sometime be confusing. This release, which I consider to be the real version of the album, was the only one available in Sweden, where I was born and where I lived in until I moved to the States in 1998. <BR>It hasn't been available on CD or vinyl (as far as I know) for a very long time. The only version availabe in the 70's or 80's was the \\"U.K. version\\" without Satisfaction and I'm Alright. Finally after 38 years I am able to hear \\"Out Of Our Heads\\" as I first heard it ...and with better sound that my recordplayer with one speaker in the plastic lid could offer. I might get my Rocks Off listening to this album again. Instant hit cover versions of songs like \\"Mercy, Mercy\\" or \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" mingles perfecly with Stones originals like \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Play With Fire\\". This album is a cornerstone in any CD collection.
B00006690G|4.0|Let me just start by saying that I am intelligent enough to know that Eminem isn't a genius, but open-minded enough to not consider him a no-talent shock artist.  Eminem does have some artistic integrity and he has some market savvy too.  So the following review is written by someone who has heard enough music, (hip hop in particular) to not be easily impressed, but not so jaded or reactionary against what is new and popular that I want to pan the album just for the sake of being contrary.<br />The Eminem Show.  Its supposed to be a concept album inspired by the 'reality-based' entertainment culture of recent years.  The title is inspired by the Jim Carrey film 'The Truman Show' in which a man discovers that the  day to day events of his life are being mareketed as entertainment to the masses.  After two wildly popular albums Eminem finds himself under the spotlight, but instead of shrinking or inventing a persona bigger than he is...Eminem has decided to flash the crowd.  Look at me he says...look at yourself too he implies.  But before things get too uncomfortable or too preachy Eminem plies us with his intoxicating wit and verbal dexterity. <br />This is Eminem's most balanced, and most mature work to date. And its a good thing too, because we aren't so impressed with his tongue twisting polysyllabic rhymes anymore that it all sounds clever.  Just like all hip hoppers the voice and the delivery only stay hot for a little while (Ja Rule take note) and so there better be some innovation or substance down the line.  Em keeps it fresh by turning inward and being a little more human instead of the two dimensional rebel without a cause of the past. This time out, Eminem rarely promotes his drug use as a badge of honor.  Maybe he was little more sober in producing this album because it just doesn't have nearly as many boring tracks as his previous albums have had.  Its hard to make a CD that clocks in at 70 minutes engaging throughout, but Em pulls it off for the firsttime.  Sure there are some moments where he re-hashes old material (Drips and Superman come to mind) but the music is still engaging and Eminem's witticism keeps things interesting enough that you are going to at least pay attention, plus no one wants to watch him pick his sores the whole time so Em steps in with some fun bangers that are more traditional 'battle-rap-I-am-the-greatest' products (see Till I Collapse and Say What You Say).  <br />Speaking of the music, its startling that Em has almost completely abandoned the production help of mentor Dr. Dre (who only contributes three tracks on the whole album) and mans the ship alone primarily.  The result?  Well if you like Dre's signature production than he is sorely missed, but Em makes up for it with more musical diversity on his self-produced tracks.  Its also interesting to note that Eminem seems to find adequate tracks to express his emotional growth.  Em still has venom to spew but it seems to be hitting closer to home now.  He isn't stabbing ex-wives and disposing of bodies with infant daughter in tow anymore, but getting more into the hurt that has come from his relationship with his mom, with his fans, and with himself.  And for a change of pace.  Em actually sings a lullaby type song about his daughter on Haile's Song.  Although barely listenable, one has to give Eminem credit for being bold enough to do something that could be described as corny when he has attacked the rest of the world so vehemently for their sentimental subject matter.  Its all the more courageous because his daughter seems to be the only thing he cares about besides his music and telling the world you value something is always risky.  Exposing his daughter to the public eye (even featuring her on catchy My Dad's Gone Crazy) and even boasting he is a competent father are all cannon fodder for those who wait in the wings to attack Marshall. <br />Saying that this is Em's most mature work still does leave some things to be desired.  He is still sometimes offensive just for the sake of it making hamburgers out of everyone else's sacred cows.  With the exception of racial slurs, there really isn't anything Em seems shy about saying to get a rise out of people.  If you found him obnoxious in the past, he is still obnoxious now, but if it didn't bother you enough to dismiss the Slim Shady LP, or the Marshall Mathers LP, than you are in for  much greater treat this time around.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|As like many people, I am always a bit skeptical about sequels.  I absolutely loved the first Blade, and was half expecting the sequel to disappoint me.  I was wrong.  The movie clicked along at a great pace.  Watch the deleted scenes and listen to the commentary.  These guys know how to make an action movie and keep it moving along.  However, the sequel was much more of an action movie - the first movie had more character development and, actually, I liked the vampires in the first movie better.  But the action and the visual effects in the second movie made for an excellent time!  The extensive use of computer generation was very fitting for a movie based off of a comic book.  I will gladly watch this movie again and again.  Simply awesome!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Finally, a female singer who actually sings! Her eclectic choice of material really lets the listen hear her voice. Nothing is hidden behind studio-techniques or some hollow rhythms. This is a moody, graceful album, one that reminds you of both smoky rooms and Key West beaches.<br />If you're a fan of Eva Cassidy or Patty Griffin, you'll adore Norah Jones!
B00006FXB6|5.0|It hasn't been long since Queens of the Stone Age released their last album, 'R', which is surprising as they've created yet another masterpiece in such a short amount of time. It's been set out as someone flicking through radio stations, and stopping at the best songs with fantastic guitar solos and thumping basslines. The album starts off heavy with 'Millionaire', sung loud and strong by Nick Oliveri. It begins to get 'bouncy' in the second track, 'No One Knows'. In a few words, it's like and inward and outward spiral of rock, metal and bounce. `A Song For The Deaf' is almost Kyuss-like. As the album progresses, `The Sky Is Fallin' and `Hangin' Tree' stand out, but 'Go With The Flow' is a stylistic sounding outburst, with Josh Homme's amazing vocals. 'Song For The Deaf' is hauntingly fantastic. The bassline runs all the way up and down your spine repeatedly. 'Songs For The Deaf' ends cosily with the beautiful 'Mosquito Song', and finishes with a magnificent marching band kind of sound, emphasising on the horn section and the crashing toms. The Kinks cover of `Everybody's Gonna Be Happy' ends `Songs For The Deaf' with a smile on your face.
B000006V1Y|4.0|When i first heard this CD I was very dissapointed because many songs sound boring and very similar. After hearing it a few times I like most of the songs but she really did better work. <BR>Honey: A sugar-sweet Hip Hop-song. It shows us the new Mariah. At first i didn't like it but it grew on me.<BR>Butterfly. This song was the reason why I buyed the album. It's one of the most beautiful ballads she ever sang.<BR>My all: Another beautiful ballad. I love the lyrics and the video is hot<BR>The roof: A Hip Hop - song. It's so-so<BR>Fourth of july: This one is really boring. it has no highlight<BR>Breakdown: Again a Hip Hop - song. It sounds strange somehow.<BR>Babydoll: The song is boring and the lyrics are annoying. i don't like it<BR>Close my eyes: I love it. it's one of the most atmospheric songs she ever sang. it's so beautiful<BR>Whenever you call. This is a typical Mariah Carey - ballad. it's wonderful. Here she sings it alone without Brian McKnight<BR>Fly away. it's kind of an interlud. It sounds like the daydream interlude on her Daydream CD. <BR>The beautiful ones: This song is written by Prince. i can't stand Prince so I don't like this song that much<BR>Outside. A slow soul song. Not my favourite<BR>Honey (So so def radio mix): This is a nice mix.

B000002UW1|5.0|The second of two of the bands finest albums in succession, after Life's Rich Pagent in 1986.  Along with Murmur and LRP, Document is a masterpiece.  It's predecessor, Pagent, was a very upbeat album, with songs like \\"I Believe\\" with its gleeful banjo riff, and \\"These Days\\" with lyrics like \\"happy throngs, take this joy wherever you go.\\"  Document is decidedly darker, though just as vibrant.  <br />There isn't one song on this disc that could even remotely be described as week.  Political commentaries like \\"Welcome to the Occupation\\" and \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" are gold, and it's sad to think that there are no bands around today who would tackle this subject matter on a pop album - even sadder to think that REM is now one of those bands, now preferring to sing about \\"sugar cane that tasted good\\" and so forth.  \\"Occupation,\\" along with \\"Fireplace,\\" \\"Lightnin' Hopkins,\\" and especially \\"Oddfellows Local 151\\" seem darker than anything the band had explored on its previous albums, other than an occasional \\"Feeling Gravity's Pull.\\"  Most songs, however, still retain their \\"catchiness\\" and hook appeal, other than the completely inaccessible and awesome \\"151\\".  <br />I don't understand people who cry sellout with this album.  To me, a song like \\"Moral Kiosk\\" or \\"Maps and Legends\\" has just as much pop appeal as \\"The One I Love\\".  Hell, \\"Driver 8\\" sounds more radio friendly to me than any song on this whole album.  The band's star had been in full ascention for years, it was just the right time for them to finally crack the top 10.  The \\"mainstream\\" finally realized in 1987 that REM was a damn good band.<br />My personal favorite track is the sitar driven \\"King of Birds.\\"  I've never heard anything like it by any other band.  It's a strange lyric over a marching-style beat, but still catchy as hell.  And of course, right up there with \\"Birds\\" would have to be that quintessential REM showstopper \\"End of the World,\\" still exciting even upon endless listenings.
B00005NWM3|4.0|I have NEVER liked rock music - but I LOVE THIS CD!  I ended up buying this CD b/c I fell in love with Chad Kroeger's voice on &quot;Hero&quot; from the Spiderman Soundtrack.  This album is awesome.  Anyone who can appreciate good music would enjoy this CD as well.  I always have &quot;Where Do I Hide&quot; and &quot;Hangnail&quot; pumping in my car!!  You can't go wrong with this CD.
0316666343|5.0|This book is powerful, gripping and opens your eyes to what one could see through the eyes of being dead, suspended away from others, especially loved ones. It was a book that had moments in it that were very tender. It makes one think.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|This is such a cute movie, my children love it!!
0790729393|5.0|This is a movie that deals with the abuse of children in a reform school setting, and the revenge taken by those children when they become adults. In a nutshell, the story involves a childhood prank gone wrong, reform school guards gone sadistic and revenge taken fifteen years later by the boys, grown to manhood. I read Lorenzo Caracaterra's book (which was touted as a true story, but later shown to be no such thing, but still a good read) and here is one case where the movie is better than the book -- by far. The movie is tightly scripted, and although it may, at 2 1/2 hours, seem long, you will not notice the passage of time. The cast demonstrates from the very outset what fine acting is all about. To single out any one performer may not do justice to the entire cast, but Robert DeNiro is superb in the role of the parish priest, who becomes conflicted by his religious beliefs and his wish to help &quot;his boys&quot;, grown to adulthood. Although the subject matter involving the reform school guards' sadistic abuse of four boys is troublesome, this is outstanding film making. I have watched it several times and will do so again, because of the compelling story, outstanding acting and superb filming. The DVD quality is excellent and so is the sound. I have never known anyone who did not find &quot;Sleepers&quot; to be anything other than an outstanding movie.
B000060MMI|2.0|After releasing two wonderful albums, Alive Behind The Green Door and Swagger, I was quite anxious to hear Flogging Molly's new album... <br />Words can't express the feeling of disappointment I felt (and still do) after listening to Drunken Lullabies. <br />Where the first two albums of course warranted comparisons to mighty Pogues, they established and built on FM's individual personality... Which I had hoped they would continue to do on their third release. <br />But no. Almost every song on here can be traced back to Pogues, beat for beat, instrument for instrument. I understand that many fantastic artists, including Shane MacGowan himself are known for thinly disguising songs that inspire them as their own work - reworking traditional tunes and adding themselves into the music... but Drunken Lullabies just doesn't pull it off. Everytime I listen to it, I get frustrated, turn it off and put on The Pogues instead.<br />Even the last time I saw them play live - a concert on St. Paddy's day, I ended up leaving early... okay a big part of that was the venue's lack of Irish whiskey and serving overpriced Guinness in little plastic cups - but the point is, I had never walked out of a Flogging Molly show before! (and haven't been to one since)<br />It's a shame and I for one, hope they can win their fans back over next time. I know they're better than this release demonstrates. The other albums PROVE it.
6303257844|5.0|Part of the reason &quot;Speed&quot; works so well is the way we care for the characters on the runaway bus. They were innocent people going to work and making a living like most everyone else on the planet. We sympathize with them. But that's only part of the reason. The biggest reason is the non-stop thrills and chills that erupt from this Jan De Bont vehicle starring Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper. One of the greatest action flicks in the past decade, &quot;Speed&quot; thrusts its audience into a roller-coaster ride filled with explosions, goodguy-badguy banter, humor, and doesn't stop until the action does, never stopping for air, even after the villain faces his demise. It's a superior action flick.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I am addicted to Norah Jones as is my office partner. We play it over and over. I want more! It's beautiful, magical, serene, and dreamy.
6304118392|5.0|Oliver Stone's visceral vision is fully realized in this unrated version of the most controversial film of the 1990s. Not before and not since has a movie exploited the media with such spark, such drive, and such violence. We see first hand the violent rampage of Micky and Mallory Knox told as only Oliver Stone could tell it. And only Stone could be worthy enough to do a movie like this. I think even Tarentino would have his flaws here. Stone is best when he's controversial. This is his second best film, however. His best is the little-known flick &quot;Talk Radio.&quot;
B00004WG2X|5.0|The BBC knows how to do Jane Austen.  The characters are much truer to the authentic nature of the book, the dialogue is almost completely taken from its source without some of those &quot;modern&quot; additions which A&amp;E took such liberties with.  I also MUCH prefer E. Garvie because she IS Elizabeth Bennet.  Austen wrote that there was &quot;a mingling of sweetness and archness&quot; in her manner which Ehle's performance was completely without.  I also prefer David Rintoul to Firth - the former captured the haughty nature and the imposing physique while the latter seemed cranky and often frumpy.<br />The costumes, location shots and the dancing/musical performances were gorgeously done and as to the dances, they were kept at a minimal.  <br />I was introduced to this version of my favorite book by my english teacher which I believe to be the best recommendation.<br />If you want a version which is true to the novel and the tone of the author, watch the BBC rather than the A&amp;E.  Also, be glad of the fact that the BBC is HALF the playing time as the A&amp;E.  That is pure greatness in itself.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Forget everything you know about the new rock scene. Forget nu-metal. Forget nu-hairmetal. Forget yourself. Then pick up this CD. From the very beginning,you are greeted with a sound I here every day: some anonymous cog trying to find something good on the mindless airwaves. And then the opening of Millionaire comes out and you are completely blown away for the next hour. Everything about this CD is perfect.
0738206679|5.0|In Linked, a scientist intrigued by the new science of networks traces the history of connected systems, from the early graph theory by a Swiss mathematician to new biology developments in cancer research based on cellular networks. 'Networking' here goes far beyond the computer world into the worlds of biology and hard science, showing how networks cross disciplines and applications to provide new insights.
B000055ZB8|5.0|This movie will send a chill up and down your spine.  Max Schreck's Dracula is the scariest of any vampire in all of movie making - it is the most vicious and demonic, which truly does parallel Stoker's book.  This is not to say that Oldman's Dracula wasn't just as satisfying but, because this is a \\"silent\\" movie, an emphasis on the visualisation of the vampire must be made.  With Schreck's vampire, you see what you don't hear: the evil and horror of the words Stoker has him speak in his book.<br />I think that a good horror movie doesn't scare you directly, but allows you to scare yourself. Nosferatu does this superbly. This is certainly not a jump-out-of-your-seat thriller and can be a bit campy. However, this is definitely a movie which, if you immerse yourself in it, will absolutely make your skin crawl.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Word of mouth and media buzz wasn't as powerful as finally hearing the single `Don't Know Why' on the local radio station.  I bought the CD and I  love it.  While its hard to really categorize the entire CD as contemporary jazz despite the strong singles `Don't Know Why,' `Come Away With Me,' and `Turn Me On,' all the songs on this CD take on a life of there own with there own style.  I would have never imagined a delivery of Hank William's `Cold Cold Heart' this way, but I'm sure he'd approve.
0192833553|5.0|Austin lays out all of her witt and charm within the first three pages of this novel and by the third and fourth chapters you won't be able to put the book down.  If you find yourself unable to keep up with Georgian style of writing (or if you are guy), however, this may not be the best book for you. ;)
0385503954|4.0|If you do a lot of reading, and get tired of the same simple story which is told in an obvious fasion, then this book will be a welcomed change for you.  The writing style feels so classic, descriptive, and subtle.  No line of any story in these pages will be forced to you, many things are left up to your mind and imagination to fill in.  It is a nice refreshing shift, while the story is lined with dark undertones of family pain and horrible war time experiences, the writing style is not depressing in spite if it's content.  Much of the story also revolves around a young girl, and the consequence of her decisions and actions on an entire family, yet it in no way is a book for women alone.  Due to the style, and changing views of situations, everyone will feel pulled into the scene, and understand the price people pay for dishonesty.<br />You will follow several stories, both on the home front and on the war front (strangely the first was actually more intense for me, but this is a debated matter)and every aspect is wriiten with skill and style.  The author throws in what I believe to be as a &quot;twist&quot; in the ending, which is entirely up to the reader to intrepret.  I found this also very refreshing.  While reading all this praise you may wonder why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, and that's a great question.  For me personally, moments in the book ran a tad slow, not terribly, but enough that I can't rate it perfect, and sometimes the story moved to quickly on facts and events that I wanted to linger on, so again this is just a personal opinion. <br /> If you love true &quot;English&quot; writing in classic, restrained style, or if you simply want a well written story that will be unlike most you have read lately, this book will be a nice choice.  If you have friends that read and like to discuss books with you I can guarentee you will pass it on to them.
B000002KGT|5.0|One of the essential recordings in the rock canon, Fleetwood Mac takes the singer-songwriter school of aesthetics, mixes it with the more commercial sounding elements of music, and ensures each song has great hooks and very memorable pop rhythms.  The result?  Proof that you can make a commercial sounding, sleek, very focused record and still produce very high quality music.  RUMOURS always feels very commercial, but never once does it come off as product.  This results in one of the rarest types of any music: music that sounds like it was written to be sold but still remaining so sincere that the commercial sound, instead of detracting, actually adds to the album.<br />To the fans of this incarnation of Fleetwood Mac would be very surprised at the very heavy, blues laden sound of the band in the 1960s.  As the years went on, they continued to evolve into a more soft, folky sound, much more along the lines of a singer-songwriter outfit than a blues band.  Of course, the critics gave them hell over the stylistic changes the band was going through because Fleetwood Mac's sound had become much more commercialized.<br />The major catalyst to these changes came in the form of two new band members, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.  They brought a pop sensibility to the band which made moved them away from the blues and more into the sound of FLEETWOOD MAC and this album. <br />Whether Fleetwood Mac sold out or not to me is irrelevant.  People use that as a slam, and in many cases when a band does that the music takes a nose dive in quality, sounding more like product than anything else (Aerosmith?).  This is not the case with Fleetwood Mac.<br />This is an album stunningly crafted, a perfect example of how to write with a pleasant pop sheen and still not sacrifice any artistic credibility.  RUMOURS has a very commercial sound, but it also has a very genuine sound as well.  The songs always sound vibrant and never once does RUMOURS come across as `in it for the money,'in spite of its commercial sound.  Many of the songs on RUMOURS have become soft-rock standards.  Despite what the critics say of Stevie Nicks, she brought a lot of soul to this album and is one very large element for its success.<br />In the end, Fleetwood Mac score one of the biggest selling albums ever, and was until THRILLER dethroned it some years later.  RUMOURS should reside in any serious rock collection.
B000058983|5.0|YES: I have heard &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;. And &quot;Revolver&quot;.  And &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;.  And all thoses albums live up to their hype in spades.  But then there's &quot;Forever Changes&quot;.  Bob, Brian, Elvis, John and Paul all crane their necks upward, shielding their eyes from the intense glare.  And there's Arthur Lee.  He's wearing a gas mask, of course -- at this altitude it's required -- but it's him, all right.  It's him....
0783225970|5.0|This is perhaps the best remake, if not the best gangster movie ever made.  It's storyline is absorbing, and Al Pichino delivers his finest.

0066211697|5.0|Francoise Sagan is a brilliant French writer, who here has written an intriguing novel about a young lady's 'coming-of-age' while on Holiday by the sea. What I appreciate about Sagan's works most of all is her style. She writes very subtly, almost tenderly at times, but what comes out of these impressions is incredible clarity into the inner human workings ans spirit. She deals with huge and incredibly moving emotional matters and life-changing experiences with the grace of an unassuming, yet very beautiful bouquet. Perhaps only French writers writing in French can do this (but this English translation maintains some of the original affect). It's like the hidden waters of the subconscious are feeding Sagan's stories, and especially 'Bonjour Tristesse' with eternal messages about life, love, fear, uncertainty, and Destiny. The parvenu paramour in 'Bonjour Tristesse' finds love without becoming jaded by the experience. Yet, she leaves us with elegaic afterthoughts. This is just brilliant literature.
B000006NPY|3.0|This record makes nice mood music and all, but I left the room halfway through &quot;For Martha&quot; to go make lunch, ate, came back, and the song was still going, and it didn't sound like it had changed any. I certainly didn't miss anything.<BR>Not essential by any means.
6305095442|5.0|'Evil Dead 2' straddles the line between satire and quality horror, and is an extremely entertaining, hysterical film. The special effects are amazing and over-the-top macabre, while the star grows into his role slowly but surely, gaining to a very robust finish. If you want to watch a scary movie that is also very funny, check this out!
B00005QG9J|2.0|Maybe it's just because I used to love Incubus and they broke my heart, but I couldn't take this radio-friendly MOR mish-mash. Nice to know you - goodbye. At least they have a positive view of life; that's exceptionally rare these days.
B000063DFS|5.0|I just received this new remastered version, and I love it.  I always thought No More Tears might have been his strongest album, and I still do believe that.  This new version has incredible sound, and two great bonus tracks.  My favorite songs are: I Don't Want to Change the World, No More Tears, Desire, Hellraiser, Mr. Tinkertrain, and Don't Blame Me.  But, the whole album is great.  If you are a fan of Ozzy's or just want to listen to great heavy metal music, I would highly recommend this.
B000000WA4|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I like most of this record, but it has to be the single most pretentious faux art created by anyone during the last decade. Still, out of twenty-eight songs and two hours (!) fully half the songs are good, and a handful are classics. The first six or so tracks of each disc come to mind in the very positive category. The lyrics are straight out of a high school creative writing course, but THAT VOICE gets many of them across. \\"Zero,\\" \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" (though the chorus is so simplistic that you could have written it yourself in an unhappy moment) \\"Love,\\" \\"Bodies,\\" \\"1979,\\" and (my favorite!) \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\" are bona fide classics of fake grunge angst. <BR>On the flip side, just reading the titles can identify to you the horribly overwrought numbers: \\"Cupid de Locke,\\" \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans,\\" \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby,\\" not to mention the sickly saccharine \\"Lily (My One and Only)\\" and \\"By Starlight.\\" Still, as a gigantic concept album it works, better than \\"Animals\\" and some of the other Pink Floyd records that Billy is aping. And it sounds believable after a fashion. <BR>If you have two hours and nothing else to do on a regular basis, then check this out.
B000002B7O|5.0|I was lucky enough to find the 1995 version of this album.  Although I have never heard the 2002 remaster, I would never want to hear this album any different than it originally was.  The instrumental is incredible and the music is great.  This is definitely one of Ozzy's best, although I have never heard an album of his that wasn't good.  My favorite songs are: Over the Mountain, Flying High Again, Believer, S.A.T.O. and Diary of a Madman.  If you are a new fan of Ozzy's (or heavy metal), I would definitely recommend this, Blizzard of Ozz and No More Tears for a starter.
B00005JCA9|4.0|A fairly run of the mill, brit flik romantic comedy, the casting of Rhys Ifans though brings a level of comedy which elevates the movies as a whole.<BR>Hugh Grant playing his usual stuttering awkward englishman to a tee, and he does it so well.<BR>The most annoying element is the friends over the topness, much as in Bridget Jones diary, the actors involved seem to be overdoing it and it all a bit sickening.<BR>And if only that bloody annoying Ronan Keating song wasnt peppered throughout, it causes a wave of nausea on its opening strains.<BR>as romantic comedys go, its a pretty good one
B00005JKCH|4.0|I recommend this movie, but tell parents to use caution because it was a little violent for small children!  But it was very, but very entertaining!
B00003TL49|5.0|I could endlessly play this album. Absolutely fantastic, words can not describe how good it is.
0783225792|4.0|This movie, had a better story than Scarface. This movie I think was different. There was never really a movie about a casino and two mobsters owning it. Joe Pesci was excellent. The film has a really gory ending, not for kids.
0316666343|2.0|Very good until the ending.  I wish I had stopped reading before the last 2 chapters.  However, I guess life is not always tied up nicely in little bows.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Part 1 of the Godfather is probably the best one. It won 3 academy awards including Best picture , and Francis ford coppala's first movie... not bad. The movie was one of the best of the sequel. <br />Part 2 of Godfather is just as good as the first one. This one won 6 academy awards including Best Picture. The scenes with Al Pacin oare alittle boring but the scenes with Robert De Niro are the best. Robert De Niro at his best. <br />Part 3 of Godfather is almost as good as the other two. It was nominated for 7 academy awards, but did not win one. It was more of a gang war. The ending is sad. And a little weird, when Al's daughter dies.
0767817664|1.0|Okay, this is just ridiculous.  Am I supposed to believe that Roddy McDowall is a vampire killer?!  I give him all the credit in the world, he was probably one of the most underrated actors of the last 30 years, but he needs to be cast properly, not as a vampire killer.  The plot is weak, acting is poor, and it doesn't even qualify to have the word &quot;Fright&quot; in the title.  This movie is so weak and tame.
0783225970|4.0|I am a fan of mobster movies. I thought this movie was entertaining, it is not for little, kids, they curse to much, there is drug content and so much blood. The film, has a good story, about a Cuban going from a poor low life mobster to a big gangster. I like the ending, and i don't. I like when he shoots them all, and says, \\" Say hello to my little friend, but in Oliver Stone's script should of made him die more classical like the Godfather, and throughout the movie, is just killing, and nonstop violence. But, this is a Classic and it is out of print in video stores.
B000002UAU|4.0|No, not really, but close.  A Day in the Life remains one of the Beatles finest tracks, but the rest of this pretty can be summed up as merely good.  The production of this record was extremely influential, however not always in a good way.  It's impossible to think of how many overreaching, pretentous pychedelic disasters followed in it's wake.  This is good, as a piece, but I'll take the White Album, Abbey Road or Revolver anyday.
0790729725|5.0|This movie has it all. I really do not like going into detail about the story. The storyline is great. The characters are remarkable. The acting is extremely, the best i have scene in a Drama movie.
B00006FXB6|5.0|What an amazing record! Fourteen tracks of everything from screaming to soothing melodies all in one. WITH A DVD!!! In some places it can be found for only $7!!!!!!! I dare you to find a better deal....or a better band!!! QOTSA found their way into the (almost) mainstream with their legendary Rated R LP. They even found themselves on Ozzfest. Now with their equally amazing release Songs For The Deaf, they are sure to be turning heads everywhere. The amazing, precise guitar work of Josh Homme(along with his perfect voice), the stunning bass skill of Nick Oliveri(along with his piercing screams), the eye-bulging drumming of the legendary Dave Grohl, and the smooth vocals of Mark Lanegan along with lots of cameos by other great artists, bring this record to the top of my list of albums to buy RIGHT NOW!!! If you haven't already heard any QOTSA, you are missing out. If you have heard them, then surely you know what I am talking about. This album is sure to bring much attention to The Queens Of The Stone Age with songs like \\"No One Knows\\", Hangin' Tree\\", \\"Go With The Flow\\", and \\"First It Giveth.\\" So, get off your computer, and go buy SONGS FOR THE DEAF, THE ESSENTIAL ALBUM OF 2002!!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Hands down. These guys are gonna be huge. The latest entry in the exclusive and fine tradition of classic debut albums. See also Jesus and Mary Chain, Stone Roses, Pavement...
B00005QZWI|5.0|Great listening CD for the Lord of the Rings book set.
0792156684|5.0|This movie is completely fantastic.  I'm thirteen years old, I've seen it seven times and it still amazes me every time I watch it. It is truly worthy of all the awards it received, and I congratulate James Cameron in being able to create such a believeable and heartbreaking story. Though I may be prejudiced as a Leonardo DiCaprio lover, I still think he did an amazing job in this movie, along with Kate Winslet and Billy Zane.  The special effects were breathtaking (esp. in the depiction of the sinking) and I personally loved the end scene (where Rose goes &quot;back to Titanic&quot; - the pictures make me cry).  Although I hate cliches, I have to agree - Titanic is most definitely a film for the ages!
6305508550|5.0|If you've ever worked in a cunicla this is the movie for you.
0671027344|5.0|I like this book so much. It really made me think, think about life, how I view it, how other people view it. It's a book about being a teenager, its like Catcher in the Rye, except less saterical and more recent. It reminds me of Almost Famous too, and is obviously written by a screenwriter, I mean its still amazing, but reading it was like reading a movie. Read this book, its worth it and then some.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This masterpiece of a film can be confusing, but the story becomes very clear once you see it 2 or 3 times.<br />If you remember the end of the movie, Diane orders the killing of Camilla and she is sitting in the same place where the psychiatrist was sitting, across form where the man with a recurring nightmare was sitting in the beginning.  He says some bad things are happening outside and he's scared, and that the psychiatrist was by the cash register. \\"Diane\\" is the waitress.<br />Then, at the end you see Diane in the psychiatrist's place, the killer in the nightmare victim's place, and the nightmare victimin the psychiatrists' place at the cash register.  \\"Betty\\" is the waitress.  There is no psychiatrist, it's just Diane's schizophrenia, or it could really be Diane's psychiatrist who isn't revealed in her real life.<br />So, this ties it together.  The monster outside is holding the blue box, which is all of Diane's troubles, including her parents.  All of the things that pressured her into this mess is the \\"monster\\".  But now she is trapped beacuse she feels guilty for ordering the killing of Camilla (guilt is part of the monster that won't go away), but she is also jealous.  Either way, Diane loses.  She goes insane.<br />That's why it was so convenient in Diane's dream for Rita to \\"survive\\" as the only survivor of the car crash, for Diane to become Betty so she didn't feel guilty (and get chased by the cops).  Then, Betty can start again with a fresh version of Camilla who has no idea that she blew her off in real life.  She can then start her affair again with the new Camilla (Rita).  Of course, it's all just in her mind.  She put all the people in the party against the director, and of course Camilla is the subject of \\"this is the girl\\" (for killing and lead actress in real life).  Diane couldn't see a brunette Camilla being killed because she loves her, so she makes up a blond version of Camilla to kill (and in real life Camilla is Camilla's other femalelover).  That way, she can have Camilla (Rita) all to herself without anyone interfering.<br />The blue key is also important, because it opens up all of her troubles.  In the dream, it allows Rita access to Betty's real life, and in reality it is a locker key which contains the black book.  Of course, the killer was asked by Diane to get the black book so she can 1) pursue leads in her otherwise unsuccessful acting career, and 2) get rid of evidence linking her to  Camilla.<br />Great story.
B00004RFFS|5.0|First of all, I am a big Anne Rice fan, and this has got to be my favorite movie of all time. It's the most beautiful, dramatic, and excellent film I ever seen. It is just right on course with the book. The soundtrack to the movie is awesome, and it suits the movie perfectly. So, read the book, watch the movie, then go buy the soundtrack. You will be  glad you did.
B00005ALRO|4.0|The Fugitive is probably one of the best suspense thrillers that ever existed. The screenplay is tremendous, the acting is magnificent, and and the directing is amazing. This movie is a whole lot of thrills and edge-of-your-seat-excitement. The casting is great and this is Andrew Davis's only picture where there was something besides fights and violence (Under Siege was only good for an action fan like me but not for many others). There is a whole slab of drama mixed in and the acting is amazing. Harrison Ford delivers probably his best performance ever and Tommy Lee Jones fully deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as the U.S. Marshall who means business. Though it is a lot better than it's sort of sequel U.S Marshals and has a much better cast and director, you can't really say this is the best movie you've ever seen. <br />The Fugitive tells the story of Richard Kimble, played by Harrison Ford, a doctor living with his wife in a normal house. However, one night his wife is brutally murdered as he comes home and he is the only witness to it. The murderer is a \\"man with one hand\\" while the other is plastic. Kimble is framed and put on a train to jail. However, the train soon collapses and Kimble gets out. And know he must prove his innocence to everyone including a U.S Marshal named Sam Gerard (Jones) who doesn't care about anything except catching Kimble. I don't know the bad guy's name but he was also the bad guy in the James Bond flick The Living Daylights with Timothy Dalton. The movie is a pure blast of fun. Though really not for small children, people over 12 can watch this movie. It is not incredibly bloody and is a true masterpiece that deserves to be owned.<br />I give Fugitive 4 stars.<BR>Time: 131 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for some scenes of strong realistic violence, mild language, and murder& disturbing images.
B000066I6N|5.0|What a beautiful album. Never has R.P.'s voice been more soulful. He nails these standards as though he wrote each and every one of these tracks. If you are into 60's styled psychedelic folk/blues this is for you.I too believe this is the best cd Plant has done since the Zep days. This cd is worth the $'s even if you only listen to it once, it is that good. In the last little while Jagger, McCartney, Ferry, Bowie have all put out albums and this is clearly superior IMHO.
0140186409|5.0|Here's another book I once avoided, an arrogant young student impressed with my collection of bitter satires by bitter, younger writers who thought just as little of humanity as myself.  Surely my decision to drift through a test and a paper on other people's discussions (ranging from 'greatest book ever' to 'a tiring, endless bore')was appropriate at the time for my cynical inexperience had not yet adjusted me for the sheer force of humanity of this titanic struggle.<br />A story in pictures and abbreviated words, The Grapes of Wrath paints an honest vision of crushing defeat endured through hard times when visualized hopes were the only things required for living.  We are swept in to a duststorm, a cascade of brief apocaylpse that batters our eyes shut only to force them open to see what is going on beneath the howl of the wind.  This is what calamities cause and here is how man will always scramble for survival.<br />The world opens up and becomes filled with people, beginning with the solitary wandering of a just-released inmate ambiling through the dead, dried out land, to search for his family.  People join and surround Tom--later the Joads--and the dazed survivors all travel, bringing customs, and search the wide world for a new place to make a living.  Their dreams and ambitions mix and then expand, groups are formed, families split apart and multiply, the crush of the storm has infected the people and now they go forward and tear up even more of the land in the search for a home.<br />The book ends in the rain, all pain and dryness washed away into the mud, the dreams coming to an end, situations grown more desperate but at least temporarily endurable--the truth about where hope lay shining and glistening before them, lost in the bible or dreams of wealth or hopes for the future or the nucleus of a loving family surrounding them.  Something is planted in that rain, finally, the milk of human kindness mixing with the mud to burst forth flowers and dew and yet another new chance to make something out of survival.<br />It really is a wonderful story told with great wisdom, dignity and style.t another new chance to make something out of survival.<br />It really is a wonderful story told with great wisdom, dignity and style.
B000067CPX|5.0|Several people here have decried the Peppers for casting aside their funk/metal style for this record. Oh well. Speaking for myself, the shift from their old, wild ways to a more melodic, introspective style reflects a newfound, and deeply welcome maturity. AK steals the show--his singing is better than ever, and the songwriting as matured by leaps and bounds. Californication was a tentative step in this direction, but By The Way is a triumph.
B00005O5JV|5.0|This movie is the best!! It's all about girls doing what they want and feeling good about themselves.  It makes you feel like you can go out and do anything you want to.  I have two daughters (ages 10 & 7) and they love it too.  It also has the best music...order the CD too!!!
B000068IEU|1.0|Please stay away from this shocking turkey of a movie. To put it simply it is just HIDEOUS. It's about as scary as opening a MARS BAR ! 'I spit on your grave' is another film typical of the genre, it is only marginally better that this dismally poor effort. Wes Craven went on to direct the equally laughable 'Shocker' which is absolutely hilarious in another tragically sad way ! you have been warned......
0140430350|5.0|The late James A. Michener, a Pulitizer Prize winner and best-selling author, wrote in his essay &quot;The Book That Made A Difference&quot; that &quot;It was in following the intricacies of this novel [Vanity Fair] that I first saw, in my own terms, how a work of fiction could be constructed.&quot;  Michener later acknowledges in his essay that &quot;today it's fashionable to denigrate Thackery . . . but when I read him at the right moment he was explosive and I revere his memory.&quot;<br />William Makepeace Thackery, a lawyer who didn't like law and turned to journalism and art, wrote &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; with a plan.  He crafted an outline and stuck to it.  To learn how to develop a character, read and think about how Thackery outlined and wrote Becky Sharp in &quot;Vanity Fair.&quot;<br />Michener writes: &quot;'Vanity Fair'was the first book I ever read as a novel, as a conscious construction for the purpose of enchanting the reader.  I'd read most of Dickens and fine works like &quot;Madame Bovary,&quot; but not as prototypes of what the artist can do when he sets out consciously to engage the reader.&quot;<br />&quot;Vanity Fair&quot; can be inspiring and instructive as well as enjoyable if the reader becomes as absorbed and as interested as Michener.
B00000I9P1|5.0|Although this album yielded three charting singles only \\"Is This Love\\" was a major hit, and the album barely made the top 50. This lack of commercial success remains an enormous mystery...this is one of the best AOR albums ever released.<br />Jim Peterik and Frankie Sullivan had a real chemistry when it came to writing great songs together. This time around vocalist Jimi Jamison also had a hand in writing four of the ten tracks; for whatever reason those songs are not quite as strong as those he wasn't involved with. (Exception: \\"Keep It Right Here\\"). But apart from \\"Man Against The World\\" which everybody but me seems to love every cut is extremely good, and while it is a softer album than most Survivor records there are some great rock moments such as \\"Rebel Son\\" and \\"Can't Let You Go\\" included. However my personal favourite tracks are the title cut and the superb \\"Oceans\\". Highly recommended.
B00005JLFC|5.0|The film is one of her greats, she has done many good films but this in my eyes is one of her best.  Great story line and great songs, loved by all.  There are lesser known films being put on dvd, it is about time this classic is protected and put on to DVD for other people to enjoy.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Having grown up with comic books like the X-Men and its cousins, I tend to take them for granted now.  This is the era of far glitzier issues with whole teams cooperating to make the pages shock and titillate.  Life was a bit tamer then, comics were fun, but not exactly earth-shattering.  So thinking \\"The X-Men, Ho-Hum,\\" I did not bother to see the film when it came out.  That was a serious mistake.  I have a very large monitor, but there is no question but that I should have seen it then.<br />This film is remarkable for many reasons.  First, the script is as fresh and up-to-date as could be.  Gone are the super heroic declamations (other than when Dr. Xavier and Magneto argue) and in their place is good, dramatic dialog delivered by talented, professional actors.  Then there is the filming, which consistently avoids any sense of cramped or overly open space.  It provides a seamless background for the special effects.  If the dialog has been brought down to a human scale, the visual imagery completely exceeded my expectations.<br />Casting is wonderful too.  Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Xavier (Patrick Stewart) seem made for their parts, and the rest of the cast are no less able.  This is not a Dino De Laurentiis film with one or two good actors using spectacle to cover its weaknesses.  Instead, we have an entire cast that conspires to make the unbelievable real.  And Michael Kamen's music is also a treat.<br />The film brings home far better than the comic series ever did that the problem being dealt with is not really good mutants vs. bad mutants.  Instead, the real issue is that these mutants are trying to live in a world full people who are suspicious and fearful of those who are 'different.'  This is a talel about the effects of prejudice, clothed in an action story.  The protagonists stand for two possible solutions.  Sometimes one can understand Magneto (Ian McKellan) despite his willingness to use evil for his purposes.<br />The plot is the simple tale of Logan and Rogue's (Anna Paquin) coming to Dr. Xavier's school and the ensuing struggle to stop Magneto from turning a ray that makes humans into mutants on an assembly of diplomats.  Each of the characters contains a story, often deeply tragic, and each has given something up as the price of their talents.<br />The DVD is a bit short on extras.  A short on the film's making, an interview with director Brian Singer, and various other bits and pieces.  A special feature that adds back in other versions of scenes sounds interesting, but actually amounts to very little.  This is a worthwhile film. If it did not have quite the impact on me that the first Star Wars did, it still was an engrossing experience in a jaded world.

B000067G3C|5.0|Speed is one of my favourite action movies beside Die Hard series. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock really shine in this movie. From lift to bus to train, all scenes are exciting! Not to be miss if you like action movies. So forget the bad Sequel Speed 2 - Cruise Control because it is very boring, slow and not exciting, but this one is a masterpiece.
B00006DEF9|5.0|\\"Singin' In The Rain\\" was filmed in 1951. It was never recorded or released in 4 channel magnetic sound. WB (via MGM) is going to release the film using the surviving audio \\"stems\\" or \\"angles\\" to recreate a sort of stereo perspective in the upcoming remastered release on DVD and the limited theatrical showing using real Technicolor prints. These \\"stems\\" are separate audio tracks made during the music pre-recording process to insure that final balances for the film were perfect in the mono release prints. They were never intended to be used as stereo and were never released as such until the 70s when MGM did reconstruction work for LaserDisc. Unfortunately, unlike the audio business which does not allow records to be marked stereo if they are not, the MPAA has never monitored the use of stereo or 5.1 stereo nomenclature in home video/DVD releases. Too many are enchanced mono but do not say so. Again, the upcoming DVD of \\"Singin\\" will be remastered using a new process to enhance picture and the sound will be modest 5.1 stereo when elements make it possible.<br />UPDATE:  The new DVD is out.  It is a visual and aural delight!  SITR has never looked this good - ever.  The sound is mostly mono with additional spread on the left and right from the use of available \\"stems\\".  If you like you can listen in mono only or the \\"5.1\\" ehancement which gives more \\"air\\" to the sound.  Great supplements and extras.
B000067G3C|5.0|I loved this movie. Bullock is great in it, and now I want to see all of her movies. I would recommend this to ANYONE. If you like romances, there is a little one between Sandra and Keanu, and there's plenty of action.
B000007T1M|5.0|The CD sticks out in a time dominted when whiny punk rock rules the market. I'm not bashing punk, it's great music when done right (Greenday), but the music out there now is crap. System of a Down has awesome solid rock, with good lyrics and great pace. No two songs are alike and even the slow ones (Spiders), pick up with heavy guitar that fits the mood. By far the best and band I have heard. This CD is a bit lighter than the first, less hardcore rock with more focus on lyrics. Oh yeah, the lyrics are awesome too. They're armenian and their experiences contribute to just about every politically motivated song they make.
B000067G3C|5.0|One of the most highly charged action films since Spielbergs RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the 1994 film SPEED is a model for how action films with fairly realistic situations should be done. Long-Time cinematographer Jan DBont (DIE HARD, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER) got behind the directors chair for this hair-rising suspense thriller that has a high-tech look and a familiar flair to it.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down's first CD and it's pure metal rock. Every song in here, with the exception of Mind, is awesome. Much heavier rock than their second CD and I even think it's better at times. Some songs like Soil and CUBErt simply rock. A must have for any metal fans and a perfect CD for anyone else.
B00005S6K8|3.0|This is mainly a Harrison Ford vehicle that doesn't live up to the original by Billy Wilder with Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart.  Which is a shame since it's a remarkably well-made, smooth romantic comedy.  Julia Ormond is exceedingly charming, and if her leading man doesn't quite deliver his usual suave charm, the excellent cinematography and classy musical score make up for some of the disappointment.<br />The story of Sabrina never fails to charm, though, regardless of the players.  Her awkward dreamer character grows up, and then beguiles and humanizes the awkward, crusty businessman.  Pick up the classic version for a night when a master's work can be appreciated.  This version is light and cheering for a relaxing evening.
B000062TU1|2.0|I finally broke down and watched HP.  An hour into the movie I began to wonder when the really spellbinding stuff was going to come into play.  Unfortunately, it never did.  Here are some of the things I did find interesting in HP: <br />The CG special effects were actually quite good.  However, that alone does not make a movie a good, or even a great, movie.  The quality of the CG merits the two star rating.  <br />Harry turns out to be the \\"chosen one\\" so to speak.  In the world of wizards, he alone has survived an attack by the \\"evil one.\\"  Therefore, he is imminently popular upon arrival at Hogwart's.  In fact, Harry is the teacher's pet of most of the faculty at Hogwart's - in an obvious kind of way.  Everyone knows that teachers have pets, but good teachers keep their pets secret.  When a teacher makes it known who is/are the favorite student(s), those who are not the favorites become alienated.  Not so at Hogwart's.  Harry is the favorite of many teachers, but manages to maintain popularity with most of the other budding mages as well.  <br />Throughout the course of the movie, Harry receives gifts and favors from his teachers that give him an advantage over the other students.  Thus, he is the hero of the day in the sports world of the school, though he was given the best broom on which to fly.  This aspect of the story is atrocious because few are given the finest things in life with which to excel.  A movie of the highest caliber would give us a hero who achieves against all odds without the best the world has to offer.  <br />Virtually everything in the movie was predictable.  I cannot recall one thing that surprised me.  <br />Overall, I consider HP to be a sad commentary on the priorities and fantasies of our culture.  At the end of the movie, I realized I had wasted 2 1/2 perfectly good hours.
0316666343|5.0|I am usually so skeptical of hype. But, like Zadie Smith's White Teeth, sometimes the hype surrounding a bestseller is warranted, as it is with this novel. Alice Sebold so believably inhabits the voice of her 14-year-old narrator, that you can't help but be caught up in the stories she tells you. This is a book that has much broad appeal: it's a family drama, a coming-of-age novel and a mystery. Sebold writes with a graceful hand, and avoids the cliches you think she's going to walk right into. She's filled this book with so many well-developed secondary characters and she paces it really well, so it's quite compelling to follow all these lives through several years.<BR>I was so satisfied that the hype wasn't unfounded; I really loved this book.

B0000025FG|1.0|As an ELO fan, I vividly remember listening to a Chicago rock station the night this album was previewed.  The DJ was deluged with phone calls decrying the band's treachery in joining the disco ranks.  I think that says it all - easily ELO's worst album, with the possible exception of their contributions to the &quot;Xanadu&quot; soundtrack...
0316666343|2.0|The book starts out as a page turner with a clever twist -- the narrator is a murdered teenager. We know who the serial killer is and we see the threads of his downfall begin to weave themselves together as her family unravels in their grief. The early writing is tight and moving. Her imaginative depiction of Susan's multi-faceted Heaven is wonderful. A scene where the narrator meets her sister victims is extremely affecting. There is even a positively portrayed lesbian character. Things are ticking right along when about halfway through the book, the story just goes wandering off into the mists of who knows where, detailing the lives of secondary characters in ways that sidetrack the story and cause it to lose not only its momentum, but also its seeming original premise. It felt as if the writer became bored with her original plans and just went off in another direction. What might be good character exploration done on the side as a research tool to help her write a better story becomes substituted for the story itself. Her mother, precipitated by tragedy out of a marriage she resents, has a very brief and seemingly pointless affair with the detective, who begins as someone important to the plot then simply fades away. Finally, after a series of unlikely and unrelated fantasies (shades of Being John Malkovich!), it just ends. Plop. I found myself correcting her grammar -- mixed verb tenses, misused words like \\"muscle\\" when she must have meant \\"mussel...\\" Nothing spoils a story like finding yourself mentally editing as you read it. If it's well constructed, you probably won't notice the errors...or care.<br />With some solid editorial guidance, this could have been a really good book.
6305265666|5.0|While I wouldn't go as far as calling Drew Barrymore's Danielle a feminist, this is a refreshing, sweet take on the classic fairy tale.  A must for anyone who enjoys romantic dramedies or pretty period pieces.  This is both.<br />The overall theme of this movie is sweetness and idealism.  It's got it's share of villains, but the real challenge for Danielle is class conflict - this is a true 90's Cinderella.  To their credit, the issues aren't done heavy-handedly.  Things fit together with the plot and characters, and if you can succeed in ignoring all the philo-babble, this is a great movie to relax with - after all, you know how it ends.<br />The disparate accents of the multi-national cast (American, Scottish, French, Dutch, British) grate a little, but eventually, this gets lost in the lovely French scenery and particularly expressive faces of actors Barrymore, Dougray Scott, and Anjelica Huston.  While the characters have been a bit updated and fleshed out, they hold few surprises.  Danielle/Cinderella is a free-spirited (but chaste) go-getter with heart and her Prince is pretty dull until he meets her.  They discuss philosophy, education, and social responsibility.  Um, this isn't your grandma's Cinderella.<br />Some changes: The stepsisters figure more prominently in the plot and they're both scene stealers (notice how opposite the sisters are in every way).  Also, no magical elements, but we get Leonardo da Vinci instead, which is a nice touch.<br />A good, entertaining movie that works for everyone - highly recommended.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|I first saw this film when I was 15 (don't ask how!), back then it made an impression on me not just for the satire, but for all of the violence it contained. However, the violence is part of the satire on things such as corruption. <BR>The jist of this film is Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), is an honest hard-working police officer. On his first day in a new precinct he is gunned down by a gang of thugs whilst attempting to arrest one in connection to a robbery.<BR>After his 'death' he is 'reborn' as a cyborg (part man, part machine), and he is now known as 'Robocop'. Despite the boast that his memory has been blanked, not all of it has been. Robocop succeeds in cleaning up the streets of Detroit, but when he begins to remember his former life and his hideous death things start to go terribly wrong. First he attempts to seek out his beloved wife and son, and then he sets out to track down the gang who killed him, thus robbing him of his life and all that mattered to him.<br />Robocop is in a world that he cannot understand, all that he can understand is what is in his program. The world is ugly and hostile, his creators don't care about him, his so-called 'work colleagues' are threatened by him and they later turn on him. His only ally (and connection to his former life) is in Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen), his partner of one day. When fellow officers are ordered to destroy Robocop, she saves him, hides him and helps him in his quest for vengeance.<BR>Though this film is showing it's age (did anyone see the wire in one scene?), it's still an outstanding film. There is much more to this film than a lot of violence, there's the lost paradise. The struggle between good and evil, the search for one's true identity, how far will people go to get ahead in life.<BR>Though the violence may seem over the top at times ( a would-be rapist getting shot in the crotch. Now THAT'S a laugh!), it's all part of the satire. So too, is the fact that the police force is now run (owned?)by a business group. But in this day and age, does that seem so proposterous?<BR>Fantastic DVD, one which sci-fi fans will love.
B00006FXB6|5.0|If you don't already know, QOTSA contains former members of Kyuss. Their musical category of 'stoner rock' is greatly misunderstood. This is their 3rd Full Length. Get this album and work backwords....you will discover so much.<br />The DVD contents alone are worth the cost of this CD. Viedos, live performances and other random footage.<br />For some unknown reason, they used Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters/Nirvana to record this album.  His drumming is very hectic on the album. I just think it is a waste to use Dave and then not have him tour with QOTSA. Almost a tease, just to buy the cd.
B000000OAA|5.0|Perhaps foremost is diversity and Queen was one of few bands that had that in abundance. Certainly their diversity as individual artists and as a group was never more strongly presented than on &quot;Sheer Heart Attack.&quot;  As one familiar with the artistry of Queen since late 1969, I would have to say this is the most diversified CD of the lot.  No one in modern music has ever matched the vocal talent and ability of Freddie Mercury, especially in the first half of Queens career.  His work on &quot;Bring Back Leroy Brown&quot; (and yes, those are all Mercury's vocal tracks) as any professional vocalist would confirm is nothing short of astonishing.  If you are indeed a Queen fan and have the capacity to appreciate true musical genius, &quot;SHA&quot; is a MUST for your collection.  From hard driving rock with soaring guitar solo, to lamenting refrains and melodic ballad, &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; is more than a listening experience.
B000068TPN|4.0|Perhaps the contemporary war film is becoming a tired and near exhausted genre in its current form. After the watershed \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", there really may not be much new to say in a large scale war epic.<br />One might certainly gain this impression based upon the many negative reviews of both \\"Ryan\\" and this film. Those souls have attempted to brand these two films as cliched and retro-patriotically simplistic. Watching this film as well as listening to director/writer Randall Wallace's superb audio commentary, it becomes apparent that \\"Ryan\\" and \\"We Were Soldiers\\" can possibly be labeled as cliched because they are both honest and realistic.  We find an example of this in the dialouge uttered by the dying soldiers who often proclaim \\"Tell my wife I love her.\\" Yes we have heard this time and time again, but that just happens to be frequently what soldiers say in their final moments. Unfortunately when we see the same truth shown too many times, it does become often cliched and redundant. <br />But what else does one want in an honest war film? Perhaps some folks deride this and \\"Ryan\\" in favor of the pretentious new agey pseudo Steinbeck-lite ramblings of Terrence Malick's beautifully photographed but muddled, cold and pompous piece of snobbish fluff that was \\"The Thin Red Line\\".<br />But I digress, \\"We Were Soldiers\\", missing becoming a classic because of its unfortunate timing in coming after \\"Ryan\\" still remains a very very good film.<br />I particulary appreciated Wallace's inclusion of footage that raises the humanity and the courage of the NVA regulars. These are not Hollywood stereotyped villians. These soldiers are equally as brave, pious and devoted as the American soldiers. Wallace achieves this balance without resorting to any political posturing. This becomes especially apparent in many scenes, including a remarkably touching quiet scene in which Gibson's (delivering a fine performance) Hal Moore aknowledges the fact that the enemy prays to Dietyas well.<br />I also value this film's structure. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" shows the homefront as equally as the battlefield. It shows the pre war experience as well as the war and the post war time as well. Wallace, utilizing the real veterans of this battle, seeks to humanize the reality of the war. Again, some might find much of these sequences quaint and simplistic. But they remain true. <br />This film also avoids the cynical, nihilistic and ugly previous portaits of Vietnam soldiers that bombarded us in the '70's, '80's and early '90's. It seemed that the films of DePalma, Stone (except for his excellent \\"Born On The Forth Of July\\"- which might be his most balanced film) sought to tear apart and demonize America through the Vietnam soldier. This film seeks again to give them some dignity and honor and finds it in their devotion to their fellow men (and honor of enemy!).<br />What makes \\"We Were Soldiers\\" a must own as opposed to a simply must see, is Paramount's (usually incredibly stingy in their packaging) inclusion of a great many extras. As stated earlier, Wallace's commentary is most illuminative. Many of the deleted scenes flesh out the emotional and intellectual impact of the film and are worth watching as well.<br />Give this film a try. It is definately a film that honors the veterans of the war. From both sides of the battlefield.
0743216458|5.0|As I read Stephen Ambrose's account of Easy Company, I found myself feeling an overwhelming sense of awe and gratitude for the people who fought for the US, particularly in World War II. To me, Band Of Brothers was an account of how ordinary people can do EXTRA-ordinary things when called upon to do so. These were men who came from very different backgrounds and lived normal, unassuming lives until they were called upon to serve our country. Their bravery, determination, and sacrifice showed the world that an army comprised of non-professional soldiers from a non-totalitarian form of government could not only put up a good fight, they could WIN it. And now, we may be facing a time when many again will be called to take a stand and fight for our republic. I found myself wondering if people today have the &quot;heart&quot; to endure the hardships and face the harsh reality of war then I realized that there had to have been many who wondered the same thing back in 1941. Ever since reading this book and watching the miniseries on HBO, I have an even deeper appreciation for all those who have sacrificed for our freedoms, whether their sacrifice was their body, their lives, or merely their comfort. When you finish Band Of Brothers, I can confidently say Veteran's Day will not be &quot;just&quot; another holiday to you.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Romantic comedies need that perfect couple.  Once you've got Meg Ryan, you're more than halfway there.  Kevin Kline steps up to the plate here, with enchanting results.<br />Kline's stereotypical Frenchman (Luc) is as convincing (that accent!) as he is funny.  His uber-casual, morally lax attitude is well complemented by Ryan's uptight, loquacious American/wannabe-Canadian (Kate).  The movie rolls along at a merry pace - from Canada to Paris to Nice and Provence, all with distinctive, eclectic music.  The locations are beautiful and serve nicely as foils for the wacky partnership of Luc and Kate, as do the songs (in French and English).  Check out the end credits when Kevin Kline sings \\"La Mer.\\"<br />The chemistry between Luc and Kate works like it does in screwball comedies - a lot of bickering sexual tension - but somehow the best and most revealing scenes are the ones where there is no dialogue (Luc and his vine, lost in Paris, train to Nice, Luc's family, dancing).  The script is a little lacking, but Ryan and Kline are charming during these quiet moments.<br />As you can imagine, with all this dualism of French and English, there is a lot of national humor - but I think the best summary of the movie is when Kate, who has lost everything (money, love, passport), wisely realizes, \\"I am without country.\\"  Of course, she means this literally, but that wistfulness conveys more.  The differences between nationalities become irrelevant when it's really about fulfillment and dreams, which aren't bound by country lines.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I really wanted to love this album. I've read the reviews and heard folks asking about it in the shops, raving about how much they had to have it after having heard a friend's copy, seen a live show, or heard something from it on the radio. So, I finally bought a copy.<br />Norah Jones has a wonderful voice, one with shades of Billie Holiday. However, the songs, arrangements, and production don't serve it as well as they could.<br />Most of the songs sound more or less the same - relatively sparse and subdued, in a &quot;we've signed her to a legendary jazz label, so we've got to make her sound serious&quot; kind of way. If you're interested in background listening (this has great potential as a midnight make-out record), that's fine, but I found the unrelenting sameness of each track off putting, to say the least.<br />Norah Jones has got great potential. With better songs, arrangements and production, she could be huge.
0783225970|5.0|Under my own personal opinion; Scarface is the one of the best made movies.  The actors are excellent, full of emotional tenacity, pulling you into the movie with a deep interest.  It's a timeless classic that I have found myself able to watch time and again, without the slightest bit of disapprobation.  Most movies lose their flare after some many viewings, but not Scarface; It's truly priceless!  You'll LOVE it!!!!
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck is magnificent in this true American classic. From start to finish, he keeps you interested, and the pages keep turning. Of Mice and Men defines the true meaning of male friendship and the power of the strong over the weak. This is a book you won't want to put down!
B00003CY6M|4.0|This movie is a delightful surprise!  It is sweet, funny, romantic, charming - and accompishes all that without any blatant sex scenes or foul language - whatta concept... John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are marvelous and totally believable as the two protagonists... I heartily recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys romantic comedy and would like for once not to be assaulted with the usual garbage Hollywood so often wraps a movie around...
B00005JKNC|4.0|This is a pleasant film that is more important for what it isn't than what it is.  There have been many comparisons between this film and the work of legendary director Frank Capra.  That is easy to do because it is a very human story set in the 1940's and it ends with a congressional hearing that is reminiscent of \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\".  However, Capra was always very black and white when it came to good and evil, with his heroes almost saintly and his villains dastardly and despicable.  This film has more gray overtones and flawed characters.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does take it out of the realm of being truly Capraesque.<br />Even more importantly, this film isn't another lowbrow gross out flick by Jim Carrey.  Carrey gives a likeable performance reminiscent of \\"The Truman Show\\", with not a hint of the repugnant and boorish behavior that made him famous.  I can only pray that despite the poor box office of this film, Carrey will attempt to build on this and move in the direction that Robin Williams went, toward more substantial screenplays and real acting.  His next project, \\"The Children of the Dust Bowl\\" is a true story of a professor who set up a school for kids in the Oklahoma dust bowl in the 1930's, so he seems to have changed his script selection criteria.  That would be a blessing as he is far too talented to be wasting his life on body fluid humor.<br />The film itself is schmaltzy and nostalgic, but it gets a little strident at the end as it tries too hard to repudiate the blacklisting and red paranoia of the 1940's and 1950's. The blacklist storyline is discordant with the rest of the film and really adds nothing to the story.  Otherwise, it is an easy story to enjoy, although it is hard for the viewer to believe that anyone in this town could possibly have thought Peter Appleton (Carrey) was really Luke Trimble.  It is as if everyone really knew the truth, but they wanted to deceive themselves.<br />Director Frank Darabont (\\"The Green Mile\\", \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\") does a nice job on the period renderings (except not enough men in hats; hats were the rule for men during that period) with costumes and props that bring the times to life.<br />The acting is very good.  I like Jim Carrey much better as a dramatic actor or a bittersweet comic than as a fatuous chuff.  Carrey is extremely affable as Peter, and plays the romantic parts with Laurie Holden well.  However, he is tentative in the Washington scenes, unable to summon up the resolute defiance necessary for the situation.  Martin Landau is terrific as Luke's father, bringing the character an almost delusional enthusiasm that is simultaneously charming and pathetic.  Laurie Holden also does a nice job of portraying Adele, taking a grounded character and slowly melting her emotionally as she falls in love with Luke/Peter.<br />This is not a great film, but other than the political drum beating it is an agreeable (though improbable) feel good flick.  I rated it a 7/10.  Let's hope this portends a trend in Jim Carrey's career away from the disgusting schlock for which he has made millions.
B000066NW0|5.0|A lot of people are dissing Avril and saying that she's ruining punk music or whatever. Avril's debut LET GO is in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM punk. This is a really well put together POP/ROCK CD. It's excellent. Avril's voice is excellent. So what if her eye-liner is perfect? That doesn't mean she's trying to be a pop star or whatever. She is who she is. As for her questionable guitar skills, who cares?! LET GO speaks for itself. Just take a listen to tracks like &quot;loosing grip&quot;, &quot;complicated&quot;, &quot;sk8er boi&quot;, &quot;tomorrow&quot; and others. You'll hear the talent there. Don't forget Avril is only 17 and has a lot of growing to do. For now her co-writing skills suits where she's at. I think this one of the better pop/rock CDs out there right now. Anyone that likes pop/rock music will like this a whole lot. Avril's no punk, she's as mainstreem as it gets. She could be Pink's bratty little sister.<br />1. Losing Grip 3.5/5<BR>2.

B00005YW4H|1.0|I am a Eva Cassidy fan.  I was told that I might like this CD.  The production and engineering on the album is terrible.  The piano often sounds like the microphone is too far away.  The music is very flat.  The first song on the CD is the only decent song on it.  However, the musicianship and the quality of the recording could have easily been better...
B000002J1U|4.0|Is this Album inferior to the previous two (Led Zep I &amp; II), as the <BR>critics wrote? Rather, I find this album to be of a different genre <BR>i.e. apples and oranges. The circumstances in which this album was  <BR>recorded were different from the first two. They had finished their <BR>second North American tour and were having much success off their <BR>previous recordings and performances, playing in the familiar rauchy <BR>metal blues their fans have come to love. Needing a break the band had <BR>just spent a good vacation in Wales (Bron-Y-Aur). This was a country <BR>estate with no electricity, leaving the band with a period to reflect <BR>on the past and chart out the future. I feel they got a little to close <BR>to the earth (found some inner peace), as is reflected in the <BR>experimental softer, folksy style of the 3rd album. Perhaps this was <BR>even an early &quot;quasi-unplugged&quot; style we'd become more familiar with in <BR>the '80's &amp; 90's. Therefore, if you're looking for traditional Led <BR>Zeppelin's heavy blues then look elsewhere, but, if you're looking for <BR>a genuine attempt at an anternative style different from their earlier <BR>music, then this may be what you want!
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is one of the best modern novels of recent years.  Simple and beautifully written, the book lives up to all the hype you've been reading, and then some.<br />The premise DOES sound hokey -- brutally murdered 13 year old girl looks down from heaven and comments on the lives of her survivors and murderer.  Sophisticated, self-proclaimed &quot;serious&quot; readers will holler &quot;Drivel&quot;, and call it the &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; of the millenium.<br />But to dismiss this novel would be to deny yourself the immense pleasure of reading emotionally charged prose that surprises in every chapter.  The last time I felt so stirred by fiction was when I first read &quot;David Copperfield&quot;  -- it has that much depth of feeling and insight into what we expose ourselves to when we care for other people.<br />You can believe the hype this time, and should confirm for yourself just how good this book is.
B00006FXB6|5.0|The newest effort by the Palm Desert band, Queens of The Stone Age, was released to the world this past week.  After waiting impatiently for its arrival, I walked into the closest record store and grabbed it from the \\"New Release\\" section.  After purchasing..., I threw it into my discman and strolled down the street.  Immediately I was brought to my knees with 'Millionare', the albums first track.  A rerecorded version of a 'Desert Sessions' song, 'Millionare' set the tone for the entire SFTD album.  Tight, High energy, and saturated with the unmistakeable trademark sound that seperates QOTSA from all others.  The next track and first single, 'No One Knows', is the best pop/rock song the band has ever made hands down.  'No One Knows' is is a head bobber.  Filled with enough hooks to catch even the most unenthused music listener, (my own father).  <BR>    The album continues to roll right along through.  Each song is placed in the perfect order.  With sounds of past albums in 'Do it Again', to new sounds 'Another Love Song'  QOSTA have become much more focused in their song writing and it comes out.  There is more of a personal feel to the lyrics as well.  Singer/Guitarist, Josh Homme, Sings in 'Gonna Leave You' \\" She said I'd throw myself away/They're just photo's after all/I can't make You hang around/I can't wash You off my skin\\".  He continues in the next verse, \\"Falling in and out of love/Something sweet to throw away/I want something good to die for/To moake it beautiful to live\\".  It seems that Homme is begining to be more personal in his lyrics.  Where in the past you'd have to guess at meanings, each song holds a  message. Musicaly the group has continued to get better and better with each album.  Everything has come together and come together as a masterpiece.  Rock n' roll has integrity again.  For true rockers, we have been shut out by the \\"Biz\\" and been given nothing.  QOTSA are the future, and 'Songs For The Deaf' is the proof.  This is easily my #1 album of the year.
B000069HKH|1.0|The hype and commercials have done a great job of generating interest in Bruce's new album.  I was caught up in it and bought a copy and regretted it immediately.  This CD is so bland and uneventful that I feel cheated.  I was at least hoping for one or two songs that would make it worth my while.  True fans will rave but the everyday, general music  lover will be let down.
B00005JKMQ|1.0|I have not walked out of a movie since &quot;Time Bandits&quot;. This one was awful- I had no interest in how it ended- Will Smith was fair but the story lacked substance. What a a disappointment.
B00006G8LB|5.0|How can anyone describe spider-man in mere words?This movie is a lot more than an action movie.It has romance and drama.And it combines them all really good.Best superhero movie ever.Period.
0062502182|5.0|Who doesn't love to dream? But who dares following one? The real few who do so end up making it big, and 'The Alchemist' emphasizes that fact.<br />'The Alchemist' is a very important novel of our times, veritably a modern classic. The story is about a shepherd in Spain who dreams about hidden treasures in Egypt, and sets about seeking it. At times one might tend to think that this book is hinging too much on the occult, but a deeper analysis proves beyond doubt that one can relate to these things in one's own life... at least that was true with me.<br />The story is replete with advice for any person who follows dreams. But the most important aspect of this book is the author's contention that the true alchemist is the pure of heart. The novel sags not for a moment, and has as many twists that one can expect in life. And the ending was truly extraordinary.<br />Call it a fairy tale, call it a book steeped into magic and philosophy - end of the day, you cannot deny the fact that this book has affected you immensely, that it has set you thinking, evaluating about life, and the mysterious world of dreams, intuition and the will to follow dreams whatever the odds.<br />A modern classic like no other - short and sweet yet profoundly touching, this book is a marvel.
B000069AUI|5.0|To think the guys that blessed the world with one of the early millenium's greatest albums, \\"Parachutes,\\" almost broke up because they thought they had reached their creative pinnacle.  After \\"Parachutes\\" became a commercial radio staple and the album sold off the charts, this highly intelligent band believed they had nothing better to offer mankind and were on the verge of splitting up.  Thank heavens they decided to give it one more shot.  \\"A Rush of Bloof to the Head\\" exceeds Coldplay's freshman release.  It shows the musical variety this band is capable of.  While \\"Parachutes\\" is a great album, it's tracks sound very similar to each other, with the same melodramatic overtones and guitar effects.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is highly creative and beautifully orchestrated.  Listeners wanting to hear the same sound of \\"Parachutes\\" on this album need to just stick with the single, \\"In My Place.\\"  The rest of the album conjures memories of \\"O. K. Computer\\" and \\"Man Who.\\"  It shows that this band is searching for their definitive sound and feel, which is a good thing, as they are not trying to appeal to the commercial music masses and wind up on TRL's top ten.  With \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" we can see and hear that these lads are quickly emerging as one of music's most innovative and genuine bands, if not the premier group from a highly lucrative list of British rock.
B0000088ZV|5.0|East of Eden released a several albums, 1969's Mercator Projected being their very first album, and it's also said to be their best. The album was originally released on Deram, the same label that gave us the Moody Blues. Mercator Projected is an excellent example of prog rock at its beginnings. You get psych, jazz rock, and Middle Eastern styles. A couple of rockers, some jams, some atmospheric numbers, phased vocals à la The Beatles' \\"I Am the Walrus\\", strange electronic effects. The band featured violinst Dave Arbus, who was also the same guy who played on The Who's classic \\"Baba O'Reily\\" (known as \\"Teenage Wasteland\\" for those who don't remember the actual title). The rest of East of Eden at that time also consisted of bassist Steve York (who jumped ship after this album for Manfred Mann Chapter III), saxist Ron Caines, guitarist and vocalist Geoff Nicholson, and drummer Dave Dufort (although the album misspelled his name as \\"Dufont\\"). Apparently the band wasn't exactly known for keeping steady lineup, and within a couple of years, they switched over to Harvest Records and went for a more country-influenced sound. Some of the best songs on Mercator Projected includes \\"Northern Hemisphere\\", \\"Isadora\\", \\"Bathers\\", \\"Moth\\", and the instrumental \\"In the Stable of the Sphinx\\". In regards to \\"In the Stable of the Sphinx\\", I just recently acquired an album released on Elektra Records called The Zodiac - Cosmic Sounds (The Zodiac were basically Paul Beaver, and various L.A. session musicians, and a narrator who sounded like Jim Morrison, doing psychedelic rock, with Moog synthesizer, ethnic instruments, and naturally rock instruments), released in 1967. One piece was called \\"Taurus\\" and it sounded awfully familiar to me. Well, it sounds like East of Eden borrowed the theme to \\"Taurus\\" during the slow part of \\"In the Stable of the Sphinx\\". British groups seemed very aware of The Zodiac - Cosmic Sounds at that time (Scottish band Writing on the Wall did a full-on cover of\\"Aries\\" off their 1969 album The Power of the Picts). The only weak spot on this album is part of \\"Centaur Woman\\" which shows that Steve York is going just a little too far on his bass guitar. But the vocal parts of the song is more bluesy than the rest of the album, and the vocals were provided by Ron Caines, who isn't normally the band's vocalist. And if the Middle Eastern influences of the album isn't enough, the back of the album shows the band members all dressed in Egyptian garb and makeup. So if the thought of early prog with jazz rock, psych, and Middle Eastern styles sounds interesting to you, you're bound to enjoy Mercator Projected.
B000002BBY|5.0|I am a HUGE Oasis fan, and although I am a bit biased, I believe this is one of the greatest albums of the 90s (as is Definitely Maybe-stunning debut).  Many Americans have only heard &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; which are both EXCELLENT songs, but (What's The Story?) Morning Glory is full of songs just as incredible.  &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger&quot; is the only song on which Noel does lead vocals on this album, and his voice absolutely shines.  If you enjoy this song, check out &quot;Familiar To Millions&quot; because the live version is simply amazing with the whole crowd singing the chorus.  &quot;(What's The Story?) Morning Glory&quot; and &quot;Some Might Say&quot; are also some of my favorite songs on the record, but as I said, there is not a song on the album that is the slightest bit disappointing.  I have been listening to Oasis for years now, since this record came out, and I haven't gotten tired of listening to this, or any of their other albums.  Although I love every Oasis album, if you want to get into them, listen to WTSMG; it will make you a fan for life!  <br />Here's fun fact of information:  As of September 2002, (What's The Story?) Morning Glory is STILL in the top 100 on the UK charts (#67 and climbing), as it was released 7 years ago!<br />Recommended: Oasis: Definitely Maybe, Be Here Now (under-rated), The Masterplan, Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants (also under-rated), and Familiar To Millions-DVD.

B00006AW2O|5.0|12 X 5 is the first Rolling Stones album I ever bought as a young teenager. It was so blues and gusty, with the appropriate amount of nasty. God, I loved this album. I wore the grooves out, literally. What made it great was the almost absence of original Rolling Stones material, and the total inclusion of terrific black American classics - Chuck Berry's \\"Around &amp; Around\\", Jerry Ragovoy's \\"Time Is On My Side\\", Bobby Womack's \\"It's All Over Now\\", and Resnick and Young's \\"Under the Boardwalk\\".  As a novel idea, soul and R &amp; B hits were transformed into rock songs on this recording. Enter into a new era of interpretation as these wild horses were let loose on an unsuspecting, naive world. The Stones just blew the doors off conformity. Jump forward some thirty years later and again I'm at the threshold of a first - my only Rolling Stones CD and appropriately enough, it's 12 X 5. Loving remastered by ABKCO, they have developed a new system for recreating the original analog sounds from the \\"we were there\\" vaults. Lucky us.  The resulting deeds take you back to a perfect, simplistic clarity. \\"Empty Heart\\" and \\"2120 S. Michigan Ave\\", penned under the Nanker Phelge alias, revel in soulful harmonica, pithy guitars, and trains arriving on time. The album 12 X 5 is like the soundtrack to a black and white Americana with ole' English subtitles. All delivered in a ruffian, juvenile style. Even the packaging resembles the authentic original. Class and quality makes for a perfect combination. No apologies, no excuses, no explanation. In a singular tongue, 12 X 5 speaks volumes.
0930289528|5.0|If this is not the best graphic novel ever, then it is definitely one of the best. The art and the plot and even the songs all fit neatly together. If you have never read a graphic novel, this is a good place to start. Having said that, this deals with adult themes and is not suitable for pre-pubescents.
B000002Z71|5.0|This collaboration between Gene Clark and Carla Olson is nothing short of wonderous. Two unique voices blend perfectly in a pleasing, sometimes downright haunting manner, particularly on Clark's arrangement of &quot;Fair and Tender Ladies.&quot; In truth, there's not a bad track on this recording. Gene and Carla's rendition of John Fogerty's &quot;Almost Saturday Night&quot; is as pleasing in its own way as Dave Edmunds' very different, very upbeat improvement on Fogerty a few years earlier. Looking for polished, heavily produced, product? Look elsewhere. Looking for pure, honest music played with depth, heart and sincerity? Look no further. &quot;So Rebellious a Lover&quot; is an overlooked classic crying out to be rediscovered.
6304057709|5.0|This remains one of the best, most lovingly-made films I've ever seen.  Dare I say that it's better than the Jane Austen novel that inspired it?  The scenery is glorious, the music is beautifully haunting, the acting superb.  The story is beautifully told.  Best of all, it features the wisdom found in all of Austen's novels: know your own heart, and follow it.  Have both passion and reason, in moderation.  Remember that charisma does not always equal substance.  Best of all, it proves that good things come to those who deserve them.
0783226160|3.0|What is there to say? It's gross, disgusting and the main character is a \\"P-I-G, pig\\". It is also the funniest modern college comedy out there. The cast of then unknowns have pretty much all gone on to bigger and better things. Belushi steals the show and his level of physical comedy in this movie shows him at his best and funniest.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Pixar has created another awesome film that both kids and adults will love.  [They have a serious talent for that!]<br />Monsters, Inc is fabulous - witty, fast paced, and fun for the whole family.  The characters are interesting and lovable [mostly :) ] and the plot is just too cute.  They way the characters play off each other is funny and brilliant and the movie is just full of hysterical dialog and satire [in typical Pixar comic genius style].<br />Our young daughter loves this film, but we love it even more.  We saw this a couple of times in the theater and look forward to enjoying our DVD version - which includes MANY extras [a whole disc worth] that are fun.<br />Monsters, Inc is easily the best animated film released in recent years.  This is one you won't mind the kids watching over and over and over and....
0440217563|4.0|This series of books has held my undivided attention since I started reading them. The historical details, and the ways that Claire, a modern woman, deals with life in the past are incredible. It's almost like being there. My problem with the series comes from Claire's sometime submission (which is not as prevelant in Voyager as it was in Dragonfly). The problem I had with Voyager, while it is a great adventure story, there is just too much adventure for it to be believable. That much stuff could not happen to any one set of people in 10 lifetimes let alone in less than 1 year. (Diana - Can't they just be allowed one day of peace!)  Also, the way characters keep popping back up.  The world was smaller in the 1700's, but not that small.  I just couldn't buy that the guy Claire meets in the jungle in Hispanola and rescues her is someone that knows Jamie from a chance encounter at the brothel in Scotland.  Too farfetched and convenient.  I don't mean to pan the book. I couldn't stop turning the pages to see how they were going to get out of the next dilemma - it was just too much. I really like these characters, but I can't decide if I will read the Drums of Autum now that the series seems to be getting too over the top.
B00003CX96|5.0|\\"Breaking Away\\" is a movie with an unusually wide scope of topics.  Its plot is not confined to one theme (a seemingly-doomed romance or good versus evil, for example) but instead almost seems to tackle life itself; or at least, life as it is for bike-riding, Italy-emulating Dave and his three close friends.<BR>Each of the four pals gets his fair share of attention, and almost without noticing the viewer comes to knowand like, for all their quirksthem all.  They are united by an obvious life-long friendship, and (although they would never admit it) a thinly-veiled desire to somehow make their way into college, or at least get a job.<BR>All except for Dave, who has multiple additional goals jockying for position in the forefront of his mind: to become a champion bike-racer, earn his father's respect (or at least un-earn his father's shame) and even win the heart of a certain college girl.<BR>Unfortunately for him, he's going to learn a bit about reality along the way.<BR>Every character in this film, no matter how minor, is fully developed and multi-faceted.  Enjoyably poignant moments, realistic hilarity and quite a few exhilirating competitions make this film both amusing and wonderfully human.  I very highly recommend this, to anyone at all.
B00005QG9J|3.0|I heard this album ine month before it was out (heh, internet of course:)) and i was surprised. i didn't know what to think. it was just...starnge. songs are slower, moodier and after few rounds in my CD player i thought  - this is its advantage. like wooow!!! songs like aqueuous transmission, are you in, warning, 11am, cirles, under my umbrella are great. and i must say that i'm a big fun of SCIENCE and i wish that Brandon & co would sth like SCIENCE again but i got used to what they are serving the world now. they change their style just like red hot chili peppers (it's evolution baby ;)). go ahead, buy it, what r u waiting for?
0316666343|5.0|This was a beautiful read. It was much better than I anticipated.  This book is emotional and graphic, and it could upset people who have survived sexual assault or rape.  However, if the reader is willing to get through the gritty parts of the book, beauty awaits, even in the \\"life\\" of this poor narrator.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Pearl Harbor has been bombed again but this time not by the Japanese.  This time the culprits were prefabricated Hollywood melodrama.<br />This movie is an appalling bore.  The main characters are wooden and uninteresting.<br />The selling point of the movie is the high-tech special effects.  Even this is unconvincing when aerial dogfights between the adversaries are much more akin to \\"Star Wars\\" than World War 2.<br />This movie should be locked away forever.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Oh my god, the Queens strike again, and they have struck hard.  Not a bad song on this one.  They have somehow managed to mix their first 2 albums, s/t and Rated R, into a hard rock masterpiece.  QOTSA just keeps getting better, refining and fine tuning their craziness into an entire albums worth of rawk.  The label stoner rock would do such a disservice to this album and band, this is just frickin' awesome, no matter what you call it.  Buy it now! The gods of rock command you to shell out the money, and while you're at it, get the limited editon cd w. the bonus dvd, its great too.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30STM is a much needed release from the constant droning of pop and nu metal that is now flooding the music scene.  It is so refreshing to see an artistic and almost metaphysical view in rock music.  30STM's haunting melodies and crushing guitars bring forth the best aspects echoing tones of David Bowie, Tool, and Pink Floyd.  I hope this band stays around for awhile!  Its a MUST BUY!
B000069AUI|2.0|Having successfully completed copying Radiohead and the Dave Mathews Band for Parachutes, Coldplay now sets its sights on Tom Petty at his worst. I really tried to like this album, thinking the band would by now find their own sonic identity. After three beginning-to-end listenings, I hope they haven't.<br />Earns first star for In My Place, second for cover design.
0316666343|5.0|This was a great book.  I really liked it, and I'm really picky about books.  I will<BR>give out one warning.  This book is for people who do not get sick really easy. <BR>It's not ALL gruesome, but just a little bit is.  This book goes along great with<BR>what's going on in our world today with all the kidnappings and killings of young<BR>girls. <BR> My favorite character was Lindsey Salmon, Susie Salmon's little sister.  I<BR>loved the part about where she went into Mr. Harvey's house and she took the<br />drawing he made of the dug-out.  <BR> Anyone with a TV sees all the young girls being kidnapped and then<BR>being found later, dead in the middle of nowhere.  It makes me think as a<BR>teenage girl, \\"Hey, this could happen to me.\\"
B0000508U6|5.0|I remember when this CD first came out in 2000, Amazon was constantly (it seemed to me) recommending this CD to me to buy.  I finally bought it around the end of 2000, listened to it all the way through once, and then put it in my stack of CDs.  However, recently I was listening to my Radiohead CDs, and I decided to give \\"Parachutes\\" another spin.  It was like \\"Whoa, this is a great CD!\\"  This CD really gets better and better after every listen.  I don't think that Coldplay sounds like Radiohead although like Radiohead, they do write their own songs and play their own instruments (what a novel concept!).  Coldplay is more acoustic sounding and melancholier than Thom Yorke and the boys.  All the tracks are good, but the best ones are \\"Shiver\\", \\"Spies\\", \\"Sparks\\", \\"Yellow\\", and \\"Trouble\\".<br />Highly recommended and also check out the recently released \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" which may be even better than \\"Parachutes\\", which is quite an accomplishment in itself.
B00006AW2E|4.0|With the release of the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material), there is now mass confusion about the Out Of Our Heads releases.  Allow me to clarify for you:<br />There are 3 Out Of Our Heads Releases (all were released with lower case titles):<BR>July 30, 1965 - U.S. London Records vinyl out of our heads<BR>     (the heads cover with Keith at center)<BR>September 24, 1965 - U.K. Decca Records vinyl out of our heads<BR>     (the hallway cover with Brain at front)<BR>December 3, 1965 - U.S. London Records vinyl december's children (and everybody's)<BR>     (the hallway cover with Brain at front)<br />This new remastered SACD is the September 24, 1965 U.K. Decca Records vinyl Out Of Our Heads release.  This version of Out Of Our Heads added She Said Yeah, Talkin' Bout You, Oh Baby, Heart Of Stone, and I'm Free.  The UK release did not include the following tracks that were on the U.S. release: The Last Time, I'm All Right, Satisfaction, Play With Fire, Spider And The Fly, and One More Try.  It was the first UK stereo release - actually reprocessed simulated stereo - and used the same cover that would be used for the U.S. December's Children cover.<br />Note: ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog when Allen Klein became their manager in the 70s.  The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever).  But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material.  With these remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio.  I guess if we had these 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of just our tiny little World.<br />You must buy all 3 releases to get all the tracks, although if you bought the 2 U.S. releases + the earlier U.S. release The Rolling Stones, Now! you would get everything on this U.K. Out Of Our Heads release.<br />Here is a listing of which tracks are on which release:<BR>U.S. Out Of Our Heads tracks<BR>.....The Last Time<BR>.....I'm All Right<BR>.....Satisfaction<BR>.....Play With Fire<BR>.....The Spider And The Fly<BR>.....One More Try<BR>U.S. Out Of Our Heads &amp; U.K. Out Of Our Heads tracks<BR>.....Mercy Mercy<BR>.....Hitch Hike<BR>.....That's How Strong My Love Is<BR>.....Good Times<BR>.....Cry To Me<BR>.....The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man<BR>U.K. Out Of Our Heads tracks<BR>.....Oh, Baby (we got a good thing going)<BR>.....Heart Of Stone<BR>U.K. Out Of Our Heads &amp; U.S. December's Children tracks<BR>.....She Said Yeah<BR>.....Gotta Get Away<BR>.....Talkin' `Bout You<BR>U.S. December's Children tracks<BR>.....I'm Free<BR>.....You Better Move On<BR>.....Look What You've Done<BR>.....The Singer Not The Song<BR>.....Route 66<BR>.....Get Off Of My Cloud<BR>.....As Tears Go By<BR>.....Blue Turns To Grey<BR>.....I'm Moving On<br />The U.K. Out Of Our Heads tracks were recorded during 1964-5 as follows:<br />1964: Oct 27 - Nov 2 at RCA Studios in Hollywood<BR>.....Hitch Hike<BR>.....Oh Baby (we got a good thing going)<BR>.....Heart Of Stone<BR>May 10, 1965 at Chess Studios in Chicago<BR>.....That's How Strong My Love Is<BR>.....Mercy, Mercy<BR>.....Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man<BR>May 11-12, 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood<BR>.....Good Times<BR>.....Cry To Me<BR>Sep 6-7, 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood<BR>.....I'm Free<BR>.....She Said Yeah<BR>.....Gotta Get Away<br />This information comes from &quot;It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones&quot; by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.
B000002H70|5.0|The Cure is one of those bands that I am very familiar with thanks to my older sister's love for them and especially for Robert Smith.  I was familiar with some of their songs like \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Friday I'm in Love\\", but I really didn't know much more than that.  Funny thing has happened to me as I have gotten older.  I have found myself getting into the bands that my sister was listening to over 15 years ago like the Smiths, the Butthole Surfers, and the Cure.  I knew that this CD was going to be good by reading all the positive reviews here, but my God, I did not know it was going to be THAT good!<br />From the first minute of track 1, \\"Plainsong\\", to the end of track 12, \\"Untitled\\", this is 72 minutes of some of the greatest music I have ever heard.  \\"Plainsong\\" in itself, is a song that instantly gave me chills when I first heard it.  Just a completely unreal song!  It gets better and better (if that is possible) as the CD goes on.  \\"Love Song\\", \\"Pictures of You\\", \\"Lullaby\\", \\"Same Deep Water as You\\", \\"Fascination Street\\", and \\"Disintegration\\" as well as \\"Plainsong\\" are all the top-notch tracks; however, the rest of the tracks are solid...there is really not a weak track on this CD.  As others have said, it is a very dark CD, but it is one that you can listen to regardless of the weather outside (although it is appreciated better if the weather outside is rain).  If you are getting into the Cure for the first time, you will definitely need to buy this CD (although buying \\"Staring at the Sea\\" and \\"Galore\\" would also be great starter-kit Cure CDs).  After listening to this CD, you will want to get more Cure.  There is no question in my mind that after hearing this work that Robert Smith is one of the greatest musicians of all-time.  I have a substantial CD collection and this CD ranks right up there with \\"London Calling\\", \\"OK Computer\\", \\"Siamese Dream\\", and \\"Mezzanine\\" as one of the greatest in my collection.

B00006AW2F|3.0|There is some confusion here about which version of Metamorphosis has been released. Although the Amazon.com listing I have seen online shows 14 tracks, the version I received and all the versions I have seen in the stores have all 16 tracks. Here are the details on both versions, although I am quite sure the 16 track European version is what has been released, not the American 14 track version that was first released on vinyl.<br />With the release of the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material), it helps to clarify the confusion about the U.S. and U.K./European releases of the original vinyl Metamorphosis.<br />There are 2 Metamorphosis versions, both released on June 6, 1975:<BR>U.S. ABKCO vinyl with 14 tracks<BR>U.K. /European Decca vinyl with 16 tracks<br />This new remastered SACD is the 16 track U.K./European ABKCO vinyl release. It includes the two extra tracks that were included on the U.K./European vinyl release (Somethings Just Stick In Your Mind and We're Wastin' Time). There are several things worth noting about these tracks, for example several tracks are actually Mick backed by the Andrew Loog Oldham Orchestra, not the Stones themselves (I've marked these below with a #).  Of special interest is this version of Memo From Turner is the only version ever released with the Stones backing Mick (The Performance soundtrack version has Mick backed by studio musicians, which included Jimmy Page). I have noted the specifics below.<br />Note: ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog when Allen Klein was released as their manager in 1972. The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including both of these very controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever).  But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material.  With these remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio.  I guess if we had these 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of just the Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the World.<br />The tracks were recorded from 1964-70 as follows:<BR>Jun 10-11, 1964 at Chess Studios in Chicago<BR>.....Don't Lie To Me (a Chuck Berry song, STILL wrongly credited to Jagger & Richards)<BR>Jun 29 - Jul 7, 1964 at Regent Sound and Decca Studios in London<BR>.....#Try A Little Harder (with Jimmy Page)<BR>.....#Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind (with Jimmy Page)<BR>Jul, 1964 at Regent Sound in London<BR>.....#Heart Of Stone (Metamorphosis has the only release of this version)<BR>Aug 31 - Sep 1, 3, 4, 1964 at Pye and Decca Studios in London<BR>.....#We're Wasting Time<BR>.....#(Walking Thru the) Sleepy City<BR>.....#Each And Every Day Of The Year<BR>Feb late, 1965 at Decca Studios in London<BR>.....#I'd Much Rather Be With The Boys (written for Bob Crewe commemorating his hit)<BR>May 6, 1966 at Pye Studios in London<BR>.....#Out Of Time (Mick backed by studio musicians)<BR>Nov 9-26, 1966 at Olympic and Pye Studios in London<BR>.....If You Let Me<BR>May 13-21, 1968 at Olympic Studios in London<BR>.....Downtown Suzie<BR>Jun 28, 1968 at Olympic Studios in London<BR>.....Family<BR>Nov 17, 1968 at Olympic Studios in London<BR>.....Memo From Turner<BR>Jun 10 - Jul 2, 1969 at Olympic Studios in London<BR>.....Jiving Sister Fanny<BR>.....I Don't Know Why<BR>Ju1 14-15, 1970 at Olympic Studios in London<BR>.....I'm Going Down (with Stephen Stills)<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own<BR>collection.
B000005RFI|5.0|THIS REMASTERED VERSION OF PARANOID,SABBATH`S BEST STUDIO) HAS JUST SO MUCH BETTER SOUND QUALITY THAN THE ORIGINAL THAT IT MAKE THE EXTRA MONEY WORTH IT.THIS WAS PUT OUT WAY BEFORE OZZY BECAME SUCH A BLITHERING IDIOT AND MADE THE SHOW THE OSBORNES THAT MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE A TOTAL BRAIN DEAD MESS.I JUST WISH THAT OZZY WOULD HAVE STAYED OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT BECAUSE THEY REALLY MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE SOME KIND OF JACKASS.BUY THIS CD,BECAUSE IT IS BY FAR THE BEST OF SABBATH.
B00006AW2S|5.0|With the release of the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material), there is now mass confusion about the Out Of Our Heads releases.  Allow me to clarify for you:<br />There are 3 Out Of Our Heads Releases (all were released with lower case titles):<BR>July 30, 1965 - U.S. London Records vinyl out of our heads<BR>     (the heads cover with Keith at center)<BR>September 24, 1965 - U.K. Decca Records vinyl out of our heads<BR>     (the hallway cover with Brain at front)<BR>December 3, 1965 - U.S. London Records vinyl december's children (and everybody's)<BR>     (the hallway cover with Brain at front)<br />This new remastered SACD is the July 30, 1965 - U.S. London Records vinyl out of our heads release.  This version of included include the following tracks that were not to be on the U.K. release: The Last Time, I'm All Right, Satisfaction, Play With Fire, Spider And The Fly, and One More Try.  The U.K. version added She Said Yeah, Talkin' Bout You, Oh Baby, Heart Of Stone, and I'm Free.<br />Note: ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog when Allen Klein became their manager in the 70s.  The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever).  But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material.  With these remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio.  I guess if we had these 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of just our tiny little World.<br />You must buy all 3 releases to get all the tracks, although if you bought the 2 U.S. releases + the earlier U.S. release The Rolling Stones, Now! you would get everything on this U.K. Out Of Our Heads release.<br />Here is a listing of which tracksare on which release:<BR>U.S. Out Of Our Heads tracks<BR>.....The Last Time<BR>.....I'm All Right<BR>.....Satisfaction<BR>.....Play With Fire<BR>.....The Spider And The Fly<BR>.....One More Try<BR>U.S. Out Of Our Heads &amp; U.K. Out Of Our Heads tracks<BR>.....Mercy Mercy<BR>.....Hitch Hike<BR>.....That's How Strong My Love Is<BR>.....Good Times<BR>.....Cry To Me<BR>.....The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man<BR>U.K. Out Of Our Heads tracks<BR>.....Oh, Baby (we got a good thing going)<BR>.....Heart Of Stone<BR>U.K. Out Of Our Heads &amp; U.S. December's Children tracks<BR>.....She Said Yeah<BR>.....Gotta Get Away<BR>.....Talkin' `Bout You<BR>U.S. December's Children tracks<BR>.....I'm Free<BR>.....You Better Move On<BR>.....Look What You've Done<BR>.....The Singer Not The Song<BR>.....Route 66<BR>.....Get Off Of My Cloud<BR>.....As Tears Go By<BR>.....Blue Turns To Grey<BR>.....I'm Moving On<br />The album includes the most famous of all Stones tracks (Satisfaction) as well as The Last Time (one of their most enduring compositions).  The U.S. Out Of Our Heads tracks were recorded during 1964-5 as follows:<br />1964: Oct 27 - Nov 2 at RCA Studios in Hollywood<BR>.....Hitch Hike<BR>1965: Jan 17-18 &amp; Feb 17 at RCA Studios in Hollywood<BR>.....The Last Time<BR>.....Play With Fire<BR>Live in the UK on March 6 (Empire in Liverpool), 7 (Palace in Manchester), or 16 (Granada in Greenford)<BR>.....I'm All Right<BR>May 10, 1965 at Chess Studios in Chicago<BR>.....That's How Strong My Love Is<BR>.....Mercy, Mercy<BR>.....Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man<BR>May 11-12, 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood<BR>.....Satisfaction<BR>.....Good Times<BR>.....Cry To Me<BR>.....The Spider And The Fly<BR>.....One More Try<br />This information comes from &quot;It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones&quot; by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.
B00000269M|4.0|After coming off an album that sells 48 million copies around the world, you'd have to expect Michael Jackson to become batty.<BR>Aside from his striking physical transformation on this album's cover art, \\"Bad\\", the followup to the one and only \\"Thiller\\", shamelessy rips off the formula of MJ's signature mega-megasmash to cheesy yet pleasureable results.<br />\\"Bad\\" with it's horns and synth beats and Velvetta-dipped lyrics (\\"Your butt is mine!\\") along with it's unintentionally hilariously corny video is so cheesy you love it! But it's trademark MJ with all the \\"hee-hees\\" and \\"sha'mons\\" you can handle. You gotta love it. The feel-good \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" and \\"Another Part Of Me\\" were purely radio-friendly pop trifles but fun pop songs nevertheless. The CHEESY \\"Speed Demon\\" suffers from a cornball premise but wins with a funky bass line and the synth changes. Again, it's the chessiness you love. The lush but lightweight ballad \\"Liberian Girl\\" is deliberatly a rip of \\"Thiller\\"'s WAAYYY superior \\"Lady In My Life\\" but it works. The preachy \\"Man In The Mirror\\" actually still lifts you with it's soaring gospel choir vocals (courtsey of Andreae Heard's famed choir) and it's while listening to this classic you realize that it was the precussor to R. Kelly's \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\". This album's most inspired moment, no doubt. The sappy but pretty pop ballad \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" has a nice chrous and a dramatic quality with Michael dueting with Sidaeh Garrett( longtime sessionist/Quincy Jones protege/ future Brand New Heavies frontwoman). \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is yet another cornball classic. It's jittery synth beats and urgent vocals(\\"Annie are you OK/Are you OK Annie\\"-CLASSIC!!!) makes you wanna do that smooth lean MJ busted in the classic video for the song. The testy \\"Leave Me Alone\\" is second-rate to me but the video was groundbreaking but it's \\"Dirty Diana\\" that actually breaks through the cheese. The first track to show the dark side of Michael (before \\"Scream\\") with testy vocals and a raging guitar solo from Stephen Stevens, Billy Idol's guitarist at the time. Is this song a take on \\"Billie Jean\\". No doubt! But it's still the best track on \\"Bad\\" and shows MJ's most sincere moment on here. And the video,AGAIN, classic!<br />\\"Bad\\" was dimissed by many critics who thought the album was nothing compared to \\"Thiller\\"(they were sort of right) since this album was so formulaic and cheesy but it's still likeable and fun. Five of the tunes easily hit #1(title track; \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\"; \\"Man In The Mirror\\"; \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\"; \\"Dirty Diana\\") and the album sold eight million copies in the US(paling to the 26 million that \\"Thiller\\" sold over here). And MJ was still the hottest thing at the time.<BR>But...I would like to dispell some little-known trivia about \\"Bad\\". Turns out that \\"Bad\\" was originally meant to be a collabration between Mikey's arch rival Prince but Prince rejected the song for it's cheesiness. \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" was originally meant to be a duet with Barbara Striesand but after she turned on it, Whitney Houston was offered the gig but she too turned on the song. And Quincy Jones HATED \\"Smooth Criminal\\", MJ insisted on recording anyway!<BR>And...MJ actually thought that \\"Bad\\" was going to outsell \\"Thiller\\" and Mike was reportedly crushed when it only(only?!) sold 8 million copies and didn't win any Grammys. Yup, there's a lot to this album that went on behind the scences!<br />Yet although it's not as masterful as the flawless \\"Off The Wall\\" and the pop fantasy \\"Thiller\\", \\"Bad\\" is a fun, nostogalstic '80s MJ ride.
B00006FXB6|5.0|In the midst of an awful era in music comes the new Queens of the Stone Age cd, giving me hope that popular music could actually be good again. The album is diverse and heavy. Using three different singers, the band brings many different styles to the table. Any fan of any form of rock and roll would love this cd. Some songs are heavier and more metal like, some show more punk influence, and some are more melodic, but all of it is rock, and good rock at that. Buy this cd now.
6305878323|5.0|My 2 year old LOVES this movie!!!  I bought this hoping we could share it, and it has been a HUGE hit!  The music, actors, and animation are perfect for adults and children.  But be warned, my daughter was so excited dancing with the movie, she danced right into a wall.  She's fine now, and still loves it, and just can't help but get up and dance around the house whenever it's on.  It's a little long at 139 minutes, but when everyone is happy, it goes by quickly.
6304712936|4.0|Many people have written that Amazon.com has the wrong MPAA rating for the film. This DVD edition is R because it is the director's cut with deleted scenes back in, one of which features nudity. That is why it is not PG. The people who have written that the wrong rating has been listed simply did not realize that this is a director's cut. Not being clearly stated anywhere on the page that is understandable.
0066620996|5.0|What a great book. What I like most is that Good to Great reveals that the real key to a companies success is it's PEOPLE!Build the people and the people will build the company.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Collecting all of Michael Cretu's Enigma albums and don't want to miss out of this one. Also a huge fan of his wife Sandra (and his band 'Cretu and Their') starting back in the mid '80s back before there was an Enigma. Sandra has a cult following outside of the United States (Europe and the rest of the world) and is considered and worshipped like Madonna and Paul Ardul at that time. If you loved Enigma then you should dabble into the music by Michael Cretu's wife Sandra. My wife and I and friends and family members consider her as one of our favorite female singer ever!
B00005JKNF|5.0|\\"Gosford Park\\" is one of the few movies that I would enjoy seeing a second time.  In fact, it might take two viewings to catch all the visual and verbal nuances of the production.  Fans of the PBS series \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" will enjoy this mystery.  We are treated to views of two worlds: The wealthy houseparty guests with their secrets, their world-weariness, and their compromises, contrasted with the herd of servants who tend to their every need, and spend any spare time gossiping about their employers.  There's a sweet scene as one of the guests, a well-known entertainer, plays the piano and sings.  Most of the guests ignore him, but the servants gather near the doors and windows and stand entranced, swept away by the romantic music.<br /><br />  Maggie Smith plays an aging relative who needs money, but who smacks her lips over a good breakfast and still enjoys the sensual side of life.  Hers is only one of many excellent performances.  \\"Gosford Park\\" is a can't miss, especially for the Anglophiles among us.  Highly recommended.
B00006AUIG|4.0|(I only gave this three stars because I hold very high standards for five.) This *is* a very good movie. Very creepy. Do not do what I just did and start it at 3am because you cannot sleep and are home alone. So very, very alone. Very alone with creepy noises emanating from your apartment building. Brrr. So yes, this movie definitely has \\"creeptitude\\" and scary atmosphere out the wazoo. Recommended if you are having problems getting too much sleep, or simply dislike taut psychological creepy thrillers in the dead of night. Double brrr.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Just when the world seemed to be overrun by fat guys covered in tattoos acting tough and little guys in garage bands with overly produced and contrived albums, a breath of raw, unfiltered, heavy air has come down from the heavens.  It's rumored that Led Zeppelin had a baby with the MC5 during the Led Zeppelin II sessions, and Black Sabbath adopted the child. Now all grown up, and going by the name &quot;Songs Of The Deaf&quot;, the album is a masterpiece without a moment of down time. Showcasing the talents of three vocalists each with their own style, it shows just what can happen when artists sit down to just make music, not try and save the world (thank you bono) or show off to girls (thank you brandon boyd). It's one of those albums that need to be played loud, because as hendrix put it &quot;music is magic&quot; and it'll take some magic to drown out Ja-Rule's latest disaster with some other girl blaring from the civic next to you at the stoplight.
B000059XUI|4.0|After the monumental success of the first Superman film, there naturally had to be a sequel.  Richard Lester was tapped to direct Superman's second big screen outting (although original Superman director Richard Donner did film some segments), which we see more thought put into the love triangle between Lois Lane, CLark Kent, and his alter ego Superman.  Although this sequel didn't live up to the epic original (and was ultimately the downfall of the franchise), Superman 2 still has a lot going for it.  Christopher Reeve is still fantastic, and he is so believeabley different as both Clark Kent and Superman that you will buy the glasses and suit as a disguise.  Terrance Stamp is just plain terrific as Zod, one of the three Kryptonian criminals that Supes must contend with.  Gene Hackman is great (again) as the sardonic Lex Luthor, and really was the perfect choice as the balding villian.  All in all, Superman 2 might not be anywhere near as great as the first Superman film, but you'll most likely walk away satisfied.
B00000J631|4.0|......those guys from blink 182 had to appear in the album singing a dumb song about their penises and their family....sorry<BR>..every band in fat wreck chords or other tiny labels had the chance to express....this is a great i dea ...thanx fat mike for your great ideas....I think that you miss propagandhi......well next time I know.......if you see this album in any store buy it...is kinda cheap.....short music....big fun!!!!!!
B00006FXB6|5.0|Queens Of The Stone Age have simply topped themselves with the current release, &quot;Songs For The Deaf&quot;! THE MUST BUY DISC OF 2002! The amazing interplay of Josh's hypnotic guitar and Nick's thunderous bass reaches new levels with the addition of drummer Dave Grohl(NIRVAN,FOO FIGHTERS), who manages to kick up the throttle with his tight bursts of rythym pounding fury. Mark Lanegan's(SCREAMING TREES) subterranean growl makes it's way through 4 songs, reaching musical perfection with &quot;Song For The Dead&quot;! Do your self a favor, drop whatever you are doing and purchase &quot;Songs For The Deaf&quot; immediately!

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU WANT A LINKIN PARK CD GET HYBRID THEORY... DO NOT BUY THIS CD... BUY HYBRID THEORY AND WAIT FOR THEIR NEXT CD TO COME OUT.... SINCERELY A VERY ....

0385501560|4.0|facts have to be faced: the artist tends to have a limited number of concerns, and revisits them in multiple works.<BR>the first novel is usually raw; the second, still raw, but better, and then the books get much more polished.<BR>'choke' is almost too polished.<BR>for those who have read palahniuk, it is a clear step in the right direction after 'invisible monsters,' which was frankly a colossal dissappointment. 'survivor' remains my favorite, due to the freshness of the work. 'choke,' unfortunately, doesn't seem quite as fresh; at times, it feels like palahniuk is treading water, as if the idea is right on the tip of his fingers but can't be transmitted to the page. it gets frustrating to know that if he just went a little bit further, maybe that great revelation the author strives for might be there.<BR>this criticism, however, is not an adequate reason to not read the novel. palahniuk is bright, his language is crisp, and the novel is very engaging. his thematic concerns may be very similar to previous works, but he is beginning to work with them more succinctly- he is becoming a more polished author. i preferred the raw, rough around the edges feel of his earlier work, but this is probably his bets 'literary' feat to date. really, a quite striking novel, with bizarre characters who are downright fascinating. good read, but he is capable of even more.
B000002MU3|4.0|Maybe there's something wrong with me. Why do I hate &quot;Murmur&quot; and love this album, the one REM fans like the least? I can't figure it out. You've got good rock and roll songs like &quot;What's the Frequency Kenneth,&quot; a sweet crooning Michael Stipe song (&quot;Tongue&quot;), and a lot of noise.<br />This is what you don't have: mumbling, awkward KRS-One cameos, shiny happy peeps, and stoned rhythm sections. In other words, they dumped all the things holding them back, made a great rock record --- and the fans said &quot;no thanks.&quot;
B00005IC2H|5.0|there's little i can say about this album that isn't written already in copious amounts, but i'll make an effort. i copied it to an md from my friend's cd while i was living in tokyo, and it really colored and shaded the subway trip to and from university in the most unique way. there is nothing like getting lost in a brilliant album and looking around at human mass. the helter-skelter, rapid-run pace of those around me was countered by the slow melodies and soaring whines. it didn't hurt that i was an alien (granted, a legal one), and the spacey feel of the music seemed to put me in my right place. the dings and chimes and sparks and moans became the beauty. gorgeous, lush (and stirkingly minimal), a full on aural experience, and one that can compliment your other senses in a most peculiar way. i strongly recommend this, especially to those who are beyond the 3 minutes pop song format.
B000002TWN|5.0|Forget the &quot;neo-soul&quot; tag that's often bandied about in r&amp;b circles.  &quot;Brown Sugar,&quot; the debut from D'Angelo, is a classic regardless of genre.  Owing a debt to Stevie Wonder, Prince, and Marvin Gaye, D'Angelo helped change the face of modern r&amp;b with this stellar debut of street-savvy soul.  There's the suave funk of the sizzling title track, the formidable cover of &quot;Crusin',&quot; the disturbing tale of bloody revenge in &quot;S.D.M.,&quot; and the seductive ballad &quot;Lady.&quot;  Featuring slammin' beats, jazzed-up vibes, and his honey-smooth voice, D'Angelo glides over these tracks so effortlessly and with poise.  A mastery of both style and substance, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; is a wonderful, towering debut.
B00005OAIE|5.0|It doesn't matter what genre you're into, john mayer has a sound for everyone.  Mix a little rock, soul, jazz and an acoustic guitar and you have an artist that can turn on anyone.  His lyrics are insightful and witty and his voice is smooth and melodic with just enough carachter that it sets him aside from all the other fresh talent out right now.  BUY room for squares at your first oppertunity, and you won't be dissapointed.  And if your lucky enough to score tickets for one of his shows, you'll be amazed by his great voice and powerful stage presence.
B000002I2G|4.0|I was introduced to this record by Lester Bangs, who brushed it off as drek camouflaged by \\"horns, strings, and anything else they could bring in.\\"  But this is probably as good as the Doors ever are, frankly.  Take it or leave it: this is a real Doors album, and so it is no ordinary rock'n'roll record; in fact, sometimes it sounds like Frank Zappa parodying this period of the Doors.  I have never presumed to know what the Doors' intentions were in the fields of irony or earnestness (note the \\"stronger than dirt\\" ending of \\"Touch Me\\" for obvious self-parody), and ambiguity is really afoot here.  But compared to most rock made in 1969, this is a not only a solid record, with tight performances, but one with a compelling variety of textures and signatures, from the straight raunch of \\"Wild Child\\" to the odd-timed, poignant \\"Shaman's Blues\\" (one of their ten-best songs), to \\"Wishful Sinful,\\" a forgotten single, all bestringed and as weirdly compelling as anything R.E.M. has tried to do with similar charts (oops, is that good thing?  Irony! I say thee, Irony!, then), to the 9-minute \\"Soft Parade,\\" which shows the Doors at full tilt in collage-mode.   Tight as Booker-T and the MG's, with lusty and liturgical lyrics, like Updike through a kaleidoscope,  it is  introduced with one of Morrison's oddest rants: \\"when I was back in seminary school. . .\\".  Not \\"seminary,\\" but \\"seminary school.\\"  That inspired f-head!  Here he is sublimely alone in the Western night . . . Stronger than dirt.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Being a bachelor with no children to speak of, I was only peripherally aware of Potter and his exploits.  I've never read the book, and must admit that, yes, I am a complete and utter muggle.<br />I watched this movie for the first time last night, and was delighted, enthralled, and totally taken in by the ending.  The kids act better than your average kid actor, (Draco Malfoy gave me chills) and the adult actors fit their roles perfectly.  Robbie Coltrane is priceless as the gentle giant, Hagrid.<br />Wonderful fantcy for the young-at heart.
B00005176F|5.0|At first glance, \\"Blur: the Best of\\" appears to be an almost flawless collection of Blur songs.  From the wonderful \\"Country House\\" to the sing-along \\"Parklife\\" this album holds nearly every track one could want from this British quartet.<br />The album begins with the first two tracks off Blur's 1997 self-titled release, \\"Beetlebum\\" and the American hit \\"Song 2,\\" but any semblence of ordering disappears thereafter.  Hardly a complaint, though, as the album plays like a set-list, bounding from one high to another.<br />The best of the best included here are:  \\"Song 2,\\" undoubtedly the most recognizable of Blur's songs by most American's and musically unlike the vast majority of other Blur tunes, is perhaps the most hard rocking song of the post-grunge musical scene and a curious, if not interesting, look into free association via lead singer and writer Damon Albarn.  \\"Coffee and TV,\\" a highlight from the 1999 album \\"13,\\" a curious mix of up-tempo music and lyrics that speak of alienation and a loss of self.  \\"End of a Century\\" is a song of futility over ones future that never feels forced, as if Albarn's tender voice were trying to gently protect us from leading the life he's describing.  And the simply fantastic \\"Country House\\" off of 1995's (in my opinion hugely underrated) \\"The Great Escape.\\"<br />Sadly the new song, \\"Music is My Radar,\\" the final track of the album, is not as phenominal as the rest.  It, along with \\"She's So High\\" from Blur's debut \\"Leisure,\\" are the weakest moments of the album.  \\"She's So High\\" falls into the trap of being just another Stone Roses rip-off with swirling psychedelic guitars, Albarn's words have definitely not reached their peak.  \\"Music is My Radar,\\" while not a bad song, does not deserve to be on an album of Blur's greatest songs.  Many bands would be lucky to have a song as good as this one, but when Blur is good they are very good and \\"Music is My Radar\\" doesn't carry nearly the weight of a \\"No Distance Left to Run\\" or \\"The Universal.\\"<br />To any Blur fan it is instantly obvious that the album is most heavily loaded with songs from the 1994 masterpiece generally considered to be the finest Blur album made, \\"Parklife.\\"  Five tracks - \\"Parklife,\\" \\"End of a Century,\\" Girls and Boys,\\" \\"To the End,\\" and \\"This is a Low,\\" are included and help give the album Blur's distinct take on British society.<br />Perhaps the weakest point of this greatest hits is its incompleteness.  Skipped entirely but for \\"For Tomorrow\\" is Blur's beautiful rendering of 1993 London: \\"Modern Life is Rubbish.\\"  All Blur fans will join me in a cry of \\"Where is 'Pop Scene' or 'Chemical World' or even 'Sunday Sunday'?\\"  But at least we are given the one track, and it is a great one.  The opening song on their prototype for the \\"Parklife\\" album completely describes what Blur is going to do to the British musical scene from that moment on: reinvention.  Reinvention of what a rock song is capable of being, with intelligent lyrics and powerful music.<br />Included with this disc is a live album recorded at Wembley Arena, December 12, 1999.  While eight of the songs have already been heard on \\"Blur: the Best of\\" the two new tracks are a welcome addition.  Of particular note are \\"Girls and Boys\\" with its exhuberant audience participation, and \\"Tender\\" performed complete with a Gospel choir.<br />For Blur fans this is a wonderful (ignoring, of course, the absence of \\"Modern Life is Rubbish\\") collection of songs.  This album also works perfectly as an introduction to Blur for new-comers to the band.  All in all an excellent album, I highly recommend it to all fans of rock music.<br />-Justin M. Freiberg
B00005AFMT|5.0|So after Fripp disbands Crimson in the 70's and goes into limbo, he reappears with a new lineup to wreak havok on the 80's. Bill Brufford who was heartbroken when Fripp broke up the 70's lineup had been putting out some great jazz/fusion albums and was ready to give his drumming talents to the new lineup. Tony Levin filled the empty bass seat and as everybody knows a chap named Adrian Belew, who played guitar for Frank Zappa took over the vocal duties and shared guitar duties with Fripp. Discipline, the first albumn from the lineup is without a doubt the best they put out and one of Crimson's best ever. <BR>Elephant talk opens the albums with Fripp using his guitar to immitate elephant noises. It's great to hear the twin guitar attack of Fripp and Belew who complement each other extremely well throughout this album. The next track Frame by Frame is my favorite Crimson song. Adrian's vocals sound so good on this one and the song drifts along effortlessly it would seem. Matte Kudasai is even mellower than Frame by Frame, but no less beautiful. Indiscipline highlights Belew's insane lyrics as he explains why he repeats himself under stress heh heh. Thela Hunn Ginjeet is another weird song, this Belew tells the story of how he and some friends were making some sort of movie and the police got involved. The sheltering sky is my favorite Crimson instrumental of all time. The closer Discipline is not as great as its twin Indiscipline, but is still good. <br />Everything is so smooth on this album. Crimson break the molds they themselves helped create by not making any songs run over six minutes. In a short space of time they manage to fill you up. A great buy for anyone curious about the band. Though this is a great album, the latter albums by this lineup are just not up to par with this one.  Beware, you shouldn't buy this expecting it to sound like anything they've done in the past.
B000065V3H|1.0|As a member of this time period, I loved this movie and recommend it to all the teenagers who work for me in place of the, \\"She's all That\\" which I felt was just not as good as this. I must agree that until this movie appears in the Widescreen version I am not interested but will be first in line when and if it does. I only buy widescreen in dvd and dvd is all I buy.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I saw &quot;THE FOG&quot; when it first came out. It was winter and when I left the theater I had that &quot;I just saw a REALLY scary movie&quot; feeling. I've always associated the film with winter ever since like I would a scary ride at the fair...in the winter. I'm pleased that the DVD is fine and I really like the old trailers....they remind me of seeing them for the first time and me thinking &quot;I'm gonna see THAT&quot;. Well, &quot;THE FOG&quot; no longer deserves it's &quot;R&quot; rating, but it remains intact as one of Carpenter's best films. You couldn't put a cast like that together today! And I had forgotten how nice the cinematography was...those shots of &quot;Antonio Bay&quot; are really good. And best of all, it has kept (for me) that shivery winter feeling. Like I want to pull my jacket just a little closer...it's cold...and there's a fog up ahead...
B00006HBUA|1.0|My wife wanted to see this movie, even though I told her it would stink. So I went with her. (WE WENT TO SEE THIS INSTEAD OF MINORITY REPORT!)<br />The movie is just horrible. The acting was okay, but the plot and the story (was displeasing). I thought the actors they picked were on the mark for the characters they were portraying, but let me tell you something, my erudite movie watching friends, if you hate a certain other dog that often frequented the later version of SD, then you will absolutely HATE THIS MOVIE.<br />I don't mean you will disklike it, I mean you will abhor it.<br />My wife turned to me after the movie was over and said.<br />\\"That sucked.\\"<br />Never have truer words been said, dear wife.
B00000K19E|5.0|For movies, the cyberpunk/virtual reality genre clearly didn't work. Keanu Reeves had already tried it with &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; and - admit it - failed miserably.<BR>In 1999, seemingly from out of nowhere, comes &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Neo (Reeves) discovers that humanity's everyday world is in fact a computerised virtual reality, known only as &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The search for answers takes Neo to Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who leads a group of guerilla fighters into a furious battle for freedom! Dazzling special effects, an intriguing story and spectacular action sequences make for a unique experience. You have never - and I mean NEVER - seen anything like this before!<br />I feel I must especially mention Hugo Weaving for his excellent portrayal of the sinister Agent Smith. I don't think I've seen many villains in films that have impressed me more. <br />The Matrix is no longer just a movie. It has become a phenomenon. A wonderful piece of cinematic work that you just can't afford to miss!
B000068TPN|4.0|This movie was a decent remaking of the vietnam war. Mel Gibson was superb but Sam Eliot took the cake. He was awesome in his role. The movie itself was allegorically correct. It begins very structured, just like the military training, and then when the bullets and bombs start going off and all hell breaks loose, the movie becomes a convuluted miasma of cut scenes and confusion ---just like a war.  Greatness. The director of this movie hit it right on the mark.  I say it was a decent remaking of Vietnam only because my uncle, who was really there, says it was much different. Eh, who am I to know? I just think it was a good movie. WATCH THE OUTTAKES!
0316666343|3.0|The story becomes weak when Susie is temporarily reincarnated in Ruth's body for a sexual rendez-vous with an old beau.  Prior to this, it was made clear that the deceased in heaven can not influence people or events or intervene on earth, despite what may be their wish to do so.  What was the point of this inconsistency in the plot?<br />Susie tries to give the reader a feel for \\"my heaven.\\" Some of her heavenly companions are described, but there is never any mention of God in heaven.  A real deficiency in credibility, it seems to me.
B00005JKED|3.0|Denzel got an oscar for this, but I can't figure out why.<br />The movie was average and the acting too, it was merely Denzel being himself. So why'd I give it a 3 instead of a 2?<br />Well kids, there is a scene in this movie that is one of the most tense I have ever witnessed. Remember the scene in Boogie Nights where Sister Christian is playing in the background? Remember how tense that was? There is a scene in this movie that is twice as tense as that. It is incredible and makes the MOVIE WORTH WATCHING. No kidding.
B00005J4HH|4.0|When I first began listening to Muse, I'll admit, the first songs that caught my ear were *not* from this album. They were the tracks, &quot;Uninitended&quot;, and &quot;Muscle Museum&quot; from the first album, &lt;i&gt;Showbiz&lt;/i&gt;. Beautiful, rock-laden tracks, they entranced me. But to be honest, they weren't anything I hadn't heard before. <BR> This album, however, is different. Apon &quot;purchasing&quot; both albums, I gave them thorough listens, one after another. The first album was quite regrettably pretty weak. This disc, however, is quite the contrary. Almost every track is solid. Even when Muse experiments they can't seem to go wrong(on this album, at least). <BR> People can hype up the first five tracks on this album all they want, but the truth is the last 6 is where they shine. This is especially true in Matthew Bellamy's ambitious fusion of heavy metal instrumentation and operatic vocals in track 7, &quot;Micro Cuts&quot;. I've never heard anything quite like it, but the result is very beautiful. If you have heard anything like it, please be sure to contact me. <BR> This is not to say that the first five tracks don't have merits of their own... New Born is the song every pop rocker wants to write, and Bliss doesn't come far behind. Once you listen, you'll return *again*, *again*, and *again*.<br />Best tracks:<BR>Micro Cuts (track 7)<BR>New Born (track 1)<BR>Screenager (track 8)<BR>Megalomania (track 11)<BR>Bliss (track 2)<BR>Citizen Erased (track 6)
B00005NW00|5.0|After Kurt Cobain died, music really went down the tubes.  Rock music slipped into its biggest slump since the arrival of Disco in the 70s.  Radio was plagued with nu-metal garbage like Korn (their first album was OK, but they pretty much{are bad} now), Limp Bizkit (worst band ever), Slipknot (second worst band ever, it's not music, it's all noise), not to mention bands copying the style of the late, great Rage Against the Machine, plus Korn knockoffs, and all the pop garbage that was also starting to take over.  To me, it seemed like the only bands that could produce good albums were those who had been around a long time, the youngest being the Dave Matthews Band.<br />However, Toxicity made me reconsider.  I had heard \\"Chop Suey\\" on the radio in my friend's car, and thought it was interesting.  A few months later, a friend at college introduced me to the album in all its glory.  I found that many of the songs I actually kind of liked.  It wasn't until I borrowed it from a friend that I really decided, odd as it was, that I liked the album.  For some odd reason, I didn't buy it until very recently, I wanted to buy some tapes for my new car (which doesn't have a CD player), and I came across a tape copy of Toxicity, and bought it.<br />Not only is there finally an excellent hard rock album for the new millenium, it is in some ways comparable to classic albums.  Serj Tankian is an excellent vocalist who can soar, moan, scream, shout, roar, and do the most original things with any consonant sound in the english language.  Though the guitar playing is nothing like Jimmy Page or David Gilmour, Daron Malakian could be the best we've heard since Tom Morello of Rage (I would say Kirk Hammett, but Rage was the best guitar band to come out after Metallica).  Malakian is the true musical genius behind the band, and it shows where the music is credited solely to him, in songs such as ATWA, Deer Dance, and Aerials.  There is not one bad song on the entire album.  All of the songs have memorable hooks in them, such as the Fred Durst impersonation in \\"Prison Song,\\" the chorus to \\"Psycho,\\" the word \\"it\\" in the line \\"I don't feel it anymore\\" part of \\"ATWA,\\" the fast part of \\"Chop Suey!,\\" the incredible harmonies in \\"Aerials.\\"  It is hooks much like these that drove great classic bands like Pink Floyd, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin to fame.<br />Like I stated before, there is not one single bad song on the album, my favorite being \\"Aerials\\" with it's beautiful harmonies, killer riffs, and excellent melody.  The album opens with the rip-roaring \\"Prison Song,\\" starting off with a hit from the instrumentalists that will make you jump right out of your shoes if you have the volume previously turned up too loud.  The amazing talents of Serj, both with his voice and the speed of his speech, will amaze all.  Then we have \\"Needles,\\" another very catchy song, which then segues into \\"Deer Dance,\\" the first real burst of Daron's genius on the album.  \\"Jet Pilot,\\" is a fast paced song, the worst on the album, but I still like it enough not to fast-forward the tape.  Then comes another fast-paced song \\"X,\\" short but really gets the adrenaline pumping.  We all know the effect we get from hearing \\"Chop Suey!,\\" the adrenaline starts pumping as soon as we hear beautiful opening chords.  Then another fast-paced tune, reminiscent of their first album, \\"Bounce,\\" apparently about pogo sticks.  \\"I brought my pogo stick to show her a trick...it was so exotic,\\" did someone say \\"sexual innuendo?\\"  Closing the first side, we have \\"Forest,\\" a great song, not sure what it's about, great music and lyrics though.<br />Side 2 opens with one fo my favorites on the album, \\"ATWA,\\" apparently about Charles Manson.  The song starts off slow, then unexpectedly kicks you in the {butt} as the band suddenly shifts from first gear straight to fifth.  Then we have \\"Science,\\" a great song about how science has failed our world.  The chorus to this song is what I mean about memorable hooks on this album, the words are \\"Spirit moves through all things,\\" but upon first listen it sounds like \\"Spear, it moves through the whole thing.\\"  Listen to it and you'll see.  Next, we have another short fast song with \\"Shimmy,\\" which incorporates the use of of a middle eastern scale in one part, very cool.  Following that is the rip-roaring \\"Toxicity,\\" you all know it, you've all heard it, I don't need to tell you anymore about it.  \\"Psycho,\\" the current radio single, is also a great song with a memorable chorus (\\"PSYCHO! GROUPIE! COCAINE! CRAZY!\\") and some of the best guitar work Daron has ever produced.  Following that is my personal favorite, \\"Aerials,\\" which was the previous radio single, you all know that one as well, I don't need to discuss it.  As the final notes of \\"Aerials\\" fade out, we are treated to a little Armenian music, starting out with some sort of wind instrument, and then percussion and chants begin.  This hidden track is one of the most beautiful things you will ever hear.  After all that adrenaline that the album gave you, you are treated to this blissful piece of music, that leaves you wanting more and at the same time, totally at peace.<br />It is inevitale that fans of nu-metal garbage will like this album.  Just as people who like real music enjoy Rage Against the Machine, those same people will also enjoy System of a Down.  I, like many people I know, hate rap-rock, but absolutely love Rage.  These same people and myself feel the same way about nu-metal and System respectively.  These guys pretty much saved modern rock for me, though I'm still not convinced enough to turn on my radio dial.  In the meantime, buy this album and realize that there may actually be hope for music in the near future as we await the next big, great, rock thing.  Until then, buy this album, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.<br />5/5
B00006FXB6|5.0|Songs for the Deaf is not matched by any other album that has come out this past year. Queens of the Stone Age, through faux radio clips mocking the state of modern rock radio, put together quite a vast collection of sounds that only leave the listener wanting more. From the pounding desire of millionaire, to the jumping &quot;no one knows&quot; to such great song writing technique in the latter half of the album, creates the greatness of this album. The record takes a huge turn as the rampant rageful insanity with a nice riff to compliment the jarring lyrics, this is where the true greatness just begins...<BR> There might not be any better way to end an album with the lineup that flows so perfectly as does: <BR>7. Hanging Tree<BR>8.Go With The Flow<BR>9. Gonna Leave You<BR>10. Do It Again<BR>11. God Is In The Radio<BR>12. Another Love Song<BR>13. A Song For The Deaf<BR>14. Mosquito Song<BR>do yourself a favor and buy the best album of the year while they are still on the shelves.
0452282152|5.0|...this book will completely mesmerize you!  I read it once and I'm ready to read it again.  Chevalier has the gift of taking you into Vermeer's studio so that you believe you are there.  I HIGHLY recommend this book.
B000069HKH|5.0|&quot;You can't go over there acting all Simon and Garfunkel, you gotta get Bruce Springsteen on 'em, man!&quot;. <BR>-Hyde from &quot;That 70's Show&quot;<br />This is definitely Bruce's best album to date.  I was worried it might not sound too great with such a big band, but they did it perfectly.  It's great to hear the E Street Band on a recording (Max Weinburg is an awesome drummer).  Every song here is pretty good.  Some highlights include &quot;Mary's Place&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot;, and the title track, but my favorite would have to be &quot;Nothing Man&quot;. I honestly had no idea he could sing that well.  Beautiful song.<br />Not much to say, except if you like Bruce, you'll love this.  The band is tight, the vocals are great, and best of all, the lyrics are more mature.  You just can't go wrong.  One of the best albums of the year.
0312243022|5.0|I just finished this book and I think it is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read. I enjoyed it all the way through and highly recommend reading it and taking your time to soak in all Cunningham's beautiful descriptive writing. This book will make you wish you could write like this incredible writer! Highly recommended
B00003CXI1|5.0|It is very seldom that an adaptation of a book as good as Harry Potter turns out to be such an excellent movie.  <br />Thanks to exceptional writing and directing movie is very close to the book. Even though I am a strong believer in reading a book before watching a movie, I must admit that this movie can be an exception. The story is untouched, casting is brilliant, visual effects are amazing. Real characters and scenery are perfectly blended with computer-generated graphics.  I watched the movie twice in the theater and could not wait to get the DVD. You can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it.   <br />Definitely worth buying.
B000002I25|5.0|I will be the first to admit the Doors weren't great musicians.  They were not even in the same league as The Beatles, Hendrix, and so many other bands of Rock's Golden Era.  I will also grant you that Jim Morrison was an overrated &quot;poet&quot; who's idea of himself was bigger than reality confirmed.  But all of that has little to do with this album, the whole of which is so much greater than the sum of it's parts.  They never pulled off an album like this again, which is not to say they didn't continue to put out good material, but nothing after their first album really came close to this, IMHO.<br />As another reviewer suggested, this album would be a must to include in a time capsule of Rock's greatest albums ever.  I think at this point, for us baby-boomers, the album creates more of a &quot;memory&quot; than a musical effect, but that is how it should be I suppose.  And the fact that X'ers appreciate this album is a testament to it's timelessness, notwithstanding the band's overall mediocre talents.<br />If you're a Rock fan and don't have/haven't heard this album, what planet have you been living on?  <br />A true classic.  No more needs to be said.
B00006EXDM|3.0|A new 40 track compilation is being rleased in the next month, including practically all of these tracks and more. Also, no bonus tracks were included in the remastered version, but  three bonus tracks were included in the remastered version of hot rocks vol 2. Why? Because they want you to buy hot rocks and the new compilation coming up very soon. So, dont buy this album and wait for the next compilation 'fourty licks'.
B00005RFAI|2.0|To be fair there are some very good songs on the CD - about 4 or 5 in my opinion. Not nearly as good as the first album. <br />But the rest are hard to tolerate. The lyrics are childish and worse - hard to block out while still listening to the music. I find myself skipping to the middle of the CD and stopping it before the end.<br />I should have downloaded the songs and deleted the ones I don't appreciate...
B000002C2E|5.0|This is the best album Dylan has made since Blood on the tracks. And if you push a little bit, his best album since blonde on blonde. When this came out, I did not buy it, thinking that is was just another Dylan album in the lines of Infidels, Under a red sky, etc. But this is really special. Dylan has manage to incorporate the blues tradition of Patton, Blind Willie Mcctell, Robert Johnson, into his own inimitable Dylan language. At the time, rumor was that Bob was very ill, and I really thought this was going to be his last album. Fortunately it was not. But the sense of loss and apathy and discomfort with this world (Love sick, Highlands, Trying to get to heaven)is something that Dylan had not really touch so deeply since those great 60's records. This is in my top five Dylan albums of all time.
