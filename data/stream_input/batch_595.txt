0307276902|2.0|Even without the controversy, A Million Little Pieces was a big let down.  Frey is not half the writer he seems to think he is: the prose is clumsy, mawkish and talks more about the authors pleading need to be accepted, than it does about his 'recovery'.  \\"Digging the Vein\\" was a similar book that came out right at the same time, which offered a rage filled altenative to the traditional AA-inspired recovery memoirs.  It boggles my mind that frey's book had the success it did, while \\"Digging...\\" has so far flown beneath the radar.  Just goes to show you that Oprah may be good at interviewing celebrities, but when it comes to literature she's pretty clueless.
B00092ZMDY|3.0|But ultimately lifeless. All the songs are immaculately performed, and the ageing eagles have still retained their pristine voices. Maybe I'm too picky, but I felt that unfortunately, the whole show is let down by lackadaisical performance - the whole show is devoid of life. I read somewhere (Amazon?) that the Eagles are not a good live band, and this DVD just about proves it. HFO was better (but still lifeless). <br /> <br />In contrast, check out, say, 'Acoustica' (I'm not comparing the bands, just the performance) by the Scorpions - the sheer joy, energy, enthusiasm and life of the performers is translated to the crowd and the whole show is a treat to watch over and over.  <br />
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|To be honest, i'm NOT a fan of the Final Fantasy games and I HATE Final Fantasy 10.  The only Final Fantasy games that I thought were OK, were FF8 & FF9.  I didn't play much of FF7 as I lost interest too quickly.  However, Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children I thought was really good.  With beautiful images with vibrant colours and attention to detail, I was impressed.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this film was the story and voice acting.  The story is very bland and hard to follow with questions of \\"whats going on now?\\" and \\"what the hell is that thing?\\".  A lot of strange things happen in this film that are impossible, but the film does have 'Fantasy' in the title so thats acceptable.  The voice acting is quite bad making the characters a little bland, while villians sound less threatening.<br /><br />What I did like about this film was the fantastic visuals and blink-and-you'll-miss-it action.  The action is so fast and so furious that you just can't take your eyes off the screen in case you miss something.<br /><br />Since I found the story bad and the voice acting bad, this still is a great film, with lightning speed action thats impossible to accomplish in real time.  Advent Children is a great, fun and very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone whos a fan or not a fan of the Final Fantasy series.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Latley, every CD starts to sound alike, the voice, the chords, the only thing that changes is the lyrics. But not Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge. Oh no, every song had a different 'feel' to it. thats probably why I liked it so much. But I do not agree that its 5 stars. Its not that good. Bravo to MCR.
B000F3A7LO|4.0|I liked this album from the first release just to hear the Daryl Hall vocals and I wasn't disappointed.  This album has been re-released as a 2-disc set with the previously unreleased vocals from Daryl Hall that RCA wouldn't permit him and Robert Fripp to use. So I recommend looking for the \\"Limited Edition\\" set instead of this issue.
B000AMJDHY|2.0|ohh myyy godd. now all mighty P!ATD followers. dont hate me for saying this, but this sounds all the same. the only difference is the synthesiser. i give ryan ross credit for the lyrics (wich are very provocative) and i give brendon M'd parents credit for making him so fine. the voice is good but it all has the same tone.
B00005Q66T|2.0|Madonna's best was during the early and mid-80's.  This album proved that she jumped the shark by 1987 and has been famous for who she is ever since.
B000002LND|5.0|The Immaculate Collection is Madonna's first greatest hits cd. <br /> <br />Madonna has mostly been a singles artist, so getting this album and GHV2 might be the only albums you need if you're just now getting into her. <br /> <br />Justify My Love and Rescue Me are the new songs(for THAT time), and are both HOT.  <br /> <br />My only two gripes with the songs collected here is the absence of Dress You Up, which should have replaced La Isla Bonita; and the presence of a remixed Like A Prayer instead of the original. But I guess if you have all of her studio albums, hearing a new remix might be seen as a treat. I simply went to Itunes and bought the original Like A Prayer and Dress You Up for $.99 each. So, all's well that ends well. <br /> <br />A great way to hear the best songs of one of our best and most important Pop entertainers.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|As I sit here and read other reviews I too have never written an online review before but just felt I needed to for this special show.  It was with a heavy heart that I watched the series finale 2 nights ago.  I have watched it 4 times since.  It made me cry one minute and laugh the very next.  I never wanted it to end.  What a thrill it would be to have all of the seasons on DVD.  Better yet in a packaged collection even.  I have bought 10 copies of season one to give to family and friends this week.  I will truly miss the phenomonal chemisty between Amy and Ephram, Bright and Hannah, Nina and Andy....not to mention the interaction between the characters of Harold and Andy.  You have to fall in with Tom Amandes' charming wit throughout the series.  I would have to say his portrayal of Harold made Harold one of the most beloved characters EVER.  Emily Van Camp (Amy) was such a breath of fresh air not to mention that she is breathtakingly beautiful and Gregory Smith (Ephram)...there's just something so special about him...I always thought of him as cute and truly talented.  He captivated me with his grin and especially with his smile.  Vivien Cardone (Delia) is sure to make it big one of these days as well. Her relationship with her father Andy (the extremely talented Treat Williams) was refreshing to watch.  I will truly miss John Beasley (Irv Harper) as well.  He was such a fixture and gave the show it's narrative voice from time to time.  I just loved all of these actors so much!!!  Even Debra Mooney...remember her guest spots on Roseanne?  I loved her nickname for Harold...Jr.  She also made me laugh and especially in the finale made me cry like a baby!  Well, I've ranted and raved way too much here.  I don't know what else to say other than I'm so deeply sad to see it go.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Madonna delivers to us a second compilation of her greatest hits in GHV2. The tracks included here tend to lean towards the electronic side thanks to her collaborations with Bjork and William Orbit.  <br /> <br />The only tracks I don't care for are Don't Cry For Me Argentina and Drowned World. The rest are very, very entertaining and prove why Madonna is one of the biggest, smartest, craftiest, and most controversial entertainers of all time.
B000EYK4KI|4.0|Just to be clear.  Unrated DOES NOT mean the film will include more violencee or sexual content.  Unrated means: This version of the film has not been viewed by the MPAA to recieve an official rating.  Of course the gullible consumer sees \\"unrated\\" and assumes this is the more explicit version.  Not the case.  Most cases, the extension is a marked improvement.  Examples include: Daredevil, Lord of the Rings TRILOGY, Kingdom of Heaven, Underworld, Windtalkers.  There is one instance so far where the Unrated version was a step down:  The Dukes of Hazzard.  Was fine the way it was in theatres.  The new cut just had nude secenes, more profanity, and drug related moments.  None of which added anything to the movie or enhanced the fun in any way. <br />I enjoyed this movie very much as it was.  Wether the extended cut will be an improvement or not, who knows.  The film is just an entertaining romp.  Nothing more, just a fun movie to watch.  In the final action scene, it appears the stunt coordinator took LOTS of notes from John Woo.  Still entertaining and fun to watch.  Requires no thinking to enjoy, just a popcorn film.
B00004XONN|3.0|\\"Instead of simply adding club beats or sonic collage techniques, Radiohead strive to incorporate the unsettling \\"intelligent techno\\" sound of Autechre and Aphex Twin, characterized by its skittering beats and stylishly dark sonic surfaces, for Kid A. To their immense credit, Radiohead don't sound like carpetbaggers, because they share the same post-postmodern vantage point as their inspirations. As a result, Kid A is easily the most successful electronica album from a rock band -- it doesn't even sound like a rock band, even if it does sound like Radiohead. So, Kid A is an unqualified success? Well, not quite. Despite its admirable ambition, Kid A is never as visionary or stunning as OK Computer, nor does it really repay the time it demands. OK Computer required many plays before revealing the intricacies of its densely layered mix; here, multiple plays are necessary to discern the music's form, to get a handle on quiet, drifting, minimally arranged songs with no hooks. Of course, the natural reaction of any serious record geek is that if the music demands so much work, it must be worth it -- and at times, that supposition is true. But Kid A's challenge doesn't always live up to its end of the bargain. It's self-consciously alienating and difficult, and while that can be intriguing, it seems deeper than it actually is. Repeated plays dissipate the mystique and reveal a number of rather drab songs (primarily during the second half), where there isn't enough under the surface to make Radiohead's relentless experimentation satisfying. But mixed results are still results, and about half of the songs positively shimmer with genius.\\" ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide    Sums up how I feel pretty much.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|first of all this cd is too slow for my liking, i was expecting it to be harder but it is not. half of the songs seem like ballads, a couple remind me of the killers which is a very bad thing. they have definitely gone in a very poppy/indie kind of way and they have dissapointed me. i will still listen to this cd tho b/c i love afi and will still support them. the screaming i like from davey, it is very full and angry but he only shows it off on 5 songs. i expected afi to come out with something better than this but this is what they gave us and i'll have to deal. it's alright.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|ever since watching the pilot episode back in 2002, i have been completely in love with everything about this show! <br />from its witty dialogue to the romantic feelings that you can't help but relate to, this show has it all!  it is one of the most realistic tv shows that i have ever seen and i would recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest intrest in amazing TV writing.  the actors are all perfectly cast, and they all seem to have amazing chemistry/understanding of their characters.  this is the perfect show for any family to watch together, as it has lessons and morals in it that no show is able to portray quite as well. <br />i will miss this show more than i could ever express and i can only hope now that the other 3 seasons will be released for all of the loyal fans to be able to rewatch and enjoy with their families for years to come. <br />So please, check out at least 1 episode and i guarentee that you will fall in love with the small mountain town called Everwood.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|To the reviewer who called this movie disturbing all I have to say is save the psycho babble for real life. This is just a movie nothing more. No marriages were ruined.  <br /> <br />The music was touching especially the song done by Johnny Mathis. I would recommend this movie for a rainy Saturday or when you need to just have a good cry.
B000000OTU|5.0|Thats what this CD should be called! I have had this CD for many years now and I never get tired of it! This album consist mostly of Aerosmith's top singles released up to 1994. I have to admit that I wish that \\"Walk this Way\\" was on the album, but what can you do? I enjoy compilation CDs because every song is great! One of my favorite songs is on the album- \\"Livin' on the Edge\\", I think that this song is one of those classic s tunes that you can just jam out to while you are driving in your car. Another favorite of mine is \\"Amazing\\". Its another classic. I can remember the video so clearly, from when I was like 9 years old and watching MTV with my sisters. I love Aerosmith's sound. I have never heard a voice like Steven Tyler and Joe Perry is an amazing guitarist. I don't think that there is any other band out there that sounds similar to Aerosmith, they are in a genre all on their own. I am amazed at Aerosmith's ability to continue to rock out and continue to put out great music over so many years. I recommend this CD especially to someone that is just discovering Aerosmith, They will be able to hear some of the classics and \\"oldie but goldies\\" from them. If you buy this CD I hope you will cherish it for many years, like I have.
6304076517|5.0|Greenaway is a master of framing the most visually amazing scenes. This film is rich beyond belief. Why in God's name is this film not on DVD?
B000F3TBIO|5.0|This is one of the best records of the year.  I love all the tracks on the album, but I must say my favorite is that last track \\"We're Not Alone\\" featuring Dub Trio.  This song reminds me of some of the best Faith No More songs and it has a great original sound, courtesy of Dub Trio.  You can find the original version of the song on Dub Trio's new album \\"New Heavy\\", check it out if you like Peeping Tom, it's awesome.
B000002UDB|1.0|This CD is totally boring, even when \\"Penny Lane\\" comes along to \\"pick things up\\", 'cause by the time \\"Penny Lane\\" comes along, I'm already so down and out b/c of how boring the previous tracks are, \\"Penny Lane\\" just isn't much; I like music from all decades and the '60's is no exception.  But what the heck is so great about this CD?  Nothing.
B0000DEPRW|5.0|\\"Rubber Soul\\" was more of the same and yet included something different.  \\"Rubber Soul\\" yielded the first Beatles hit song that had nothing to do with love or girls (\\"Nowhere Man\\"). \\"Rubber Soul\\" marked an evolution from the Beatles as a boy band to a mature rock group that could cover any subject.<br /><br />The songs on this album are classic mid-60s. \\"You Won't See Me,\\" \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" and \\"Drive My Car\\" are each classic Beatles songs that are staples of classic rock stations. \\"You Won't See Me\\" in particular has been covered numerous times by other groups.<br /><br />\\"Nowhere Man\\" is excellent.  This song is about everyman, and a commentary on everyman. This song with its political overtones may have expressed some of the frustration the youth of the 60s had with their desire to change the world, and the difficulty they had in getting oldsters to understand what they were about.  There was also frustration with the speed of change.  It is strange looking back, because now we are the oldsters and the wheel has turned once again. The most incredible thing about this song is that it has nothing to do with love, and ranks as one of the best Beatles songs of all time. The only flaw with this song is that it, like so many other songs of the era, was a paltry 2:44 long, which was LONG by the standards of those days. Think of what the Beatles could have done had they had CDs to work with!<br /><br />I think \\"Michelle,\\" \\"Girl,\\" and \\"In My Life\\" are excellent Beatles ballads, with outstanding harmonies on \\"Girl\\" and \\"In My Life;\\" classics in a different vein from the other songs on this album.<br /><br />Of the remaining songs, \\"Think for Yourself,\\" \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" \\"Wait,\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" offer quality Beatles music. Each of these is a harbinger of the Beatles that would see one more transition album, \\"Revolver,\\" followed by the revolution in rock music, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Word\\" is very 60s pop music, with little to distinguish it other than it is a Beatles song. \\"What Goes On\\" is an interesting song for the Beatles in that it has a country flavor with Ringo taking the lead vocal.  \\"Run for Your Life\\" finishes off the CD with some novelty. The \\"end\\" in the song is pronounced \\"end-uh\\", matching the music well. Note that in written lyrics this is written as \\"end-a\\".<br /><br />The album is a little uneven in a couple of places. Following \\"Think for Yourself\\" with \\"The Word\\" is not a smooth transition. Similarly, following \\"Michelle\\" with \\"What Goes On\\" causes \\"What Goes On\\" to grate somewhat. The order of the songs could have been changed to have some flow to the style and mood of the songs. However, rock concept albums were yet to be and often insufficient thought was put into the order of songs.<br /><br />The flaws in this CD are minor. The music proved once again that even with small bumps in quality, the Beatles were consistently able to fill an album with good to great songs. This album is a must have for any fan of mid-60s rock, and definitely for any fan of the Beatles.<br /><br />Note that there are several versions of this album that may be available.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is a great Red Hot CD! It is so much better then some people are making it sound. The Mars cd is similar the \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" and is not slow AT ALL. The jupiter CD is a little slower but is crazy good. john frusciante is my favorite guitar player of all time and is one of the best ever. His playing is amazing on every single songs. Anthony Kiedis is better than ever on this album. Ofcoarse Flea and Chad are amazing. If you like the peppers this is a GREAT buy!!  <br /> <br />GET ALL THE PEPPERS CDS!!!!! <br />GET ALL John Frusciantes CDS TOO!!!!
0895260131|5.0|Great book....Buy it, read it, tell your friends about it. If more liberals read this book, they might start supporting our troops and the war we are in against these religious fanatics.
0553801503|4.0|There is not a lot of action in Feast. It is told by minor characters. I found it was interesting to see the main characters through a new point of view. Getting into Circe's mind and watching it unravel under the weight of her ego was fasinating. I also kept in mind that these chapters were originally interspersed among what I would assume are more action-packed chapters that will appear in Dance of Dragons. This book is the exposition for that book. Nothing much happens in Fellowship of the Rings, it is the exposition for Two Towers and Return of the King, because originally, it was one big book. Fellowship was still worth a read, because Tolkien has an amazing style and description. Martin does the same. He draws you into his world with well written details.  <br />And Feast ends on a nail biter. As long as Dance pays off with the real action, I can look favorably on Feast. I just hope Martin doesn't let his story get too big like some other fantasy series have.
1594200823|5.0|This well-written and researched book teaches a tremendous amount about our food chains (pun intended). First is the Industrial Food Chain. I had no idea that the Industrial food chain existed, though in retrospect of course I must have been aware somehow. This chain leads to McDonald's. The second chain is the Industrial Organic -- the Whole Foods, Wild Oats suppliers.  I will always think about Pollan wearing a moon suit when visiting organic chickens. And \\"free-range\\" no longer means anything to me. The Beyond Organic section looks at Joel Salatin's Polyface Farm, and made me want to start my own farm. Finally, Hunting and Gathering--the shortest food chain. I didn't want to read about hunting, but Pollan got me there, too. I was fascinated throughout, and I am very thankful for this intelligent book.
0515125024|3.0|\\"Die Trying\\" is the second installment in Lee Child's popular Jack Reacher series.  Reacher is an ex-Army-MP-turned-vigilante-drifter, a tough guy with an unflinching sense of right and wrong who always manages to stumble into a situation in need of his style of correction.      In this book, Reacher happens on to the kidnapping of a government worker and not only ends up being snatched along with the target but also gets [...] as the prime suspect after being identified by witnesses.  Bad luck for Reacher - worse luck for the bad guys.  As Reacher uses his MP background to put together the clues, he discovers that this is no ordinary kidnapping of any ordinary person and that the perpetrators are out for much more than simple ransom.  He has to solve the mysteries, save the girl, and stop the growing conspiracy - all before the nationwide manhunt mistakenly takes him down.  It's all in a day's work for Jack Reacher.      The Reacher series is a throwback in action writing, unencumbered by modern sensitivities and moral ambiguities that plague so many other contemporary heroes.  All characters are cut-and-dry either on the side of right or wrong, women are typically fodder for rescue and/or quick, passionate affairs, and all problems can be solved with the right mixture of brains and force.  This world view can sometimes lead the books down a path of being overly simplistic or even hokey, but ultimately Reacher's charisma and conviction make for worthwhile Summer reading.  Pacing is typically swift as Child's background as a television writer becomes apparent with each passing chapter.  Book after book, the Reacher series is a mixture of \\"24\\", \\"CSI\\" and even a little bit of \\"McGyver\\".      \\"Die Trying\\" is a good volume in the Reacher series.  It signals the beginning of the shift from Reacher as pure tough-guy action hero to mystery sleuth, which adds some needed depth.  It's not quite as well-written as \\"The Enemy\\" or \\"Running Blind\\", but definitely worth a pickupfor all Reacher fans.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I had enjoyed the movie Secret Garden when it was released in the 1990's.  I bought the cd, thinking I would enjoy it too.  It's one of my favorites.  I listen to it in the car on long drives.

It makes me wonder how Spin magazine could totally ignore The Bends when doing their 100 Greatest Albums of the past 20 years list. So much for credibility. Here, Radiohead still use some of their signature unique sound that would be explored more fully on their next album, yet still sound accessible enough to be on the radio. Other than Ok Computer, The Bends accomplished the ideal for an album: it attained critical acclaim and critical sales.
B000002LGQ|5.0|I really like the songs on here. This is where the public starts to scrutinize Madonna because of the portrayal of her having sex with a black saint in the \\"Like a Prayer\\" video, and the way she was scantily clad in her \\"Express Yourself\\" video. Actually I like controversey, so this album suits me well. This is a great album, with a good number of hits. \\"Express Yourself\\" is a song that I've lived by for many years. \\"Like a Prayer\\" was a song that I really liked when it came out, back when religion was important to me. \\"Cherish\\" is a beautiful song, and I love the video to it. I was a rebellious teenager when this album came out, so \\"Oh Father\\" was a song I sort of identified with. I am also a big Prince fan, so when I first heard \\"Love Song\\", I thought it was the totally coolest duet I had ever heard. In my later teen years \\"Spanish Eyes\\" became a favorite of mine because I was questioning the validity of christianity. \\"Act of Contrition\\" is one of my personal favorites because it is so funny - she starts out saying a prayer, then a loud electric guitar drowns her out, and it sounds like \\"Like a Prayer\\" being played backwards. She then sings a prayerful song which abruptly ends when either a) she realizes that her song was left unfinished or b) tells the people at the pearly gates that she has a reservation and then yells \\"What do you mean it's not in the computer?!\\" I love it!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Many discard this as Kid A's b-sides, but I find this funny because Amnesiac has the better songs. The best song on kid A is Optimistic, yet that song can't hold a candle to Pyramid Song and Knives Out. How do we know Kid A isn't the b-side to Amnesiac, but was just released first? I guess all of this depends on which record you like better. My vote goes for Amnesiac.    And I guess I'm also in the minority when I say I like Amnesiac's Morning Bell better. Both versions are really good, but Amnesiac's Morning Bell provides an eeriness and spookiness that makes Climbing Up the Walls sound like Jingle Bells. I've heard Amnesiac's Bell is closer to what the band were originally aiming for. I think the slowness and atmosphere is more appropriate with the lyrics than the techno beat Kid A offers.    Pulk/Pull, Hunting Bears, and Like Spinning Plates are the only songs I don't like. The rest range from interesting to excellent.    I will say at times Thom Yorke's singing gets on my nerves. His vocal idiosyncrasies can at times mess up perfectly good songs. I wish he would just open up his mouth and stop sounding like he's drunk. Why make it harder on your devoted fans to understand you, especially when you didn't even bother to provide the lyrics in the sleeve.    Amnesiac is more accessible and provides better songs than its predecessor.
B000002MFN|5.0|This is when I became a true Madonna fan - I loved her music before, but when she came out of the closet (I'm also bi), I knew that I had to be a fan of hers. This album came out along with her controversial Sex book, and spawned the whole Lesbian chic trend in the early '90s. The song \\"Erotica\\" seems to have a BDSM theme to it with lyrics like \\"I'll be your mistress tonight\\" and \\"I only hurt the ones I love\\". It leaves much to the imagination. It is appropriately followed by a cover of the love song \\"Fever\\". \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" is a song that was a staple in the club scene for years, and is very beautiful as it is danceable. \\"Where Life Begins\\" is another erotically good song. \\"Bad Girl\\", \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Thief of Hearts\\" are songs that deal with cheating, or being stood up by someone. \\"Words\\" and \\"Rain\\" are very beautiful songs that would be good for meditating to. \\"In This Life\\" is a sad song about AIDS and homophobia. Finally \\"My Secret Garden\\" makes a nice and uplifting end to the album. This is a good album if you're into controversey, BDSM or albums with an LGBT theme, or if you just like good dance music.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This film has such a simple message. Life is about personal responsability. Each day we decide as individuals to do the right thing or not. It is easy to get caught up in all the drama around you but individual integrity is the only real power we have. Scott uses politics and religion as a backdrop to study man and his need for war, violence and power. No one in the film is a super hero or super villian they are just ordinary humans beings. War means that real people die. In each battle you feel the pointlessness of the massacre of human life, you are not rooting for sides. I don't know why people don't connect with this film. I can only assume it is because it challanges them to have integrity in difficult situations. \\"what is a man who does not make the world a better place...\\" corny i know but sorely lacking in our modern world.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This is my favorite Madonna album, made within the context of the early '80s. This is the album that put Madonna on the charts, and put her on the road to superstardom. My favorite song is \\"Burning Up\\", her first of many seductive, risque-type songs. I'm not sure if \\"Holiday\\" or \\"Lucky Star\\" was the first Madonna song I had heard, but I do remember liking \\"Lucky Star\\" because it reminded me of Rainbow Brite when she sang \\"Starlight, Star bright\\" (I was 7 or 8 when I first heard it). \\"Holiday\\" will always be a staple in the club scene. \\"Physical Attraction\\", like \\"Burning Up\\" is always a good song to make out to.  \\"Everybody\\" is definitely the anthem for getting people to dance and flirt. And if you're not in a good mood, \\"I Know It\\" and \\"Think of Me\\" are good songs to listen to. Finally, \\"Borderline\\" is the tamest song and the video for it is also very tame, which is very different from everything else Madonnna put out. It is still a good song. All in all, this album is good, classic early Madonna. I love it!
B00009V7P8|5.0|In his major label debut, Damien Rice establishes himself as an Irish force to be reckoned with. His raw vocals laced with Lisa Hannigan's refined harmonies produce a sound that any Iron and Wine fan can appreciate. Departing from the more rugged, scattered tracks of B-Sides, O draws the listener into a grouping of songs that tells a beautiful story of love, loss, and the games in between. While cohesive in its entirety, each selection is able to stand on its own and knock you on your feet. Through added instrumentation, he achieves refinement while still maintaining raw emotion drawn on subjects that are very true to life. This is illustrated quite well as Rice's 1997 demo of \\"Volcano\\" from B-Sides is transformed from a haunting acoustic piece into soulful, heartbreaking duet with Lisa Hannigan. The addition of Vyvienne Long's cello communicates a sense of pain long before the vocals begin and the additional lyrics allow two sides of the story to be communicated.  <br />The most definitive song on the album, \\"Cannonball\\", relies upon the heartfelt lyrics, raw vocals, and dynamic guitar progressions that are true Damien style. My personal favorite, \\"I Remember\\", begins with Lisa Hannigan's soft vocals lovingly retelling a first encounter, and leads into Rice's angry solo, backed by full orchestration, demanding explanation leading to a breakup. This style of meek and soft then progressively stronger and louder is consistent with the rest of the album.  <br />O is an absolutely must for any modern folk fan and Live from the Union Chapel is the definite follow-up album to have. So drop what you're doing, buy this album, and you'll be thanking me for years to come.   <br />
B000002NJS|5.0|This is Madonna's first techno/trance-themed album. When I first heard the first song to this album, I was like \\"WOW!!!\\" I bought the album before I heard any of the songs on the radio, in January or February of 1998. I thought the album was out of this world. And I thought it was an improvement from Bedtime Stories because Bedtime Stories had too many slow songs. All the songs on this album blend into each other very well. After awhile, the songs just get me into a meditative kind of mood. It's very different from a lot of techno/trance music I usually listen to. I recommend this to anyone who likes techno/dance/'90s music. Madonna is always changing her style and keeping up with the times. :)

B00005J6SZ|5.0|This album should be right next to Michael Jackson's Thriller album in your cd collection - this is a definitive album of the '80s. This is the album that made Madonna a star, and showed that she was here to stay. The song \\"Like a Virgin\\" was #1 on the pop charts for 6 weeks, while \\"Material Girl\\" is the song that gave her the nickname. All the songs on here are good, classic '80s rockers. You don't want to miss out on this one.
0156027321|2.0|Wow... did I hate this book. the first half of the book was terrible. It felt like the author  wrote the first half only so it would be long enough  to qualify as a novel.<br /><br />  I rated it as a 2, only because the second half was was ok.<br /><br />if you really want to read it, buy this one used.
B000002LND|5.0|This is a must-have for anyone who likes Madonna or who likes '80s music or likes dance music in general. This has most of Madonna's hits from the '80s and very early '90s. This is always a good cd to play at a party or even to just drive around in your car.
B000002BE9|5.0|I have never owned a Fiona Apple CD.  This is my first one to buy.  Even though it is a few years old I absolutely love it.  The CD flows very nicely.  I knew a few of the hits such as \\"Criminal\\" and \\"Shadow Boxer.\\"  What I was pleasantly suprised by were the other songs.  I really enjoy listening to the whole CD.  One of my favorites is \\"Slow Like Honey,\\" it is very bluesy and kind of sung in a slow manner.  The words to it are great too.  She is singing about how she is going to win over this man.  I also really like \\"Sleep to Dream.\\"  The lyrics are about how she wants to keep sleeping because in her dream this guy is so real to her.  Her dream is even better than reality so in the mornings she wished the darkness could go on forever so she could keep sleeping.  I can really relate to this because I have had some great dreams that I didn't want to wake up from either.  The way she sings the songs is neat too.  She has a deep bluesy voice, but on a couple of the songs she sings in this really high almost falseto voice which is really nice to listen to because it is so sweet and pure sounding.  She was only 18 when she came out with this album.  She plays the piano throughout the album.  It is a great CD to listen to if you just want to relax or you are one of those moods.

B000ESSTKQ|1.0|I have bought both versions (UK and USA). Here is my review.    1) The Sound: Both versions sound equal. The remastering at least on the CD layer is not better than the singles 81>85-Period.   The new remasterings are in the middle between the \\"old\\" CD's and The Singles 81>85 CD, so don't expecte a \\"big\\" improvement unless of course you have a SACD player or a 5.1 system.    2) The SACD layer: The USA doesn't contain this layer. I think they should be presenting a CD/SACD + DVD (as originally designed) on this 'remaster' series, not just a plain CD with an additional DVD. However if you don't own a SACD player this layer is useless.    3) The video format: The USA remasters are NTSC and Region 1. The UK are PAL and Multiregion. However if you live in America and have a good CD Player Sony the USA remasters are more useful because sony doesn't reproduce PAL DVD's.    4) Both versions can be ripped to a mp3 format. No problem.    Which version you should buy?, the're almost equal, one have an advantage over the other and viceversa. At the end the decision is only yours.
B00008N6N5|5.0|I didn't know too much about the man that was Larry Flynt before the other night.  I new he was the man behind 'Hustler' but that was about it.  Watching this surprisingly tastfully done biopic on the man opened my eyes to what he stood for.  Pulling himself out of nothing, Larry Flynt (Woody Harrelson) stood up for the rights of every American when he fought for the publication of his magazine.  Starting out the owner of an exotic dance club but looking for more he started a newsletter advertising his 'girls', but after his little side project took off running it was apparent where his big break was going to fall.  The film follows Flynt throughout his life, from his marriage to dancer Althea (Courtney Love) who is just as excited about his magazine as he is, to his arrest's and constant battles with the court over the right to publish 'smut' as they called it. <br /> <br />His legal battles are really where the meat of this film lies for is really shows the hypocrisy of the legal system.  They were forcing opinions on citizens instead of inforcing law.  There was no law against the publication of porn, but it went against what many people belived to be good morals.  As Flynt so noted, he was guilty of nothing but bad taste. <br /> <br />As the film progresses we see the aftermath of a shooting gone wrong, a man obviously upset over the magazine shot Larry outside of the courthouse paralizing him from the waist down.  This has to of course be a terrible blow to a man obsessed with sex.  Just before the shooting Larry was starting to turn over a new leaf after being converted the Christianity.  He was trying to turn his magazine around (even though he ended up making it worse) but after the shooting he swore off god altogether and became athiest.  Through the course of the next three years he and his wife became addicted to pain killers and his wife ended up suffering the fatal price when she was diagnosed with AIDS.  The film shows beautifully, as well as heartbreakingly, Larry's devotion to his ailing wife and there illicit love affair that was in all sense of the word genuine. <br /> <br />The film helps show the triumph of the everyman as he battles for the freedoms we all enjoy and is relentless in doing so.  He's not doing this for the money or the fame but to prove that we all want the same thing.  It doesn't matter whether we agree with what this man did or what he promoted, for theres not one of us who doesn't enjoy the freedom we have in this country, and all Larry Flynt wanted was the right to enjoy that freedom as well.  What this film proved, and better yet what Larry's life proved, is that once you start taking away the freedoms of one person based on our own viewpoints we start to limit ourselves and everyone around us.  If we started punishing those who didn't think like us the world would be a much colder place. <br /> <br />Now what needs to be mentioned, and what makes a film like this so great, is the brilliant acting on the part of the entire cast, from Harrelson's brilliant take on Larry Flynt to Edward Norton's turn as his cautious lawyer.  I wholeheartedly agree that Woody should have won the Oscar for this, for there is no one else that could have pulled this off the way he did.  Courtney Love is another cast memeber who deserves heeps of praise for her scene stealing performance as Larry's bisexual, drug addict wife.  Her performance blew me away with her commiment and dedication to her role.  She was the def. of commanding and stole every scene out from under Woody's feet.  I believe Courtney to be a huge star, and if she would only harness that drive she showed in this film then she could be much further then she is now.  As a whole, in everyway, this is a great film that is about so much more than 'porn' but about growth and the fight for the American dream!

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|\\"Transamerica\\" never played in the movie theatre in our little town of Greenville, North Carolina.  So being somewhat in the cinematic sticks, it's a real thrill to finally get to watch Felicity Huffman's Oscar-nominated performance.  Wow!  My supposition before seeing the film was that it was going to hinge mostly on her makeup and ability to look masculine.  What most impressed me about her performance was the tenderness in the relationship that grows between Bree/Stanley and her son Toby.  Ultimately, memorable films aren't about special effects, but about the relationships between characters.  Huffman explored so many level of insecurity with her own personal identity, but then was able to overcome them to that critical moment where she reveals herself as his father to Toby.  Huffman fully deserved this nomination.<br /><br />As Toby, Kevin Zegers finally pulls out of the shadow a bit.  I can see that he's done quite a bit of work, but I certainly would never have recognized him.  As Toby, the young street hustler, he has the required chip on his shoulder.  The best moment for him was when he finally is brought together again with his stepfather who has sexually abused him and Zegers explodes with fury, disgust and pain.  It was an excellent performance.<br /><br />The other characters did good jobs.  It was nice to see Burt Young again as Bree's father Murray.  It's been a long time since his Best Supporting Actor nomination for \\"Rocky\\" in 1976!  Graham Green does a nice job as the lonely farmer Calvin who befriends Bree.  Elizabeth Pena from \\"Rush Hour\\" and \\"Lone Star\\" does a nice job as the firm therapist who causes Bree to face her past before moving into her future.  Fionnnula Flanagan from \\"Four Brothers\\" and \\"The Others\\" does a fine performance as the mother Elizabeth who doesn't have the capacity to understand or accept her son/daughter's new identity.  Grant Monohon makes a memorable full frontal appearance as the hitchhiker who seems so new age enlightened and winds up driving away as a carjacker.  Dolly Parton's Best Song nomination was also a delight over the closing titles.<br /><br />While this film received a lot of buzz because of the transsexual content, it ultimately succeeds as Duncan Tucker's first directorial effort because it seems to be about real people.  This was an excellent project about tolerance and understanding.  Bravo!nlightened and winds up driving away as a carjacker.

B000002OX5|5.0|The Who Sell Out is a milestone recording, and has for years been a long standing favorite of mine. I own two different vinyl copies which I have cherished. My decision to buy this on cd was based on a friend's recommendation and the fact that there are \\"extra songs\\". I was unprepared for just how many additional songs are included on this release, and most of them are simply jaw-droppingly astounding.<br /><br />My personal favorite bonus track on Sell Out is The Who's version of \\"Melancholia\\", which I had heard previously only as Pete Townshend's demo that he released on the \\"Scoop\\" album. The notes for \\"Scoop\\" tell that perhaps it was Roger who was unhappy with Melancholia as it wasn't quite \\"macho\\" enough. Also the Coca-Cola track just simply rocks. What an amazing band The Who were! This record is epic!<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with this record then I seriously advise the stopping of your first several listenings with Rael (I) in order to truly experience the album as it was released and intended to be heard. Only after should you dive into all of these bonus tracks as your reward!<br /><br />The remastering here is excellent and should be played at excessively loud volumes over and over and over again in order to truly appreciate it .<br /><br />This is quite simply inspiring and should belong in the collection of every music lover with any interest in '60's music or british pop. The sophistication of craft, the range of genres from song to song, the songwriting and the playing have no equal anywhere. Even if you think you may not like The Who (perhaps you have only heard the classic rock '70's anthems, or maybe you thought Tommy was pretensious and long-winded) then you owe it to yourself to hear them at their absolute creative peak!
B000F6IOC0|3.0|Possible spoilage ahead...... <br /> <br />Sequels are really hard to do well, and while UE isn't bad, it doesn't quite match up to it's predecessor. <br /> <br />But it's got potential, which is more than can be said for most series in this genre which are extremely easy to ruin. My problem is the same one I had when I saw the first movie for the first time in it's theatrical DVD release; that is, a promising concept, but one that felt a little rushed and therefore, a little uneven. This kind of felt the same way, but having seen the way the first movie greatly benefitted from an \\"uncut\\" director's cut release, I'm fairly certain that the sequel can follow in those footsteps and become a little more fleshed out and complete. <br /> <br />One thing I greatly appreciated is the continuity of the effects and scenery. So many directors these days have success with effects driven flicks and immediately seize upon the opportunity to out do themselves in the sequels because they have so much more money to spend on CGI. Inevitably this leads to movies crammed full of painfully obvious and annoying green screen sets and are very short on any kind of story. In fact, the story just kind of serves as a distraction until the next explosion/monster/whatever kind of irritating FX trick someone can dream up comes in--see The Matrix & The Mummy sequels, and the grandaddy of them all..the recent Star Wars sequels.  It was extremely refreshing to hear Len Weisman actually say that just because the could have done more CGI, they didn't want to, relying on it only when the practical sets couldn't work, or when it actually added to the scene. <br /> <br />Interestingly enough, the one scene I could have done without and that I wouldn't miss at all if they decided to cut it for future releases, was the love scene. It felt out of place in the context of the overall story, and while I'm not saying it's out of the question that the characters would have jumped each other, it seemed a teensybit out of place. What made the way they relate to each other interesting(to me, anyway)was that although there was an instant kind of recognition and connection between their characters, it was slow to build and they were wary and cautious around each other to the very end of the first movie. These actors have good on screen chemistry, but I think putting this scene in made not so good use of it. On that same note, because the sequel starts right on the heels of the first movie, meaning they have known each other a few days, his \\"death\\" and her reaction to it seemed a little out of place as well. <br /> <br />I would say, as other reviewers before me have, watch the first one again and then this. Weisman has done a good job with continuity, and the prologue and flashbacks help with the story, but putting the movies back to back will make it smoother.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, another sequel would be a bad idea, but making a prequel and delving more into the stories of Viktor, Lucius and the Corvinus family, and thus the start of the whole thing would be interesting. Anything to see more of Bill Nighy.
0385510454|4.0|Grisham is up to par with this book. Depth of character takes you from despising the bad guy to thinking he's not really that awful  after all - he becomes just a regular man with upscale tastes and high level intelligance mixed up in a very dangerous situation. The story brings legal and political maneuvering to a high point that an everyday citizen can understand. An interesting page turner.
B000FILW86|5.0|With the release in 1997 of their 2nd album with the title \\"Cheap Trick\\" it seemed the boys had found themselves completely.  Not only is that 1997 album one of Cheap Trick's best, it's one of the best rock n roll albums by anyone in many, many years.  Then after years of waiting finally came \\"Special One\\" - and it wasn't.  Right up there with \\"The Doctor\\" as the wonkiest of Trick albums . . . there were a couple of strong tracks like \\"Pop Drone\\" and \\"Sorry Boy\\" but overall, pretty disappointing after waiting so long. <br /> <br />So \\"Rockford\\" is a very pleasant surprise to me.  While there is still a little too much of the overly pop-py sound that screwed up much of \\"Special One\\" and not nearly enough of the raw edge that made 1997's \\"Cheap Trick\\" such a great record - this is certainly getting back to where things should be. <br /> <br />I've played it about 4 times in my office today and some of the melodies are starting to stick, so far \\"Decaf\\" seems to be the only MAJOR let down - something a little too reminiscent of \\"Hummer\\" on the last album. <br /> <br />But I think this album is going to grow on me.  It has certainly brought a smile to my face several times today.  And BTW, the Man of a Thousand voices sounds amazing and has thrown out a few new tricks (a James Brown, a better Lennon-esque voice than ever before on Oh Claire, a little Jeff Lynne) - The playing is solid by all. <br /> <br />Would still love another hard edged album from the boys, but this is a nice collection from a band that never strays too far from their roots.  And thank goodness for that.
1932100660|5.0|I've been vegan, i.e. eating a plant-based diet for about 4 years now. I thought I knew everything there was to know about nutrition and health. I thought that I was eating an incredibly healthy diet by avoiding all animal foods.  <br /> <br />T. Colin Campbell's book dispelled that notion. Since reading the book I have enormously altered my diet. Though the diet I ate was somewhat what Dr. Campbell recommends in that it was \\"plant-based\\", it lacked an important specification to that category, and that's \\"whole-foods\\".  <br /> <br />I learned that plenty of Vegan foods are unhealthy, i.e. those made my refined sugars, starches, etc... and those high in fat and salt.  <br /> <br />Dr. Campbell's research is overwhelming and convincing. What we need to be consuming for optimal health is a low-fat whole-foods plant-based diet.  <br /> <br />I have never felt more troubled by the idea of consuming animal products in terms of health-concerns . Everytime i see someone eat animal food, I feel deeply guilty, as if i were contributing to their ailment. I want to pour all of the information from The China Study out of my mouth, but i don't want to push them away by being perceived as dogmatic or biased. All i can do is sigh and tell myself that when i get the money, i'll buy them a copy and they can see for themselves.  <br /> <br />
B00004RF9I|5.0|Director:  Sidney Lumet <br />Cast:  Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, Robert Duvall, Wesley Addy, Ned Beatty, Arthur Burghardt, Bill Borrows, John Carpenter, Marlene Warfield, Beatrice Straight. <br />Running Time: 121 minutes <br />Rated R for language and sexual innuendo. <br /> <br />'Network' is Paddy Chafesky's riveting and grim tale of the sleaze surrounding the American television industry. Winner of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, \\"Network\\" is without a doubt one of the most powerful, influential and meaningful satires ever made. One of the reasons \\"Network\\" was so well received by both film critics and movie-going audiences was because it possessed a certain quality that most films unfortunately lack -- intricate and involving characters in realistic situations. The film follows a low-rated television network trying to keep its head above water. The network, UBS, has decided to fire an aging veteran news anchor, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), in an act of desperation to boost ratings. Beale is given a two-week notice, and instead of going out with his tale between his legs, Beale announces on live television he was fired and is going to kill himself. This raises panic and chaos at UBS, until they get the memo that Beale's crazed rant just bumped the ratings significantly. The UBS execs, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) decide to give Beale his own show where he complains and screams bout the problems with the world, while Beale's best friend (William Holden) feels it's inappropriate for the network to take advantage of a mentally-ill man. Besides exploiting a mentally unstable man, the company execs also work out a weekly program with a anti-establishment African-American communist, Laureen Hobbs (Marlene Warfield) following political terrorists and their violent outbursts.  The film also stars Beatrice Straight as Schumacher's boring wife, Conchetta Ferrell was an assistant working for the network and Ned Beatty who plays the sinister boss of the UBS television network who always gets what he wants. <br /> <br />\\"Network\\" boasts one of the finest and most intricate screenplays ever written that rightfully earned Paddy Chafesky the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Sidney Lumet's directing is absolutely incendiary and the movie has an incredibly strong cast. Faye Dunaway gives what is perhaps her very best screen performance as the cutthroat Network executive, while Robert Duvall is just as brilliant as the ruthless Frank Hackett (which should have earned him an Oscar nomination, period!) Beatrice Straight is solid in her role (not quite Oscar-worthy if you ask me, though) and Marlene Warfield is just as great. The two performers who really steal the show however are William Holden and Peter Finch. Both nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the Academy Awards in 1977, Peter Finch gives a startling and powerful performance as the 'mad-as-hell' (not to mention crazy-as-hell) Howard Beale, while William Holden gives a subtle but none-the-less outstanding performance as the conflicted Max Schumacher. It's hard to say who was better, but if I absolutely had to decide I'd choose Holden's non-Oscar-winning performance slightly over Finch's sympathy Oscar-winning performance (he still was extraordinary, though). I honestly believe if Finch hadn't died just after the film, Holden would have taken home the Oscar gold for Best Leading Actor, both were still magnificent. The only player in the cast that I felt wasn't that great was Ned Beatty. In a role far deserving from an Oscar nomination (which he for some odd reason received), Beatty plays the angry little man role he always does. Besides Beatty's lackluster performance and marginal pacing problems towards the middle (you are going to get that in any 70s film that isn't a Kubrick film), the movie is utterly entertainment perfection.
B000FILW86|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet. I'm a big Cheap Trick fan, but I acknowledge that they have put out a few shakey albums over the years. This is not one of them. Rockford is fantastic! Great catchy tunes, well produced, and incredibly well played and sung. I've listened to it over and over again for the past day and I just can't believe what a solid CD the boys have delivered. How anyone could give this a negative review is beyond me. If anyone gave this less than fours stars, they need to have their hearing checked and get some taste.
B000002BFL|5.0|I wonder if the reviewer XraySpex had listened to this CD? To write such a pathetic review... <br /> <br />This CD along with the GREAT \\"Nebraska\\" and the also magnific \\"Devils & Dust\\" completes a trilogy of great Springsteen records. My favourite tracks are: \\"The Ghost Of Tome Joad\\", \\"Straight Time\\", \\"Highway 29\\", \\"Sinaloa Cowboys\\", \\"Across The Border\\", \\"My Best Was Never Good Enough\\" and, especially, \\"Youngstown\\", with Soosie Tyrell on violin and Marty Rifkin on pedal steel guitar. I really do believe that \\"Youngstown\\" is one of the BEST Bruce's songs. <br /> <br />This proves - once again, once and for all - that Bruce Springsteen is one of the great American Ambassadors.
B000002H33|5.0|A week ago, I attended the Rock Am Ring festival in Germany where Metallica headlined.  I remember my buddy saying something along the lines \\"I hope they don't play a lot of there newer (St. Anger) stuff\\"  Low and behold... The show starts off with a few songs... James gets on the mic and says \\"You are all in for a little bit of a treat.  Since it is our 20th anniversary of our 'Master of Puppets' album... WE ARE GOING TO PLAY THE ENTIRE THING FOR YOU!!!!!\\"   <br /> <br />So yes, I heard argueably the greatest metal album in its entirety, and it sounding so good... just lets you know how good of an album it really was/is and ever will be.  Just Fantastic.
B000002GQJ|5.0|This 1970 release saw the Moodies simplifying the approach taken on the 1969 concept album To Our Children's, Children's, Children, which was an album that explored the possibility of spiritual enlightenment through space travel.  Notwithstanding, while A Question of Balance may have had both feet planted on the Earth, it was no less \\"cosmic\\".<br /><br />There are some fantastic songs on this album including my favorite piece Question, And the Tide Rushes In (Ray's best piece in my opinion), Its Up to You, Dawning is the Day, Mike Pinder's spacey and haunting Melancholy Man, and The Balance.  The acoustic guitar and most importantly, the mellotron with string setting are used a lot on this album, which give the songs a very...well...melancholy feel.  There are some lighter moments too though, especially with upbeat and whimsical songs like The Tortoise and the Hare, so it is not all doom and gloom.  The Moodies would continue with this formula for the next two albums, which would conclude with Seventh Sojourn in 1972.<br /><br />This remastered version has pretty good sound quality and loads of liner notes by members of the band.<br /><br />A Question of Balance is very highly recommended along with Days of Future Passed (1967), In Search of the Lost Chord (1968), and To Our Children's, Children's, Children (1969).
B000ETQRCM|1.0|Thuis album is disgusting, its boring, safe, mom dangerous, and worst of all, it focusses on politics, not the lyrics (lyrics are lyrics are lyrics) but they over shadow everything, the album, artwork, the lyrics. BORING!!! <br /> <br />It limits the listner, music does not have to be about one thing, especially for the individuals that lsuten to it. <br /> <br />Worst of all its by Pearl Jam, a band who have'nt shown a decent album since Yield or No Code, Binuaral and Riot Act, were almost shimmering with glimpses of hope, but they just werent there. <br /> <br />Absolutley awful.

B00000I8NC|5.0|Okay, we all know Godspeed is liberal and in opposition to a lot of our and canada's political ideas, however BBF3 is not anti-American, it is about gun-control. The piece is about the combination of anger and a loose grip on reality. The political aspect is the realization that such a person could possibly have the arsenol he descirbes. His hatred for the American government is not the band's stance, it's used to provide a soundtrack to desperation, anger, and helplessness. And this song, broken into two parts, is amazing in it's ability to convey such emotion.

The film is really fun from start to finish maybe becouse it's a fun movie of errors from mistaken identities and so on. The story is fast paced and has many funny moments. The acting is also really good from Heath Ledger to Sierean Miller and Oliver Platt who steals every scene. The film is really fun and a must watch.
B00004YW6I|5.0|The fascination I have with female artists seems to know no bounds. From Madonna and Britney, to Bjork and Tori Amos, to Joni Mitchell and Kate Bush, I definitely prefer female music over that of the male. PJ Harvey is someone who I was not very familiar with, and had always avoided her music as I thought it was too rocky for my taste. However, I'm all about experimentation and at Christmas I bought her Mercury Music Prize-winning fifth album \\"Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea.\\" I knew about the album years before I bought it; albums that win that kind of award become notoriously famous despite how many copies they sell. Such was the case with Polly.<br /><br />At first I didn't like the music on this album very much, it was 'just okay' pop rock. However, I'd only listened to the first few songs and always skipped back to something more familiar. It's been six months since I bought the album, and I've listened to it many times since, coming to love almost every single song. This is a very clich&eacute;d statement, but this really is one of the best female singer-songwriter albums out there. I am compelled to delve further into the music of this artist, as I am with so many others. I'm sure I will be surprised and pleased.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Big Exit,\\" which is ironically, a big opener. The guitar is very loud and catches your ear straight away, building like an enormous wall of water. Polly's vocal delivery is stunning, very powerful, as she shouts, screams and wails, desperately trying to compete with the enormity of the sheer sound. The quiet break down in the middle only serves as a reminder of the power of the song as it fires back up and she sings, \\"I walk on concrete, I walk on sand! But I can't find a safe place to stand!\\" The next song is \\"Good Fortune,\\" a catchy mid-tempo pop rock song that actually has substance and isn't bland like a lot of crap out there. The verses are what make this song memorable, with Polly drawing out her lines. The sound of this song is just purely beautiful. Her voice is indescribable, I get more drawn in the more I listen to it. \\"A Place Called Home\\" is another amazing song, quite similar to the previous song. The keyboard and piano work on this song is of particular interest to me, especially towards the end, sinking through the guitars like a sun setting on the horizon. \\"One Line\\" is a slower song, but picks up pace as the song progresses. It's actually quite difficult to describe the sound of this song; sometimes I think it's very slow, then I listen to the guitar and I think, No, it's quite fast actually. Thom Yorke provides backing vocals on this song, adding a very sparse atmosphere to the soundscapes.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Feeling\\" is an incredibly dark but beautiful song. It's precisely four minutes long and features Yorke on backing vocals yet again. He adds something to this song that makes it so special, which along with the understated guitar softly playing away and Polly's passionate vocal delivery is just perfection. \\"The Whores Hustle And The Hustlers Whore\\" is one of my favourite songs on the album. It opens with amazing guitar work that is, right from the start, just a massive, colossal wall of sound. Imagine a wall of water in slow-motion and that's how I see it. Polly's vocal delivery is snarling, nasty and very powerful, enhanced by her high-pitched yelp just before the first chorus. Her operatic outro to the song reveals her as this Goddess-like figure possessed, very compelling. \\"This Mess We're In\\" is a duet with Thom Yorke. The two voices work very well in this song about the disintegration of a relationship. The musicianship is also one of the strongest on the entire album. The spoken bits at the end are the highlight for me. \\"You Said Something\\" is one of my personal favourites that I find myself singing a lot when I'm not actually listening to the album. I love the opening line, \\"On a rooftop in Brooklyn, at one in the morning, watching thelights flash, in Manhattan.\\" As the listener want to know what this something is that the person has told PJ, but of course we never find out. The imagery of this song is very urban and representative of PJ's music at this point in her career. I love the city-life feel of it, it's quite refreshing.<br /><br />\\"Kamikaze\\" is the shortest song on the album at just over two minutes long, but it's probably the rockiest thing on the entire thing. PJ gets a lot of words out in this song. The chorus is very high-powered and energetic, with high-pitched screeching - almost a hardcore Kate Bush for the 21st Century! \\"This Is Love,\\" one of the album's three singles is one of the catchiest tracks on the album. The bass is quite dirty and ultimately very catchy. The vocal delivery is exposed, standing on its own. Polly has no shame singing loud and proud in these songs, and this is no exception. \\"Horses In My Dreams\\" is quite different to anything we've heard up until this point. It's also one of my favourite songs here. Very slow opening, takes its time to get going, but the piano work here is just incredibly beautiful. Polly's voice seems emotionally damaged which I think adds something raw to the song. \\"We Float\\" is another amazing song. At over six minutes long, it's an epic track, reinforced by the chorus where Polly draws out the line \\"We float!\\" over and over. It reminds me to take life easy, and not to get too stressed, which is a very important thing for me because I get too worked up sometimes!<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />The UK version of the album includes a bonus track, \\"This Wicked Tongue.\\" Overall this album is one to keep. I can imagine listening to this years from now and reminding myself of my teenage youth! The album features three UK singles, none of which made the Top 40 unfortunately. The album itself peaked at No.23 in the UK, despite all the hype and attention it received from the Mercury Music Prize. In America, the album debuted at No.42. Polly won the Mercury Award Prize for this album of September 11th 2001, and recorded her acceptance speech from a hotel window in New York as she watched the events unfold behind her. This only makes some of the music on this album more poignant in my opinion, especially \\"A Place Called Home,\\" \\"Horses In My Dreams\\" and \\"We Float.\\" Since buying this album I also bought \\"Uh-Huh Her,\\" yet that album has still to grow on me. I am confident it will, though as much as this one I am not sure.lights flash, in Manhattan.\\" As the listener want to know what this something is that the person has told PJ, but of course we never find out.

0201485672|5.0|This book makes a wonderful reference and should be on every developer's shelf. I gain new insights whenever I pick it up even on concepts that I thought I knew. <br /> <br />Read the first several chapters when you first get this book - they are well-written and eye-opening. The remainder of the book is a catalog of Refactorings, which I recommend skimming initially and periodically poking through to refresh your fundamentals and pick up on the hidden gems.
6301174240|4.0|I felt compelled to write this review for anyone who, like me, intended to purchase this for their children.  It has many great scenes/stories that are fun for kids, but the last 1/4 of the film is extremely violent--machine guns, mobsters, shootings, child abduction, etc.  This is unfortunate as this last segment contains some of the best dancing and choreography of the entire video.
0321213351|1.0|There seems to be a common misconception that Refactoring and Patterns are disconnected things. I had high hopes that this would be the book that cleared this misconception and tied them together. <br /> <br />But I found the examples to be contrived, and often not deserving of the patterns that were applied. The step-by-step examples were hard to follow as they constantly gave tiny snippets of code that were missing proper context. <br /> <br />As important as I think this topic and message is, I can't imagine this book convincing anyone who wasn't already convinced. At best, this might make a passable supplement to someone learning patterns for the first time from another source. <br /> <br />On the bright side, some of the stories in the early chapters were entertaining, but not enough to recommend this derivative work.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|I expected more and something a little more original.  Sure these guys always wore their influences in bold print on their black t-shirts, but this was a bit much.  You can hear a very (VERY) heavy influence of Depeche Mode's Violator and Children of God era of the Swans.  Mix that with some catchy Green Day like hooks, and that's the latest AFI album. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong.  Its an okay record.  Better than something than I could have come up with.  I'm curious to hear where they go from here.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|This album just like hypnotized is garbage and is a disgrace to the great early two albums. the songs are not as good , but basically the main reason is because serj is the man and daron sux. he is literally the worst singer i have ever heard. Serj did so great on the first two and even steal the album was good(it was better before the commercial release)but ever since then daron is slowly taken serj's place. i wont be surprised if serj isnt even on the next album. do yourself a favor and buy toxicity or their self titled album instead of this crap. that guys voice is like needles in my ears. let sej sing again or i think soad is already done.
B000EGCITG|4.0|I was highly impressed with P!nk's latest album. Throughout her history I've always been dissapointed with a lot of what was on each release. However, I love almost every single song on I'm Not Dead! It's her best yet.
B000FILW86|5.0|Cheap Trick is my all-time favorite band and I am very impressed with this release! I can't stop listening to it! BUY IT!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|To me, the most disappointing thing about this album is the lack of Alan Forbes artwork.  But that's about it.<br /><br />It doesn't have the raw intensity of \\"Black Sails,\\" or the diversity of \\"Sing the Sorrow.\\"  And that's a good thing.  AFI are the one band I can count on to release drastically different yet wholly satisfying albums each time.  About a year after \\"Sorrow,\\" I lost interest in the band, but I couldn't help but be pulled back in as 6/6/06 grew closer.<br /><br />I was disappointed after the first few listens, but it takes a while for the album to reveal its sonic secrets.  Bitch and moan all you want about the techno stuff and how it doesn't sound like blah blah blah.  Judge this album on its own merits.  When I heard the piano on \\"Silver and Cold\\" during my first listen of \\"Sing the Sorrow,\\" I wanted to kick AFI for including a piano.  When I first heard \\"Decemberunderground,\\" I wanted to kick them for not having a song that sounded like \\"Silver and Cold.\\"  In three years, people will be complaining the new album doesn't sound enough like this one.  \\"Summer Shudder,\\" \\"Love Like Winter,\\" and \\"The Missing Frame,\\" have become fast favorites. Just like Billy Preston once did for the Beatles, Ronan Harris has added a fantastic layer to AFI's songs.<br /><br />I'm not a teenybopper mall goth.  I'm just a regular guy who stumbled upon AFI during high school around the time of \\"Black Sails.\\"  They've captivating performers, and since Jade and Hunter joined the band, they've only gotten better and better and built an amazing catalogue.  I still haven't found an easy way to describe them to someone who's never heard them.  There's no song on here that matches the transcendence of \\"God Called In Sick Today,\\" but I'd rather they keep growing in new directions than trying to top old songs on each new release.  I think once these songs settle in our minds, they will stand up well with the past three albums.<br /><br />Someone on here mentioned that Davey too often resorts to suicide as a topic.  He always has.  Read the lyrics for \\"Last Kiss\\" and tell me that song isn't about suicide.  He just calls it by its name this time around.  Oddly, this is AFI's most optimistic sounding album.  If you are disappointed with it, keep listening.  Don't get hung up comparing it to past albums.  There's plenty here to love.<br /><br />This is AFI's music.  We're just along for the ride.  I haven't been there since the beginning, but I'll be there until the end.Davey too often resorts to suicide as a topic.  He always has.

B000002H70|5.0|From the opening notes of Plainsong to the final bits of Untitled, Disintegration grabs the listener and envelopes them in its own dark atmosphere. Everyone has heard of Pictures of You and Love Song, But the true gem is the incredible Same Deep Water as You. Each note is clear and distinct, without distraction and overlapping sounds. Every instrument is precise and vibrant. In Lullaby, Robert Smith practically exhales every word as beautiful strings play in the background. This is an album that brings the listener into its world and shares its wonderful story.
0689859414|5.0|My 8 yr old son says the following - <br /> <br />I really like the book and the illustrations.   <br /> <br />The dragon page is really hard to close.  Some of the pages fold out, but if you aren't really careful, you'll bend or tear them when you try to fold them closed. <br /> <br />
B000BB1MHS|5.0|I wouldn't say this movie is as good as the first one but it's good. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) looked better. He had a nice haircut. I would like to get one like his. The songs however were better. My two favorites were Veruca Salt and Mike Teevee. Veruca Salt's song sounded like a song from 1969. And that Hard Rock band that was playing on Mike Teevee's song reminded me of that band KISS and it also sounded like that song by Queen \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" When I heard this movie came out, I felt as though this was sort of like a historic moment because this is like the sequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) since the old movie was made 34 years ago as of last year and that's a pretty long time for a sequel to come out. I don't know why Tim Burton wanted to use just a 100 Deep Roys as Oompa Loompas. He could've used other actors who are Midgets like Warwick Davis or Verne Troyer. The plot is sort of the same where Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) and his family are poor and there are 5 Golden tickets in any 5 Wonka bars. Later on Charlie finds it and he tours the Chocolate factory with 4 other kids Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) who eats so many Candy Bars a day, Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) who gets everything she wants because her father Mr. Salt (James Fox) is rich, Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) who chews gum all day long and also won many trophies for activites, and a nerdish kind of guy Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) who likes watching TV and playing Video Games but hates Chocolate and Mr. Wonka. While in the factory, they don't listen to Mr. Wonka and do what they want to do and don't win the factory. However Charlie won the factory and also shows some new stuff not in the original movie like what the kids looked like after their incidents and Mr. Wonka lands his glass elevator into Charlie's poorhouse and tells his family he won the Chocolate factory but Mr. Wonka says he cannot bring his family with him so Charlie turns down the offer. Things turned out a little better for the Bucket family but not for Willy. Then later on Charlie is Polishing Shoes and Willy Wonka comes to get his shoes Polished and after Charlie talks about Willy, Willy reveals himself and says why he doesn't want Charlie's family to come to the factory because they tell you what to do and what not to do but Charlie tells him that they're just trying to protect you because they love you and later on Charlie takes Mr. Wonka to see his Dad, Dr. Wilbur Wonka who's a Dentist and actually before this part, it mentions about Willy's childhood. Wilbur didn't want Willy to eat one piece of chocolate or candy. But later on Willy likes it and starts eating just that and Wilbur doesn't like it so Willy runs away and that's how he ran the chocolate factory. Because of this, Willy didn't want to see his Dad but Wilbur recognizes Willy and realizes how much he loved Willy so Willy changes his mind and makes the offer to Charlie again about the factory and gives it to him under one condition, he brings his family along. Anyway, this was a pretty good movie, I thought it wasn't gonna be better than the first movie but it actually was and I recommend it to everyone especially Johnny Depp fans.
0143034901|4.0|This story is beautifully written and engrossing, and held my attention till the end.  I loved all his descriptions and the characters were well drawn.  It had elements of tragedy, love, and humor.  No novel is perfect, hence the following critique: It would have been better had the dialogue fit the time period of 1945-1966 and not been filled with modern vernacular phrases and slang such as \\"catch my drift\\", etc.  At the end of the book, the female character who writes in 1st person and sums up the story of Julian could not have possibly known some of the events and dialogue between characters which she discloses.  Some killings take place at the very end which logically couldn't have occurred as described.  Certain characters who should logically be dead, live to a ripe old age.  But what bothered me the most was, Daniel says he has one week to live so the reader expects him to die tragically -- instead, this is only a ruse used for dramatic effect.
0312954468|5.0|This book is excellent the characters are people who the reader would admire and you could not wait for Lord Intef to die. Anybody who considers this as 1 or 2 star, DOES NOT KNOW A GOOD READ and that is my opinion. This book is a perfect example of life on the Nile.

B000EHRVP6|3.0|\\"Hostel\\" is an interesting little movie and definitely a step up from Eli Roth's \\"Cabin Fever\\", which was pretty disappointing after all that hype. Watching \\"Hostel\\", it made me temporarily reassess my desires for going to Amsterdam in all honesty. I love the setup for this film and it's actually pretty scary to think about it from the perspective of the protagonists. I think the movie loses steam about two thirds into it and becomes kind of goofy in a way but it works really well as an exploitation piece and a general horror movie. It's not the most gruesome movie I've ever seen but it gets pretty rough at times. Definitely worth a watch for the gorehounds.<br /><br />This unrated cut is not much different from what I remember the theatrical version to be. This whole trend of releasing a movie on DVD as an unrated cut kind of bites, personally speaking. Damn marketing ploys...<br /><br />Anyway, this DVD has nice picture and sound and a fair amount of extras (four commentaries is kind of ridiculous for a movie like this but... whatever), including a nice little trio of behind the scenes featurettes that show some of the more interesting aspects of the whole production. This DVD presentation was okay but I can't help but feel that we'll probably see something even more concise down the road.

0307277674|4.0|As I read the last few negative reviews of this book, I realize that most were trying to make the book into something that it was never meant to be. Of course this book is popular entertainment. Of course the book will appeal to those who prefer candy and rush-to-the-end rollercoaster rides over those who enjoy more mentally nourishing, denser fare. The Da Vinci code was written for audiences that appreciate popular thrillers. Note the short, breathless chapters ending on exciting points--no less a page-turning guarantee. The book was never meant to be Kant's metaphysics.<br /><br />That said, and taking the whole thing in proper context, I found the book enjoyable. As stated, it's a quick read and engaging enough to be one of those books that kept me going until I fell asleep, and one that I picked up and started reading as soon as I awakened.<br /><br />I'm taking off one star for some rather implausible plot turns, not the least of which occur when our heroes Sophie and Robert are allowed to escape over and over from various places from which they should never have escaped. I suppose this had to be done in order to keep the reader turning those pages, but all of it together was bit much.<br /><br />The quest is interesting, the connections intriguing (though debatable)...but none of the information will be new to those with a decent knowledge of history and mythology.  The characters are not exceptionally well-drawn, though I'm willing to give Brown a pass on this, given the \\"quick bite\\" nature of the book.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code ain't deep and it ain't perfect, but it is pleasant...at least in the same manner as a fairly well-done Hollywood movie is pleasant. Read it in bed, take it to the beach or on a plane. You'll find it a nice distraction.

B000002H97|4.0|Metallica didnt sellout. This Metallica's Heavy Metal stage. All the albums after this are Hard/Modern Rock and THATS when they sold out. The only reason this got 4 stars from me is because it DOES stray away from the original thrashiness that was Metallica. Still a solid Metal album though. Buy it, along with Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and . . .And Just For All.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Before the album came out, I had listened to some of the songs on their myspace. When I heard Miss Murder, my first thought was \\"What is this? It sounds so much more pop-punkish than their other stuff.\\" and I was worried that DECEMBERUNDERGROUND wouldn't be as good as I was hoping it would be. A little while later, they posted Kill Caustic on their page, and I liked it more than Miss Murder... But it seemed to have too much screaming for my enjoyment. Despite my worries, I bought the CD the day it came out. My initial reaction to it was not a good one. I felt as though AFI was begining to sound alot like other bands... I knew they hadn't changed in order to become popular. I know AFI wouldn't sellout. They just wanted to change. But still, I was somewhat disappointed. I still continued to listen to it, because I can never get enough of Davey's vocals. Before I knew it I had these songs stuck in my head. I had fallen in love with AFI all over again. From it's softer sounding songs, such as The Interview (Which has an AMAZING, melodic ending) and Love Like Winter, to it's heavier songs like Affliction and, of course, Kill Caustic, this CD is packed with talent. Looking back, I really don't know how I couldn't have liked Miss Murder. In conclusion, it took me a bit of getting used to, but I now love this album just as much as the others. AFI are back, with just as much energy and emotion as before.
B0000046PE|5.0|\\"First Lady of Song\\" is a great starting point for Fitzgerald looking for sampling of her work while on the Verve label from 1956 to 1966; probably her most seminal and memorable work, not to slight her Decca recordings in the decade before.  Verve gave Ella the freedom to do what she wanted and Ella pursued that with a vengeance, releasing a series of landmark recordings covering the \\"Songbooks\\" of American Pop Standards that may never be equaled.  Ella covered them all, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Rogers and Hart, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen, and Jerome Kern.  \\"First Lady of Song\\" covers all those songbooks and whole lot more including her recordings with Louis Armstrong, Nelson Riddle, and others.  While this is a great sampler it's more of a survey of what Ella was up to at Verve and if anything only whets your appetite for more.  Her vocal prowess, agility, and versatility are neatly showcased here and it makes you wonder if there was anything she couldn't sing.  I frequently found myself wishing to hear more of Ella in particular style, be it Ellington, Porter, or even her very swinging Christmas record.  True, Ella lacked the drama of Billie Holiday, the sass of Sarah Vaughn, but she more than made up for it in a willingness to take gambles and risks that more often that not paid off.  This collection will leave you begging for more!

0440217563|5.0|Finally, the third book starts with a punch.  I don't like when you have to trudge through 10 chapters to become interested in the story.  I loved the reunion between Claire and Jamie and the fact that this book didn't center around Roger and Brianna quite as much.  Loved it.  Another keeper from Diana Gabaldon.  These are by far the most romantic books I have ever read.  5 years later and I can't forget this wonderful story.
B000B5UL7G|2.0|Stokes' favourite son belts out another hit album. Sadly there is nothing original here, just another mish-mash of pop tunes that could have been done by any X Factor wannabee.  In fact it may be fair to say that Mr Williams has done very little since 'Let Me Entertain You' and perhaps now might be the time to call it a day, especially as he's struggling to get anyone in the U.S. to notice him! He obviously has talent but why he insists on releasing formulaic albums such as this one is beyond me.  I've given this two stars simply for the fact the cd makes a useful coaster for my coffee mug!

B0000026DJ|5.0|One guy came to me one day and said \\"listen to that one buddy, it's pretty cool\\". It was in 1993, and most people had never heard about this band in Europe, including myself.    And it was the great shock. It takes only a few seconds to realize what a masterpiece you have. This kind of thing happens rarely. Such an incredible voice, and this powerful, wild sound, coming from \\"elsewhere\\"... They reinvented rock & roll, and they did not joke!   Beds are burning was this kind of song that could appeal to almost everyone, from the hard rock purist to the radio amateur. The melody itself is eternal.  Another fantastic song on the album is \\"put down that weapon\\". Musically as impressive as the former one, it impresses also with the passion Garret has to deliver his peaceful message.    There is no weak track on this album. I mean, try any of them alone, and you will have something between \\"positively inspired\\" and \\"awesome\\".  Every track has got this sense of rough urgency that is the trademark of the group. In the same time the whole is perfectly produced and played.    Just my opinion, in the \\"ranking game\\" : Now that I know most of their albums, I would give 5 stars for 3 of them :    1. 10,9,8,7,6,5...  2. Diesel & Dust  3. Place without a postcard    Enjoy !
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first saw Firefly on Fox, I immediately identified with the characters and actually 'felt' for them when they were in danger. I usually don't do that with any show. The acting is great and the story line so original. Western meets scifi. I own this box set and have watched it 4 times and have loaned it out to friends and family who also want to buy the box set.
0375831002|5.0|Reading The Book Thief was like being a fly on the wall during a terrible part of our world's history.  There was great sadness, but there was continuous hope. Markus Zusak created  characters that became very visible.  With Death as the narrator, he hooked me on the first page. I can't wait until my children are old enough to read it. This book is a treasure!
0743424425|3.0|I'm sure I will be crucified by King fans for this review but I must say that after having seen the movie a dozen times and after three days of reading this book, I am not at all impressed. I am not a fan of Steven King's writing style at all and although the first half of this book kept me interested, I still found that it was an awful lot of work to get through. I suppose he is known for this now, but it takes King three pages to describe a car ride up a hill during a blizzard. Again, just not the kind of writing style that keeps me or the plot moving along at a fast enough pace to keep focused. <br /> <br />All in all, my summation of this book is that it is an awfully depressing story about one man's terrible struggle with alcoholism, his desire to prove to his family that he is really a good man while battling with the \\"inner demons\\" of his past, in other words, the memories of the nasty things he has done while intoxicated. Then, there is Danny.  A little five year old boy who not only is the abused son of an alcoholic father but who also possesses this awful ability to sense doom and see horrors of the past and future that he must struggle with alone because he cannot share these thoughts or feelings with his parents for fear of them thinking he is insane.  THEN, to top all that off, this family ends up in a haunted hotel. So there are really at least three plots working here: 1) Jack and the lifelong battle of an alcoholic 2) Danny and his torment as he tries to protect his parents and make sense out of the psychic war that goes on inside his head 3)The Hotel itself and all of the weirdness that goes on there (and what goes on there for me, was never all that horrific and actually there are only a handful of scenes that are actually scary. The hedges (okay, enough with the animals moving already), the lady in the tub, the hand in the snow, the dogman in the hallway etc...but for some reason, all of this was just more torment for Danny instead of good scaresfor me. <br /> <br />And finally, the ending is so unsatisfying, so anti-climactic, I was actually searching the pages after the final page thinking, that can't be the end, there has to be more! But alas, it was truly over. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a realistic, honest account of an alcoholic's mind as he tries to stay sober and patch things up with the hurt he's caused the ones he loves. But to read this looking for a good scare, you won't get it.  <br /> <br />Also, have you ever realized how many suffering children there are in King's books? Carrie, Pet Sematary, Cujo, It, Firestarter, The Shining, the list goes on and on. He must have had some wicked childhood to write so many stories about children in so much pain. Just too disturbing for me... <br />
B000FFJ85I|4.0|decemberunderground is as different from sing the sorrow as sing the sorrow was from the art of drowning as the art of drowning was from black sails.  maybe more so.  if you didn't see this coming you haven't been paying attention. <br />that said, it is a beautiful album.  my intial reaction to sing the  sorrow was \\"what the hell is this?\\"  now i listen to it and wonder how i could ever been so closed minded.  now i appreciate it as the culmination of all of afi's influences, progression and growth, and as one of the best albums to come out in a long time.  if you want a readily accesible album, this probably isn'it it.  if you want a punk album, this definately isn't it.  if you want a carbon copy of anything afi has done before, this isn't it. <br />this album is, however, a thouroughly enjoyable blend of industrial, 80'a new wave, punk (yes, i said the \\"p-word\\") and post hardcore.  as far as mentions of emo darlings as influences, this album is far more depeche mode than my chemical romance, and in my opinion, that's not a bad thing. <br />get over afi's punk roots (that was then, this is now), get over sing the sorrow (that was a once in a lifetime record), get over your own expectations, and give this album a chance.  if you do, i think you'll find yourself wondering why you ever said \\"what the hell is this,\\" the first time you heard it.
0803729227|5.0|I love this book and so does my 3 year old boy.  The story is adventurous and has a nice, subtle ecological lesson.  It also has a lesson about how you can be little but still accomplish great things.  The pictures are gorgeous.  The whole story rhymes and has such a nice rhythm.
1400079179|3.0|I am generally for this book, despite disagreeing with a number of its premises. If you're only planning to read it now, then you'd definitely find it over-hyped given the unbelievable amount of publicity it has received. Yet when I first picked it some two years ago, I found it hard to put down.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is a competent piece of fiction - a neat blend of conspiracy theory, suspense and romance that will appeal to a wide variety of tastes (as it has). The characters are typically one-dimensional, as with many pop thrillers of this kind; and the plot, a reinterpretation of the grail legend, is certainly not new. But Dan Brown keeps the reader going with a tight storyline and intelligent puzzles along the way. The puzzles, which are cleverly weaved into the grail conspiracy, are, in my opinion, the chief selling-point of the book and help to raise it above the ordinary thriller.<br /><br />This being said, the book should be read as fictional, and nothing more. Strange I should be saying this about what is obviously a piece of fiction; yet the religious debates generated by the book sometimes verge on treating it as a non-fictional source. It doesn't help that the book itself gives the impression that it is based on historical fact. What is certain, however, is that some of the 'facts' central to the book, such as the existence of the Priory of Sion or of a bloodline from Jesus, are highly disputable. The book has opened up debates, but it cannot provide answers to them.<br /><br />If you're expecting the Da Vinci Code to be a literary masterpiece or a piece of well-researched historical fiction, then you'd be sorely disappointed. Read it, however, if you're looking for a good ol' page-turning pop thriller.
076790592X|3.0|A short, sweet and supposedly sad book, popular culture ensures that many have heard the name, Tuesdays with Morrie. The book was recommended to me in passing by a coworker a couple of years ago. It was in the back of my mind when I was watching a Simpson Christmas episode and Homer referred to it. Homer screwed up Christmas (again) and stated, \\"This is sadder than Tuesdays with Morrie.\\" I had to give in to reading it when Will & Grace dedicated an entire episode to the book.  <br /> <br />Without giving away much, you have an old man - a teacher - who is dying and a young man - a former student - who is in need (like all of us) for spiritual enlightenment. Within the span of about a dozen Tuesday meetings, Morrie passes his wisdom to the author.  <br /> <br />I was not overwhelmed by this book. I found that I knew of most of the parables although the book has been around for a couple of years and so the mainstream might have incorporated most of Morrie's lessons.  <br /> <br />I also didn't find it sad which I'd like to believe Morrie would have preferred. Morrie saw no sadness in death.  <br /> <br />Worth picking up if you have a chance. <br />
1592400876|4.0|Bestseller \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" is worth the price and time. Lynne Truss' writing skills blossom in this wonderful quick read on punctuation - its history, present use, and misunderstood flexibility.<br /><br />Truss' catchy chapter titles set the book's mood with headings such as<br /><br />`The Tractable Apostrophe; That'll do, Comma; Airs and Graces; and, Cutting a Dash.\\"<br /><br />She fills the book with stories, humor, and some great history.<br /><br />The exclamation point started out as \\"punctus interrogatus\\" in the 8th Century...The question mark was acquired in the second half of the 19th Century.<br /><br />Today, we have excuses for not using the colon and semicolon (I am guilty) since they are considered old fashion, middle-class, optional, mysteriously connected to pausing, and the difference between them is too negligible to be grasped by the brain of man. (Airs and Graces)<br /><br />Sir Roger Casement (1864- 1916), an Irish would be insurrectionist, was hanged \\"on a comma\\" after a trial in which his defense council plea was to argue a point of punctuation. (Much like the famous `Is is?' or \\"When is is is?'\\"<br /><br />\\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" will most certainly entertain those who are lovers of the written word - writers and readers - as well as those who like exploring the mundane with a humorous and fresh view. There is much to be gained in one reading. One of the big takeaways for me was to glean that punctuation usage, much like language, is evolving. There and will continue to be many fights over the \\"if, when, and where\\" of the usage of commas, colons, semicolons, hyphens, dashes, and italics. Television ads have contributed and escalated these fights. And with the introduction and broad use of the Internet, these fights may escalate to nuclear war!. Email and instant messaging have begun to erode what many believed to be a seemingly stable punctuation system.  Internet maybe sealing the doom of today's grammar.
0800105141|2.0|At the beginning of the film, while on a train, Ghandi (Ben Killingsley) is white. Not semi-white, he is completely white. Everyone in the class I was watching it with was totally confused, why the hell was this white guy calling himself Ghandi? I started to think that maybe Ghandi had a skin pigment problem, because in every scene he went from light, to semi-dark, to black as night. It was like a rotation, I was thoroughly confused. We get to watch Ghandi get arrested about 8 times during the movie. It gets to the point where the story isn't going anywhere, you just keep watching him get arrested. Then all of a sudden the British want to move out because the Indians don't fight back when they are hit with sticks. When the indians are being beaten by the police its almost like a 3 stooges routine. I understand the message, but I also understand that this was another attempt, and good one, to be the first to make a movie about something(one) that really intrigues people. You think Mel Gibson is a devout catholic? Please. If you want to ignore all the rediculousness and pretend that it was made by Indians for Indians, then you will get a lot out of this film. Just try and forget that Ghandi is a white, BRITISH, man.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Although I now have Tool albums from Opiate through to 10,000 Days, you couldn't describe me as a Tool fan.  Although there is much to like about Tool.  They have a distinctive, aggressive hard rock sound that is contrasted against quieter and odder moments.  This is their strength but with 10,000 Days also the weakness.  10,000 Days does sound like Lateralus does sound like Aenima.  I also liked the drumming, which in the 1990's boldly broke free of that 80's & 90's snare and kick drum only sound.  But this sounds a bit ordinary now too.    10,000 Days is overall more listenable than the predecessors, probably due to longer quieter tracks - not a draw card to a hard rock lover like me, but I'm not left with the feeling there is filler like on the previous albums.    My recommendation for prospective buyers is buy in the order Aenima, Lateralus, 10,000 Days and if your hooked by then anything else.    I'm interested to note that with all these reviews, no one appears to have commented on how well recorded and mastered 10,000 Days is.  On the recording front, no worries, the album is good.  On the mastering side - even Tool cannot break free of the dreaded Soft Limiter volume maximising (Ultra Maximizer, Wave Hammer, Elephant etc).  Yes, the soft limiting has been done masterfully, listening to 10,000 Days there is no obvious limiting induced distortion, and some dynamics are left.  But compared to say Opiate from 1992, this mastering is awful.  Why is it the level can't be dropped a few dB and the soft limiter forgotten?  Why do they want us to have second rate CD's?    Don't know what I'm talking about?  Google \\"Loudness War\\" and check out the wikipedia entry.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory is probably 2Pac's most intense cd.  It begins with \\"Bomb First\\" which is an adrenaline packed gansta rap song that actually made my hair stand on end the first few times I listened to it.  But, my hair stayed up listening to \\"Hail Mary,\\" which is eerie in both the beat and Pac's lyrics.  Then comes \\"Toss it Up,\\" which is a disappointment and probably the only downside of this entire album, and is the only song I ever skip when I listen to this cd (that and Life of an Outlaw, because of the Outlaws, they really have a way of ruining perfectly good Pac songs).  The rest of the album, however, maintains the intensity and raw energy of 2Pac, along with intelligent lyrics and possibly the best beats of any 2Pac album.   <br /> <br />Tupac is raw, energetic, powerful and a genius lyrically with this album.  If this is where 2Pac, or 'Makaveli,' was headed, it really is a shame he was taken away so soon.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|If you thought for even a second that these guys were going to slow down from their 2 previous albums \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Steal This Album!\\", we get rocked out again by the infectious melodic metal groves that is System of a Down. Going into album #4, another set of high expectations were already set for \\"Mezmerize\\" and as usual, no disappointments at all. Just plain out great music and even better, another great album. <br /> <br />I would venture to say that this album is a little more politically charged then previous albums but in the same kind of tongue in cheek way as \\"Steal This Alubm\\", the guys still poke fun at heavily publicized topics like Hollywood fame and even taking a somewhat different angle of war in the album's lead single \\"B.Y.O.B\\".  This album might be a little shorter than the other albums (11 songs and roughly 38 minutes total) but every song delivers a 1-2 combination of melody and metal, something sorely missed in a lot of metal these days. <br /> <br />And let's not forget the quirky lyrics and delivery, this album is no exception to their successful formula. I can't say the lyrics but \\"Cigaro\\" is a great example of what they do best. It's nice to see a metal band have some fun but still be able to kick @ss. I will say that this album does have a lot of just weird songs on it like \\"Radio/Video\\", the before mentioned \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"Violent Pornography\\" but those of us who have been into these guys for a while will enjoy these tunes.  <br /> <br />The music itself has grown a little as well. The riffs are very sophisticated and melodic and even some experimentation in metal ska clown music melodies on \\"Radio/Video\\". Trust me, you'll see. This song is really weird but it's fun. Honestly, just like \\"Toxicity\\" I could find no real flaws on this album. I don't have any songs I flip through so that's a good thing for starters and second the songs are equally memorable in their own way. I really don't know how these guys do it. I've said it time and timeagain but whenever System comes out with something new, there's nothing that I get turned off about it.  <br /> <br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST this album! I don't think I would suggest it so strongly to new fans because of how obscure and experimental this album can be at times so if you're looking to get into System, check out \\"Toxicity\\" first. \\"Steal This Album!\\" isn't that great of a starting point either but it is a very good album as well. But if you want to go totally basic, just start with the self title debut and take it slow. 5 stars earned with ease!
B00000055E|4.0|Your purchase should be based entirely on the question asked in the title of the album itself.  Are you still down?  There have been a lot of albums released after Tupac's death, and beginning with \\"R U Still Down\\" it is easy to tell that quality, original 2Pac material is becoming hard to come by.  Tupac was immensely paranoid about his own death, and was absolutely convinced he was destined to die an early, tragic death.  Because of the paranoia, he recorded as many songs as he could.  It is amazing there have been so many cds released after his death, but it is easy to tell that Sug and Death Row are running out of quality material. <br /> <br />With that said, I still think this is a great album.  \\"R U Still Down\\" is very catchy, \\"Hellrazr\\" is an incredibly powerful narrative, and of course there is \\"I Wonder if Heaven Got a Ghetto,\\" which I think is one of the best songs 2Pac ever created.  The first cd is great, and shows Pac at some of his best.  But, the second cd is not nearly as good, and really starts to drag at the later half.  You know it is bad when they have to double up songs too (\\"I Wonder if Heave Got a Ghetto\\" reappears on the second CD and is a so-so remix at best).   <br /> <br />Overall, you just have to ask yourself \\"Am I still down?\\"  If you can't get enough 2Pac, go right ahead and buy this album, you'll likely not be disappointed.  However, if you are starting to lose interest, this CD may not be worth the money, especially since the second CD is only mediocre.  And finally, if you are new to Tupac, \\"Me Against the World,\\" \\"All Eyez on Me,\\" and his \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD are better starting points.
B000E41MRC|5.0|Triumph of the Will is overwhelmingly powerful in its portrayal of nationalist unity unlike any I have ever known. Riefenstahl's use of neon lighting as an introduction for each major party official is almost subliminal, and by such technique is one pushed into watching attentively as something critically important is about to occur. Her stylized direction resembles so many maneuvers common in modern films today (which I regrettably take for granted), and I suddenly begin to understand why so many movies about militaristic empowerment/unity are accordingly so effective--they are based not only on documented propaganda, but propaganda of a political faction that was extraordinarily successful when skimming through the annals of history. One really ought to step outside themselves when watching Triumph--to really focus on this document's power to not only characteristically show why the Nazi party was so appealing (because of Goebbel's seductive use of suggestion in all forms of propaganda, including this film which he realized quite entirely), but to transform the minds of clean-slated Germans viewing this film in theatres at that historical moment. Such an event in history cannot (and assuredly will not ever) be forgotten. It is breathtaking to see how people can be so easily manipulated into thinking something so flawed is ultimately perfection materialized. This just may be our only effective link to such a heinous (and equally awe-inspiring) time in human history. I have looked forward to seeing this film for about six months now, and when I finally witnessed its unfolding, I came to understand why it has ignited so much debate and scholarly discourse. If you appreciate film and its influence upon the mind (which is so easily swayed), then you must see Triumph of the Will--a friend of mine (who happens to be a film student) broached the topic of this movie not two weeks ago with me, and he explained just how crucial it was in his own area of study. In fact, I would recommend buying it as an elemental part of your movie collection. Everyone deserves history in their lives, and this is a form of history in its most intended form (from the Nazi perspective). Irrespective of Riefenstahl's personal stances on life and politics, she was a mastermind as a filmmaker, and definitively worthy of my praise as someone who appreciates art, and powerfully emotional art at that.
0743454537|3.0|A story of love and companionship- Jodi Picoults's \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is a must read for anyone who has a close relationship with a sibling. It is the story of a young teen named Anna, a girl that is closely tied to her cancer-ridden sister, who is faced with a life or death court trial involving the fate of their family. It is a story that tests the bonds of a family while a young girl is on a search for her own personal identity. The author does an amazing job raising ethical and moral as well as personal questions in the novel to entice the reader as well as spark much debate. <br />I really enjoyed the author's way of portraying character development by having each chapter divided into interior monologues that provided insight into what each character was thinking/feeling. This helped to make the book a cover-to-cover read, one impossible to put down, because the reader wanted to discover more of what the characters were feeling. However, the end of this book will throw you for a loop and leave you screaming, \\"WHY!!\\" The ending is a desperate attempt by the author to abandon an amazing story, not giving justice to the novel. So, my advice would be to enjoy the story of family, love, and happiness while it lasts, because the end will leave you thirsting for more!!

B00005RYKV|3.0|Its hard to put a finger on exactly what went wrong with \\"Brother.\\"  Takeshi Kitano is an immensely talented film director and actor, but i suppose even he has to miss the mark sometimes.<br /><br />The story has potential.  An exiled yakuza goes to his half-brother in Los Angeles after finding himself on the wrong side of a gang war in Japan.  There, he does what he knows best and begins forging a rag-tag collection of petty thugs and drug dealers into a professional gang, finally feeling big enough to challenge the Italian Mafia for control of the area.<br /><br />However, in going to the US Takeshi left his area of expertise, and it shows.  I once read an interview with him, regarding his American debut in \\"Johnny Mnemonic,\\" where he said that the American director didn't really understand what a yakuza was.  Unfortunately, the same thing is true here.  Takeshi doesn't really understand the Los Angeles gangs, and the whole thing seems fake.  What works in Japan doesn't necessarily work in the US, and Takeshi doesn't explore these differences.  He just has everyone instantly fall in line with the Japanese Way.  He also has trouble directing the English speaking actors, and their dialog falls flat.<br /><br />There are some good bits here.  Takeshi's character, Yamamoto, is an interesting figure, quite and soft-spoken but every bit a hard-core villain.  His first entry into the US, not understanding the English and customs around him, is a fascinating study of cultural isolation.  Another favorite scene is when he has a gang members pinkie cut off when he fails, although no one else around him understands why.  They don't get the yakuza expression of penance.<br /><br />This was meant to be Takeshi's transition film for US audiences, and he hoped that the Los Angeles setting would provide a familiar door for viewers.  He also mines freely from some of his older flicks, especially \\"Sonatine\\" which has a similar theme of a gangster in exile.  Plenty of yakuza and \\"Japanese\\" stereotypes and pitched in for the Americans as well, things that would never normally appear in a Takeshi flick.  Trying to bridge both worlds meant that he ultimately failed to do either. The Japanese world that he knows so well gets mixed into the unfamiliar American gangland, and both suffer.<br /><br />\\"Brother\\" is not a terrible film by any means.  He is still Takeshi Kitano, and even his worse flick is still worthwhile.  But it just doesn't achieve any of the greatness that we have come to expect.kuza and \\"Japanese\\" stereotypes and pitched in for the Americans as well, things that would never normally appear in a Takeshi flick.

0743454537|5.0|I have now read about 4 of Jodi Picoult's books.  You can see her style change a bit from the earlier books to the later ones however; one thing that doesn't change is that Jodi Picoult is a mastermind of storytelling.  The story takes through the points of view of each of the characters.  I, personally, really enjoy how Jodi Picoult weaves the story using this method of storytelling. <br /> <br />My Sister's Keeper has now become my favorite Picoult read.  I was intrigued from the first chapters as I found about out about how Anna, was genetically engineered to be a donor match for her sister, Kate who was diagnosed with a cancer at an early age.  The blood transfusion from the umbilical cord was to save Kate's life and was to be the one time that Anna helped her sister.  But as Kate's illness worsened Anna went underwent numerous procedures to `save' her sisters life. <br /> <br />Anna is now being asked to donate a kidney to once again `save' her sister's life.  However, this time - Anna has hired a lawyer to sue her parents for the right to make her own decisions.  The story weaves around Anna; Kate; the parents; Jesse, the older brother; Campbell, the self-absorbed lawyer; and Julia, the court-appointed guardian ad litem. <br />
B0001I55OC|1.0|I read the book by Michael Crichton and loved it.

Horrible script, laughable editing...it does no justice to the book whatsoever.<br /><br />Posting this will hopefully prevent further victims.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|While captivating during the opening scenes, Underworld Evolution falls short on the kind of dramatic plot and coherent character ideas that make the great movies. While the first Underworld movie began what promised to be an excellent saga following the bloodline of Alexander Covinus through his children both Lycan and Vampire, this second movie proves to be a major let down. <br />While the action scenes are violent and bloody (as would be expected), they are truly not the spectacular sights you would expect from immortal beings, who both in legend, and in current reading are vested with an awesome amount of power. Except for a single forest scene in which Selene utilizes the celeron power (supernatural speed) often attributed to vampires, and the demonstrations of superhuman strength, the movie fails to involve the abilities which vampires are universally agreed to have. The use of guns and knives, both of which are human inventions and capable of little by comparison to the natural abilities of vampires and lycanthropes (lycans for short), makes for an almost comical collection of battle scenes. Add to that the weakness of both Markus and William (the ancient descendants of both races who by all practical reasoning should be the most powerful beings on the planet) and you will find that what should be epic storytelling with epic battles has become an excuse for some worthless gun battles. <br />The end not only defeats any idea of climactic sequence, it literally leaves the watcher dumbfounded. After releasing his long imprisoned brother William, Markus faces off against Selene while Michael faces the freshly released beast of beasts. However, what should prove to be a tooth and nail struggle for Michael (after all, he is fighting the most powerful Lycan) ends up being as simple as the ever-present King Kong like jaw rip, killing William and enraging Markus. Speaking of whom also seems to have little power. Granted that Selene has diablerized Alexander Covinus,and now has his blood in her veins, but you would think that the ancient Markus would have been a more challenging enemy to defeat. However, in a matter of a few seconds, Selene dispatches Markus by fatally throwing him into the spinning blades of a downed helicopter. Truly an anti-climactic end for what throughout the movie promised to be the battle to end all battles. <br />To the director's credit though, it would be unfair if I did not mention a few things. The fact that the movie begins exactly where the previous movie ended was a very good decision, one that the world of sequels would do well to imitate. Also, the penchant for blue-tinted screen shots remained in this movie and keeps the sequel smoothly congruent with its predecessor. And finally, the filming techniques utilized from the way the shots capture some of the rugged forest scenes to the angles from which other scenes are shot give an interesting and sometimes breathtaking screen to the viewer. <br />All in all, while a descent action flick, this movie left me wondering why I anticipated it for so long.
B000002UTT|5.0|This was the first album I ever bought. I felt a bit naughty buying it cos my parents wouldn't let me listen to rock music. How things have changed. I even play myself now. Well anyway. I still own it and still think its an awesome album. Listen to Your Heart is still quite often heard on the radio here and now with its new dance remake. I bought it for The Look. I didn't really like the song when I first heard it. I thought it was a bit naughty but it really grew on me and I became a big fan and have been ever since. This album is like a greatest hits album. I like every song on it.  <br />The Look has that awesome guitar riff that gets you from the beginning that noone has been able to emulate and those awesome lyrics. Its hip from the beginning and you can never tyre of it.  <br />Dressed For Success - funky mixture of Per and Marie. Naughty and hip. Rebellious. Still sounds great.  <br />Sleeping Single - more of a blues souly jazzy number with its sax. mixed with a bit of funk.  <br />Paint - This is one of my favourite songs off the album - \\"I get a love shock electric from the touch of your hand, I'm getting lost in the rhythms of the modern man\\". Cool mixture of Per and Marie. Funky rock track.  <br />Dance Away - Unleashes Marie's powerful vocals and soul. Love this line \\"even the groove has got that bitter taste of a lie\\".  <br />Could have been a hit for Dirty Dancing.  <br />Cry - This song has really grown on me over the years. It is a really nice ballad. Up there with all the others. <br />Chances - This was single apparently to my surprise. Has a sweeping element to it. 80s guitar. funky. It gets me singing when I am listening. A surprise element.  <br />Dangerous - Well what can i say. Everyone wants a girl whose a little bit dangerous. Cool Chorus - hip. \\"I'm not attracted to go go, Viva tonight\\". Love that harmonica. Not played so much on the radio these days. Sometimes you hear it at retro nights.  <br />Half A Woman, Half A Shadow - funky, sing along track.  <br />View From A hill - Again a funky little number that gets you when you listen.  <br />I Could Never Give You Up - This was never on the cassette when I first bought it and I felt I was missing out on something and sure enough I was. This is a cool song with Per mainly at the helm. \\"I watch your rainbow rise\\" Nice imagery. \\"I'll carry your heart like a bridge\\" <br />Shadow of A Doubt - Another sweeping song with epic qualities. milking Marie's awesome voice.  <br />Listen to Your Heart - When you hear that trademark opening piano on the radio you know its coming. Your favourite band being played again. Awesome ballad always has been and always will. Epic and sweeping.  <br /> <br />It was great revisiting this album to review it. It brings back a lot of nostalgia from when I was about 12 and first bought it. And all the times that I have heard these songs since. Listening to it and trying to persuade my parents that it was good music and there was nothing bad about it. Getting hassled by my sister and brother for never growing out of Roxette. First Cut is the Deepest. This was the first band and has stuck with me ever since. I have every one of their albums and this still remains right up there with the best of them. I think a lot of Roxette fans would agree that they have taken a lot of flack for staying true to this band. People laugh when you say your favourite band is Roxette. Its always been a bit of a closet thing for me but at every opportunity I have tried to get others interested with some success. It has almost become a mission. An obsessed fan perhaps. But when you listen to these and their other albums you'll understand why! There is a bit for every part of you in Roxette. There is a Roxette song for everything. They have that dynamic duo mix of female and male that makes them appealing to every romantic. And have such versatility - funy, rocky, New Wave, dance, folk, country, soul, jazz, hip hop almost even, blues, metalish at times, 60s, 70s 80s 90s, they are an ecclectic mix of everything and that's what continues to make them interesting. Every song is different - not like toher artists where you buy one album and every song sounds the same on it. I think its the versatility of having a male and female artist who were both solo artists before. Happy listening.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000BB14YY|5.0|Kurosawa's adaptation of King Lear succeeds in every way, and does so brilliantly: the visuals, plot, and score have no equals either individually or taken as a whole. <br /> <br />Criterion has done an excellent job at reproducing the vibrant colors of the movie, which are essential.  The plot is based on King Lear, but where it diverges it is an improvement - the final scene has no parallel in King Lear, and is in my opinion the most moving. <br /> <br />Unforgetable.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|When popular philosopher Barry White shared these immortal words with America, he might easily have been working from the Roald Dahl playbook.  Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is an oddly moralistic tale about the hazards of excess, not just of sweets, but parental indulgence, competitiveness, and aggression.  The question is, why remake it?  Fortunately, there are many valid reasons.<br /><br />While Gene Wilder has given us many wonderful performances, his rendition was too drenched in saccharine musical theatre numbers to satisfy and now looks dated.  Tim Burton, by contrast, brings not only his reliably astonishing visual imagination to the party, but also a bittersweet sensibility perfectly in keeping with Dahl's perspective.  Lucky for us he also brings frequent co-conspirator Johnny Depp, and musical wiz Danny Elfman.  In addition to being one of our very best actors, Depp is most drawn to roles that offer interesting challenges.  His Willy Wonka, in addition to being a sartorial splendor, is part perpetual child, part mad scientist, part eccentric gazillionaire, and part absent-minded professor.  That he allows justice to work itself out in his presence is more a matter of absent-mindedness than malevolence.  Indeed, the faults of the children involved - and their parents - appear to provide their own lessons and punishments with little help from Willy.<br /><br />From black and gray cityscapes reminiscent of Batman to color so dazzling you might request a pair of Charlie's oversize sunglasses, this film gives your eyes a workout they will never forget - simply spectacular.  Special recognition must be given to Deep Roy who, through the miracle of digital technology, plays all of the innumerable Oompa Loompas.  With almost no lines he manages to improve every scene he's in, and the musical numbers, which draw from Busby Berkeley to Saturday Night Fever and all points in between, are simply fantastic.  (Elfman really came through on these, they have a hip, ironic sensibility thoroughly lacking in the Wilder version.)<br /><br />That Helena Bonham Carter was willing to lend her name to the project when she has little to do but chop cabbage tells you a great deal about the quality level.  Finally, Charlie Bucket, played winningly by Freddie Highmore, is every bit as ingratiating and unassuming as we would like him to be, he deserves his good fortune.  (After seeing the headgear Willy had to wear as a child, you will agree that he deserves a break too.)  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have done it again, a wonderful movie worth owning and watching many times.ty thoroughly lacking in the Wilder version.)

B000EHRVP6|1.0|Seen this movie a while back and it was extremely wretched and futile. Quentin what are you doing? I can name a couple of straight-to-DVD horror films that were better than this. Don't AGREE WITH ANY OTHER REVIEW EXCEPT FOR THE ONE STAR REVIEWS! <br /> <br />OH WAIT, I WAS GOING TO MAKE A TITLE FOR SPOILERS BUT THIS MOVIE ISN'T WORTH WATCHING AT ALL SO... <br />   <br />THERE IS ONLY ABOUT TEN-ELEVEN,ETC. MINUTES OF TORTURE SCENES. <br />I CANT BELIEVE THE PREVIEW MADE IT LOOK LIKE THERE WAS AN ARRAY OF TORTURE THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE!!! <br />THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO SCARY PARTS IN THIS MOVIE AT ALL!! <br />A WOMAN GETS AMPUTATED AND.. WELL YOU HAVE TO SEE.  <br />THE SAME WOMAN JUMPS IN FRONT OF A TRAIN BECAUSE HER FACED WAS MESSED UP. WHAT IS THAT?  <br />MOVIE DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT THE END!!! <br />WHAT IS WITH THE KIDS? VERY DEFICIENT! <br /> <br />IN CONCLUSION, I WAS NEVER DISAPPOINTED TOWARDS ANY OTHER HORROR OR ANY OTHER MOVIE IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF GENRE EXCEPT FOR THIS!!!

B000F0UV0E|5.0|Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris are two musicians who've traveled many a mile, and most of the songs on \\"All the Roadrunning\\" are explicitly or indirectly about the journey. The artists sound as comfortable together as if they'd been married all that time; the gravel in Knopfler's voice occasionally brings Johnny Cash to mind for this listener, though with none of the anger and pain, while Harris, freed from having to carry an album solely on the strength of her presently somewhat diminished vocal resources, sounds altogether in her element. The songs mix country and rock flavors in agreeable though never too frenetic fashion; some may find this entire set too laid back, but I found the gentle nostalgia of \\"Beachcombing,\\" \\"Rolling On\\" and the title tune to be balm for the soul. \\"I'm still your man for the roaming/for as long as there's roaming allowed,\\" Knopfler sings, and one hopes for the sake of music that these two have a lot of roaming left in them.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|I am a longtime fan of AFI. I own every released album from Answer That and Stay Fashionable to the new, and much less desirable, decemberunderground.  I understand that from every cd to the next, AFI has a tendency to completely change their sound.  There was one huge difference between all of their changed sounds to this new Sing the Sorrow to decemberunderground.  They finally changed for the worse. <br /> <br />No, I do not think AFI has \\"sold out\\".  They have just changed.  I don't know what triggered this terrible change, but I don't think it was a bad attempt to become popular. I have more faith in AFI then that.  But honestly, as soon as I heard their first single, Miss Murder, I was scared.  It was the first song by AFI that i have not liked at all.  It sounded like an extremely bad combination of Green Day and My Chemical Romance.  I later noticed that they had posted another song upon their myspace website, Kill Caustic.  This song would not have been half as bad as Miss Murder, if it were not for the screaming.  I can understand a small amount of screaming to show intensity, but this is really overdoing it.  <br /> <br />Though I had these worries, I purchased the cd, thinking that they must have at least one good sounding song on the entire cd.  Boy, was I wrong.  If you have the american version of Sing the Sorrow, you know after ...But Home is Nowhere until you hear the hidden track This Time Imperfect? The weird little piano sounds?  Well yes, they do sound pretty cool, but AFI seems to REALLY like those types of sounds, and they are ALL OVER this new album. <br /> <br />In addition to all of this utter garbage on this cd, AFI has adapted a new theme in their lyrics: suicide.  Okay, I can understand one, maybe two songs about suicide on a CD, but nearly every track on this entire CD has something to do with suicide, and if not with suicide, death.  On their old albums, you hear poetic beautiful lyrics, now you hear lyrics that make you want to cry and cut yourself in a corner. <br /> <br />AFI fan or not, nobody should buy this album. It can only be described with one simple word: bad. Sorry to be mean Davey, but try to focus less on your make-up and more on your music.
0553213105|4.0|If you can help it, read this book before seeing any of the visual versions of the story. I couldn't help but put the visuals from the BBC mini-series version of the story everywhere. (which I still think is better than the new movie).<br /><br />As I dont commonly read this era's type wording, it took me a good few chapters before I quit stumbling over terminology and sentence structure.<br /><br />Of course, it's a love story to shame all others...and so it gets 4 stars!

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Having been a fan of the graphic novel for many years I was interested to see how exactly the Wachowski's intended to translate Moore's early 90's view of the future into a believable concept for the twentieth century. Despite what most of the purists may say, Moores original view of totalitarian britain has aged somewhat, and an exacttranslation of the graphic novel onto the silver screen would have been far too esoteric and inaccessable for those who had not been previously introduced to the material. What we have here the is an adaptation of the original concept of the novel, with some of the plot points rearranged and characters redrawn, in order to fit a movie format, and to better explore the intricacies of this fascist police state. Whereas moore portrayed a world where the government is in complete control, both of the nation and the hearts and minds of the citizenry, the Wachowski's have altered this somewhat. What we have now is a government that controls through deception and spin, by creating fear in the populace and presenting Anglo-christian based national socialism as the cure for all ills. This is in contrast to moores vision where the government rules by intimidation and violence, the citizens of britain are brow beaten dogs utterly submissive and incapable of thought, in this movie the populace have simply been kept in the dark and are awaiting someone to turn the light on. Enter V.  <br /> <br />What makes this film such a triumph is it's assertion that no matter how entrencehd a governments control becomes, there are always going to be people who question them always people who look at the world and sense something is wrong. People know when they're being lied to, know when spin becomes outright lies and are perfectly capable of standing for their own rights. Of course V's attacks act as the catalyst for this process ut the ultimate act of herosim is performed by the public.  <br />Yes there are better action films, yes there are better films that question the world we live in, but very few do both with such style and grace. This time the wachowski's managed to of their message without recourse to big black coats and rage against the machine music. Rebellion isn't just for angry teenagers- it must be for everyone.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|This was an awesome movie but the only real bad thing i have to say about it is that it dragged on for way too long but that is not to take anything away from the film itself.  <br />I'm not sure of the characters names so bear with me as i try and explain the plot. Naomi Watts who plays an actress desperate to make it big and she comes across a director (played by Jack Black) who is determined to hit the big time but in an unorthodox way. He wants to make a trip to an uncharted island where there are myths of dinosaurs and other undescovered creatures little do they know they are about to come across the biggest myth of all.  <br />The crew that go to the island during the film come across King Kong and basically the relationship between Kong and Naomi Watts character is a connection of loneliness. Kong is lonely because well he's just a giant ape and Watt's character is lonely because she is an actress.  <br /> <br />Enough of that before i give the movie away but this is packed with amazing action and as you have probably already seen amazing special effects. The actions and facial expressions of kong are very much like that of a real silverback gorilla.  <br /> <br />Top movie and i highly recommend.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Crank your iPod buds and blast your stereos, while you allow yourself to be swept away into the masterfully constructed farscape of Decemberunderground. The \\"purests\\" ache for the days of the Garage punk and true hardcore. The Art of Drowning and Black Sails in The Sunset are proclaimed the benchmarks of AFI's goth-core music, however for the umpteenth time 15 albums containing the same content is not called staying true to your roots, it is stagnation. AFI took one brave step forward with Sing The Sorrow and now have taken a leap, no, journey, into Decemberunderground. Musically, nothing about this album consistently resembles any previous work. The instrumentation is typicically impeccable and the vocals are equally as stunning, however in a different way than any other previous AFI work. The evolution of AFI has turned up a raw and emotional catalog of darkness. Those who claim AFI is commiting the unforgivable act of selling out must first read the lyrics that provide a stable contrast to the new sound. \\"if you keep killing me how can i keep absolving\\" is not much different from \\"my life is a big dark room\\", other than the fact that Decemberunderground is much more profound and metaphorically inclined to previous albums. The subject matter is the same, but just displayed in a far more mature way. The songs that resemble \\"old\\" AFI are Kill Caustic and Affliction, the latter which proclaims \\"Spend some time, Walking the Line\\". Every fan should harken to that statement and take a chance with this veritable goldmine of brilliance, who knows you may actually find yourself with a one-way ticket to Decemberunderground with no hopes, or desires, of returning.

0060194995|5.0|It was in 11th grade that I ran into this book in the school library and even back then I fell in love with it. But it was a week ago (4 years later), when I finished reading it for the second time, that I fully appreciated its brilliance. <br /> To my great joy, the author, Harper Lee is alive! In fact, she celebrated her 80th anniversary in April. So, besides planning to write to her to express my gratitude for her masterpiece, I intend to make her a belated birthday present. Now if I help you feel an urge to read To Kill a Mockingbird, moreover, if you really get round to reading it, I believe she'd be glad to have this present from you. <br /> Let me begin by mentioning that Harper Lee is said to consider her book as a simple love story. I don't know if she was serious really. If she wasn't joking, then what she meant by a love story was something quite different from the dictionary definition, because To Kill a Mockingbird is far from being a story about a romantic relationship. However, if we define a love story as a story about pure love and care for each other, a story about deep affection for our family, about concern for those we believe deserve our respect and trust, then it is the most touching and moving love story I have ever read. <br /> The plot covers just a few years, which, however, seem like a long time because during that time the two protagonists - Scout and her elder brother Jem - learn their crucial lessons about life. In this sense, the book could rightfully be defined as a bildungsroman. The story is told by Scout who looks back on her childhood with greater understanding than when she was little. In fact, judging by the way she relates those days, back then she only relied on her intuition to grasp what was happening and what she was being told. Actually, this was exactly what helped her see things more clearly. As a Mr. Raymond told her and her friend Dill one day, `...you are children and you can understand it.'  <br /> To cite Mr. Raymond again, the book is about \\"the simple hell people give other people - without even thinking...the hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think they're people, too.\\" But it is not just a story about racial segregation and severe discrimination. Scout tells us about the way her father and the cook Calpurnia bring them up. Thus, To Kill a Mockingbird could also be considered a handbook for raising a child. I myself reckon that it has already influenced the way I would treat a child of mine. And this is another reason why I am grateful to Harper Lee. The approach of Atticus (the children's father) to Scout and Jem is definitely one to be admired. Every other thing he says or does is worth quoting as an example to follow. One of the very first lessons he teaches Scout is one of empathy:  <br /> \\"First of all,' he said, \\"if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - \\" <br /> \\"Sir?\\" <br /> \\" - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\\" <br /> Ironically, this very first lesson plays a major role in her understanding of matters, events and controversy that would otherwise be above her comprehension. Ironically, I say, because very few people in the small town in Alabama where she lives were taught that same lesson. <br />        Despite all the bitterness in it, To Kill a Mockingbird is also a fun read, sometimes even hilarious. What mainly contributes to this effect is Scout's perspective of her family, the townsfolk, and everything she witnesses. Were these accounts not a child's ones, they would often sound as sarcastic remarks...for Scout's forthrightness. <br />        To conclude, I regard this novel as an unquestionable masterpiece. To be honest, I cannot wait to read it again. What is peculiar about it is the fact that as much as the plot involves the reader, and as poignant as the climax is, I don't think there is a real climax. The suspense and the emotional intensity built up from the very first page don't really leave us after the alleged climax, but even grow stronger. And what resonates with us is that \\"it is a sin to kill a mockingbird\\".

B000002JSJ|5.0|This album is as close as you can get to a 'Live' studio album. They had wrote, rehearsed & arranged  in LA. Then went to Switzerland (as they were avoiding heavy taxes in the UK) and Jimmy Page asked Keith Richards & Mick Jagger if they could have an extra 3 days to record their music. Keith & mick would later record 'Some Girls' in the exact same studio. When Jimmy Page was done he asked Keith & Mick what they thought... <br />\\"oh you needed an extra 3 days to do this song?\\" <br />\\"No\\" said Jimmy. <br />\\"We did the WHOLE Album\\" <br />They were both stunned, as it normally took  weeks to produce just ONE song. <br />The Album 'Presence' is EPIC. <br />On a scale of 1 to 10 a definite 8. <br />-Domo J.

I just couldn't stand (or rather I despised) the main character in Shopaholic. Well, to my pleasure, Undomestic Goddess has a likeable, human, real female character that isn't a total idiot. The sense of humor and asides keep things going. Story is pleasant with a little love, drama, and pseudomystery. Great summer read...take it to the beach or on the plane!

0060872675|5.0|I'm puzzled by the people who don't think this makes a good book for actual children. They'll have to take that up with my 14-month-old, who demands (\\"Cow!

Of course I'm not sure how much she actually understands, but the text and style are highly engaging. <br /> <br />The adults in our family haven't yet read _Thud,_ and this book seems to work just fine for us without it. I'm not sure I would feel that I needed to own this if I didn't have a little kid - once through it would probably be enough for me - but it's a great book for our family.
B00005ASGG|4.0|The movie is an idealistic and bittersweet allegory for culture in transition and what a modern society should represent. <br />The Old west is characterized by rugged individualism where power is in the gun. Big business (Cattle Barons) and violent criminals (Lee Marvin) are linked as the bad guys; small business and the common man are victims; and powerful, honest men stand on the sidelines only intervening when in their own self-interest. This is also a time when black men are called \\"boy\\" and women are told they should be uneducated, even by \\"good guy\\" John Wayne. <br />In transition, law and order attempts to come through peaceful confrontation, the press and democratic participation. Jimmy Stewart is the agent of change. He educates the masses, including women, preaches equality for all people, and power through the political process. He finds though, that in the period of transition, the gun is still necessary until his utopia is ushered in. <br />In the idealistic future envisioned in the movie, there is no room for men like John Wayne and Lee Marvin. As such both Lee Marvin and John Wayne's characters disappear and only Jimmy Stewart and Vivian Leigh continue on. The future is bright where women are educated, people are treated equal and big business is brought under the control of the political process and the Law. <br />In the finale, a very symbolic tribute is maded to the rugged west in the form of boots and spurs, cactus flowers and the absence of a gun belt.  <br />It is a bittersweet farewell to the old west.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Right after City of Evil released, a friend of mine (who is in love it seems with Avenged Sevenfold) told me of them and how great and original this band was. I definetly had my doubts at first, but I can promise you those doubts definetly went away with the first few listens of this CD. The guitar work is unbelievable and absolutely crazy and sometimes it feels like there is a solo going on in the background throughout the whole song. The rhythm guitar is even more tight from Waking The Fallen, and the bass shines through more on this record than others.  The Rev's drumming is definetly insane as well, the most technical and precise drumming I have heard since Joey Jordisons.  Now, onto the singing. After listening to the first few minutes of City of Evil you will realize that there is no more screaming vocals and it is just straight up clean vocals. This caught me off guard at first, since I had heard and loved Waking the Fallen before this CD. But, it has grown on me and I really love Shadows style and how passionate his voice seems sometimes. Here's a run through of the tracks: <br /> <br />1. Beast And The Harlot: 10/10- Great opener track. Absolutely love the lead guitar on this song, Syn does a great job here. I think the key change at the end of the song is a little unneccesary, but it still sounds good. <br /> <br />2. Burn It Down: 9/10- This song starts off great, with the awesome sounding dual guitars doing all sorts of crazy sweeping in the intro. True, M. Shadows voice on this track is a bit more nasaly than the others, but once you get used to his voice you won't complain too much. Plus I really love the part where Shadows is singing, \\"yeah! before I tear you down, you chose the wrong side, so right!\\"  <br /> <br />3. Blinded In Chains: 9/10- At first this was my least favorite song on the CD, but now I really love this one. Great song about politics. The little bass solo at the end is really great sounding and the rest of the song after that is really great to hear live. <br /> <br />4. Bat Country: 8/10- Ah, yes, the imfamous overplayed Bat Country. I think this is a good single, but yes definetly overplayed. Although I've stopped listening to the radio, so I still listen to this a lot. The solo on this song is unbelievable good, and the dual guitar thing right after the solo sounds really great.  <br /> <br />5. Trashed and Scattered: 9/10-Great in your face song. Makes me feel like I just wanna smack someone in the face. <br /> <br />6. Sieze The Day: 10/10- I believe this is going to be the final single off of City Of Evil. Beautiful ballad. Shadows' voice when he says, \\"so what if I never hold you, or kiss your lips again\\" is so epic sounding there. <br /> <br />7. Sidewinder: 10/10- Now it's getting on to the more experimental side of the CD. This song is really a good one, especially the acoustic flamenco style stuff at the end. <br /> <br />8. The Wicked End: 10/10- Most epic song on the CD, obviously because of the boys choir in the middle of the song. But we cant forget the solo before that section. Definetly one of the best off the CD.  <br /> <br />9. Strength of the World: 8/10- Starts off sounding like a Spaghetti Western, then quickly goes into standard A7X sound. The reason I gave this song an 8 is because it seems to drag on for a little too long. They should of cut atleast about a minute off of this song, clocking in at about 9:14. Although the solo is great on this song as well. <br /> <br />10. Betrayed: 9/10- Song about Dimebag of the legendary Pantera. I really like the lyrics on this song. It seems to show the perspective of three different people, one from Dimebag's, one from the killers, and one from an outsiders. Crazy sounding. <br /> <br />11. M.I.A.: 10/10- The final song and my personal favorite. Shows off really what Avenged does best, great guitars, powerful vocals and lyrics, tight drumming, everything is fantastic. Very sad song about war. The ending of this song is very sad sounding and the best way to end the CD.
B000EHSVS2|1.0|Yet another re-issue and shaft job by the movie industry making DVD's, and releasing them with a few more extras one to six or seven years later. Give these crap re-issues one star, not based off the movie, but the shaft job done to loyal DVD customers. If you must buy this release, ALWAYS BUY USED. That way the vultures who play unfair won't make a profit off you. Then sell your old release, which will hopefully deter more people from buying the newer version, with a cheap old version on the market, and will hit these scumbags where it hurts the most... bottom profit line. Voice your anger, ALWAYS BUY USED IF YOU MUST BUY AT ALL, and tell them you're sick of this re-issue anniversary edition crap.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I accidentally tuned into the first episode of Everwood in 2002 and was immediately intrigued. It is not often that a show invites you to journey along as a successful man considers that the direction he is going was all wrong. As Andy uproots his family, leaves his successful neurosurgery practice in NY and heads out for Everwood Colorado, a place his recently deceased wife said that she had wished to live sometime, he slows down and realizes how much he has missed being there for his family. This is, of course, is met with mixed reviews especially by his teenaged son Ephraim. In the spirit of the move, he grows a beard and opens a free, general practice clinic much to the consternation of Everwood's only other doctor. There are tough issues this show tackles such as grief and loss during this first season that will keep you glued to your set. You will laugh, you will cry and you will come to love all the people of Everwood, Colorado.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|If you like what's being played on most Radio stations these day's do not buy this album...it Really Rocks you wouldn't like it! <br /> <br />I am so happy to hear something other than the weak dribble that is called music today...these guy's did a great job creating their sound...as evident by the comparison to such bands as Zep, Deep Purple and Sabbath. I personally do not hear the Sabbath in it but it still rocks all the same...I hear more Foghat than anything else, but music is an opinion and this is mine...Keep it up guy's!!!!
B000F3TBIO|5.0|Mike Patton is probably one of the few musicians that can create REAL pop music. He twist it and the product always is a master piece. I hope we'll see more of this \\"user-friendly\\" Patton in the future... sometimes i think one Mike Patton isn't enough to cover our needs, don't you??
B000EULJLU|5.0|First of all I just bought this cd.  I popped it in a few times and was totally blown away.  I am writing this review to counteract all of the idiots who listened to it once and wrote their opinion.  No its not the next Aenima, nothing ever will be, get over it!!  It deserves nothing less than 5 stars.  Can they write a bad album? Hell no.  Technically this cd should not recieve a proper review intill like 2008.  There is just so much to take in.  They are really going down a path of progressivness on this one, and at times yes the songs are really slow and trippy.   <br /> <br />OK, I do agree that this is the first Tool cd that didd'nt become better than the last one (well ask me that in 2008).  I still enjoy it very much.  The heavy songs are.. well heavy, they sound amazing, technical, mathmatical, mind bending, EPIC and are everything you'd expect from vintage Tool 1,2,5,8,10 (I can really hear the Meshuggah influence!!).  Yes some of the songs are filler namely 6,7,11.  Some of the really slow trippy prog tracks I would still consider actual songs example 3,9.  With the exception of 4 which is slower but really good.   <br /> <br />What is everyones problem?  This album is a complete whole, a painting with many different strokes.  When it all comes together it is a freaking masterpiece.  Obviously some of the \\"kids\\" in the ipod era out there, dont have the attention span to digest this.  Whatever, I will never listen to anyone's opinions on one of my favorite bands untill I listen a good 20 times.  Times have changed and my tastes have changed, (I bought Old Man's Child \\"Vermin\\" the same day as this) but to me no matter how big they get, how many records they sell, how hard they get ripped on etc., they will always be the underground band that I discovered and have loved since '93, and no one can take that away from me.  A must have for true Tool fans.
0312995423|3.0|I'm Japanese and I've found several mistakes about Japanese. <br />It's not MENBOKO- It's MENBOKU  to mean \\"face and honor\\" as written in the last part second time. <br />It's not SHICHIGOSAN- It's SHICHIFUKUJIN. Shichigosan (meaning 7,5 and 3) is a ritual to celebrate children's health! Shichifukujin IS a group of seven god of goddess. <br />Ensei Tankado is not likely Japanese name. I'm wodering how a translator can translate this name to Japanese Kanji or Chinese character.  <br /> <br />I know I'm not supposed to write about THE password here - but I want to tell this! <br />The \\"difference\\" of THE two things for the most of the Japanese must be about its dates. <br />And it's exactly same with the password. I wonder why Dan Brown hadn't thought about this! <br /> <br />Honestly I'm not happy about Dan Brown's mistakes and misunderstandings.
B000FILW86|2.0|first off a note to some reviewers : a band will always say their most recent release is their best/ favorite. just like a band will say \\"this tour is going to be our best\\" .  <br /> well , this is only ct's 3rd release in the last 11 years and , to me , is very disappointing. their isnt one stand out song on here. after the last 2 releases ,ct played it too safe with this one, most songs are so boring, i cant imagine having to listen to them live to hear the good ct.  <br />if you are a casual ct listener or have just recently started listening to them with their last 2 releases and enjoyed those ; ct 97 and special one, just skip this. if you listen from start to finish it sounds like one loooooong song. there are a couple of stronger songs ;  <br />if it takes a lifetime <br />come on come on <br />o claire <br />this time you got it <br />and one more, which is very fun, it reminded me of something off of special one. <br /> i like when ct is all over the place and a little more aggresive and harder edged. they can be so good at times when they take chances. instead of playing it safe like rockford.  <br />ct97 was one of their best releases and it was the one with the most \\"great songs\\" out of all their releases, IMO . great , more talented songs, not so bubble gum sounding as some of their material can be. and \\"special one\\" was all over the place with the songs \\" best friend \\" , and \\" pop drone \\" standing up to any of their best songs  in their whole career, IMO . \\"special one\\" had fun , goofy songs like \\"hummer\\" and \\"if i could \\", as well as good ballads like\\" too much\\". <br />rockford takes no chances, theres nothing edgy or interesting about it. most of the first 20 reviews came from diehard fans that just came over from ct's website forums. oh well ,  i'll just have to wait for their next release which could be awhile as ct seems to be taking to touring  to make more money , as opposed to making records. <br />
B000FFJ85I|4.0|Okay, I don't normally make it a point to buy a lot of rock cds.  Check out my other reviews and very few of them are for rock cds.  This is because I have different standards for hip hop and R&B cds compared to rock cds.  I mean, for me to buy a rock cd, the cd really must have something good to it, and believe me, Decemberunderground has that something good.  From the wonderful, tense Prelude 12/21 to the hit single Miss Murder to the final amazing track, Endlessly, She Said, this cd is tense, fun, and beautiful all at the same time.  Davey Havoc writes some great lyrics and he sings them awesomely as well.  The band does great, as normal, and they make things even better for Davey.  This cd is an excellent cd and I have a feeling that I will be listening to it for a long time to come.  Be warned, however, that this is lighter than their previous efforts, but still just as good.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|I really enjoyed the first \\"Underworld\\", so much that I bought the DVD (I don't purchase too many movies).  I read lots of vampire books as it is one of my favorite genres.  But I waited until the DVD came out to watch this film (I gave up going to the theaters years ago).  I was ferklemped after seeing this film.  The great story line that was established in the first film just didn't flow in this installment.  At almost the end of the film, I realized Scott Speedman hadn't really talked that much in the film.  There is way lots of action and fights.  I am all for fights but the fights seemed to be fruitless. When the vamps and lycans fight each other, they still hang in there.  Bullet and spear chucking doesn't always kill these guys off.  I was let down that more story or alliances were accomplished.  I hope that if a 3rd installment is made it goes back to the storyline.
B000FILW86|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD. This is not only another great Cheap Trick CD, it's one of their best period. I can't believe that after all this time these guys can still keep me interested in them. One track after another they sound as catchy now as they did 20+ years ago. Their last couple of records were nothing to get overly excited about, but this one blows me away. Cheap Trick has always has been heavily influenced by the Beatles and you can certainly here it in Oh Clair. The Linda Perry (Four Non Blondes) Tune is one of the most memorable tunes on the CD. Dream the Night Away sounds like early Def Leppard you gotta love it. This CD it like a trip back in time for any CT fan.
0802130208|5.0|I first received this book as a Christmas gift nearly 15 years ago and loved it...I could not put it down and frequently found that laughing out loud while reading in public didn't matter to me one bit.<br /><br />I've just bought and gifted this comic romp for the 11th time and no one has told me that it was anything but fun.<br /><br />Sure Ignatius is unloveable...that's the point.<br /><br />I read this book as the comedy it is.  I wasn't looking for War and Peace or Jane Eyre and I enjoyed it to the last page.  Of course I loved Moby Dick and still think THAT was just a story about a white whale and the men who hunted it.<br /><br />Reggie
0312995423|1.0|This is the only Dan Brown book I've ever read.  Actually, I only read half of this one.  The story telling is so bad and the characters so wooden, I have no desire to read his other books, including \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"  I only got halfway through before the poor characterization, even poorer plot (with its coincidences too big for even really bad fiction), and just plain bad story telling forced me to put it aside.  Sorry.  I know Dan Brown has become a cultural icon, but he's not for me.
0375507256|5.0|Watch, in these two propositions from the book, as I give away everything, but give away nothing:    1) One model of time: an infinite matryoshka doll of painted moments, each present encased inside a nest of previous presents and presents yet to be;  2) Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, and though a cloud's shape, hue, and size, all change, it's still a cloud, and so is a soul.  Who can say who the soul will be tomorrow?  Only the wind and the atlas of clouds.    In these two comments lies the heart of Mitchell's third novel, a moving, sprawling adventure tale of desperation, hope, yearning, and dreams, matched against the root of all evil, which, in its illustration of the depths and heights of what human spirit can accomplish, makes the love of money, which so often seems ascendant, instead appear somehow almost trite and childish.    That Mitchell can cast such realistic, empathetic characters amid such a vivid, believable, and encompassing scope is his greatest strength as a writer.  No matter how seemingly incredible the challenges his characters face, always, because of the richness of his characterizations, those challenges seem within the scope of the possible, the real.    Cloud Atlas, in its structure, actually is far more similar to that of Ghostwritten than of Number9Dream, and, because of that, in Mitchell's threading of the twine of the spirit amid so many of his characters in each book, in my view he becomes the most successful writer of magic realism in English.    I realize I may not be making much sense here, but I'm not trying to place the book within a pantheon like some literary twit; I'm just trying to respond emotionally, rationally, and as articulately as possible to a great, involving, emotionally compelling and intimate book.  Whether it stands the test of time to illustrate just what kind of people we were at the beginning of the 21st century, well, I'll leave that to that matryoshka doll, but for now it's a great, rich, and humongously satisfying exposition of the complexities of humanity across the ages.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Bravo!  Nice evolution.  Bring forth change!  I have enjoyed listening to the progression this band has made and I have grown along with them.  With each release they push themselves further musically.  We should expect musical evolution from true musicians.   <br /> <br />The music and lyrics are moving and beautiful.  Please do not put it in a box with a label (MTV sellouts, emo, pop, mainstream, techno, etc.) just because it does not sound like the old AFI or because it sounds like so and so.  It is AFI and we hear all of AFI's musical influences incorporated in decemberunderground.  It is great music, listen and enjoy!
B0000508U6|3.0|Coldplay's debut album, while a fairly decent listen itself, was barely a glimpse of what the band would later prove to be capable of.  There are a handful of good tracks, like \\"Yellow\\", \\"Trouble\\", \\"Shiver\\", etc, but overall the album is rather plodding and monotonous.  The band's second album, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", was a huge step forward, with much stronger melodies/songwriting, and more diversity, and the third album, \\"X&Y\\", was another leap forward still.  Furthermore, the band put on an incredible performance on \\"Austin City Limits\\", proving once again that they just get better and better.<br /><br />For high quality melodic rock, I recommend either of the other two albums over this one, but this is still worth the purchase for sure.  Not bad, but it only gets better from here.
B000AP04FG|4.0|whoever did the casting what a web they help to weave with Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Vince Vaughn (AND I'M NOT SPEAKING BAD OF ANYONE)<br /><br />I didn't want to see this movie because of all the hype that was around it with the stars about whoever is dating or who broke up who, i want to see a movie because the actors did a good job. I took a chance and watch it and i must say it was pretty ok i didn't think it would be the whole cast had a great chemisrty and the action scenes were also great for me...

B000EWBNMS|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this set on DVD. So glad it is finally just about here. I find the concept of the psychic detective intriguing, and I know that there are people among us who communicate with the dead, because I have seen it for myself.  <br />But for me the thing that really sets this show apart is the relationship between the characters: this is maybe the most lifelike marriage I have ever seen on TV. The relationship between Joe and Allison is so lifelike that sometimes I feel like I am eavesdropping on real people. The daughters also do an uncanny job of bringing reality to their characters(particularly in the episode where the middle daughter wanted to wear a helmet everywhere, including her class picture!-I have a daughter like that myself!) I guess to sum it up, the writing comes from an amazingly true place, at least within the family relationships. I was so happy that Patricia Arquette won the Emmy for best actress; she doesn't appear to be acting at all. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
630512762X|5.0|A magnificent piece of entertainment. Good cast, great plotline, and true John Woo action. Travolta and Cage are perfect.

0224076051|4.0|String theory is crackpot because it doesn't do anything useful.  We don't say UFO's cranks are scientists because there is no connection with reality.  UFO's are not real until \\"falsified\\".  Science doesn't merely require that you predict fairies or that matter is made of strings.  Science requires evidence, of which there is not one shred in string theory.    What's exciting about extra dimensions and strings?  People are more likely to believe them than UFOs, because there is allegedly some evidence in equations.  What equations?  There is no mathematical model connecting anything stringy to anything observable that survives scientific inspection.  As 't Hooft says, \\"string theory\\" doesn't exist: it is as big a fraud as selling people a chair, minus arms, legs, seat and back.    Peter Woit is interested in finding a final theory that produces predictions, and the purpose of this book is to investigate mainstream ideas and some alternatives.  Lee Smolin comments that Not Even Wrong 'is a courageous and necessary book that should spark a debate about the future of theoretical physics', while Roger Penrose states: 'The hold that string theory has ... is very remarkable, considering the lack of any observational support ... Woit supplies the first thorough and detailed analysis...'    Woit acknowledges on page xi that most stringers are 'not likely to be very happy with this book.'    Chapter 1 begins with Winston Churchill's advice in war, the version I'm familiar with being simply: 'Never surrender!'  But should this advice apply to speculative mainstream ideas?    Woit discusses this in the context of stringy speculators.  They too will never surrender: too much depends on their speculations.  Surrender will mean loss of prestige, power, control of arXiv.org, journals, etc.    Chapter 2 briefly defines (in words) state-vectors and Hamiltonians and then gives a history of experimental particle physics.    Chapter 3 explains (in words and illustrations) quantum theory, symmetry groups, Lie algebra unitary group U(1), representation theory, Weyl's theory, symmetry unitary groups SU(2), special orthagonal group SO(3) and its relationship to SU(2) by rotations, particle spin, all in historical context.    Chapter 4 explains the history of quantum field theory from the inconsistency of Schroedinger's quantum mechanics with relativity, through Dirac's equation that solves the problem and predicts spin, antimatter and the electron's magnetic moment.  Woit briefly discusses renormalization, which is physically understood by the polarization of Dirac's sea of virtual charge created by the strong field around a real particle.  The polarized charge tends to shield out most of the charge as seen at large distances or in low energy collisions.  Renormalization is required because there must some kind of cutoff (reason unknown) that prevents the entire vacuum being polarized by a single real charge, but Woit does give the detailed history which makes at least the mathematical side of the problem crystal clear to the layman.    Chapter 5 is gauge symmetry and gauge theories.  Woit explains Weyl tried to unify gravity and electromagnetism by extending the general covariance of general relativity (general covariance is the property whereby covariant laws of nature don't depend on either the velocity or acceleration of the observer) into a new symmetry principle of gauge invariance, giving Maxwell's equations.  Einstein immediately found experimental objections to Weyl, so that closed down that speculation.  However Weyl later introduced the maths of spinor fields.  Woit introduces the Yang-Mills weak force isospin symmetry SU(2), noting that the name derives from isotopes (where the experimental data comes from).    Chapter 6 is the Standard Model.  This is what you're buying the book for.  Chapter 7 explains the successes of the Standard Model in experimental particle physics.  Chapter 8 lists the few outstanding problems of the Standard Model like gravity and, 'Why does the vacuum state break the electro-weak gauge symmetry?  If the origin of this really is a Higgs field, then at least two new parameters are needed ...  One [only] is determined by the observed properties of the electro-weak interactions ... This is why the Standard Model predicts the existence of a Higgs particle, but does not predict its mass.'    The first 101 pages, just described, are worth the price of the book.  Chapter 9 onwards sadly gets into the boring and useless stringy speculations: Kaluza-Klein 5 dimensional unification, supersymmetry, supergravity.  Sense is restored from page 120 with lattice gauge theory in quantum chromodynamics, which makes predictions that are tested.  Woit explains that Witten made the decisive breakthroughs which allowed calculations to be made using the current algebra model of pions.    Page 180 gives Feynman's published statement about superstring theory:    'nonsense ... not calculating anything ... maybe there's a way of wrapping up six of the dimensions.  Yes, that's possible mathematically, but why not seven? When they write down an equation, the EQUATION should decide how many of these things get wrapped up, not the desire to agree with experiment ... So the fact that it might disagree with experiment is very tenuous, it doesn't produce anything; it has to be excused most of the time.'    Feynman added: 'String theorists don't make predictions, they make excuses.'    The next hundred pages explains boring stringy pseudo science dominating the media with hype.  I pray for the day when it will be possible for Woit to bring out a new edition renamed 'Not Wrong!', with those last 100 pages replaced by a discussion of naturally checkable theory, hopefully something from Lee Smolin or someone.  Overall, this is the best book I've ever read.    Page 227 describes the some silly attacks on Woit by string theorists:    '... some superstring theorists have chosen to attack me personally [via the Not Even Wrong weblog comments section] ... One of the more excitable of such superstring theorists, a Harvard faculty member, [commented] that those who criticised the funding of superstring theory were terrorists who deserved to be eliminated by the United States military.'    Woit spent the years 1984-7 as a postdoc at Stony Brook, during which the 'first superstring revolution' took place (the one where either 10 or 26 dimensions seemed likely).  By 1987, superstring theory had closed down most of the opportunities for investigators interested in understanding the Standard Model in 4 dimensions.  Like Feynman, Woit considered it premature to introduce extra dimensions merely in order to address speculation about graviton and unification guesses.  If the introduction of extra dimensions was addressing an experimentally fact, then that would be science.  Similarly it would be science if a speculation have a checkable, definite prediction.    However, to invent a speculation about extra dimensions merely in order to justify other speculation about gravitons and unification of forces, without a checkable connection to reality, is not physics.

B000FFJ85I|5.0|i remember reading an interview where AFI stated that they were not going to try and make a more epic sounding album than Sing The Sorrow and any AFI fan knows that the days of VPOY and SYMAOYE are long gone, but i think the band did a phenomenal job in creating a more evolved and experimental style while still coming through with heart felt and thought provoking lyrical content. So i feel that they have done what they set out to do with this album. I had heard the album on The Leak and really enjoyed it alot more when i bought it was able to read along the CORRECT and complex lyrics contained in this disk.  <br /> <br />p.s. they are playing the MTV movie awards tomorrow night and i think it is fine because if anything having a band like AFI play the show will bring more integrity to MTV rather than taking any credibilty away from AFI.
0060922583|2.0|The Holographic Universe is at worst a major hoax or at best the writer is innocently using the National Enquirer as his source to back up the many outrageous claims. I am particularly stunned that the reviews below rate this book so highly, prooving the long held notion that people will believe anything they read.  <br /> <br />What started out as a solidly grounded scientific theory with support from the works of Einstein, Bohr, and other respected scientists gradually turns into a mystical, witch-craft, tarrot card training manual. The well documented placebo effect is exagerated to a point that no rational person could possibly accept.  <br /> <br />For example, the author brings an example of Jack Schwarz, \\"a Dutch-born author and lecturer, astounded researchers in laboratories across the United States with his ability to willfully control his body's internal biological processes. In studies conducted at the Menninger Foundation, the University of California's Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute, and others, Schawrz astonished doctors by sticking mammoth six-inch sailmaker's needles completely through his arms without bleeding, without flinching, and without producing beta brain waves.\\" I would normally dismuss such nonsense without firther thought, but because I believed that I was reading the work of a respected author I decided to investigate further. <br /> <br />So I called the Menninger Foundation. I spoke with the media relations person at the Foundation extensively about this case and she confirmed that no such research ever existed at the Menninger Foundation. If you are still skeptical, go ahead and call them yourself - (713)275-5000. <br /> <br />Next the author brings several examples of stigmata as though they are solid scientific evidence. Are you serious?! Somebody please pass me the Prozac! Stigmata is a well documented fraud that are just self-inflicted wounds by severely dillusional and psychotic individuals. Here, and I will quote \\"There are two main reason for believing that stigmata are usually self-inflicted, rather then psychosomatic. One, no stigmatic ever manifests these wounds from start to finish in the presence of others. Only when they are unwatched do they start to bleed. And two, Hume's rule in \\"Of Miracles\\" is that when an alleged miracle occurs we ask ourselves which would be more miraculous, the alleged miracle or that we are being hoaxed?\\" <br /> <br />Instead the author supports his evidence from testimony of devout Catholic priests and folowers, who lets just say are more then a little boased. Next, Mr. Talbot serves up nonsense like \\"During the last years of her life [St. Veronica Giuliani] became convinced that the images of the Passion - a crown of thorns, three nails, a cross, and a sword - had become emblazoned on her heart. She drew pictures of these and even noted where they were located. After she died an autopsy revealed that the symbols were indeed impressed on her heart exactly as she had depicted them. The two doctors who performed the autopsy signed sworn statements attesting to their findings\\". Wow, sworn statements? How about photographic evidence? Don't you think that if such a remarkable case had ever been documented that maybe it would appear on the front page of the New York Times? <br /> <br />The book continuous with more and more examples like this to make its case that the mind can cause physical manifestations in reality, however, as already noted with some examples above if the evidence presented is carefully investigated the whole case quickly falls appart like a giant house of cards. <br /> <br />And don't even let me get started on the little Mohotty who can put large hooks through his skin without any bleeding... I would advise Mr. Talbot, if he trully believes that such amazing mind feats are possible, to simply end his writing career and instead contact the James Randi Foundation which would pay him a hefty $1 million if he can demonstrate any of these events under scientific scrutiny.  <br /> <br />I would further conclude that Mr. Talbot must certainly knows how outrageous his claims are and that he is either taking advantage of the reader or insulting their intelligence.  The holographic model of the universe does have substance, but certainly there is no reason to continue reading the book after chapter 2. <br /> <br />I give the book 2 stars for its entertainment value.
0553801503|2.0|Ok, Author and Editors take heed!  At this point I can see this previously wonderful series descending into pointless oblivion, in that the books just keep getting fatter and more padded out, and any hope of any kind of ending just disappears.  Hmm, kind of like Robert Jordan's 50 bazillion page mega-epic. We have spent three wonderful books prior to this one getting attached to some fantastic characters, caring about what happens to them, and wanting to know how it all turns out.  So guess what, practically NONE of them are in this book.  We're left with the despicable Cersei, and little of bit of the only slightly better Jaime (his redeeming rapier wit is all but missing here, he's so busy feeling sorry for himself), and a bare smattering of Arya.  There is no one to get invested in here, even though there are plenty new POV characters. So here's the problem with this book. I don't care about any of them.  I don't want NEW characters, because all that's doing is padding out a great story into something that's just bloated and wallowing in pointless minutiae.  I want the characters that brought me back for Books 2 and 3. Dany, Tyrion, and the remaining Starks, et al. As far as I'm concerned, three-fourths of the material in this book should have been skipped entirely, and we wouldn't have missed a thing.

B000005Z0E|4.0|This dude's late material is gimmicky but this album is nice. <br /> <br />There were many great lyrics on this album that were witty and well structured my favorite line was the \\"Underground railroad on an incline\\" <br /> <br />Violent is probably my favorite song on here. <br />
B000002C1W|5.0|Yes, Roger Waters was a genius behind Pink Floyd and a driving force but David Gilmour was every bit as much the genius that Roger Waters was. He proved that by producing one of my favorite Pink Floyd albums personally and one of their strongest efforts. <br /> <br />1. \\"Signs Of Life\\" - One of the biggest things Pink Floyd lost with Roger Waters was a fantastic lyricist. However, as David Gilmour stressed after Waters left, the music has to be balanced with the lyrics and when things get too wordy, it becomes a problem. This was my major problem with The Final Cut personally. Here, Gilmour shows that you don't even need to write lyrics to produce good music. Though this is one of the weaker tracks on the album, it's still a great instrumental opening. <br /> <br />2. \\"Learning To Fly\\" - Fantastic. One of the single greatest songs ever written by Pink Floyd. There's a reason why this song still gets continuous radio play to this day and it's because it's a great song. Though the lyrics are strong, Gilmour's guitar speaks almost as loud as his words with fantastic riffs that fit the melody and mood of the song perfectly. <br /> <br />3. \\"The Dogs Of War\\" - A highly underrated song with very good lyrics. With the type of lyrics, it's very much a Waters-style track. This song is reminiscent of The Final Cut, however the band manages to balance the music with the lyrics far better. <br /> <br />4. \\"One Slip\\" - One of the weakest tracks on the album, that's not a bad thing because it has heavy competition. Though \\"One Slip\\" is more reminiscent of the trends in music of the 1980's, it still holds onto that distinct Pink Floyd sound and is a very catchy song/ <br /> <br />5. \\"On The Turning Away\\" - Some of the best lyrics ever written by David Gilmour, the music is just as good as well. This song is a very deep, powerful song ending in one of my favorite guitar solos of all time. <br /> <br />6. \\"Yet Another Movie/Round And Around\\" - Yet another movie, yet another great song. A very strong effort musically, the lyrics are also a strong point. The instrumental ending of \\"Round And Around\\" is also very well played. <br /> <br />7. \\"A New Machine (Part 1)\\" - Not a real song but the lyrics are very good. <br /> <br />8. \\"Terminal Frost\\" - One of the weakest tracks, this one is a nice instrumental but doesn't really go much of anywhere. <br /> <br />9. \\"A New Machine (Part 2)\\" - Again, not a real song but the lyrics are very good. <br /> <br />10. \\"Sorrow\\" - A fantastic closer to a great album. The lyrics are some of the best Gilmour ever wrote. The music is a fitting end to the album.
B000002UQJ|3.0|This album by Paul McCartney has been forgotten apparently .You cant even buy it in stores anymore. \\"Off The Ground\\", \\"Hope of Deliverance\\", \\"I Owe It All To You\\", \\"Peace In The Neighbourhood\\", \\"Winedark Open Sea\\" and \\"C'Mon People\\" are all EXCELLENT songs. The others are just mediocre filler songs. Not too good, not too bad. Its unfortuante more people are buying rap music than a lost gem like this from one of the greatest musicians to ever live. If your a BIG fan of Paul, you should have this CD. If your a casual fan dont buy this because you will be disappointed. For a casual listener get the 2001 release \\"Wingspan: Hits and History\\" which is a two disc \\"greatest hits\\" collection of Wings 1970's music. It has the hits from 1970 to about 1984's \\"No More Lonely Nights\\". It will really get you interested in Pauls music.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|I almost didn't get this one, because the first Underworld was just Ok for me.  I love a good Vampire film with well developed characters, and the first one left me wanting a little more.  The sequel filled in a lot of the gaps that the first one left wide open.    We learn the truth about Victor, Marcus, Selene, and the origins of Vampires and Lichens (or however you spell it).  We hear about Selene's family, and Marcus's brother.  And we learn why, no matter what happens or how many bodies are left laying around, they never make the news.  I wondered that in the second one...remember that train scene?  Anyway, this explains who does the clean up and why.    I gave this three stars not because I didn't like the movie, but because it was average for me.  I wanted to see Selene become more powerful from drinking Alexander's blood.  I wanted to see the lichen that was locked up for over half a millenia to have come to some kind of inner peace and be able to control his rage and become more human.  I wanted to see the ending battle scene be more.....just, more.  This movie had so much potential that it just did not live up to.....even the plot wasn't great.  I mean, the storyline didn't exactally keep me guessing, but it also didn't leave me bored.  The sex scene didn't completely turn me off - tho it tried.  If you're about 15, this movie will completely awe and amaze you.
0743487583|3.0|As I read the novel I thought always of how much better it could have been.  Mary Shelley wrote that she originally conceived \\"a few pages -- of a short tale\\" but that Percy urged her to develop the story at greater length (p. 283).  Mary should have stuck to her instincts.  The book is way too long; it would have been much better as a short story.<br /><br />Moreover, the entire tale of the monster is ludicrous.  We never learn anything about how the monster is created, but he certainly is a fast learner!  The monster runs away from Victor Frankenstein and hides for several months, living off the land.  From where he hides he observes a family's comings and goings.  While hidden, he somehow gains the equivalent of a university education, reading Paradise Lost, Plutarch's Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter (p. 151).  Then he flies into a murderous rage and demands that Victor create him a mate.  When the monster realizes that Victor is stalling in the girlfriend-production department, he turns his rage toward Victor, follows him across many lands, and carves long, threatening messages into trees and rocks (pp. 253-254).<br /><br />The silly monster story might have been easier to take if the novel had left open the possibility that the monster did not exist.  For most of the book, such a possibility is open.  The entire novel is a series of stories within stories.  Robert Walton, the Arctic explorer, writes letters to his sister.  The reader's vantage point is that of Robert's sister.  Victor tells Robert his story, which Robert passes on to his sister.  Victor hears the monster's story and passes it on to Robert, who passes it on to his sister; likewise, with letters Victor receives from his father and sister; and so on.  For almost the entire book, all that Robert knows about the monster is what he has heard from Victor.  The better ending to the novel would have been for the monster never to appear except in Victor's version of events.  In that way Robert, his sister, and consequently the reader would have been left with a choice about whether to believe Victor's kooky monster story or instead to believe that Victor either made it all up or is delusional.  Unfortunately, that choice is foreclosed when the monster makes an appearance on board Robert's ship at the end of the book (pp. 270-275).ently the reader would have been left with a choice about whether to believe Victor's kooky monster story or instead to believe that Victor either made it all up or is delusional.

1400079276|2.0|I tried to like this \\"insistently metaphysical mind-bender,\\" as _The New Yorker_ blurb puts it on the back cover, but by the last half of the book I was constantly cursing the fact that I chose to read this 467-page bildungsroman.  Murakami could've cut this by half and got the same thing across to us, whatever it is he is getting across.  I was also pulled in by the title, Kafka being one of my heroes.  Unlike Kafka, Murakami doesn't succeed in taking an ambling plot that seems to go nowhere and concomitantly help us dig down to the deeper level of things.<br /><br />This isn't even worthy of a lot of other stuff that gets passed off as literature these days.  This is metaphysics lite (with elementary Hegelian subject-object relations thrown in to no good end) with maddeningly inexplicable plot elements tossed off that add up to little more than bizarre Oedipal wish fulfillment, soft-porn, macabre anime-style violence and fantasy sequences.  In short, this is fantasy for older teen males that tries to pass itself off as literature.  A 19-year-old would get more metaphysical bang for his buck from Hesse, but then again he wouldn't get the prurient sex scenes and weird occurrences that take the plot nowhere.<br /><br />All of this I could maybe handle if the writing weren't so awful in spots.  There are two plots here, Kafka Tamura's bildungsroman (which generates the most interest of the two plots, but is still EXTREMELY hard to swallow in certain key spots, which I won't give away since they are the \\"surprise\\" elements of this novel) and Nakata's search for the \\"entrance stone.\\"  Nakata is an old man who can't spell, read, feel passion, remember anything and who is therefore very \\"simple,\\" as he says over and over.  He hooks up with Hoshino, your everyman who drives truck and who loves baseball.  You would expect dialogue between two simpletons to be wooden, but I think we can be spared almost a hundred pages of this dialogue.  On his \\"metaphysical\\" journey with Nakata, Hoshino learns the value of culture, specifically Beethoven.  Problem is, I don't care.  Here's a sampling of the kind of writing that abounds in _Kafka_:<br /><br />\\"Driving back to the apartment, Hoshino stopped at a bookstore and picked up maps of Takamatsu city and the Shikoku highway system.  He popped into a CD shop nearby to see if they had a copy of Beethoven's _Archduke_ Trio, but the little shop had only a small clasical section and one cheap, discount-bin version of the piece [. . .] but Hoshino went ahead and paid his eight dollars.<br /><br />\\"Back in the apartment, a soothing fragrance filled the place.  Nakata was bustling around the kitchen preparing some steamed daikon and deep-fried flat tofu.  'I had nothing to do, so I made a few dishes,' he explained.<br /><br />\\"'That's great,' Hoshino said.  'I've been eating out too much these days, and it'll be nice to have a home-cooked meal for a change.  Oh, hey--I got the car.  It's parked outside.  Do you need it right away?'<br /><br />\\"'No, tomorrow would be fine.  Nakata has to talk more with the stone today.'<br /><br />\\"'Good idea.  Talking things over is important [. . .].\\"<br /><br />And on and on and on.  I think Murakami could've done something with all this strangeness if he would've went for quality over quantity, but he chose to serve us dialogue that tells the plot rather than shows us something prescient, like so many pulp sci-fi novels.  It's mostly just weirdness for the sake of wonder, which can be great in the hands of a sensitive writer (read: the language has to provide the wonder, not gratuitous event-mongering).  The problem is that Murakami really gives us next to nothing to wonder about despite the great lengths he appears to take.h Nakata, Hoshino learns the value of culture, specifically Beethoven.

B000BOH8XW|5.0|Shakira - a girl from humble begins has proven to be a very talented artist.  She is not only a singer but a songwriter.  I have enjoyed her music beginning with her 1995 realise of her cd \\"Pies Descalzos\\".  She got my attention with her song \\"Estoy Aqui\\" - loved the lyrics and the beat.  Shakira has a VOICE on her, man does she. That is what I love about her - her voice - with or without music, her voice is just comes through, making chills run up your spin.  Shakira is a great example that women no matter our background can realize their dreams
B000FFJ85I|4.0|yea so they kinda went mainstream on this album. but so what.. theres those people that say \\" oh there on the radio now. so they suck\\".. sellout.? i disagree. Greenday is the best example of that. 180degree turn in there music. But AFI still has there sound. its just refined and more melodic in my opinion. i do however am not sure what they were thinkin with sing the sorrow. <br />and if something sound good in my head i am goin to listen to it.
0440237688|5.0|This book is a very intelligent and yet easy-to-understand read.  It vaguely reminds me of Orwell's 1984, since they are both about a terrifying future with extreme government control.  They veer away from each other, however, in that The Giver is hopeful and even in some ways joyful about the human condition, while Orwell is anything but.  In my opinion, The Giver tries to illustrate humankind's greatest strengths (love, forgiveness, compassion, empathy, courage, strength, the list goes on) as well as its faults, which makes it unique.  When I first read it, I was about 10, and I took its ending at face value.  Now that I am quite a bit older, I am inclined to (forgive the pun) read more deeply into its meaning, whether or not that was what the author intended, and have come to my own conclusions.  I am sure you will find your own as well.  Overall, I highly recommend this as an excellent, thought-inspiring book especially for preteens who may not quite be ready for Orwell (Blair, of course) or Czeslaw Milosz, but meaningful for all.

1400032717|2.0|2 stars <br /> <br />1. My friends gave me this book as a birthday present last year. <br /> <br />83. And I really looked forward to reading it because almost every book they recommend to me ends up being a book I really like such as Winterdance and Game of Thrones and Me Talk Pretty One Day and Through a Window as well as other books which I do not recall at the moment but which were also very good I assure you. <br /> <br />22. And I picked it up one day to read because I was looking for a book to read in a short time and this was short and I ride the train to work every day so I get to spend a lot of time reading because I do not work that close to where I live so I am on the train a long time and a short book would take only a few days to read and now I can't remember why I wanted a short book to read at the time but I did.  <br /> <br />-4. And the book is about an autistic kid who tries to solve the mystery that is named in the title of the book and who writes a book about it so we are led to believe that an autistic kid who begins every paragraph with the word \\"and\\" is going to write a book and solve a mystery and do a lot of things that seem highly improbable given the nature of autistic children and the litany of things that he cannot seem to overcome on a daily basis. <br /> <br />77. And I am numbering the review like the book numbers the chapters but not quite because the book is numbered in prime numbers so you're at chapter 233 before you know it but you really have not read that many chapters because the list of chapters are prime numbers so every even number after 2 is not included and every third number is not included because those are not prime numbers and any number ending with a 5 or a 0 are not included because they are not prime numbers either and this seems like just another one of these new and \\"funny\\" ways authors use a catch to get you to read their book and they want you to think they are clever <br /> <br />6. And I am bored by authorsnumbering their chapters in funny ways like with prime numbers or in descending order or by giving them all the same number in an attempt to make their book more interesting than it really is but all it merely does is detract from the fact that the author needs a diversion because the actual content of the book isn't enough to keep your attention so you need to be entertained by funny numbers and equations and pictures and maps and so on but this is what our reading world has come to these days. <br /> <br />36. And I am writing this review like the boy in the book because this probably gives you a better idea of the content of the book and what to expect so if you don't like all the lines beginning with the word \\"and\\" and you don't mind the run-on sentences then you might like this book but if you don't like this review you probably won't like this book or it might be the case that you did like the book but you don't like the review because you think I'm making fun of this theoretical autistic boy and his style of writing but what I'm really doing is giving you a window to what this book is about and the style it is written in without actually giving away very many details of the curious incident that happened in the night-time pertaining to a dog. <br /> <br />91. And I think it is silly for a non-autistic person to write a book from the perspective of an autistic person because we really don't know what it's like to be in the head of an autistic person and to be honest I think it's a cheap trick to use to get people to like your book but not like the band Cheap Trick which has problems of their own but they don't write books they make music. <br /> <br />8. And I think if you like this review you'll probably like the book and vice versa but for me I found it tedious and pointless and annoying and the 226 pages droned on and on and the story was not digestible so it was not a short book for me but really a long book with a few pages and the writing obviously lefta lot to be desired and there's not really a moral to the story and in the end everything is cured because he gets a dog. <br /> <br />48. And I just don't like that.

0312323867|4.0|The follow-up to Emily Giffin's book Something Borrowed gives a new meaning to the phrase \\"two sides to every story\\".  In Something Borrowed Giffin told the story of a fairly average woman named Rachel who was sick of being in the shadows of her best friend Darcy's glow.  After Rachel accidentally (sort of) sleeps with Darcy's fiancee, she ends up falling in love with Dex, who admits he has feelings for Rachel as well.  If you're looking at this page then you'll have figured out by now that Rachel succeeds in winning her man - while Darcy finds out a few moments afterwards.  This book...is Darcy's tale.    At first I was surprised to see Giffin wanting to put a character she portrayed as such an unlikeable, vapid, robotic person at the centre of a chick lit book - which are generally designed to make you RELATE to the main character.  Indeed, at first, Darcy is every bit as despicable as she was portrayed in Something Borrowed, seeking shallow comforts, using people to make herself feel better, and launching venomous attacks in her mind against friends and family.    However, the book does give insight into Darcy's OWN affair - with a friend of Dex's, which has resulted in her being pregnant with the friend's baby.  Bit by bit the book also divulges how many of the characters from the first book are faring in this one - including Rachel & Dex.  You also learn how clueless Darcy was to the whole Rachel/Dex affair, in fact the truth doesn't come out till six months or so after Darcy catches them in bed together.  In all fairness, Giffin paints a realistic portrait of the agony Darcy goes through seeing her friends together - happy - and just why it's so hard for her.    THe plot is essentially Darcy loses everything she once held so dear - friends to lean on, her prize of a fiancee, respect of her co-workers, closeness with her family.  Panicked and frustrated after the father of her child breaks up with her, Darcy flees sto London to live with hers and Rachel's childhood friend Ethan.  Although things are just as rocky in the UK as they are back home at first, eventually Darcy learns that life is full of surprises - including some about her family, friends, baby, and everything she ever thought she wanted.    By the end of the book you maybe aren't starting to root for Darcy, and you're certainly relating to her.  She becomes a softer, sweeter person with real emotions that looks back on her 'old life' with shame and disgust.  Although the book is filled with a ridiculous amount of unlikely moments of luck and ignores some basic mechanics when it comes to living & working in London, it is an honest, and most importantly, enjoyable read.
B000099T2L|5.0|I dont know who is posting their reviews, but some of yall dont know what yall are talking about.  Ok, you have your opinion, but I mean the woman can sing.  Beyonce Knowles has dealt with some situations in the past and she moved on.  From being in a group with people who didnt really appreciate her and what she wanted to do artistically, backstabbing and scrutiny, it was a mess for her.  She went into depression over that. She then realized that she needed to pick up the pieces and move on.  From writing songs on \\"Survivor\\" to coming out with her solo debut \\"Dangerously in Love\\", this woman is a phenomenon.  Her voice gives me chills.  She has such dynamic and heartfelt vocal range and her runs are amazing.  I loved the whole album, but especially loved \\" Speechless\\", \\"Dangerously in Love 2\\" and \\"The Closer I Get to You\\".  This woman is here to stay!!!!  More amazing things to come from her.  Beyonce, keep doing your thang!!!  Much love.
B00005JKL8|1.0|As the US European Command A-2 (Director of Air Intelligence) during this phase of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, I was surprised to see the ending -- what happened to the admiral and pilot. Historical? No way! The only plane shot down was a single-seat US Air Force F-16 pioted by Capt McBrien (sp?) while on combat air patrol (CAP), no cameras. Some naval F-14s carried film-loaded cameras in pods, but most of the imagery pin-pointing mass graves came from U-2s and satellites (and good coordination with French peacekeepers on the ground). So, this movie was fiction. It could have conveyed a better message, a better review of the decay of the former Yugoslavia and the dominant role of Serbian forces. But the producers decided action via fiction was better than learning fact.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I actually saw the Bucharest concert when I was seven years old and never forgot it.  You can feel the emotion in his songs, which is something that never dies.  I love everything that he does from singing warm, heart-felt ballads, to rocking it out with get-up-and-dance songs to the heart-stopping moonwalk.  He is probably one of the most spectacular entertainers of our time.  I hope he comes out with something soon.  I still can't forget the way he sang, \\"She's Out of My Life\\" , it was really emotional.  You could feel what he was saying.  As another reviewer said, I did think the jet pack exit was tight.  Who else would have done it the way he did?  Nobody!!!!  No one can ever compare to this man.  There are a lot of wannabe's, but there's only one MICHAEL JACKSON.  I will always love his music, generosity and kind spirit.  He has made many attributions to the world. I hope someone enjoys this review.
B00005JP01|3.0|Ok I have a question, why does this series keep straying farther away from what the underground scene is really about? People dont drift on the streets they do it professionally on real race tracks. Part 1 was horribly put together but it at least got the main point across. I of course will see this movie and probly enjoy it but I wish they would stick to drag racing since thats pretty much what people do in real life. Peace
B000FFJ85I|4.0|the first time i put in this CD, my reaction was simliar to many of the other reviewers who gave it 1 star. once you get past that initial shock... <br /> <br />the album f**king soars. yes, it sounds completely different than the previous albums. but it is genious. it is endearing and twisted. and it goes without saying that the band does not skip a beat or miss any detail. while i am not a fan of any of the bands that AFI seem to have emulated on this record, i love the way AFI approaches the genre.  <br /> <br />Kiss and Control is probably my favorite on the album, as it builds up gradually and kind of explodes after davey gets pissed off. then during The Killing Lights, Jade gives you that amazing work that you expect from him, shooting out a maidenesque solo, short but true.  <br /> <br />the bottom line is that any fan of AFI has to give it a shot. you will be suprised at first, maybe even a little disgusted, but this really is a great album.
006092988X|5.0|I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars.  I'm an avid reader and have probably read thousands of books, but A Tree Grows in Brooklyn continues to be my favorite.

B000EULJLU|1.0|ok peeps listen up and listen good. theres'e been enough reviews written on Tools' latest epic '10000 days' and I am suprised at some of the comments. Slightly negative at times from people who have probably only listened to it a couple of times. I was 1st drawn to Tool through Aenima (a classic) and waded through the progressive yet ponderous and drawn out 'Laterious' in 2001. This is similar to 'Laterious' but it isn't ponderous. It hits the spot and is a must for Tool fans to add to their collection. Dark haunting soundcapes,that build to a heavy finale, offbeat drumming, heavy bass lines and we can finally hear the lead guitar instead of it hiding in the back and beyond (Laterious). Aenima is a different cd in its own right (but still progressive and deliciously heavy). But back to 10,000 days, openers 'Vicarious' and 'Jambi' are heavy and subdued pointing the listener to what is coming. Title track '10,000 days (wings pt 2) is a classic must-hear, brooding and building, forever building. 'The Pot' follows suit and other musts include 'Rosetta Stoned' and 'Right in Two' wihich has definate overtones from Aenima. Of course a Tool CD wouldn't be without a couple of filler tracks but hey, at over 70 minutes long, you can put up with these of course. In conclusion whilst this is similar to the last CD it has more direction and less pondering. Buy it or miss out on a classic!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|when davey said electronic elements will be in the new record, he really did mean a lot of electronic elements. decemberunderground kicks off with 'prelude 12/21', a creepy one and a half minute electronic sound with a choir from havok leading into hand claps and \\"oh's\\"; then immediately spinning into 'kill caustic' which is an upbeat track that doesn't miss a pulse... davey's spewing vocals and catchy chorus makes this the most different but nonetheless a standout track. 'miss murder', the bands first single comes off as a sassy sound of afi with \\"heys\\" and one of the many catchy tracks on decemberunderground. next up is 'summer shudder', which is without a doubt the catchiest and most melodic chorus out of the amazing 12... it has a 'sing the sorrow' feel with a mix of 'black sails' to it with the great chorus phrase \\"under the summer rain\\".     'the interview' slows the pace of decemberunderground down a bit with a beautiful pieced together track that has a great ending of \\"i flee to decemberunderground and i'll grow pale without you\\"... it has a feel of 'this time imperfect' from 'sing the sorrow'; it's simply an amazing song. the record picks up again with 'love like winter' which is sure in most minds to be the next single to follow 'miss murder'... it has an 80's feel to it with synth elements and an amazing chorus. 'love like winter' stands out the most from any track on decemberunderground. 'affliction' is the twin of 'kill caustic' except with a more melodic chorus that sticks in your head forever. a secret track follows 'affliction' with amazing and beautiful electronic sounds and a female pouting words in the background. 'the missing frame' starts off with amazing guitar work and drum work from jade and adam and leads into a dark yet joyus and outstandingly beautiful chorus with afi's famous \\"woahs\\" and \\"oh's\\"... and the breakdown is even better with stomach twisting feedback and an awesome bassline. the next track   'kiss and control' is a favorite of many that has an exploding and hard chorus... the ending with davey talking is very cinematic and builds back into the great chorus.     'the killing lights' is catchy all through the track with a sickening melodic chorus of \\"it's killing time again, put on your face and lets pretend these killing lights won't kill us all again\\"... it has a feeling of being in a city at 3 in the morning with a great piano outro... it makes you feel pretty; and it has the same feel of 'this celluloid dream' if you're a fan of that song from 'sing the sorrow'. '37mm' is an upbeat mellow track that falls in the lines of the 'postal service' with great piano moments, and is a very soothing track all the way through (great night time song)... it follows up great from 'the killing lights'. the finale of decemberunderground is 'endlessly, she said'; which of course ends in a beautiful way... i have never heard davey sing so emotional on this track in any other afi song; and he says \\"i will wait for you\\" in such a beautiful way... it's a great ender for the great decemberunderground.    after 3 long years for a new record, it's well worth the wait. but it still will never live up to 'sing the sorrow', 'the art of drowning, or even 'black sails'. if you're an old fan, then please just open your mind on this record. i do see this record appealing to newer fans mostly, however. but 3 words sum this record up... beautiful, melodic, and catchy. davey's voice has improved tremendously and is more emotional than on any other previous records from afi. many think this isn't afi, but i disagree as i have found elements in this record on all the previous records from 'black sails in the sunset' to 'sing the sorrow' rather it be the \\"oh's\\" and \\"woahs\\" or just the dark side of afi. the fire still burns for a fire inside.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|The best part of \\"Dumbo\\" is seeing the delight on my 3 year old's face as he watches it.  We just bought the film 2 days ago, and he's already watched it 3 times.  He gets especially tickled during the bubbles scene.  As for me, I am moved during the \\"Baby Mine\\" scene.  Overall, \\"Dumbo\\" is a wonderful story about maternal love, innocence and friendship.  I only wish that there were more age appropriate films like \\"Dumbo\\" for young children.
0553801503|3.0|I spent most of this book waiting for something to happen, waiting to spend time with the characters I expected to see.  It was only after becomming disappointed that I read on the author's website that this is 1/2 of the original planned book split into two for size's sake. <br /> <br />Okay, that is part of an explanation, but does not really satisfy.  That means the next book will not contain any follow through from this one and these story lines will be dangling for several years before being picked up.  Worse people who don't know go into this book set for disappointment as they expected to see their favorite characters and were met with a book of new characters and nothing to tell them. <br /> <br />I hope the time between book 4 and book 6 is far less than book 1->4, because spending this much time away from ciritical characters is a sure way to lose interest in a series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EMGJM2|5.0|Van Hunt, the black Remy Shand, has put out his second album, \\"On The Jungle Floor\\" to much anticipation, not even giving his fans two years to breathe (which is rare amongst the neosoul community).  \\"OTJF\\" is an outstanding sophomore effort, considering that his self-titled debut was a pretty good nod to the golden age of R&B, funk, and soul- the 1970s.  Hunt does his lineage proud as the new funk progeny of Parliament-Funkadelic, Curtis Mayfield, Sly & The Family Stone, Rick James, and mostly notably Prince.  Add to that Hunt's sense of melody and penchant for a good lyric, and you have one of the, if not the, best albums of 2006.  There lurks an intro and interlude within, but they're short and actually quite amusing in their brevity.  They merely showcase Hunt playing around.  The first song, \\"If I Take You Home\\", launches off with a funky, distorted guitar riff and boasts a lovely chorus, a la Wendy and Lisa from The Revolution.  The funk is given in a higher dose with \\"Hot Stage Lights\\" where Hunt tries his darndest to bend his notes like Rick James in \\"Superfreak\\".  Other highlights include... well, the entire album, as there are too many to name.  The catchiest song (although not my personal favorite) on the album is \\"Mean Sleep\\" with Nikki Costa.  It's a cover of a Cree Summer song and the interplay between Hunt and Costa is amazingly emotive. It's one of the rare songs where I actually feel an emotional reaction from a vocal performance (particalurly Costa's).  However, there are a couple duds that have to be singled out- the Kravitz-esque \\"Ride, Ride, Ride\\" and \\"The Night Is Young\\".  If you actually sit down and listen to them, they're not bad songs, but just have very weak choruses and/or are repetitive.  Do I think this album is better than \\"Van Hunt\\"?  Absolutely.  What is significant about Van Hunt is that he wears his influences on his sleeve, but he doesn't manage to sound \\"copycat\\".  For instance, the opening guitars on \\"If I Take You Home\\" sound somewhat raw and idiosyncratic.  Maybe someone else who knows more than I do can probably nitpick and find a source, but when I hear that kind of distortion, I think of Van Hunt.  I also think Hunt sounds better and he experiments more with rock and other sounds not heard on the first album.  It's almost shocking to know that he's responsible for mostly all writing and performing of the instruments.  I play this album a lot, and it's gotten me to appreciate \\"Van Hunt\\" more (which is a great album).  I can only hope that he tops himself with his 3rd outing.omewhat raw and idiosyncratic.

B000A5044C|4.0|A graceful and haunting film from Japanese writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda.  Four children struggle to survive on their own in a tiny Tokyo apartment after their childlike mother abandons them.  The oldest, Akira (Yûya Yagira) and his sister Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura) try to maintain some semblance of family life for the younger children, Shigeru (Hiei Kimura) and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu), but ultimately tragedy befalls the four.<br /><br />This is a long, slowly paced, minimalist film, but it rewards the patient viewer with its tender attention to the simple beauty and minutia of the children's world as well as the utterly natural performances of the child actors.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|Donnie Darko is a very good movie. Yeah it gets a little to complicated for itself at times, but it's entertaining the entire way through. A very good film with a very good cast. Almost nothing wrong with it. But... <br /> <br />The Director's Cut: Alright, this version of the film has been criticized by many fans and critics. Often seen as making the film, simple and cheap. I myself do not enjoy it quite as much as the original, for the above reasons. But by no means does the Director's Cut make it a bad movie. I mean heck, I own it. The specials on the dvd are also pretty good. <br /> <br />I still suggest to you that you watch the original first, but if you don't, I wouldn't worry about it. The whole, \\"The Director's Cut is the Worst movie Ever\\", isn't true. I hope you  enjoy this very good movie. <br /> <br />Rating: 4 Stars <br /> <br />I hope this was helpful, thanks for your time.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|There are two very fine adaptations of Pride & Prejudice already, the first the 1940 Hollywood version with a script by Aldous Huxley (of Brave New World) starring Laurence Olivier as the definitive Darcy.  The second is the recent BBC miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  Both preserved the wit and verve of the source.  This version has the audacity to try to rewrite Austen's dialogue as if to improve upon the original.  The results are downright cheesy, and worse, boring.  The costumes and sets look cheap, the characters are unsympathetic, and the performances are at best one-note, at worst colorless.  Keira Knightley is posing for a fashion spread, but she's not acting.  Don't bother.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|You would expect more out of Academy Award winning, Peter Jackson. But it seems we were expecting too much. The film is visually stunning. It's worth seeing just for that reason. But the overall film suffers in many areas, resulting in a mediocre remake. <br /> <br />First of all, the casting was bad. Often the actors are very out of place in their roles, even though they give good performances. Some of the selections are very peculiar, Jack Black for instance. Very strange, although he is quite good in his role. <br /> <br />It has some memorable moments, but the majority of the film is boring and pointless. It seems Jackson feels the need to make every movie as long as possible, and the film really suffers because of this. Even with the strange casting, the film still could have been great. The length is what really knocks it down a level. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a 3 hour long movie as much as anyone else, but the extra length was pointless. It didn't add anything to the movie. <br /> <br />As I said before, it's worth a watch for the special effects. Just don't go in expecting an amazing film. <br /> <br />Rating: 2 1/2 Stars <br /> <br />Thank you for your time.
B000EQH2QK|2.0|I've been a fan of Shakira for many years, and I believe that her first two albums, Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan los Ladrones, are still her best works by far.  If you've watched Shakira grow since day one, then you probably won't enjoy this album, because this doesn't even compare to the old Shakira. <br /> <br />If you're a non-Spanish speaking American Kelly Clarkson, Avril Lavigne, Madonna fan, then you'll probably enjoy this album.  I mean, with all due respect, I only like one song on ths album (Don't Bother), and that's because it reminds me of \\"Si Te Vas,\\" a song featured on Donde Estan los Ladrones.  Everything else is just a mess. <br /> <br />I still love Shakira, but this album is a huge disappointment for her more mature fan base.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This is the best movie from the 1980s... my daughter, who is now 8, loves this movie too...
B00005JKLZ|4.0|My recommendation is to rent the DVD and watch it once for the special effects, particularly the time machine itself, a well-rendered combination of mock-up and computer graphics. While you're at it, pay special attention to Klaus Badelt's magnificent symphonic score, then buy the soundtrack CD and forget the movie.  As others have said, the plot is puerile and forgettable.  Among multifarious problems, the callow kid played by actor Guy Pearce has in no way the scientific gravitas to invent a time machine  (I wish I did).  Instead of the movie, I recommend reading Wells' groundbreaking sci-fi novel of the same name while listening to Badelt's score.  Symphonic music is not dead, friends, it lives on in movie scores like this one (replete with a choral Eloi theme worthy of the very Garden of Eden). One can only hope that, when the next really grand movie does come along - David Lean style, they will get a composer as good as Badelt to score it.
B00029LNHS|5.0|This is one of the best Black Eyed Peas cd's ever. Let's Get It Started is my most favorite song out of any other song that I know of. BEP beats my second favortie band Bon Jovi by a longshot.
B00003CXDD|4.0|\\"Willow\\" - a film by Ron Howard, based on a story by George Lucas, who also produced the thing. I remember watching Willow when I was fairly little, but I couldn't remember a thing about it except that it had a dreamy feel, like most 1980s fantasies do. Picked up the special edition on DVD and had another at look.    The wicked Queen Bavmoral (Jean Marsh) seeks to destroy a baby girl born in her kingdom, for according to a prophecy this girl will destroy the evil empire the Queen has spent her life building up. The baby is put in a basket and sent down a river (rather like the baby Moses) and is found by Willow (Warwick Davis), a very little man who lives on his farm near a town of very little people (known as Nelwyns) with his loving wife and his two cute children. Willow wants no business with the bigger people's babies, and would rather put the girl back in the water, but her wife makes him see sense, and takes the child into her home. However, with the baby comes trouble, terrifying hounds terrorize the village, sent by the evil Queen to hunt down the baby. To take the pressure off the town, Willow must take the baby back to the world of the bigger people (known as Daikini), who are in the midst of a war. On the way he'll meet a mad swordsmaster (Val Kilmer), discover men even smaller than he is in a Gulliver's Travels style encounter, master sorcery and even tussle with a two headed dragon and a few trolls to boot.    It's an entertaining fantasy, great looking and rather unique. I liked the idea of the town of little people, though it must have been a nightmare for Lucasfilm to find all the right extras. I spotted a few I recognized from other movies and TV series (like the little fellow who appears in Sabrina The Teenage Witch now and then). Val Kilmer makes a fine smart alecy warrior, and Jean Marsh makes a chillingly cold sorcerer queen. Part of the film is shot in New Zealand, which might appeal to fans of Lord of the Rings (along with the whole \\"little people on a quest to rid their world of evil\\" thing).    There's a fair amount of special features here, though not as many as you would get with a Lucasfilm like Star Wars. These features include a commentary from Willow himself (Warwick Davis), a 1980s \\"making of\\" documentary (George Lucas hadn't gone gray then, Ron Howard hadn't gone completely bald and Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley fall in love on the set), a documentary on the \\"morphing\\" effect (first featured in \\"Willow\\") and its impact on the special effects industry, along with the impact of digital filmmaking in general. There's also a photo gallery, and a series of original trailers from the 80s    I recommend this movie to fantasy lovers and to followers of Val Kilmer, as he falls in love with his wife in this film.    Oh, and one more thing. If you liked Jean Marsh as the witchy Queen Bavmordal, I recommend you check out the 1989 Doctor Who serial \\"Battlefield\\", where she plays Morgana (of Arthurian legend), a role that looks and sounds very similar to the one she plays in Willow (it was only a year after Willow, so I'm sure it was kind of deliberate casting choice).  However, being a TV serial, it is a lot lower budget. She's one of the best things in that serial, I reckon.  Speaking of Doctor Who, Jean Marsh also appeared in the 1964 serial \\"The Crusaders\\" and the 1965/66 serial \\"The Dalek's Master Plan\\", though neither time as Morgana, she's still pretty good. The surviving footage from those last two serials is available on the \\"Doctor Who - Lost in Time\\" (The William Hartnell Years) DVD box.
B000059PPX|4.0|This film is certainly like no other movie you've seen. You can tell from watching it that it could never have been made before or after the years between 1967 and 1970. It brings to mind \\"Casino Royale\\" and \\"Barbarella\\", but \\"Candy\\" is better.  <br /> <br />This is a psychedelic \\"Candide\\" story. Our heroine, Candy, travels around the world and encounters a number of men, all weirder than the last. The supporting cast is excellent. Walter Matthau plays a sex starved general, Richard Burton a pretentious, self obsessed, alcoholised poet. Ringo Starr plays the Mexican gardener and Marlon Brando makes a hilarious performance as an Indian guru.  <br /> <br />The film is two hours long and the story is thin, but it kept my interest up. It is filled with humour that is sometimes too dry for its own good, but whether you laugh with the movie or at the movie, it's still lots of fun. This is a one-of-a-kind movie that's not for everybody's taste, but it's definately worth checking out.
0671027387|5.0|President Zachary Herney, the incumbent in a hotly contested presidential race, is a strong supporter of a publicly funded NASA, open to the scientific community at large. His opponent, Senator Sedgewick Sexton, has made overspending and mismanagement at NASA his campaign hot button issue and clearly favours privatization of space research. NASA's timely discovery of a meteorite buried deep within an arctic glacier that provides positive long sought for proof of the existence of extra-terrestrial life seems to be the needed success that will put a lock on their reputation with the US taxpayer and a stranglehold on Herney's successful re-election. But when Herney's hand-picked team of civilian experts and intelligence analysts begin to sniff out the possibility of scientific fraud, Dan Brown treats us to a magnificent display of high intensity action and fireworks; the best and the worst of Washington political posturing, cover ups and power plays; and a deadly team of Delta Force assassins assigned to ensure the fraud is kept under wraps.<br /><br />But, as exciting and as imaginative as it was, it wasn't actually the plot or the fast-paced action that put Deception Point into the category of one of the finest thrillers I've ever had the pleasure of reading.<br /><br />Unlike so many other thrillers, Dan Brown has not sacrificed characterization for plot. In fact, he has treated us to a marvelously broad cast of realistic, well-developed, human, credible characters that fairly leaped off the page - Marjorie Tench, a bone deep ugly spinster bitch with an incredible set of finely, honed killer political instincts; Michael Tolland, a charismatic scholar who like David Suzuki, David Attenborough or Jacques Cousteau, seemed to be able to translate real scientific knowledge unerringly into a well understood and widely appealing television format; Rachel Sexton, the daughter of the self-centered presidential hopeful senator, struggling to distance herself from politics and retain her credibility as a skilled intelligence analyst with the NRO; and Gabrielle Ashe, the starry-eyed aide who succumbed to Sexton's political reputation and got trapped in a career-killing sex scandal.<br /><br />The second feature that separated Deception Point from other lesser lights in the thriller genre was his exhilarating use of technology!

1400079179|3.0|i had to have a look after all this hype and the book was worse than i feared. the chapters are annoyingly short and end with what are probably supposed to be cliffhangers, but what they do is chop the story into frilly little pieces. Brown's previous Vatican story was much better.<br /><br />The characters are 2D, laden with cliches and damned with a thin plot.  Although the book contains a number of clever riddles and juicy historical factoids, the author can never decide whether he is giving a lecture on history, religious iconography and conspiracy theories or whether he is actually writing a thriller. as a result, there are pages and pages of irrelevant stuff while the plot itself is thin and moves at lightning speed.<br /><br />not that i mind the subject topic - in fact, i find Knights Templar, medieval legends, da Vinci et consortes captivating.  yet if you are writing a novel, Dan, please write the novel, not a philosophical sermon or a Morality Play.<br /><br />And now I have to imagine Hanks as Langdon &lt;shudder>
B000AL730O|3.0|The song RIDING TO VANITY FAIR is Paul's literal take on Heather Mills' bitchy interview in (you guessed it) VANITY FAIR magazine.

0812550757|4.0|Speaker for the dead is one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read. <br />It is the perfect sequel to Ender's Game and one of the most taught out novels I have ever read. If this book is to have a sequel I'm certain that it would be as good if not better than this one; not an easy task because of how well written this book is. By using complex characters, intricate storylines, and the intense action of this novel it is one of the best in existence. I hope you enjoy my review. <br />   The setting is the Portuguese experiment planet of Lusitanina. Here the human population is the host to a race of strange creatures called piggies. Through this book the humans and piggies cause mysterious events that force Ender Wiggin to investigate as Speaker for the Dead. In just four days time the human and pigges will be revealed as only Ender Wiggin can. The question is will Ender be a saint or a heretic when the dust levels. The answer can only be found by reading this book. <br />    Another feature of this novel that I enjoy is the technologies that make the entire story come together. There are some new editions to the arsenal such as a fence that causes all your pain receptors to violently react when touched and a hyper intelligent computer ear piece called Jane that guides Ender in his finances and planning. But the ansible and light speed star crafts are still the classics. For all you gadget fans and high tech freaks this novel is for you. <br />   As you should be able to tell I loved this novel and I had a great time reading it. It sentence and paragraph fluency causes this book to be a quick read just like the prequel Ender's Game. I advise that if you haven't read Ender's Game that you should before reading Speaker for the Dead. For a great sci-fi novel read Orson Scott Cards Speaker for the Dead.
B00004W221|5.0|I just watched this with my nephew, a 10 year old who wants to play football some day. What a great movie for a kid his age!  Not just because of the whole \\"follow your dreams\\" message but also because it's just an entertaining movie. You get a real sense of how someone can accomplish a lot with nothing more than his own motivation and desires.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I'm sorry CW did not decide to continue this show. It had great characters and writing.  It didn't need murders and violence but showcased family conflict and other relationships. It would be nice if some other channel would pick up this show for more seasons. Hopefully all the seasons of this show become available on DVD.  Also would love to have another CD of music from this show.
0385336691|4.0|I discovered this series last year while surfing the amazon website for new author's to read. When I came across Lee Child I read the reviews you guys wrote about his books. They were all positive. So I started at the beginning and read The Killing Floor. From then on I was hooked. You will too if you haven't read this series. The Hard Way is a great story. I won't go into detail because many of these reviews have that info already. I will just say this is a great addition to the series,very worth while, however I would love more action with Jack, kicking some butt. I had to wait until the end to get it this time.
0060764899|5.0|This book is amazing! I just loved its plot and storyline. The characters were well developed and you could relate to them, as I am very close to the main character's age. And it is also so addicting written, that after reading the first sentence you won't want to stop! <br /> This book is about 4 brothers and sisters who find a magical wardrobe that bring them to a magical world of Narnia. But Narnia is under the evil rule of the White witch. So now the children must go along with a army of talking animals, spirits, and trees, along with the leader of Narnia, Aslan the lion, to defeat the White Witch. <br /> I just love C.S Lewis's style of writing. It lays everything you need to know on the paper, straightforwardly enough so any child can understand it, but beautifully enough so any critic will praise it.  This book is truly a masterpiece.  <br /> I recommend this book to any fantasy book lovers, and any Lloyd Alexander fan will love this book!
B000002J09|5.0|Most of the non Led Zeppelin fanatics may look at you funny if you mention Zoso or Runes, and some may even be quizzical about the title Led Zeppelin IV, but if you mention that this album has \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" on it, you're bound to get your point across. <br /> <br />Yes, this album has \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" on it, but it also has unquestioned classics \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock and Roll,\\" \\"Going To California,\\" and chestnuts such as \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hop.\\" And that's just the songs that immediately come to mind. <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin's eight song master work is a perfect example of a time when albums didn't have just one or two truly great songs and a bunch of filler material. This isn't a one hit wonder, as Zeppelin already had albums and well-known material before Zoso hit the music stores. This is rock music that stands the test of time, as \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is consistently rated among the top songs of all time -- even though it was never released as a single.  <br /> <br />For a song that never inched higher than 47 on the U.S. charts, \\"Rock And Roll\\" remains indelible in the minds of classic rock fans, enough to bring fresh excitement to Stevie Nicks concert sets both last year and this year when she included it in her Gold Dust Tour.  <br /> <br />While people sometimes denigrate younger listeners, seemingly labeling all of them as having no respect for classic rock, try your hand at singing a Led Zeppelin song around a younger crowd. You may find it's appreciated much more than you expected. When something is truly timeless, people still get a charge out of listening to it. This is one such record.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Alot of what I've been reading for reviews for this album echo reviews I've seen for things like NIN's \\"The Fragile,\\" which was also accused of having too much filler. Luckily, Tool outshines competition. <br /> <br />If you are going to start listening to Tool for the first time, do NOT buy this album. That simple. Start with something from A Perfect Circle (either Mer de Noms or Thirteenth Step), or go to one of the other Tool albums. You need to be used to their style to even begin to like this album. And even then, it can be a little tricky. I'll admit, at first, I latched on to Vicarious and Jambi, and sort of ignored the rest of the album. But, as of late, I've actually found myself wanting to skip straight over to 10,000 Days/Wings for Marie Pt 2, just to hear the melody and singing on that track. The thing is, this particular album isn't meant to be a series of individual songs, but seems to be rather one long piece that, in its own way, tracks much of the progress of the band over time. It starts out viciously attacking the media, then religion, and over time deals with drugs and even the supernatural (unless I missed something).  <br /> <br />The title track, though, is an incredible emotional foray. From what I have read online (check out Wikipedia's entry on Tool), the idea of \\"10,000 Days\\" may be related to Maynard's mother (named Marie Judith), who was confined to a wheelchair for 27 years (which is almost 10,000 days long) until she passed away. \\"10,000 Days/Wings for Marie,\\" when viewed in that light, becomes something of a beautiful melody, showing a Maynard at his most vulnerable since Undertow.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is a fantastic album when listened to end to end, and although it does seem to drag at points, it's well worth picking up. Just don't expect instant gratification: you have to let this one grow on you.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I'm a huge Everwood fan. I don't think that there was a better hour of television. Every episode was filled with warmth, witty, and personable characters. Yes, it ventured into cheesy storylines at times, but the writers and the actors always, always managed to salvage them. I will miss this show. Very much. <br /> <br />I'll admit it, I didn't buy the first season when it came out (but I wasn't really buying DVD sets then either). I have just rectified that--I hope that we can send a message that Everwood is appreciated and we will get a chance to own all of the seasons of this beautiful, wonderful show.
1400079179|4.0|Strengths: This mystery gets better as it goes along, rather than losing steam as so many seem to do. The last third is very good. The basic premise is excellent.<br /><br />  Weaknesses: Too much indifferent dialog, especially in the first two thirds; too much dialog replacing action. Not that much happens in the first two thirds.<br /><br />  Question: Why? Why the runaway success? This is no better than many other first rate mysteries. An unheard of book (by comparison) is Robert Goddard's \\"Days Without Number\\" ... yet the same genre and in my opinion just as strong. So why the huge success for \\"Code\\" while so many others (in the same genre, even) are neglected? I have to believe it has nothing to do with talent, everything to do with marketing and media hype.<br /><br />  Having said, if Brown's intent was to master the formula in such a way as to have a tearaway bestseller success, he certainly pulled that off.<br /><br />  Entertaining -- and way over-hyped.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|I fell in love with the song \\"Unfaithful\\" the minute I first heard it. As for the other songs they are all very good! It's not every day when you have an overall great album! Must buy!
B0006GAOBI|3.0|Even though the Director's Cut is the \\"vision\\" of Richard Kelly, the tweaking of the DVD has not been well recieved. From the changing of music, new Frankie voice-overs like \\"mail her a letter\\" and the cheesy computer graphics, the Director's Cut DVD is better left in the bargain bin. Don't get me wrong... it is still a great movie and I liked the 20 minutes of extra footage. My biggest problem (besides the handholding of the film to you) is the \\"computer grid\\" effect at the climax with the fireworks. If you love movies and want a more rounded version of the film, get the original and stick with it.
B00061QJZI|5.0|This movie is very very funny. San Diego anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is loved by all the citizens. His boss hires a woman reporter who is extremely hot. She takes her job very seriously but Ron and his fellow workers Brian Fantana, Champ Kind and Brick Tamlind (Steve Carrell)are hitting on her. This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. Other movies I enjoy are Old School, Zoolander, Scary movie 2 & 3 and Austin Powers 1, 2 & 3.
B000002BBY|5.0|Stop the comparison between Oasis and the Beatles. The Beatles are the greatest band ever. Noel Gallagher will tell you that. Fact Oasis has released six albums of new material, 1 live album, and 1 b sides album of previously released material. Oasis has released eight albums. Oasis has six number 1 albums on the UK charts. The poll of the greatest albums of all time was conducted in the UK not the US. Get your facts straight before you bash Oasis. This is a very good album! Please listen to the CD before you review it!

B000002UR7|4.0|Now before any of you give the below reviewer an un-helpful vote, read his profile, as he states that his reviews are jokes. Anyway, this was Radiohead's beginning. Thom and co. were from a city no one really heard about, but they were determined to make it in the music business. Keep in mind that Pablo Honey was made when grunge was still popular. Radiohead tried to make a record influenced by grunge without ripping off greats like Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and... Nirvana... who weren't all that great (and if I hear a Nirvana fan bash this...).<br /><br />The song Creep, while a hit song, was attacked by music critics, calling their album a pop disaster and so forth. It nearly broke up the band.<br /><br />Radiohead is my 2nd favorite band of all time (I won't say what my 1st is), so hear me out:<br /><br />Pablo Honey really isn't all that bad of an album if you let it grow on you, Radiohead fans. Like many of you, when I 1st heard Pablo Honey, I didn't like it at all. I was used to the unique and complex song structures that were found on The Bends, and everything after it (and yes, that includes Amnesiac and Hail To The Theif, Radiohead \\"fans\\"). However, I gave it a few more tries, and found it to be quite good. The beats are pretty catchy, the guitar solos are outstanding, and the lyrics aren't half bad (with the exceptions of a few songs [I'm looking at you, track 12]).<br /><br />However, Pablo Honey gets a star off because it's not all that great, but it gets 4 stars because it's decent for a 1st effort and for its time. Forget the fact that Radiohead \\"fans\\" say you can skip over this (they say that same thing about Amnesiac and Hail To The Theif, which makes my blood boil. These so-called \\"fans\\" are basically calling themselves Radiohead fans when they reject 3 of their 6 albums. Fans my @$$), it's still worth adding to your collection.<br /><br />Still, with that said, I suggst that you start with any other Radiohead album when 1st getting into them, then you can buy this record.<br /><br />Recommended from one big Radiohead fan.getting into them, then you can buy this record. <br /> <br />Recommended from one big Radiohead fan.

6305558175|4.0|Intense-loved it! I went in not expecting much- Richard Gere has a bad track record and I'd never really heard of this movie-but was pleasantly surprised and very drawn in by the love story and the mystery. Great chemistry between Richard Gere and Jodie Foster illuminates an already strong plot, not to mention their great acting. This is the best acting that I have seen Richard Gere put out so far, and in this movie there's everything to catch and hold a viewer's attention-passion, romance, suspense, fighting, even a trial. That is not to say that it is a loud movie-it's not, which explains its relative obscurity. But it has something for everyone, both the males and the females. And I especially appreciated the fact that it did not fall all over itself with the love story-that is the center of the movie but in the end it's the story of two people, not of their love, which is the way it shoudl be. Delicate, crafted, and oddly moving, it ends with a bittersweet ending that lifts this movie into one of the best movies of its kind that I've seen.
1400079179|3.0|A quest romance. The protagonists, Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu, who is a descendant of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, are in search of the Holy Grail, or something, and are pursued by bad guys who include the Pope, the French police and Opus Dei. Brown leaves out the Knights of Columbus, the Shriners, Rotary and the Boy Scouts but that may because he didn't have room.<br /><br />They follow  a lunatic but entertaining sequence of clues based on codes and anagrams as they search. There's a great deal of information and misinformation about secret societies, lost biblical manuscripts, old churches in Paris and London, the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians etc.  Some of it sounds quite erudite until you check it out.<br /><br />The stuff about pagan survivals in Christianity largely comes from James Frazer's \\"The Golden Bough\\" which has now largely been debunked by such works as Robert Fraser's \\"The Making of the Golden Bough\\" and Cynthia Eller's \\"The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory.\\"<br /><br /> For a sober view by a professional historian of  pseudo-ancient  secret societies I would suggest Frances Yates's \\"The Rosicrucian Enlightenment.\\"<br /><br /> \\"The Gnostic Scriptures\\" by Bentley Leighton in the New Anchor Bible Reference Library is a balanced view. (Elaine Pagels is rather too enthusiastic).<br /><br />Bernard Berenson's \\"Italian Painters of the Renaissance\\" remains the standard on Leonardo's paintings.<br /><br />Mary Magdalene is mentioned by name in the Gospels, in the 8th Chapter of Luke, the 27th Chapter of Matthew, the 16th Chapter of Mark and the 20th Chapter of John, (Some other women are sometimes identified with her, although the Bible doesn't say so. One is Mary who was the sister of Martha and Lazarus; one is the woman in the 7th chapter of Luke \\"which was a sinner\\" who poured perfumed oil over Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; another is the unnamed woman taken in adultery in the 8th chapter of John and then left alone with Jesus.) In the 8th Chapter of Luke Jesus and his disciples travel around accompanied by many women who included Mary Magdalene, Joanna and Susanna  and who, in the King James version, \\"ministered\\" (the Greek is \\"diekanoun\\") to them.<br /><br />I found it enjoyable and it held my attention for the first half but was rather too long. Apart from the fake history, which could have been fun, the main plot line is a  treasure hunt, following clues, and a chase with narrow escapes. There's episode after episode, in each of which they follow a clue, get into trouble and then get rescued in the nick of time. These got repetitious. .My other main problem was with the dialog, which is never sparkling and often consists of long speeches expounding the cryptography and hermeneutics.is disciples travel around accompanied by many women who included Mary Magdalene, Joanna and Susanna  and who, in the King James version, \\"ministered\\" (the Greek is \\"diekanoun\\") to them.   <br />I found it enjoyable and it held my attention for the first half but was rather too long.

076790592X|4.0|In this particular book there is this guy named Morrie, who is dying from a disease known, as A.L.S. It's a disease where your muscular system slowly breaks down, until you die. Throughout the book one of his students, named Mitch comes and sees him every Tuesday, while they talk about the world around them and life. <br /> I thought that this book used very vivid descriptions about Morrie's remaining days. As you read you are always feeling what Morrie and Mitch feel. I think that this book is good for all ages, cause it teaches you how to live life freely and how to prepare for some of life's greatest lessons. <br /> Some of the things I didn't like about this book were that not much of a plot really happens. They only ever really talk throughout the entire book. Not many actions take place, and you are constantly feeling bored with this book. <br /> I would probably recommend this book for anyone over the age of 12, but not if you're looking for a good action or suspense, etc. kind of book. This book is really for when you're contemplating about your life, for Morrie makes you appreciate living.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|I am late reviewing this album, even though I bought it the very first week it came out. Anyways, PEARL JAM is a fine disc from the group of the same name.  It isn't per say a particularly innovative disc, but it goes to show that a good hard rocking disc without added frills is a great breath of fresh air itself. PEARL JAM fills this easily with hits such as \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"World Wide Suicide\\", \\"Comatose\\", and \\"Parachutes\\" among others.  Nobody can deny that perhaps \\"Life Wasted\\" is the true highlight of this entire album and is also their follow-up single to \\"World Wide Suicide\\".  Vedder's gritty, grimy vocals make the experience of this album all the better as he howls \\"life wasted\\" repeated numbers of times.  Occasionally too much of all good things tend to cloud how remarkable they really are, but the true hits of this album and the high points truly make it one of 2006's best rock releases.  It's not the experimental metal ruminations of Tool nor the funk-rap metal of Red Hot Chili Peppers, but one must not forget the major success that Pearl Jam has enjoyed 15 years into it.  4 stars.
B000003S5H|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing the tune \\"La Femme D'Argent\\" as the background music on a very funny youtube video. These guys make some awesome music with old-school electronic instruments - moog, vocorder, etc. <br /> <br />rock on, garth!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've watched this movie three times. I've read the novel twice and seen the A&E version (which this film is unfairly compared with). Therefore I am fully aware of the story and characters and all that diddle-dee-do. So I guess I can be considered informed of the material and what it is about. <br /> <br />Now I should mention to people who have this idea that movies based on books should remain faithful to the point of thinking the source as sacred text: the screenwriter did take liberties with the story. A leap in time here. A missing episode there. A sudden visit here. And a hussy fit there. <br /> <br />But it is an \\"adaptation\\" and not a \\"translation\\" of the original novel by dear Miss Austen. The changes are not drastically uncalled for. They are actually refreshing. As is the mood that the director (Wright) set for the film. The film moves at a swift pace but the mood is always down-to-earth and emotionally focused. Normally when people do Austen adaptations they have this image of the whole movie being focused around drawing rooms with the etiquettes associated with the Regency period. They put so much emphasis into the details of the setting and situations that they neglect the characters humanity and hope that the actors are up to code. This version actually looked at the material in the opposite direction and focused more on the main characters (especially Elizabeth or \\"Lizzy\\" as she is well known). <br /> <br />Oh well I must talk about the acting. It was good. <br /> <br />For more info notice the academy award nomination Keira Knightley received for her portrayal of Lizzy. Even though the Academy Awards relativity to cinematic excellence has lessened, please be assured that the notice placed towards Ms. Knightley's performance was well deserved. The whole cast was pretty good with the other standout being Donald Sutherland. But if I must say something more about Ms. Knightley, it is that she fitted who Elizabeth was as a young opinionated woman. She plays Lizzy with the conviction that I felt was missing in other P&P adaptations. It one thing to say the lines, it's another to say the lines like it's something you would actually say.  <br /> <br />This movie puts the \\"passion\\" aspect into the romance of Austen's creation. A true Romantic (of the literary kind) would think of this adaptation as a triumph. And if dear Miss Austen were alive she would probably giggle (of the hushed kind) with delight at the unabashed joy this movies gives in spades. <br /> <br />Well Recommended <br /> <br />Note: For the strict Austen fans who believe that Austen would spin in her grave at the supposed blasphemy of the movie, I will say this. You forget that Miss Austen (the writer of gothic-satire Northanger Abbey) probably did not think so much of herself that she wouldn't have wanted other people to look at her work in different ways. Stop being narrow-minded. Miss Austen wasn't! Now enjoy the movie. <br />(Off the soap box) <br />
0316743003|5.0|Skunk Works reads like an entertaining history (at least for aviation/military/politics buffs), but if you read it closely it also offers the most details of any book I've found on how Lockheed's Skunk Works and its legendary leader, Kelly Johnson, actually achieved so many aviation breakthroughs.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended to anyone involved in technology development, and is perhaps an aerospace corollary to Brooks' Mythical Man-Month.  Kelly Johnson was decades ahead of others when it came to lean development methods, and many of the companies that are wasting millions on bloated engineering or software projects would do well to go back and re-examine Johnson's approach, which centered on clear lines of responsibility and communications and a small, highly-talented and -empowered staff with  clear requirements.<br /><br />Kelly Johnson was perhaps the greatest aircraft designer of all time, and left an organization in Rich's Hands that allowed him to develop breakthrough stealth technologies that again revolutionized air warfare.  As far as I could tell, Rich is pretty candid about life at the Skunk Works, noting for example how Johnson didn't believe stealth technology would work, but managed to leave room for Rich to pursue it.<br /><br />If you are interested in this sort of stuff, then I also encourage you to check out my blog AeroGo (see my Amazon profile), which covers things like this that engineering students and others going into the aerospace field need to know about, both for background and to make the transition to management.
B0000648WZ|5.0|This great movie, which I always find funnier when I call it Starship Poopers, is the birth and death of young talent.  It's the moment that we get to see a young Denise Richards, nubile, perky, and smiley.  Oh yes, thank you Denise Richards.  On the other hand, it's the one and only time that Casper Van Dien (who gets a homoerotic, alien, mucus facial during a battle) has been in anything worthwhile; so, it's basically like Bloodsport for Jean Claude Van Damme.<br /><br />There is the wonderful shower scene in which male and female alike get wet and soapy, and no doubt inspired Denise Richards to do her infamous threesome scene in Wild Things.  It's also the scene that the audience gets introduced to the hot redhead, who has never been seen again.<br /><br />Alien carnage and futuristic battle scenes dominate the movie.  What's great is that the alien cockroach looking things rip apart bodies so messily that Steven Seagal gets jealous every time he watches the movie.<br /><br />Besides Richards, who steals every scene, it's a cast of B-listers who every movie-buff knows by face but not name.  It's an entire movie of, \\"Hey!  It's that guy!\\" or \\"Hey, it's that chick from that one movie!\\"  And that includes Doogie Howser.<br /><br />The greatest part of this movie is the constant voice-over that some sort of news caster works into every transition.  It's a sci-fi, action, news cast!  At every turn there is an infomercial that is so jingoistic that I initially thought it was done to make fun of Nazis.  \\"Would you like to know more?\\"  Even the kids get involved in the war effort, killing anything that resembles the bug-like aliens.<br /><br />Ruffnecks!  Rico's Ruffnecks!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|After being a Dream Theater fan for over 10 yrs. I personally was a little reprehensive about Octavarium since I really didn't like Six Degrees that much buying it as soon as it was released, until a few weeks ago I started to listen to it now I can't stop listening to it, many people have discribed Dream Theater as \\"Self Indulgent\\" those same people will never in their lifetime understand the level of muscianship that these guys have reached only a handful of people in the world have the ability to write & play music as Dream Theater can. People don't understand that muscians need to keep on challanging themselves like a racecar driver looking for that perfect lap/race or a golf player that perfect game once you are this level you keep on searching higher and higher. Being a M.I. GIT graduate and studyng music and applying myself to thousand's of hours of practice to achive perfection I completely understand their music. Octavarium is just amazing in it's own way, people need to stop comparing albums, and accept the album for what the artist is trying to express. In only listening to this album 2 times I already like it, which is usually not the case for me. As a muscian I tend to analize everything and takes me time to digest Dream Theater since their music is so complex. I would highly recommend.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|Something must be said about Len Wiseman. He certainly knows what's COOL. From the American Werewolf in Londonish Lycon transformations, to the clashes of metal, to the dark and stylish settings, to the sound of the gunfire on your surround sound, to the phenominal make-up job on Marcus Corvinus, to the swift action-filled tempto, to the violent and bloody deaths and of course casting his hot and cool as hell wife Kate Beckinsale as the Vampire/Something else Selene.<br /><br />UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is an excellent mix of action, horror and Science Fiction, and this time, it doesn't get as bogged down with confusion, Lycon/Vampire history and draggy talky stuff. It does a little bit of the history, but it keeps it in the relevant, necessary and doesn't drag. At least it didn't seem to.<br /><br />I had planned on buying Underworld: Evolution when it came out on DVD even though I thought the original was just okay. Everything is made better by casting Kate Beckinsale and sure, I'm a red-blooded male, but upon watching, was even more pleasantly surprised by my purchase. The movie was sheer entertainment and is gifted with numerous scenes that I think are some of the coolest in recent years.<br /><br />Not to mention, unlike some of the modern day directors like Bay and Emmerich, Wiseman goes over-the-top from time to time, but he keeps it in reality. He keeps it in the realm of the story and doesn't insult our intelligence. In fact, he strokes our intelligence. Despite all the criticism he got for the originals complexity, he came back with some of the same and he earns my respect for it.<br /><br />Excellent movie. One of, if not the, best action film of the year. Which makes me even more excited about the upcoming Wiseman directed DIE HARD 4!

B00005JOE9|5.0|This is a classic film, deserving of all the accolades and none of its critiques. Yes, it thinly criticizes the existing fascist state in America and in effect tells us, \\"See what you're headed for.\\" But it gives us hope that a few brave people can shake the sheep out of their bleating complacency and actually stop letting manufactured false fear be their true dictator. This is a stylish movie with memorable performances and visual imagery, coupled with cracking dialogue and resonating with verve and energy. Conservatives probably shouldn't see it, though, but all Christians should.
B000021YQV|5.0|System set the bar pretty high with their first self titled album. I never thought they would be able to top themselvs, but i was dead wrong. this album sounds alot cleaner then the last one, but it never loses its hard edge. Serj's vocals r absolutle amazing, with great lyrics to boot. You can get in to every song be it fast like prison song, or slow like phsyco. all in all its so good
B000EOTAM6|5.0|I wasn't sure about Charlize, but she pulled it off nicely. They all did.<br /><br />Excellent story (wasn't sure what they'd do with that either), but it was great. ORIGINAL, for one thing. Finding that these days is not easy.<br /><br />And GREAT. A Great Movie. It's the trifecta. If you love Sci-Fi, I don't know what your waiting for...buy it, and fall in love.<br /><br />The cartoon is good too, Intense. But dated a little, and it is anime. So, i's a toss up whether you'll like that series. Personally, I wish more people created cool and wierd entertainment that wasn't trash.<br /><br />NICE GOIN GUYS!!
B0000524CY|5.0|I have been a fan of \\"horror\\" films since I was a young kid. Being fairly young (20 at the time of this review) I didn't have the oppurtunity to see this film when it was on theaters, or even on VHS. <br /> <br />As the newly extended version was released into theaters, I went in expecting the typical Hollywood configuration of blood, guts and perhaps some nudity. What I got was something psychologically penetrating and ultimately far more haunting than any other film in recent memory. <br /> <br />Regan is a tweleve year old girl who has been exhibiting strange behavior, be it seizures or almost schizophrenic like tendencies. As modern medicine fails to provide a solution, her actress mother decides on a different course of action-- an exorcism. <br /> <br />While the characteristics of Regan's possession are indeed frightening, they are not what they seem at first glance. In my opinion, they are clearly an allegory for the emotional unrest faced by the priest who aids her, as his mother is ill and his own faith is begining to be tested as her condition deteriorates. <br /> <br />In the end, he not only faces off against Regan's demonic inhibitor, but also the demons that lie within himself. <br /> <br />This DVD is a very nice job, with picture and sound being sharper and clearer than any other previous addition. The extra footage is a nice touch, though none of it truly changes the plot in any signifcant manner.  <br /> <br />So, if you're ready to see a movie that is truly horrific for its very real undertones, then The Exorcist is most definitely for you. Just don't watch it if you plan to go to sleep right after, because I doubt you will!
0670034711|4.0|The first section of the book, Eat, is the richest and funniest.   <br /> <br />The second section, Pray, is about this poor soul's attempt to find herself on an ashram in India -- meditating, praying, doing yoga.  This section was painful to read -- in the way that bad acting is painful to watch -- because I wanted to slap the writer:  Hey girl, your \\"problems\\" aren't that bad!  Snap out of it!   <br /> <br />In the third section, Love, she mellows out a little more, relaxes in a beautiful setting, and the book is more enjoyable again. <br /> <br />Warning: if you think the Pray section will be about finding God or discovering Christ, you might want to move along.  This lady has her own unique ideas about spirituality -- a sort of catch-all of any religious ideas that appealed to her -- and devout followers of any particular religion might be offended.  I wasn't, but I did think she was a little wacky. <br /> <br />I congratulate her on her happiness in the end, and I envied the generous advance on her book deal that enabled her to take a year off to enjoy and find herself.  If only we all could.

B0000019PA|5.0|When this album was originally released in 1998, many critics saw it in the context of Elephant 6, a loose collective of musicians in Athens, GA that would often collaborate on each other's recording projects.  Bands like the Olivia Tremor Control and the Apples in Stereo, although diverse in their musical tastes, seemed intent on recreating the psychedelic rock of the 60's, only without the radical politics and drug damage.  Critics were so fascinated by E6 that when Neutral Milk Hotel, led by Jeff Mangum, released \\"In The Aeroplane Over the Sea,\\" they saw it as just a product of a collective.  Reading those initial reviews, I dismissed it as just another retro recreation, and figured that since I've heard some of the other bands, I didn't really need this.  I was shocked, then, when in 2004, Magnet magazine named \\"Aeroplane\\" the best album released during its first ten years, ahead of such landmarks as \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"In Utero.\\"  So I picked up a copy with loads of skepticism, almost daring it to impress me.  About 40 minutes after pressing \\"play,\\" I was not only impressed, but shocked speechless.  How could I have ignored this indisputable masterpiece?  How could all of those critics, even the ones who liked it, get it so wrong?  While \\"Aeroplane\\" sounds like there really were a Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, it's also much more than that. One of the definitive E6 albums, it's also Mangum's quirky and deeply personal vision, with the collective backing him up every step of the way.  This surreal stew of sex, death, spirituality, despair and hope is such a singular creation that it can not only change a person's life, it may even save it.  I actually think that if Kurt Cobain had been able to hear it, he would have reconsidered his final decision--\\"Aeroplane\\" embodies the kind of naive brilliance that he so prized.<br /><br />Although Mangum was an obsessive, omniverous music fan, he was able to tap into the core of his psyche and bring it out almost unfiltered.  For all the diverse instrumentation that Mangum and producer Robert Schneider (of the Apples in Stereo) brought in--everything from guitars, organs and horns to singing saw and zanzithophone (!)--his imagery is so personal that I doubt even Mangum hemself gets it all.  Blending the organic (flowers, semen, spine, tongue) with the mechanical (radio wires, pulleys and weights, bombs and, of course, aeroplanes) and even the supernatural (the ghost of Anne Frank), Mangum fashions a disjointed, surreal narrative of sex and death, hope and regret.  The opening of \\"The King of Carrot Flowers part 2\\"  has Mangum singing, in his plaintive, nasal wail of a voice, \\"I love you Jesus Christ...\\"  It's disarming not only because of its clarity, but also its sincerity.  It should be noted, however, that while Mangum is truly faithful, his approach to Jesus is his alone, not the scary brand of fundamentalism that's run rampant in this country.  Even a proud atheist like yours truly can sing along unashamed.  What it all means is anyone's guess, but the wonder of \\"Aeroplane\\" is that its mysteries don't need to be solved in order to resonate.  When the devastating, emotional ballad \\"Oh Comely\\" transitions, with the help of Mangum's patented fuzz bass, to the soaring opening of \\"Ghost,\\" you can practically feel Mangum's fingers tickling your spine, and a wave of goosebumps is inevitable.  This is an album to be felt as much as understood, and anyone who can't invest themselves in it are likely to be mystified and even repelled.<br /><br />Many naysayers center their complaints around Mangum's voice, which is definitely not the polished product that even some rock fans seem to demand.  This, of course, didn't hurt Bob Dylan or Tom Waits, and Mangum more than makes up for his lack of technical skill with sheer emotional nakedness.  Likewise, his accoustic guitar playing is shaky and too loud, and that is part of its hppnotic power.  Many casual listeners will want to stick with the processed, hermetically sealed paste that so much of pop aspires to.  If you value honesty over comfort, however, you may find \\"Aeroplane\\" to be transcendent.  Some fans of the album, myself included, will only listen to it in one uninterrupted sitting with no other distractions for its entire running time.  This may seem obsessive--okay, it's definitely obsessive--but a work of this power demands nothing less than your full attention.<br /><br />As of this writing, it seems likely that Mangum himself was similarly overwhelmed.  He hasn't recorded any original music of his since this album's release, and he seems content with that.  Those who want to delve further into this mystery will want to read Kim Cooper's invaluable book about the making of the album (also titled \\"In The Aeroplane Over the Sea\\"), which offers some surprising answers.  It still retains the overall wonder of the album, though.  If all this seems a little too much like a cult, not to worry.  Independent thinking will only enhance the enjoyment. so you won't need to turn off your mind to \\"get it.\\"  In fact, all you need to \\"get it\\" is some spare money, but believe me, you'll be rewarded many times over.d, hermetically sealed paste that so much of pop aspires to.

B000ESSTKQ|5.0|Depeche Mode's first album, Speak & Spell, is here now in remastered format and has warmer synths, crisper vocals, and fatter drums that brings the futurist\synth-pop classic to the 21st century. Several tracks that stand out are Photographic, Nodisco, New Life (Presented here in the original version and not the remix like on previous US versions of Speak & Spell), and Just Can't Get Enough, but all in all the entire album sounds great. The second disc, a DVD which includes a 5.1 version of the album, b-sides from the singles from the album, and a 30 minute documentary with rare footage of the band and interviews with everyone from Vince Clarke to Daniel Miller. <br /> <br />There is no reason to give this album bad reviews based on minor techinal details. The songs are great like before and the album sounds better than it ever has. Well worth it to fans of Depeche Mode.
630469654X|2.0|<br />Unlike many, I hadn't seen this film when it first came out.  So it was with much anticipation that I recently sat down to watch it.  Well, it stunk.  What a disappointment.  The only really good thing in there is Leo McKern, who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue.  Show 'em how it's done, Leo.   <br /> <br />Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful to look at, but her role is limited.  Matthew Broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career, and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever, which hampers the film, since his character is supposed to be a quick-witted thief.  Fortunately, he has come a long way as an actor since then.  Rutger Hauer is just plain bad. <br /> <br />In defense of the director and crew, the film is prettily shot (with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene) in well lit, scenic locations. <br /> <br />Otherwise, I would not recommend this film to anyone with expectations. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I'm not the biggest AFI fan I got into them when they hit the mainstream with The Art Of Drowning, so to me their best song is Morning Star. Now on this album they didn't change alot, but they changed enough to notice, having gone back to older AFI eventually, I knew where they came from and it was a long way from black sails, This album is loaded with emotion and energy, and the only place it's lacking is in the bass work, it has quite a few electonic elements to it and some songs sound like it's Nine Inch Nails trying to do a pop punk song, but overall you can hear ever influence the band has had over the years, I'd highly reccomend this album if you're a fan of everything after The Art Of Drowning.
0060512806|4.0|After reading Snow Crash, I decided on Cryptonomicon as my second Stephenson book to read.  This is the story mainly of a young, upcoming math-computer genius who falls into crypto during WWII and his grandson, who is a current day computer \\"hacker\\" trying to establish a new business.  These two main characters, as well as several other major characters, are tied together over time through information, fate, and the effects of past events.  The weaving of the two story lines from WWII and the present day made me want to keep reading, day in and day out, and I enjoyed each reveal of a link between the two; it was rewarding and exciting.  I found the plot as a whole to be fulfilling, even if others found it to be too weak, detail- or math-oriented, or lacking character development.  I do fall in the crowd, though, of people who wish the ending was a bit improved, only because the bulk of the novel was such fun to read.  The novel is very well-imagined, creative, well-written, and original.  I recommend it for those who in general like WWII-related stories (e.g. Catch-22) or crypto math, obviously, but it's also interesting and entertaining if you know nothing about these things.
B000002KCC|4.0|When Neil Young recorded this album, he was pissed off. Why? Lots of reasons. Two close friends of his (Roadie Bruce Berry and rhythm guitarist Danny Whitten) had recently OD'd on heroin. Thanks to the Harvest LP, he was on the road to stardom as a soft country-rocker along the lines of (GASP) the Eagles. His recent albums (Time Fades Away and On the Beach) gained hostile reviews from critics looking for another Harvest. And his record company rejected this album's first release, so he put out On the Beach instead. In other words, he was in \\"The Ditch\\", meeting more interesting people and making better records.<br />This album's title cut is among the most haunting ballads in history and is among his best tracks ever. It's basically an obituary to Berry, as  you can tell from the opening lines. (\\"Bruce Berry was a workin' man...\\"). Next up is Speakin' Out, a barroom rocker with some paranoid, anti-drug lyrics. World on a String is Neil railling against his newfound fame as a sappy singer-songwriter (another common theme on this album). Up next we have Borrowed Tune, which cops Lady Jane's melody. (As Neil sings, \\"I'm singin' this Borrowed Tune/I took from the Rolling Stones\\"). I love Lady Jane's melody, and it's great to hear the song without Mick Jagger's over-the-top vocals. As usual, it's anti-drug - Neil blames the reason of borrowing the melody because he was \\"too wasted to write\\".<br />The album's second half is a bit weaker than the first, though no song is bad I very rarely listen to Mellow My Mind, Albequrque, New Mama or Roll Another Number. But there are exceptions, such as the murder mystery Tired Eyes, Lookout Joe and the reprise of Tonight's the Night.<br />This is one of Neil's best records. Just because it wasn't as popular as Harvest doesn't make it worse. On the contrary, it's leagues better.
B000FQJAIM|5.0|I sit here in complete and utter shock, not because Lucas finally gave in and is releasing the original theatrical versions but because people are still finding stuff to [...] and moan about.<br /><br />I for one have nothing but utter respect for George Lucas. I am a photographer and fellow artist and have nothing but respect for peoples artistic stances and opinions. I dont have even one ounce of contempt for this man. He had the desire to go back and make his pictures better in terms of special effects and he did. Because of this people bashed him like he was the 2nd coming of Lucifer. As if the public somehow owned the rights to these pictures now and the fact that he was tinkering with them was a sin beyond all other sins. He had the artistic integrity to stand by his work even when the majaority of the fan base was screaming bloody murder, he stood by his work.<br /><br />I for one knew that he would eventually release the original theatrical cuts, not because he has abandonded his artistic integrity but because it was the right thing to do both for the fans and for his company. This is what everyone has been screaming for for the last 8 years incuding the people who run Lucasarts Inc. They stand to make a great sum of money by releasing these again and I dont blame them for doing it. This is not some cheap double dip that we see every week by Fox and every other studio out there these days. This isnt a super cool edition, a super duper extreme edition, an ultimate edition or anything like that. This is quite simply what everyone has been asking for.<br /><br />So my hats off to Lucas. Star Wars has definitly come full cirlce now and this release will satisfy every last Star Wars fan out there. I loved the original editions and I loved the remastered editions as well. I just have too much respect for these movies and Lucas to let a couple changes that he desired to make have any effect on my overall view of him and this series.<br /><br />As for the people still complaining, I guess no matter what you do these days some people will just be ignorant and complain. Its obvious that no matter what Lucas does your just going to [...] some more. Dont get me wrong, I am against double dipping like no other and have repurchased countless DVD's due to some studios pathetic marketing techniques. I however do not even begin to group Lucas in with these other studios and will happily plop down another 40-70$ to get the original Star Wars saga on DVD and will happily do it again when they are released onto HD-DVD.<br /><br />So to bring this thread to an end, congrats George!! This really is like Star Wars coming full cirlce and what an amazing circle it has been. Now when are those HD-DVD's coming out!!!<br /><br />MN....r what you do these days some people will just be ignorant and complain.

B000B5IPDI|5.0|This is, indeed, a magical, mystical movie about fathers and sons, which is based upon the book \\"Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions\\" by Daniel Wallace. The book is a perfect vehicle for Director Tim Burton's signature melange of reality and fantasy. The story is that of a father and his son, their estrangement, and their eventual reconciliation. It is a beautifully realized film that will bring tears to one's eyes.<br /><br />The father in question is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) who loves to tell, at least it seems so to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), tall tales about his past. The son becomes estranged from his father on his wedding day, when his father tells one tall tale too many for Will's tastes. For the next several years, Will communicates only with his mother, Sandra (Jessica Lange).<br /><br />When his father becomes seriously ill, however, Will and his wife rush to his side. Father and son take final stock of each other, and the seemingly tall tales continue. As his father gets progressively worse, Will, feeling that he really does not know his father, embarks on a journey to discover for himself, once and for all, the man his father really is. What he discovers is that his father was not so off the mark with his stories, and he finally begins to appreciate who his father really is and the impact that he has had on others. It allows Will to be able to say goodbye to his father in a way that his father understands and to be at peace with the man whom he discovered his father to be .<br /><br />The film takes the viewer on a ride through some of Ed Bloom's tall tales, in a series of vignettes, where the viewer sees a young Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor) living an almost fantastical life. We see him meet the love of his life, Sandra, as a young girl (Alison Lohman). We see him as a circus worker, a soldier, a traveling salesman, and even a bank robber. We see some of the people that cross section his life: a giant, a diminutive ringmaster, a witch, singing Siamese twins, and a bank robber. Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.<br /><br />This is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"The Princess Bride\\". Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange. Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable. Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order. Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.<br /><br />Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is. Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of the senior Dr. Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work. The direction, however, is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant. This is an absolutely exceptional film. I really enjoyed it immensely, even though I initially viewed this film most reluctantly, and only after much persuasion by my son. I am certainly glad that I did. This film has made me a fan of Tim Burton. It is filmmaking at its best. Bravo!twins, and a bank robber.

B000BFH2S2|5.0|I have been a fan since the beginning and I LOVE the DVD that came with this CD.  I have never seen a performance live, but now I can't wait to see him.  He is adorable...and funny...and cute...and smart...and cute...and SOOO talented...and did I mention cute?  His voice is wonderful and I actually find myself enjoying many of his versions more than the original standard performers.  His music is in quite a few movies and many have heard him and not realized it was a young, fairly new singer, thinking it was one of the oldies instead.  If you are a standards fan, you won't be disappointed.
B00020JQ7G|5.0|My daughter, who had seen this film and loved it, suggested that we watch it together. I agreed and was very glad I did so, as I really enjoyed this bittersweet film. It is a well-acted, well-directed effort about a free-thinking art history professor, Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), who in the nineteen fifties, lacking Ivy League credentials, manages, through a twist of fate, to get a berth as a professor at traditional and conservative Wellesley College. It is here that she hopes to find herself instructing the leaders of tomorrow.<br /><br />What she finds, instead, is a group of highly intelligent, young women, who are more interested in marrying the leaders of tomorrow than in being leaders themselves. Ms. Watson succeeds in opening the minds of her students to the possibilities and choices life can offer and learns a little about such possibilities and choices herself. She also finds friendship and romance while at Wellesley College. The film also focuses on four of her students, all of whom are given stellar portrayals by the young actresses playing them.<br /><br />Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is the quintessential fifties girl, obsessed with getting her Mrs. before getting her BA. She later discovers that one should be careful for what one wishes. She is also a nasty piece of work who doesn't care what misery for others her poison pen invectives and barbed comments cause. She eventually gets her comeuppance in a way that she never envisioned. Her best friend, Joan Brandwyn (Julia Styles), is a beautiful, highly intelligent, young woman who harbors a secret wish to become a lawyer. Yet, at the same time, she desperately wants to become a wife and mother. Hers is a decision between choices. She ultimately makes a choice that causes Ms. Watson some consternation but with which she is happy. Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young Jewish miss in a WASP environment who finds herself having short term affairs with her hunky professor and with an older, married man. Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a pleasingly plump, pretty cellist who finds true love, only to find it derailed by the ever evil Betty.<br /><br />Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant in the supporting role of Nancy Abbey, Wellesley College's professor of etiquette and deportment, who, one discovers, has not always followed her own staid advice. Noted British actress, Juliet Stevenson, is outstanding in the small role of Amanda Armstrong, the college nurse and closet lesbian, who is still mourning the loss of her companion of many years. Marian Seldes is perfectly cast as President Jocelyn Carr, whose role at the college seems to be that of keeping the well-heeled alumni and trustees of Wellesley College happy with the status quo. Donna Mitchell turns in a stunning performance as Betty's self-absorbed mother, a woman who is a slave to the expected and puts appearances before her daughter's happiness. Julia Roberts is luminous as the role of Katherine Watson, infusing it with an intelligence and natural warmth that radiates off the screen. Though she has a little bit too contemporary an edge, she still manages to carry the day in the role of the forward thinking professor with the Mona Lisa smile.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful, highly enjoyable film in which the social mores and style of the nineteen fifties are well depicted.older, married man.

B00005B36H|5.0|... this album is a masterpiece. They really cranked the experimental and conceptual knobs to 11 this time, and it still works. Had you asked me 5 years ago, I would have given it a 3, but, like all progressivly amazing music, time reveals the true value of the music.
0345475674|4.0|I went through this book quickly. This book is an interesting and compelling work of historical fiction. The book opens in the days leading up to the great eruption. Marcus Attilius has been dispatched from Rome as the new \\"Aquarius\\" or chief engineer of the elaborate aqueduct system that moves fresh water along from town to town. The previous Aquarius has mysteriously vanished. Attilius soon finds impurities in the water that fortell of something ominous. He immediately runs into troubles when he encounters Ampliatus, one of Pompeii's wealthiest citizens and a man prone to immense cruelties.       The book, without being too overweighted with historical dialog, is  a facinating look at what Roman society was like. Attilius is a sympathetic and down to earth character amidst the backdrop of a Roman empire ruled by self indulgent and corrupt leaders. The Romans had brilliant engineers who designed and built this advanced aqueduct as well as powerful citizens who diverted and sqaundered this precious resource for their elaborate pools and fish ponds, even while the lower class goes thirsty. This book is reminscent of James Cameron's Titanic movie. This book and that movie both introduced compelling fictional characters who were caught up in the middle of a real and famous tragedy. Even though we know how it will end we still find it compelling. This fast paced book is a great read for the beach.
B000000993|4.0|On it's own merit, Undertow is a great album. It went places few bands had ever gone. Without rehashing the reasons this album is great, I will say that the unrelenting sound is somewhat numbing by the end of the album. Later releases would incorporate the ambient sounds needed to allow ideas/concepts to fully bloom, disorientation to creep in, and allow the albums to breath more. Still a great album though...
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Here is a letter from Lucasfilm concerning their position about the unaltered trilogy: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Lynne Hale (publicity@lucasfilm.com) wrote:  <br /> <br />I wanted you to know how much we appreciate the passion and enthusiasm you have for Star Wars, and thank you for sharing your concerns about our upcoming DVD release.  <br /> <br />The DVDs being released in September will contain two versions of Star Wars: Episodes IV, V and VI - the Special Editions (which represent George's vision of the movies) and the first versions, which will be included as bonus material. We hoped that releasing those \\"original\\" movies on a bonus disc would be a way to have some additional fun with the debut of the movies as individual DVDs. We certainly did not want it to become a source of concern or frustration for any of our fans.  <br /> <br />As you may know, an enormous amount of effort was put into digitally restoring the negatives for the Special Editions. In one scene alone, nearly 1 million pieces of dirt had to be removed, and the Special Editions were created through a frame-by-frame digital restoration. The negatives of the movies were permanently altered for the creation of the Special Editions, and existing prints of the first versions are in poor condition.  <br /> <br />So many fans have requested the original movies, we wanted to find a way to bring them to you. But since these movies do not represent George's artistic vision, we could not put the extraordinary time and resources into this project as we did with the Special Editions. The 1993 Laserdisc masters represented the best source for providing the original versions as DVD bonus material. Although these are non-anamorphic versions, they do preserve the original widescreen composition of the movies.  <br /> <br />We want you to be aware that we have no plans - now or in the future - to restore the earlier versions.  <br /> <br />We hope you will understand our decision and, again, want to let you know how much we appreciate your interest and enthusiasm.  <br /> <br />Sincerely,  <br />Lynne Hale  <br />publicity@lucasfilm.com
B00000099Y|5.0|This album blows their previous work out of the water. A fully realized collection of amazing songs/art pieces. I'm not gonna play the comparison game, that's not how to review albums.

0553802534|5.0|Alone was captivating, immediately drawing me in to Bobby Dodge's work as a police sniper in a hostage situation, then keeping me with Dodge as he dealt with the aftermath of his actions.   The author ties several plotlines together - the investigations into Dodge's actions, the pedophile who kidnapped Catherine decades earlier, and the conflict between Catherine and her in-laws who are fighting for custody of Catherine's child.  That these seemingly unrelated stories are so well linked is a testament to the author's skill.  I can't wait to read the author's next novel.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|The adaptation of Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is one of the most unique films of its kind. It's a thrilling adventure story, but also has deeper themes of spirituality and Church conspiracy. As Ron Howard put it, the film is essentially a \\"grail quest.\\" All these elements gave Oscar-nominated composer Hans Zimmer a challenge: to compose music for a film that acts both as a thriller and a spiritual journey.<br /><br />Once again, Zimmer rose to the challenge, and has written an awe-inspiring score for \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" It has all the elements of a thriller, an epic, and full of spiritual wonder. The score is exciting and emotional at times.<br /><br />There are several standout pieces on this CD, but the best piece is track 13, Chevaliers de Sangreal. It's a very stirring piece of music, filled with wonder and emotion. I listen to that piece more than any other. The other highlights include: Dies Mercurii I Martius, Ssalvete Virgines, and Kyrie For The Magdalene.<br /><br />This is a brillantly-crafted score that ranks very high on Zimmer's list of scores!

A tiny consolation is the movie, 'Serenity' which wraps up the TV series and demonstrates that the Firefly universe was as broad and deep and rich as any other series... and we missed out because - for some incomprehendible reason - the networks cancelled the show!<br /><br />It had all the promise of Buffy but with wider appeal. Adventure, humour, thriller, mystery, romance and horror set in the future, with all the grit and grim of today's world. Brilliant acting, fun characters with depth and credibility, stimulating story lines, evocative sets and a horribly catchy introduction tune.
B000007S5B|1.0|I was Doors fan in the 1980s. I liked their debut, Strange Days, LA Woman, Morrison Hotel etc. But when I brought this album home (on vinyl no less) and played it, I was speechless. It was terrible.  Gone was the old slightly menacing Doors and here was the middle of the road lounge act Doors. The change from dark  and mysterious to sugar coated twee was shocking. The electric organ now sounded horrible, they were already rehashing Break On Through and they seemingly had forgotten how to get their instruments in harmony with each other. And they totally ripped off The Kinks with Hello I Love You. I initially thought that maybe I was just not in a receptive mood for the music so I gave it a rest and came back to it a few days later. It still sounded dreadful. I've listened to this album a fair amount in the intervening  20 years and I *still* think it's one of the worst albums ever made.  <br /> <br />Forget St Anger, Van Halen III or other \\"infamous\\" albums. Waiting For The Sun is truly the worst album by a major band!
0780020685|5.0|This film is one of the best films I've ever seen . It is in subtitles , however you don't mind them ... the film is so good and the acting doesn't even need sound for the viewer to injoy this masterpeace .<br /><br />IF I COULD GIVE IT 10 STARS , I'D ASK AMAZON FOR 90 MORE !
B00005JNRY|5.0|So, will this make Pixar's run of excellent films seven for seven? Undoubtably. <br />Early signs however were not good. Although the release date was moved from last fall to this summer (not usually a good omen) this seems to have been more a desire for the makers to 'polish the chrome' even more than it already was. With Pixar having such a strong reputation, they needn't rush out their product to compete in the now almost saturated market. <br />Other bad vibes came in the form of the trailers. The teaser was pretty poor, not anything like the great ones for Monsters Inc or The Incredibles (excluding visuals which were enough to get most of our motors revving). Then the first theatrical trailer seemed to pitch the film squarely at 'motor-heads' with some pretty obscure car-based references. <br />Of all of Pixar's films so far, this probably has the least universal appeal, at least on the face of it. I doubt whether many little girls will want to rush and see it (I may be being a little sexist here and I apologise) but this may be made up for with the amount of grown-men that will surely queue around the block. <br />From here on, Pixar are now part of Disney instead of partnered with them and I sincerely hope that Pixar's knowledge rubs off onto Disney's flagging animation department.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|Personally i liked this album a lot better than music of the sun. I thought it was a huge step. I mean Music of the Sun had Pon De Replay, but it was lacking other hit songs. This album instead had loads of solid songs, such as the infectious S.O.S. and unfaithful. Really really good song~ very impressed really. I mean some people say she did too much ballads on this album, but i personally think that the ballads on this album are very quality~

B0002IU988|5.0|This music pretty much sounds exactly like creed (i'm a big creed fan) but differen't singer and way better guitar.  for those of you who thought mark tremonti sucked (hahaha at you)...well take a listen to this cd and you will immediately think differently.
B00005JNRY|5.0|Pixar's animation studio has not only been the go-to studio to continuely raise the bar for CG animation, but PIXAR pretty much created the bar itself. One reoccurring negative in their reel reign (aside from their contractual obligations and burden of partnership w/ DISNEY) was those darn humans. From Andy and his family to the very stylized characters of their last outstanding outing \\"The Incredibles\\" those probamatic people seem to be holding the studio back from the Zen of true animated perfection. The award-winning \\"Finding Nemo\\" has Spartan servings of those CGI simians and \\"A Bug's Life\\" none at all. So now with \\"CARS\\" Pixar has not only eliminated the humans, but also the human form. Sure the cars in CARS are anthropomorphized, that's a given, otherwise it's a HERBIE movie or Knight Rider without the Hasslehoff. This project is more akin to the claymation CHEVRON commercials of the 90's from AARDMAN ANIMATIONS. The imagery is hard to shake, but maybe that's a plus, not a minus, `cause most of us loved those guys and, I think, most of us will love these guys too.<br /><br />Pixar has outdone itself again with this one, the animation is flawless, the opening of the movie immerses us in the NASCAR-like track series: Dinoco's \\"Piston Cup (Dinoco a Toy Story reference, as is the tires and the blimps, they're \\"Lightyears\\" of course) in a world where cars are both cars and people. The graphics at the race are absolute perfection, slamming the screen with racing commentary, stats and glitter. The race itself looks as if it were filmed for IMAX, beautiful!! Accept cars just can't bend and move like that, let alone emote and express the seemingly limitless range of expressions and attitudes these car can. Pixar has really outdone themselves!<br /><br />The story is the only thing that isn't exceptional about the movie, it is archetypical racing fare. The young \\"oh-too-full-of-himself rookie\\" LIGHTNING MCQUEEN (voice perfectly by Owen Wilson) has a hard lesson to learn about treating others and that he really does need friends. Already at the films opening, his disregard for others nearly costs him the race, but he manages a tie, a three-way-tie with CHICK HICKS, a ruthless competitor and The King, a racing legend (voiced by real legend Richard Petty). Immediately ignoring advise from the King that would have saved him a lot of trouble, enroute to the tie-breaker for the Cup Lightning loses his way finding himself in the town of Radiator Springs, and in trouble. While repairing the road-damage he caused he meets an ensemble of unlikely, yet inevitable friends who teach him the lessons he so desperately needs. (Tow-)Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's best friend, Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) is a Porshe who charms Lightning, then there's Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman). Doc, serves as Radiator Springs doctor (mechanic), Judge, and he also serves as Lightning's archetypical mentor. The old 1951 Hudson Hornet who was a famous 3 time-Cup winner himself gives Lightning McQueen more than just advise, he gives the rookie racer an insight into the real spirit of racing and a Shakespearean themed notion of how to remain true to yourself. Everntually McQueen makes it to his Tie-breaker, but his heart isn't in it without his new friends. I won't tell you who wins the cup or how, but true to the archetype, McQueen's mentor shows up to guide him  through the race. This clich is not only one we've seen before in the race genre, but as recently as this year in Disney's Herbie Fully-Loaded. That's okay it still has solid impact just this one more time.<br /><br />Pixar's voice-casting as always is top-notch, Owen Wilson is the quintessential hotshot, I mean it is his bread & butter in front of the camera. Larry \\"TCG\\"  as Mater is his classic good ol' boy that keeps him in flannels. Paul Newman as Doc, what a terrific and moving job the 79 yea old does, bringing so much to such a small part, amazing! Also superb comic characterizations from Tony Shalhoub (Monk) as the Italian tire-shop owner and Fiat 500 and classic George Carlin as a classic VW burned out hippie van. And YES! John Ratzenburger is in CARS! The Pixar \\"good luck charm\\" himself John Ratzenburger, who voices a character in ALL of the Pixar/Disney releases in back in this one too as Mack! If you sit through the credits, as always with Pixar, you will get a treat, this time specifically poking fun a past works and the actor. Also, bless you Pixar for getting the \\"CAR TALK\\" brothers \\"Click & Clack\\" on board, they so needed to advice us not to \\"drive like my brother.\\" Great!<br /><br />Cars is the first feature since TOY STORY 2 to have co-founder / executive producer John Lasseter direct and it isn't a disappointment. This may be Pixar's best work to date; it is definitely the best film so far of the summer of '06.  The only weak link here is the obligatory sentimental music montage, that each of Lasseter's works have. This one tells or rather shows the story of how Radiator Springs fell by the wayside off route 66, maybe little too awkwardly setting up Sally's desire to see the town returned to its former glory, which an hour and 55 minutes later, it is. The music there and overall, could be stronger, lots of road refs, okay but that's really my only complaint. I still say, go take a second lap, you'll need to see it twice, in order to catch all the little jokes.rb comic characterizations from Tony Shalhoub (Monk) as the Italian tire-shop owner and Fiat 500 and classic George Carlin as a classic VW burned out hippie van.

B000093BDX|5.0|The Beach Boys are a classic American group who sing music about classic American things; cars, girls, suntans, school etc...Songs such as \\"Do you want to dance\\", \\"Surfer Girl\\" and \\"Be True to your School\\" are all examples of classic Beach Boy songs. This is a great CD because, even though there are too many Beach Boy's greatest hits albums to count, this particular one has their greatest songs from the beginning of their career in 1962 until the end of their span of hits in 1988. All thirty hits on the album were at one time on the Billboards top 40 countdown. <br />I being a Beach Boys fan for my entire life can remember listening to songs such as \\"Kokomo\\" and \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" with my older sister in the mid 80's, so listening to this CD brings back fond memories of being a child. Not only is this CD a favorite of mine due to the fact that I've always been exposed, but it is simply a fun CD. The Beach Boys are a group who sings about fun things, good times, parties and being young. This is definately an album I play to lift my spirits.  <br />The music is typically Beach Boys, and nothing but, which is what makes it fabulous. Alot of the songs are in mono, but it does not take away from the distinct Beach Boys sound. <br />My favorite song on the album is \\"Kokomo\\", it is and always will be my favorite Beach Boys song, it's a feel good no worries type of song. My second favorite song would either be \\"In my room\\" or \\"GOd only knows\\" which are both songs that are slower and not quite as typical as other songs on the album <br />The only other group that could ever be compared to the Beach Boys is Jan & Dean who predated the Beach Boys but were only made widely famous for their \\"surfer\\" sound after the Beach Boys became popular themselves. But in my opinion the Beach Boys are the best. <br />Overall this is an awesome Beach Boys compilation, and I can't imagine there being a better one. If you're a casual Beach Boy's fan or an avid long time fan you'll love the 30 songs chosen for this particular album.
1592401791|2.0|I like the insight that Geoff brings to the actual recording of many of the Beatle's albums.  However, he makes George out to be a hack musician and not much of human being to boot.  He also gives himself enough credit to perhaps make you wonder why EMI never built a statue of him in front of the Abbey Road studio.  I think the book is overall a good read for any Beatle enthusiast, but Geoff would have done himself so much more good to not make George Harrison, Ringo, and often George Martin look average.  ...of course he has an undying love for Sir Paul!
B000EMGAGW|5.0|what more can i say i love it i like the whole dammm album don't sleep
B0007Y08QA|5.0|It's always a bit saddening when I take notice of an actor who has dedicated himself to a character that will never be fully appreciated during its time.  Christian Bale will most likely never receive all the praise he's rightfully earned for committing to this film.  As far as slimming down for a movie role goes, Mr. Bale's 63-pound weight loss makes Tom Hank's transformation for `Cast Away' seem like a joke.   <br /> <br />What really is a joke though, are movie stars nowadays, thinking they can get away with substituting dedication for their celebrity status, such as Nicole Kidman who demanded to wear a wig for the ineffectively languid film `Birth' (Guess she figured the prosthetic nose she wore in `The Hours' gave her some leeway.  Guess again, Nicole!)  Moviegoers are not that easily appeased.  What ever happened to actors trying to fit the role; like Sigourney Weaver's shiny bald head in `Aliens III'? <br /> <br />But \\"The Machinist\\" has much more to offer than just the main protagonist's rather unpleasant caricature of a holocaust victim.  It's frightfully moving in the daunting peculiar sense, which director Brad Anderson accomplishes so mindfully.  In his previous work, Anderson puts to good use this alarming kind of raw visual style, as with \\"Session 9\\", that adds a certain slow and off-kilter presence to every scene.  But it's more so the symbolic nature and visual style of this movie that really gives it its value.  <br /> <br />Christian Bale gives an openly remarkable performance as a repressed, anorexic, insomniac.  I never truly appreciated Bale as an actor until I viewed this film.  He's very gifted at what he does and the utter devotion to his character, Trevor Reznik, is intensely apparent.  Listening to Anderson's commentary on the DVD, I learned that he did not ask Bale to lose so much weight for the film however, Bale took it upon himself to transform his body to what the script described as a \\"skeleton of a man\\".   <br /> <br />The film's opening is just as intriguing as its end.  Ironically, we are lured to this Reznik character knowing so little about him and why he's plagued by symptoms of OCD, such as washing his hands with bleach and self-emaciation.  But the actor's unsightly appearance and intrepid performance is just merely the icing on Anderson's cake.  From a screenplay by Scott Kosar (`The Amityville Horror' and `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'), comes a brilliantly told story with an original plot that's chillingly unpredictable.   <br /> <br />Having not slept for a year, Trevor's mind and body begins to deteriorate before our eyes as he dispels concern from his co-workers at the machine factory and from Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a dreary prostitute whom Trevor unburdens himself to.  \\"If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist,\\" she tells him.  But soon Trevor's paranoia builds to the point of sheer desperation and you find yourself actually sympathizing for this character, particularly when his distraction in the workplace inadvertently causes a co-worker, Miller (Michael Ironside), to violently lose a limb in the drill press.   <br /> <br />Anderson does a remarkable job at this: keeping the audience focused and motivated to understand the perils of each character while captivating you with desaturated tones of greenish blue and dashes of red.  And it is this vibrant red that's underscored by a sinister outsider, named Ivan (John Sharian), taunting Trevor with perilous car chases and a brusque disposition.  Not to mention the mysterious Post-its Trevor finds stuck to his refrigerator sporting a game of Hangman.   <br /> <br />With notable literary references to Dostoevsky and a recurring scene of Trevor vigorously scrubbing his hands with bleach is suggestive of Shakespeare's \\"Lady Macbeth\\".  All this is accompanied by Roque Baños's unsparing use of the theremin for the music score which evokes a Hitchcockian, `Twighlight Zone' feel to the picture.  <br /> <br />Midway through the filmI somewhat expected it to end with another hackneyed dual personality revelation.  Instead, the denouement is much more fervently paced and realistic.  \\"The Machinist\\" is undeniably Hitchcock inspired and definitely not for those who enjoy the simplicity of the movie-going experience.  Nonetheless, it's a disturbingly edgy psychological thriller and Anderson doesn't let you up for air until the very end.    <br />
B000FFJ85I|1.0|If you like any other AFI songs/cds that are not \\"Miss Murder\\", this album is not for you.  Lovers of \\"Art of Drowning\\", \\"Black Sails\\" and \\"All Hallows\\" will be extremely dissapointed.  AFI has progressed from the dark rock sounds of \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" to the incredibly cheesy tracks of Decemberunderground.  This cd is full of Fall out boy-esque garbage the likes of which Newfound Glory wouldn't even listen to.  If you want music with an edge, go buy any All Hallows or Art of Drowning.  This cd is rubbish.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Matrix reloaded is a brilliant film. I'm hearing alot of bad reports about it and its pi***ng me off because its a brilliant film. The film is about NEO (Keanu Reeves) must complete the prophecy that Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) believes in to save the world. The effects, martial arts, action and stunt scenes in this film are amazing. Whenever he has to fight all the agent smiths is a pretty cool scene. Whenever the film starts off with trinity jumping off a bike in mid air and sending the bike into a security hut and then the security hut explodes the film has you completely hooked! <br />The freeway scene in this film has you absolutely gob smacked! Whenever neo has to talk to the architect this part of the film is a real brain teaser. The explosions in this film are quality. I think that reloaded is as good as the first film. A lot of people would disagree with me because alot of people I know that have seen this either don't like it or just thinks its ok. Well I think its brilliant and I definitely recommend it.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|ok, ever since hearing the cd, i imagined the backlash they would get from the so called purists. this is NOT the AFI from previous works. this is not even sing the sorrow AFI. this is Decemberunderground AFI. and if you don't like it, fine. but after the transition from black sails to sing the sorrow, you had to see it coming. what else could you have been expecting? a sudden return to their 7' roots? Of course not. they have progressed, and this is pretty much exactly what I expected, with the exception of 37mm. But to truly appreciate this cd, you have to put on some headphones, lay back, and listen. This cd isn't the punk attitude extravaganza that they were. This cd is all about the subtleties. and if you listen carefully, the subtleties are brilliant.    prelude 12/21-5/5  if this wasn't AFI, no one would be saying anything about this being their worst cd opener. if you take this song, minus the AFI tag, it's a great opener. nice lyrics, nice choral arrangement, and just beautifully written.    Kill Caustic-5/5  people are giving this song [...] for being too harsh and the vocals not fitting the song. ummm...are you not listening to the lyrics? \\"love these screams, like I do\\" seriously. This one of my favorite songs on the cd.    Miss Murder-5/5  yup, i'm giving the radio song a perfect rating. why? because aside from the chanted 'hey!'s and the simplistic progression, this song is great. The Green Day comparison's are only relevant in those two afforementioned parts. it changes numerous times. musically, both versus are played completely different, adding a different yet familiar sound to both. the bridge is unexpected the first time you hear it, and the screams are perfectly positioned.     Summer Shudder-4/5  a strong song. the chorus gets stuck in your head, and will stay with you. minus points for the keypad solo in the middle. seriously. why not a guitar solo or something. despite that, it's very nicely put together.    The Interview-4/5  a very interesting and melodic song. nice background vocals. lyrically, one of the better efforts, and again, take this song and release it under a different name, a no one would complain.     Love Like Winter-5/5  This song has also one of the top two or three lyrical efforts on the cd. It does have an 80's feel to it. But it's still got the undeniable AFI touch. Well, the NEW AfI.    Affliction-5/5  one of the faster songs on the cd. Great guitar work by Jade. One of my favorite musical performaces on the cd. You just never can predict what he's going to do.     The Missing Frame-4/5  yeah, this one is pretty 80's as well. but still extremely catchy. if it actually came out in the 80's, it would have been a classic new wave type song.     Kiss and Control-5/5  Another one of my absolute favorites. If you don't like this song, then you really shouldn't have bought the cd. Great performances by everyone. Beautiful lyrics, and even some spoken word verse that builds in intensity until Davey is screaming, in the bridge. Perfectly put together.    The Killing Lights-4/5  This seems like a strong candidate for a second single. Not as adventurous as the rest of the cd, so i wouldn't be entirely suprised if it's a choice for 3rd or 4th single. Still a solid song nonetheless.    37mm-3/5  my only complaint really with the cd was this song. a little TOO far away from anything they have done. Sounds like somone was listening to a lot of NIN. Very industrial. daring, but not my taste.    Endlessly, She Said-5/5  Along with Kill Caustic and Kiss and Control, my favorites of the cd would HAVE to include this. A beautiful and perfectly put together effort. Again, if you can't like this, then you won't like AFI in their new form. I can't stress enough the brilliance of this song.     One thing that listeners who give the cd a chance will notice is that the a lot of the guitar and vocal lines seem like they were written and performed with GREAT thought put into it. listen to Kiss and Control, Kill Caustic, and Endlessly, She Said for Jade's guitar lines. subtle yet very nice differences are added all over the song. I think he has become one of the most unique and talented songwriters and guitar players out. Not technically a beast, but in just imagination and performance, some very nice touches.     For those with an open mind, and liked sing the sorrow, i highly recommend it. For those who want old AFI back, skip it. but either way, don't go into this cd with any true expectations of anything they have written before. this breaks new ground for this band.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The original record breaking Matrix a few years back set my pulse racing. We had an action film, with a great backstory. We also had many hidden depths to the plot and narrative structure, and we had two directors who were happy to let you unravel their ideas all by yourself. <br />The films are open to polysemic interpretations, and that is what makes the Matrix trilogy and philosophy so beautiful. The Matrix Reloaded improved on the original in many ways, and this film improves on them both. <br /> <br />We take a step up in many new camera techniques, and we have a few technological advances from the first film. The bullet time technique had revoloutionised cinema, and the way films are made. It also was ridiculed from film to film, with even Dreamworks' Shrek getting in on the act. <br /> <br />If you thought the first two films were complex, then this film will confuse you like nothing before. We may not have the psycho analysing architect to contend with, but we have a plot that seems to move in ways that we do not expect, yet think it should. Questions we thought would be answered, are left for us to amuse ourselves with. <br /> <br />If you like closure and boundaries, then this film might not be the one for you. If you like action, gloriously choreographed fight sequences and the confusion of the what ifs, then you will love this film. Loose ends are not tied, and is peace closure. Is it really peace at all? Were you really watching this film and are you really reading this review... <br /> <br />To sum it up the acting may be slightly wooden, and the love between Neo and Trinity does not really makes us feel very passionate. The dialogue in places appears over written and very Capraesque, but who cares? The Matrix is clever, and inspiring. I love it
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This is my first review for an Amazon item.  Because I am outraged I saw people giving it only one star!! Is this the pearl jam album ever?  No.  Is this one of the best rock n roll albums to be relased in the last five years?  You, bet.  I agree, the last few PJ albums haven't been that impresive to me.  However, as newer bands come and go, albums like \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\" will still be selling thousands of copies for years to come.  This new album echoes those time as it gets better upon repeat listening.  Is the new album a masterpiece?  No.  But this album reaches a level few do, I believe it will sound as crisp and inviting 10 years in the future as it does now.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a great film. The films budget for this film was around $60 million and was the first film to (fully) employ 'bullet-time' effects- where computer software is able to slow down scene to the speed where moving bullets (and forces) can be seen. <br />The plot is potentially confusing which is why the film will make much more sense when watched twice. <br /> <br />Because of the high use of quality music (AC/DC) and awsome use of sound effects the film would be a great treat for your surround sound system- imagine a large scale gun fight between 10+ men darting along your speakers firing and shouting. <br /> <br />At times it can seem like your just waiting for a gun fight at the 'boring bits', but they are worth the wait. <br /> <br />The Dvd includes behind the scenes and all the standards you would expect from a DVD. <br /> <br />This film was made with the intention of not being in a trilogy but because of its populatity Warner Brothers gave a $300 budget to making 2 further films. These films can be seen as 'The Matrix Hollywoodised' because of its overmade and used computer effects and a plot that seems to intentially confuse you by never speaking in casual tongue in the film- at times you can feel like an idiot when you don't understand the plot. <br /> <br />In my opinion the first Matrix film is the best is has become a classic amoung action lovers. <br /> <br />While the other 2 films were entertaining as a novilty, 'The first Matrix film is how the Matrix was before Hollywood got to it'
0671449028|5.0|The other (positive) reviews are all spot on, except for the age ranges discussed. Like all of Boynton's books, this one's not just for toddlers, 2-6 year olds, etc. I've been reading (reciting, really, since I know it so well from our first child) this to our daughter since she was only 3 or 4 months old, and she knows and recognizes its cadence remarkably well even now at not quite 9 months. It's a great tool that I incorporate not only in reading as part of the bedtime routine, with the book in hand in a rocking chair, but also something I recite while dressing her - a great tool, that is, for shifting from the fun and frolic of the bath, to the placidity of the reading/rocking chair.
B00005JO1R|5.0|How two actors can transform themselves into country singers as convincingly as this is breathtaking, and to give such satisfying, spontaneous and riveting performances is amazing.  <br /> <br />Just watch the extended versions of the songs on Disc 2, particularly Reese in \\"Juke Box Blues\\", it seems she has completely forgotten who she is, she is just living June Carter, also the great duet of them singing \\"Jackson\\".  <br /> <br />Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash, he doesn't act or mimic him, he is him, watching his performance you can actually see a comment made in one of the extras that Cash \\"was the most haunted man I have ever met\\".  <br /> <br />This is no romantic biopic, it is a gritty slice of real life, the lives of Johnny Cash and June Carter.  <br /> <br />The extras on Disc 2 are every bit as good as the film in their different way, and the extended songs stand up as an album on their own. Buy, but make sure you BUY THE TWO DISC VERSION.  <br />
B00005LC1H|5.0|As many others have noted, Fawlty Towers is a truly hilarious series. The only show I can think of that's funnier (to me) is \\"Arrested Development\\" and it took 25 years for any comedy series to surpass FT.  Every episode is a gem, but my favorite is \\"Gourmet Night.\\" The scene where Basil goes berserk and starts thrashing his car with a tree branch is just one of the funniest TV moments EVER!  I bought the series on VHS tape years ago, and I'd upgrade to the DVD set if were more reasonably priced.  Three bucks an episode is a bit steep for 30-year-old TV episodes; most US series go for about half that.  Still, FT is a classic, and there are some decent extras on this set.  If I didn't already own it on tape I'd probably spring for it.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|I had to put a review up after I saw the low rating - now, I know I gave it 5 stars (this is a personal rating after all), but I'm going to help people a little here rather than, as one person below me has, just give their side. <br /> <br />Now, consider carefully what type of cinema goer are you? Do you only watch films for big noises and improbable story lines? Do you go because you want to see good cinematography, with a genuine message? Or are you in the middle, and sometimes like either, depending on mood? <br /> <br />If you're the latter, give it a try when you're in a thoughtful mood, if you're the first of that list, probably not for you, if you're the second this is probably ideal (I myself don't mind admitting that I am the last of that list). <br /> <br />This is a truly thought-provoking, genuinly disturbing, and all too possible a series of situations, I would rate it as possibly the best film I will ever see. <br /> <br />Now, it has been accused of American-bashing by some americans (I have not seen a review outside of the US that has voiced this opinion) - but I believe it is unfounded. It is scathing to the global oil industry (and quite a few of these happen to be US owned) and to the US Governments attitude towards them in it's foreign policy, but this does not mean it's saying 'all americans are hateful'. <br /> <br />Give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised.
B0007SN89A|5.0|What do you say about one of the greatest albums of the rock era? Do you say that at the end of their career as a group that these four individuals, talented individually and phenomenally gifted as a group, came together to create something magical? Sure. Why not? But even that would be an understatement. When describing a performance this good, you get to the point where words along fail. Artistry with words fails to describe the artistry with music, which is as it should be.<br /><br />\\"Abbey Road\\" was an interesting combination of music. Much of the album is a collection of songs that was and is the envy of lesser talents, and remains a standard of excellence. Part of the album was a grouping of songs that transitioned from one to the next seamlessly and wonderfully, beginning with \\"You Never Gave Me Your Money\\" and ending with \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\". The Moody Blues had performed similar transitions in \\"Days of Future Passed,\\" and the Beatles themselves had originally had overlapping songs on \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" but the Beatles did seamless transitions here rather than just overlapping the songs.<br /><br />What songs! Songs from hard rock (well, it was hard then) such as \\"Come Together\\" and \\"I Want You,\\" mellow ballads such as \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" a bizarre synthesized \\"Because,\\" and quirky novelty songs like \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden.\\" It was as though the group knew this was the end and was putting out pieces of this and that with exquisite finesse and skill. The breadth of music on this one album is incredible, and shows why The Beatles remain (in my humble opinion) the greatest rock group of all time. They gave so much in creating rock music as we know it, and this album was their last brilliant hurrah.<br /><br />There are a number of versions of this album available.  This particular version is a Russian special collector's edition.  You may wish to survey the versions available and their price before you buy to determine which version best meets your needs.<br /><br />There is nothing more to say. This album is a must-have for any Beatles fan, for any aficionado of 60s music, and for anyone that appreciates the talent required to create the range of songs on this CD. Throw yourself back more than 30 years and imagine what it was like to have lived in the time when the lads were still young, and genius music like this was fresh.

B000DZIGDU|5.0|This highly underrated film will come to define the (first) Gulf War in a way that Apocalypse Now defined Vietnam. That is not to say that it can yet be elevated to that lofty status, but that it captures and evokes the time with brutal cynicism mixed with a taste for the surreal in a similar way to Copola's masterpiece. In many ways it also resembles Full Metal Jacket, beginning as it does in the training camp with the anonomous 'jarheads' being put through the paces by a tyrannical drill sergeant. Where it surpasses Kubrick's vision is its ability to translate the process of dehumanisation onto the battle field engagingly, albeit with a more contextual message.  <br /> <br />Mendes's Jarheads are mere ordinance in a technological war. Trudging across the desert they encounter the burnt-out convoys hit by US laser-guided bombs, its victims anonymous, probably civillian. Their's is a modern war where the enemy is unclear, where the battle is won from the air, and their experience is defined by their never having shot their rifles. It deals with a generation of disenfranchised young men brought up to believe in American superiority but who never had to fight to achieve it. Many will leave unable to consider themselves a hero in a country obsessed by heroism, and some are left, finally, in despair at the seeming futility of it. Having been moulded into testosterone-fuelled, unthinking (hence 'Jarhead'), killing-machines, the war for many of them is one of boredom and frustration.  <br /> <br />Where the film is really elevated is in its highly stylised vision of the desert, unrelentingly oppressive in stark, unflinching white. Its use of contemporaneous music is also clever, even if one character comments that they don't even have music to define their age in the same way that Vietnam did. Nirvana's 'Something in the Way' accompanies a terrifying dream sequence where Swofford goes to be sick in the mess hall sink, but unleashes a torrent of sand instead of vomit. Equally brilliant is the marines offloading their munitions into the sky to Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power' in an archly symbolic vision of end of the war celebrations. There are many entirely cinematic conceits such as Gyllenhaal's protagonist Anthony Swofford encountering a oil-covered horse in the mecadamised apocalypse of a sabotaged oilfield. This seemingly offers the bewildered Swofford an almost mythological dimension to his experience, but this is soon debased by a drunken party. Swofford often seems on the verge of some kind of epithany but is misguided by the sensless machismo of 'The Core'. This theme is best realised in the brutal irony of the scene where the marines are shown patriotically chanting to Apocalypse Now's famed Ride of the Valkaries helicopter assault, apparently unaware of its subversive connotations and highly seduced by the spectacle of American military might ('Shock and Awe').
B00005GL6I|4.0|This song track is an interesting and unusual CD in that it has a title similar to the original, but it is not the original. The original \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack was a combination of a few Beatles songs with the portions of the score from the movie. The result was less than transcendent; indeed, it was a farrago of musical styles clearly better suited to the movie than to even a soundtrack.<br /><br />Someone, I have heard it was a film company executive, decided he wanted to have a \\"better\\" version of the soundtrack created. So engineer Peter Cobbin retrieved the four-track tapes of the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" songs and, using today's technology, remixed all the songs, discarding the score in favor of the 15 songs from the movie. In general, I'd say the remix is an improvement, but, it is very different from the original.<br /><br />Some of the songs received only minimal benefit, if any, from the re-mix. Some of the songs received a lot of benefit. Comparing \\"All You Need Is Love\\" to the previous version, the sound is bolder and clearer, and I think the bass comes through more clearly. Many of the other songs that were early stereo songs, some of which were in a kind of pseudo-stereo, were remixed to put the vocals more in the middle and move the instruments outward. I suppose Beatles purists will object to some of the changes, but in general I think the changes are very good and are an improvement.<br /><br />A question you might have is why you should buy this album if you have all The Beatles' other albums. Good question. Most of these songs appear on other albums: \\"Rubber Soul,\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\" If you have the original \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack, then I think you pretty much have everything on this CD. I have all of these CDs except for the original \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack, which I currently do not plan to buy. I enjoy all three of the aforementioned Beatles' albums, and listen to them often. However, I've noticed that some of the remixes are noticeably better than in the original albums. Furthermore, the songs are those that appeared in the movie. Lastly, it's a Beatles album, and I've got most of the Beatles albums released after 1966 on CD, so I just had to have this one. This album makes me wish I had a yellow submarine.<br /><br />And now I give you a significant word of warning.  There are several versions of this album available.

B000F6IOC0|5.0|\\"Underworld: evolution\\" is the sequel to \\"Underworld\\", the supernatural thriller regarding an old feud between vampires and lycans, and as such is more of the same. By that, I mean uncomplicated fun for those who from time to time enjoy watching a fast paced film that has elements of fantasy in it, and that lacks food for thought but makes up for that with lots of entertainment value.  <br /> <br />Are you, like me, one of those people I mentioned above? If the answer is no, do not lose your time, this film is probably not the right one for you. If the answer is yes, I recommend you watch this movie, but only after having enjoyed the first one.  <br /> <br />Now I am going to talk a little about the plot of \\"Underworld: evolution\\", so if you still have to watch the first movie in the series stop reading now, in order to avoid spoilers. The plot of this sequels picks up where the last one left off, and does an excellent job of allowing us to catch up with Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the beautiful vampire death-dealer, and Michael (Scott Speedman), the young lycan she has feelings for. Michael was turned by Selene into a hybrid of lycan and vampire in order to be saved from certain death, but that act of defiance and the fact that Selene killed an ancient vampire ruler to protect Michael, means that they are both on the run.  <br /> <br />But what exactly has Michael turned into, and will they be able to survive? And what will happen when Marcus (Tony Curran), another of the vampire elders, turns into a hybrid of a different kind, and finally achieves the power to free his dangerous brother, William (Brian Steele)? Things become even more complicated when we find out that Marcus was the father of all vampires, as William was the father of all lycans. On top of everything, Marcus and William s father, Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), decides to meddle and help Selene and Michael to stop his sons. The alternative is chaos, and a world full of crazed lycans running free and wreaking havoc.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind. The result is that their story is more believable, and thus more engaging.  <br /> <br />All in all, I can say that I really enjoyed watching this film, and that I believe that is even better than the first one. Of course, \\"Underworld: evolution\\" is not perfect, but it is so entertaining that does t matter too much. Highly recommended!
B000B6Q1JM|5.0|After \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" the Beatles were musically unstoppable. While \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was clearly a great album, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is no less great but got caught between \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"The White Album,\\" both of which are considered groundbreaking. I suppose that eventually you run out of superlatives in describing three outstanding albums in a row from one group. However, it is this quality that made the Beatles the greatest rock group of all time.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", which is as innovative and musically interesting as the song \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" In addition to being novel, this song was featured in an extended music video that featured the songs from the first half of the album. One of the interesting features of this album was the number of songs that had little or nothing to do with love and girls, delving instead into subjects tending toward the psychedelic, such as this song does.<br /><br />\\"The Fool on the Hill\\" is a song that shows that even though the Beatles music was becoming more complex, they could create relatively simple masterpieces. This song shows John Lennon and Paul McCartney at their creative best.<br /><br />\\"Flying,\\" attributed to all four, is an unusual instrumental that again has a bit of psychedelic feel to it. A good fit with the TV show.<br /><br />\\"Blue Jay Way\\" is a perfect fit with 60s psychedelic music. The music was simple, but the bizarre sound that has characteristics similar to some other psychedelic music. Note that this song anticipated many of the other groups that tried to create similar music in 1968 and 1969. This song is also a good indicator of the direction that George Harrison was heading in his life and his music.<br /><br />\\"Your Mother Should Know\\" is relatively simple compared to the songs surrounding it. More like pop, but in this context this song provides a reference for how psychedelic the other songs really were.<br /><br />\\"I Am the Walrus\\" is one of the all-time great psychedelic songs that set the stage for much progressive rock that followed. The song has lyrics that almost make sense, and do if you try not to decipher it word for word. It was music like this that was the basis for Yes in the creation of \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans.\\" The sounds in this song and the sound of the words in this song carry meaning independent of the actual usage of the words.<br /><br />From this point forward the remaining songs were added to complete an album's worth of material. And what great songs these were. These songs are generally pop songs, but with Beatles' class; every one a classic, and great. \\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" are great pop songs that are classic Beatles, and show how perfect John Lennon and Paul McCartney were as a songwriting team.  Worthy of note is that \\"All You Need Is Love\\" was the basis of the first world-wide satellite broadcast of a show and an indication of the popularity and success of the Beatles.<br /><br />And now I give you a significant word of warning.  There are several versions of this album available.  This particular version is one of the most expensive.  You should survey the albums available and determine which version meets your needs the best before buying.<br /><br />Perhaps overlooked by some, but one of the Beatles' greats, this album is a combination of a concept (the first half), and a collection of singles.

B000F1IQMS|5.0|It's thought provoking, it's balanced and director Stephen Spielberg doesn't waste anytime getting to the heart of the issues or the action. Munich works on a number of levels as an audacious political statement, a tense thriller, and an inspiringly brutal look at two peoples forever caught up in a cycle of violence, constantly drowning in a sea of their own blood.  <br /> <br />It's a bleak vision and Spielberg carries it off beautifully, providing us with a clipped and tight back-story, where the Palestinian terrorists invade the Olympic village in Munich, killing two members of the Israeli team and taking another nine as hostages.  <br /> <br />The Israeli response is swift and fast with Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) authorizing a top-secret assassination campaign which will carried out by the security agency Mossad, aimed at wiping out those who had planned the attack. It is left to the hunky Mossad agent Avner (Eric Bana) to emotionally and strategically shoulder most of the burden.  <br /> <br />The team is a seemingly innocuous and innocent mix. Daniel Craig's Steve is the group's impulsive hard-liner, a strapping Israeli itching for reprisal, often clashing with Ciaran Hinds' Carl, the cleanup man. There's a sweet-faced bomb expert named Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and a thoughtful muscleman (Hanns Zischler).  <br /> <br />As Avner cooks dinner, they all get to know one another, hashing out the fine details and the boarder implications for themselves and for the Jewish state. And so the methodological killing begins, yet as Munich progresses, what remains of certainty vanishes, replaced by a thousand conflicting agendas.  <br /> <br />This is a world where the rule of the law is superfluous and where allegiances are none, the only constants are mistrust, paranoia, and the need to find more names, which inevitably comes at a price. No one is ever who they are, a drunk on the corner may be CIA, or KGB or the seductress at the hotel bar might be a hitwoman.  <br /> <br />Spielberg wisely avoids any soapbox speeches, but he does allow his characters to present both sides of the argument: At a safe house in Athens, Avner is confronted with a young Arab who tells him if the desperate need for a Palestinian homeland, a place they can call their own. And back in Israel, Avner's mother tells him that Israel is their land, finally they have a home and they will fight to keep it.  <br /> <br />In Munich the themes are universal - the moral imperatives of violence, and in what circumstances can one justify such senseless murder. As Avner and his colleagues continue their operation, they become psychologically immune to it all. Yes - the operation may be successfully carried out, but how long will it be before righteous anger - the anger of the Israelis - can be continued before stumbling into bloody-mindedness? The irony is that in demonizing these Palestinian terrorists, they are themselves acquiring similar gruesome aspects.  <br /> <br />It's all about the cycle of violence, a common problem that has plagued the Middle East for generations and will probably continue to do so. Munich deftly shows that everyone has their reasons for hating the other side - whether it is religious intolerance, or the fight over land rights - everyone ultimately thinks they're right, but such a stalemate can never be broken by killing people whatever side of the fence you are on. Mike Leonard May 06.
B000002J0B|5.0|the reason i love Zep so much is the variety of styles they incorporate into their music, which is won of their most heralded traits. Not one of these songs sounds the same, which is what makes it so great.  My favs are The Rain Song, The Crunge, Dancin Days, D'yer M'ker, and the Ocean. Oh shoot, that's the entire CD, and i origionally bought the CD b/c of Over the Hills and Far Away.  Some may dislike other songs and favor others, b/c of their individual taste buds and the endless variety of flavors on this CD
B0000027I6|5.0|As with most of Roger Waters best work, you have to take a bit of time to let it take hold of you. When you get it, man, you REALLY get it. I love this album and I think it is fair to say that one song after the next (they all connect in classic Waters fashion) speaks to the issues of the day. War, Entertainment, Idiocy, and more War. Waters is a real genius in the fullest sense of the word. I read this awesome post on another site recently (and also got turned on to a very intense, almost unknown film that was influenced by Roger's style through that post.) I'm going to share it with all you Waters fans because it sums up how I feel better than I can, with much more clarity:  <br /> <br />By Hannah Korigian <br /> <br />The reunion of Pink Floyd at Live 8 was a moving event. The decades long rift among the members of the influential and supremely creative band was unfortunate but not surprising given the often volatile nature of artistic partnerships. In keeping with his commitment to issues of global importance and at the prompting of Live 8 organizer, Bob Geldof, Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters put his personal bitterness aside and approached band member Dave Gilmour about playing at the huge concert to end poverty. The result was a set of soaring and emotional Pink Floyd favorites that captivated the audience and made news around the world.   <br /> <br />The brilliance of their instrumentation combined with the bite of the lyrics that characterizes Pink Floyd has made them one of the most successful bands of all time. Their popularity crosses social, educational and cultural divides. However, it is interesting to note that although Roger Waters' genius is acknowledged by all Pink Floyd fans, the deeper message embedded in his lyrics is often overshadowed by the pure enjoyment of listening to the distinctive Pink Floyd sound. Roger Waters is the most intellectual and complex lyricist in rock. Both in his solo work and in his work with Pink Floyd, Waters builds conceptual underpinnings for his creations that add an unusual depth in a field generally known for simplistic expressions. Unlike most rock music, which revels in sexuality, the vicissitudes of love and general \\"good times\\", Waters' compositions focus on larger issues such as war, personal alienation, mortality and societal apathy. These themes are played out in a multitude of ways, from the exploration of time and the cycle of life in \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", the longing for lost innocence in  \\"Wish You Were Here\\", bitter criticism of social norms and structures in \\"Animals\\", individual breakdown and militarism in \\"The Wall\\" and the tragedies of war in \\"The Final Cut\\". Waters continued to explore the darker side of the human experience in his solo work, perhaps most effectively in \\"Amused To Death\\" in which he takes aim at the fusion of militarism and entertainment. Rather than being a \\"rocker\\" in the usual sense of the word, Waters is a consummate social critic who utilizes the forum of rock to express his views to a wide audience.  <br /> <br />Waters' stance on social issues is taken seriously by many; witness the recent controversy that erupted when Waters, who has expressed humanitarian outrage over the conditions in the Occupied Territories, announced his decision to play in Tel Aviv. In an open letter to Waters about the upcoming concert protesters called him \\"the artist whose name around the world was for many years associated with breaking walls of injustice\\". Waters subsequently changed the venue where he would play from Tel Aviv to the Israeli Peace Village where Palestinians and Israelis are living together in a bold experiment for peace.  <br /> <br />Waters has influenced many over the years and his style is reflected in the works of music and visual expression by a variety of artists.  In recent times a notable example of artistic creation in the Floyd/Waters style is the relatively obscure independent film \\"USA The Movie\\" which has the same complexity and multi-faceted approach to cinema as Waters has to composition. \\"USA The Movie\\" merges a free-floating fictional storyline with real world events and places.  It is a take on war, past and present, through the \\"comfortably numb\\" eyes of an aging American hippie who can't break free of his own apathy and thus becomes a symbolic weapon of mass destruction. \\"USA The Movie\\" has a particular resonance with \\"The Final Cut\\" and such lyrics as:   <br /> <br />\\"In my rear view mirror the sun is going down  <br />Sinking behind bridges in the road  <br />And I think of all the good things  <br />That we have left undone  <br />And I suffer premonitions  <br />Confirm suspicions  <br />Of the holocaust to come.\\" <br /> <br />The filmmaker, W.T. Zeyera, who in various interviews has expressed his admiration for Roger Waters' work and sensibility, also utilizes audio in \\"USA The Movie\\" in distinctly Floyd/Waters manner. The audio design brings together elements of sound, speeches and music to create a profoundly haunting atmosphere reminiscent of  \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" or in a more biting tone - \\"Amused to Death\\". This is a Floyd/Waters type of project not in the entertaining or rock and roll sense but in the willingness to take its time and captivate through its substance as well as style.  <br /> <br />Movies and popular music in this modern era are both primarily viewed as vehicles for entertainment. Those artists who choose to utilize these forms of expression for something deeper or more challenging are often looked upon as going outside the traditional boundaries of their chosen field. In the case of projects like \\"USA The Movie\\", this has resulted in the film being labeled as \\"art house\\" or \\"experimental\\" while at the same time being given a niche in academia. Professor Dion Dennis, Ph.D has urged a wider awareness of the project in his detailed analysis of the film: Between Nomadology, the War Machine and the State:  A Deleuzian Analysis of the Film, USA The Movie. In his paper Dennis writes: \\"In the process and product of \\"USA the Movie,\\" he (filmmaker Zeyera) fused reality with allegory, intention with contingency, personal troubles with collective tragedies, and art with history.  Even in its limited circulation, the film has formed a rhizome with the world, generating a mapping well worth circulating, sharing, discussing, detaching, and redeploying.\\"  <br /> <br />In the case of a megastar like Waters, his unyielding focus on human blindness and social injustice has sometimes been criticized for being too dark or depressing. However, this focus on the painful aspects of the human condition is what sets him apart. On the whole, Waters doesn't so much point a finger at a specific target; rather he holds the entire species accountable as in \\"Perfect Sense Part 1\\" from \\"Amused to Death\\":  <br /> <br /> The monkey sat on a pile of stones <br />And stared at the broken bone in his hand <br />And the stains of a Viennese quartet <br />Rang out across the land <br />The monkey looked up at the stars <br />And thought to himself <br />Memory is a stranger <br />History is for fools <br />And he cleaned his hands <br />In a pool of holy writing <br />Turned his back on the garden <br />And set out for the nearest town <br />Hold on hold on soldier <br />When you add it all up <br />The tears and the marrowbone <br />There's an ounce of gold <br />And an ounce of pride in each ledger <br />And the Germans killed the Jews <br />And the Jews killed the Arabs <br />And the Arabs killed the hostages <br />And that is the news <br />And is it any wonder <br />That the monkey's confused <br />He said Mama Mama <br />The President's a fool <br />Why do I have to keep reading <br />These technical manuals <br />And the joint chiefs of staff <br />And the brokers on Wall Street said <br />Don't make us laugh <br />You're a smart kid <br />Time is linear <br />Memory is a stranger <br />History is for fools <br />Man is a tool in the hands <br />Of the great God Almighty <br />And they gave him command <br />Of a nuclear submarine <br />And sent him back in search of <br />The Garden of Eden <br /> <br />Waters' adherence to his principles despite the criticism that is sometimes leveled at him is a vital contribution to the creative arena that paves the way for other artists to take a chance and speak their conscience through their work as well.
B000AMJDHY|3.0|Panic! is a really hard band to review because they are so hard to classify! They're not punk, not exactly emo, not at all indie, not rock, and so fall mostly into the mainstream catagory of pop, which is sad really because they have much more talent and potential than 99.99% of pop bands today. I was first introduced to Panic! when they opened for The Academy Is... and Hellogoodbye at a concert I went to. I picked up A Fever You Can't Sweat Out afterwards, and liked it. That being said, Panic! does have some problems. One, their song titles are way too long! It's blaringly obvious that they are trying to be creative, but they're a little late. Fall Out Boy experimented with the long song titles before Panic!(which would be because Pete Wentz from FOB helped produce and market Panic!). Second, their sound and lyrics aren't really that original. The Academy Is..., Fall Out Boy, Hellogoodbye, Motion City Soundtrack, Armor for Sleep, Matchbook Romance, Silverstein, and Senses Fail all sound quite similar to them. Third, their music video I Write Sins Not Tradjedies (the title of which, by the way, has nothing to do with the song, am i right?) has been so overplayed that Panic! is going to really struggle not to be branded with the titles \\"posers,\\" \\"sellouts,\\" or \\"one hit wonders.\\"<br /><br />So, if you think after reading this you still want to buy their cd, go for it. It's not a bad cd at all, and I look forward to seeing what direction Panic! chooses to go in.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice and company have quickly become my inspirations for this album, while short, packs such a punch it will stay with you.  There hasn't been a debut album this rich, this pure, this perfect in a long time.  Damien possesses a gift, a raw, imperfect talent that helps you see through to the very emotion he's feeling with every breathy verse.  Heres a run down of this gem of a CD... <br /> <br />1. Delicate <br /> <br />This song has deep meaning for me for listening to it helps express exactly the way I felt the day my first love (not first girlfriend, first love) broke my heart.  Damien asks the questions \\"why'd you sing with me at all?\\" and that's the same way I felt, staring in her eyes and wondering why she'd pretend for so long only to take back everything she's ever told me.  This song perfectly expresses the feelings left when love goes wrong, when everything delicate breaks. <br />   <br />2. Volcano   <br /> <br />A song of tortured or maybe even forbidden love (\\"she's still too young\\"), this is by far a standout here with beautiful and heartfelt lyrics, and vocals shining by both Damien and Lisa Hannigan. <br />  <br />3. The Blower's Daughter <br /> <br />Thanks to the popularity of 'Closer' this single made Damien a household name.  The song, set aside the instant popularity, is well deserving of all the attention.  It's a brilliantly crafted love song that showcases the despair of a broken heart and the determination to make love last.  Damien laments over the broken condition of the one he loves, but will he ever be able to make her whole? <br />   <br />4. Cannonball <br /> <br />This song is about the insecurities that amount when your falling head over heals for someone.  Damien talks of his doubt, his words \\"it's still a little hard to say what's going on\\", but it's the chorus that really tells it all.  When your in love it's easy to be hurt because you become so vulnerable.  So when Damien sings \\"it's easy to fall when you float like a cannonball\\" he so right.  When you fall for someone you feel as though your floating high, but thats dangerous for when your that high you have a long what to fall.  This is such a beautiful song with such resonance with situations we all have faced. <br />    <br />5. Older Chests  <br /> <br />This song disects the changes we go through as a whole, the way the world changes and, as people stay the same it's unhealthy as the world around then changes and adapts all the time.  It's actually quite sad when you think about it.  \\"I'll be fine, just give me time.\\" <br />   <br />6. Amie   <br /> <br />Sometimes we meet someone, we know someone and no matter how weird it may seem that someone who we've known for so many years and never thought of passed friendship turns out to be the one you long for.  \\"You know when you've found it there's something i've learned 'cause you feel it when they take it away\\" and how true that is...  <br />  <br />7. Cheers Darlin'  <br /> <br />When you keep your mouth shut you lose out on the things you long for the most.  That's the moral of this song as Damien laments over not taking the chances he should have...\\"I'm too shy, I should have kissed you when we were alone\\"...And now it's too late, for she's getting married and at this point theres nothing you can do, for all is lost and your alone.  She's something you'll never have, not once, and even if you move on, even if you find love elsewhere, never having her, never having the chance to lose her will eat you up for the rest of your life. <br />   <br />8. Cold Water <br /> <br />Close to my favorite song on the album, Damien and Lisa Hannigan here harmonize beautifully on this song about the feeling of lonliness and the desire to feel needed and wanted.  The way Damien sings the first verse, almost as if he's choking...it adds to the feeling of being smothered, of drowning in your sorrow and so you believe him when he says \\"cold water surounds me\\"...brilliant! <br />    <br />9. I Remember  <br /> <br />Sung almost entirly by Lisa Hannigan this song is a shining moment for her until Damien comes in towards the end when the music takes a turn and he steals the whole show.  She sings beautifully but Damien is so commanding I almost forgot she sang any part of the song.  This song goes into losing your grip on your reality when you fall for the wrong person, when you give up all you thinking ability and devote yourself to them, and they use and abuse you and you end up screaming to yourself \\"I wanna hear what you want what the hell do you want?\\"  I know the feeling well. <br />   <br />10. Eskimo   <br /> <br />This is an interesting song concept, translating an opera.  It works well and proves that Damien is a freaking genious!  This song, while a little strange (\\"i look to my eskimo friend when i'm down \\") it still evokes brilliance, especially towards the end when the opera screams in the background and your drawn into it's grander... <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are worth a listen, especially 'Prague' which is beautifully done and worth the bit of silence it takes to discover.  Their rendition of 'Silent Night' is also breathtaking, sung a capella by Lisa Hannigan it will give you chills.  I recommend this album to any lover of music for that's what Damien is, a lover of music, and here he's been able to build a musical masterclass! <br />
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|COULD IT BE THE GONE WITH THE WIND OF THE HIGH SEAS? <br /> <br />FIRST THOUGHTS: DIFFICULT FILM TO PUT INTO PESPECTIVE UNLESS ---  <br /> <br />Viewing \\"Titanic\\" to learn about the ship is alot like viewing \\"Gone With The Wind\\" to learn about the Civil War. In both cases the titles are vital settings that are done extraordinarily well, but the films are both about the same something else. The life changing event that caused epiphanies in the female leads are what Titanic, and Gone With The Wind are all about. Everything else simply contributes to the events our leading women, Scarlett O'Hara and Rose DeWitt, must endure to reach salvation for themselves, and thereby radically alter their destinies.  <br /> <br />FLASHBACKS REVEAL ILL-FATED TITANIC ROMANCE & MORE  <br /> <br />Certainly not for children, but a potent fictionalized drama that will strike an emotional cord for all viewers, and resonate loudly for some, especially young women.  <br /> <br />WHAT IT IS \\"TITANIC\\" ABOUT:  <br /> <br />\\"Titanic\\" is about an improbable, lightning romance aboard ship, between two young people of completely different classes. It is vividly reenacted for us by a 100 year old woman, who, upon being questioned by the salvagers, describes the happenings that she recalls, ostensibly in regard to the whereabouts of a priceless diamond necklace that she was portrayed as wearing in a painting found aboard the ship, dated April 14, 1912, by a team within a submersible salvage vessel.  <br /> <br />The salvage team's discovery of the titanic, now, some 85 years later, was motivated by the expectation of finding the priceless diamond necklace. Originally, within the context of the film, that is the only reason this secret romance, and the epic story which includes the historic tragic sinking of the Titanic, is recalled and revealed to us -- the audience.  <br /> <br />*-----* THE CAST [ABRIDGED] *-----*  <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio - Jack Dawson  <br />Kate Winslet - Rose DeWitt Bukater  <br />Billy Zane - Cal Hockley  <br />Kathy Bates - Molly Brown  <br />Frances Fisher - Ruth DeWitt Bukater  <br />Gloria Stuart - Old Rose  <br />Bill Paxton - Brock Lovett  <br />Bernard Hill - Captain Smith  <br />Jonathan Hyde - Bruce Ismay  <br />Victor Garber - Thomas Andrews  <br />David Warner - Spicer Lovejoy  <br /> <br />*-----* THE MAJOR AWARDS - [MOST OF THEM] *-----*  <br /> <br />* Best Actress (nom) Kate Winslet 1997 Academy  <br />* Best Art Direction (win) Peter Lamont 1997 Academy  <br />* Best Art Direction (win) Michael Ford 1997 Academy  <br />* Best Cinematography (win) Russell Carpenter 1997 Academy  <br />* Best Costume Design (win) Deborah L.

There are powerful, even grisly scenes, and the depiction of the sinking is grand and accurate, but the story is more about the romance between Rose and Jack, than anything else. If you are looking for a film which makes the ship the star of the film, and for its theme, its sinking, consider viewing, \\"A Night To Remember\\", 1958, starring Kenneth More.  <br /> <br />
1577312082|2.0|I started falling asleep within two seconds of the author starting to speak, and it just goes on, and on, and on. It's so monotonous at times it sounds like the artificial 'voice box'. <br /> <br />It's unfortunate, because there's some real wisdom in those words. This should be abridged and read by someone else and then it'd be truly valuable. <br /> <br />Note, I'm only referring to the Audio CD version. I still think everyone could benefit from the information presented here.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have been a fan of Tool for many years going back to Undertow and Aenima, but have was disappointed with Lateralus and was bored with Perfect Circle discs. I started to think that Meynard had used up his best stuff until listening to 10,000 Days. My problem with Lateralus was that is sounded watered down without any real intensity and I was very skeptical that I would like their new disc. With 10,000 Days, Tool brings back the dark intensity that has been missing since Aenima. They have finally rediscovered their edge. Buy this CD! After even one listen I am going to go on a limb and say it's their best work yet.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|PJ have returned with a bang.They have made a brilliant album after several mediocre efforts like No code and Binaural.I would rate this on par with tewn due to beautiful songs like worldwide suicide,life wasted and big wave.Keep the good work PJ.Recommended.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|The day they turn into the backstreet boys is the day I'll stop listening to AFI, nuff said!! Seriously though, any true fan won't turn them down because of change...I mean life changes also and that's no different than anything else on earth including music. They've become more artistic and there's nothing wrong with that. They still hold true to their unique style and sound, I've also noticed that in all their albums they preserve that edge that most bands end up losing. True fans only!!!
B000002J09|5.0|WOW!I JUST CANT IMAGINE ANYONE NOT LIKING A BAND AS GREAT AS LED ZEPPELIN WHO HAVE SOLD MORE THAN 100 MILLION ALBUMS WORLDWIDE.THEY HAVE PRODUCED SEVERAL CLASSIC ALBUMS WITH MASTERPIECES SUCH AS BLACK DOG,ROCK AND ROLL,MISTY MOUNTAIN HOP,STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN AND WHEN THE LEEVEE BREAKS.DONT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE ONE STAR REVIEWERS WHO PROBABLY LISTEN TO MAINSTREAM CRAP LIKE GREEN DAY WHO SUCK TILL ETERNITY.GET THIS TODAY.BILLION STARS.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|I wasn't very much surprised when I heard Patton's new album. What was he trying to do? Mike Patton's reflection on pop maybe. Who knows... <br />This will probably sound like pop only to hard core Mike Patton fans, because it sounds softer and remniscent to lighter songs from Faith No More era. It includes some hip-hop and pop elements, but few will categorise this to general pop category because rhythms, vocals and sounds on almost every song have too spooky and weirdo feeling for a MTV kind of pop fan to appreciate. But if you are a fan of more alternative approach to pop, you may like this album, a lot of good stuff is going on, Mike's singing is very good there are variety of styles that go well together and guest atars appearing on the record are top notch in their line of music. If you are an old time Patton fan check it out, and if you are a pop music a la Shakira fan proceed with caution.
B00005JOYA|5.0|My family and I went to see this movie. We loved it- especially my 4 yr old. Now I know that some ppl are like \\"OMG! you took a little kid to that!\\" Yes. Yes we did. And she loved it. Halfway thru the movie she asked when it was coming out on dvd. She loves horror movies. We visited the website several times before actually going to see the movie.  <br /> <br />And No, this wasn't like the games. This was much, much better. You know what? There aren't any movies that are like the game. At least not until the Halo movie comes out. The whole game similarity thing is the biggest compalint from most ppl. I played the game. That guy was the biggest \\"girl\\" I have ever seen. He reminded me of Barbara from the Night of the Living Dead, ya just wanted to smack the crap out of him the whole time.  <br /> <br />In the movie however, we had strong characters, at least once the situations started rolling. It was nice to see a female character in a movie who didn't acted like the general \\"girl\\" the whole time. You know the \\"OMG! What happening? Why is this happening?\\" I hate that. It's unrealistic.  <br /> <br />Overall, this movie, as a movie and not as comparison b/t the movie and the game, was very good. You were on the edge of  your seat the whole time. It was great fun.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I'll admit this sequel does throw a lot at you in the beginning that had me somewhat confused, but things become clear as the movie progresses.  I really enjoyed the movie as a whole, but the ultimate battles between Selene vs Marcus and Michael vs William could have been a bit more... more something.  Even so, this movie is great fun and I look forward to the 3-quel.
0156027321|5.0|For some reason, people expect this story to be more action-packed in the beginning than it is. Let me remind them it is the LIFE of Pi and the author is showing us how uneventful his life was before the Tsitsum sunk. I mean, the book is a great piece of literature. I feel pity for the few who cannot sustain themselves long enough to read the truths given in the book. They are missing a lot. This is a definite great read!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Sure Green day aren't as musically talented as other bands, and maybe they are overplayed and overrated.  The fact that they are overplayed isn't their fault though.  And anyone who has seen them live knows that they have one of the best live shows in rock. <br /> <br />Anyway, I got this album in 04 when it came out, and to this day I still love it.  The concept idea is awesome and the music is great.  The songs are very catchy, memorable, and epic, and the lyrics are powerful as well.  I totally recomend this album to anyone who like rock music. <br /> <br />Sure Green Day may not have complex beats or crazy guitar riffs, but they write damn good songs, and it is evident in this album.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|So, Lucas didn't do anything to the original version that'll be released.  Is that really a bad thing? <br /> <br />I've been so happy with the bottleg laser disc copy I bought on ebay that I didn't even buy the 2004 version when it came out.  It looks fine on my 32 inch TV.  Yes, it isn't as good as it could and should be (that's why I give it only 4 stars) but at least I won't wear out my tapes. <br /> <br />Plus, I agree with the other reviewers who say that it'll be released again.  Why?  Because we're like junkies and will buy it - again and again and again. <br />
074325144X|5.0|This book is the book I keep reading and re-reading and it has changed my running life and my life for the better.  <br /> <br />I am a 38 year old mom.  As a devoted runner for almost 12 years, (averaging 30-40 miles/week) I was wondering if there really were any new dimensions to read about in running.  (Of course many \\"power running\\" articles will promise you \\"results\\" if you follow their one-page recipe.).  Well, this book has helped me add a new dimension to my running and my life and I am forever grateful.  I keep this book by my bed-side and re-read it at night before falling off to sleep.   <br /> <br />My only wish is that Danny Dreyer would write another book on applying the chirunning principles to daily living (though he encourages us to that in his book).  I have been working on this little-by-little, but would love to learn more! <br /> <br />Since reading Chirunnning, and working on integrating the focuses into my running and my life, not only has my running improved, I am enjoying it even more than I did before.  Running has always held deep meaning and importance for my life, but this book has impacted me far more positive ways than I could have ever imagined.  It is transformative.  This book is for people who hold running dear...or would...., who know that there is no \\"magic pill\\" or cookie-cutter workout to make them faster (or whatever).  If you are looking for the \\"quick fix', you won't find it here, with good reason.  Look deeply at those reasons, and the principles of chi-running.... you may find a joy you weren't quite expecting. <br /> <br />If you want to take your running and your life to a higher level, read and study this book.  Thank you Danny and Katherine Dreyer for publishing this book.  It is a gem!!!  Best wishes for continued success.  I am going to read chi-walking next!  (and please consider a book on chirunning principles for daily living.....) <br />
B000EXZI0A|4.0|Hits is something of a misnomer when it comes to the Ramones. It's more like the tongue in cheek title that the Red Hot Chili Peppers gave their 1993 EMI collection, \\"WHAT hits?!?\\" I am sure that anyone who is a die hard fan probably has all these on CD somewhere, or would have picked alternate titles than the ones presented here since a mere 20 songs sells the band kind of short.<br /><br />It is going to be a damn long time before we have the likes of the Ramones on this earth again, or a band with this kind of influence. Suffice to say that it's all good (with the possible exception of \\"Baby I Love You\\" which had Joey Ramone saturated by Phil Spector's stings). For all the critical nit-picking that has occasionaly been leveled about the lack of variation in the Ramones' style, this CD lays that argument to waste. \\"Do You Remember Rock And Roll Radio\\" would be a classic out of anybody's songbook, the Phil Spector production should have made this the breakout record that the band so obviously longed for. But it isn't the same song as the rappy \\"Wart Hog,\\" which is not the same as \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" etc, etc.<br /><br />The unifying thread through almost all of these songs was Joey Ramone's voice, which became more and more soulful as their career proceeded. If Dee Dee and Johnny gave guts to the band, it was Joey's voice that gave it heart. These songs may have been punk-rock-tough, yet these \\"brothers\\" were never without spirit. When listening to this disc, it's the Ramones' spirit and heart that will stick in your memory, just as much as any of the classic rock hooks they were so adept at creating.<br /><br />And just for the record, \\"Loud Fast Ramones\\" has 30 songs and rocks harder for just a few bucks more.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|It's a sad day when fans start dropping like flies simply because a band gets some mainstream attention. Sure, \\"decemberunderground\\" may not sound exactly the same as the \\"A Fire Inside EP\\" or \\"Shut your Mouth and Open your Eyes\\", but can one say they really expected it to? AFI is constantly changing their sound, and this is just another notch in the saga. <br /> <br />The sound may have changed, but AFI is still the same band. The lyrics are still wonderfully poetic and musically, they are still going strong. The album includes more then just one sound, from the harder edge of \\"Kill Caustic\\" to the more gentle \\"Love Like Winter\\". The ability to create an album with a mix of genres takes talent, and AFI has proved themselves worthy in the world of music. I perfer old AFI, but I cannot say I didn't enjoy this album, for if I did, I would be telling a filthy lie.
0062502182|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I had heard that it was close to some of the theories of the very popular anime series \\"Fullmetal Alchemist\\", and in theory it is. Some of the philosophy of the anime is similar to that of Coelho's work. The philosopher's stone, the equal exchange, the diligent pursuit of dreams that seem impossible, it's all very similar. The Alchemist's reference to the philosopher's stone comes in when the main character, Santiago, runs into an Alchemist who teaches him how all of life is connected, by asking Santiago to transform into different elements. Of course, the basic principle of alchemy is to understand what goes into certain things to create equivalent exchange. The philosopher's stone, however great it may be, according to the Alchemist in the book, is more or less the painful cheap way to skip the journey and get rich fast. The whole point of the dream is to strive and journey towards it, that is part of the quest. Santiago and the reader learn that through this book. The Fullmetal Alchemist series presents a more harsh way of portraying what the stone can do to people but both are ultimately about dreams and journeys. The journey and the dreams are what attracted me to the book in the first place.    I've heard of many references to dreams; some see dreams as a reason to live, other see dreams as a way of life. Coelho sees dreams as life itself and life has struggles to reach its end.       When a young shepard, Santiago, decides to question the truth of a dream he had, he ends up going in search of his own personal dream or as Coelho calls it \\"personal legend\\". What exactly Coehlo intends this to mean, I think is exactly what the book says it is: a person's dream of themselves as something greater than something they admired, they admire themselves and are therefore content.       But the main character in this story has a hard time accepting his legend. He doesn't believe in the legend because the gypsy who read his dream toldhim he may not suceed. Later, he meets a king named Salem, who tells him that not many people follow their legends because of fear and the fact that some dreams, as they believe are better off left as dreams: namely legends. Tehy king further tells the young shepard, Santiago, that he must decide for himself if he will pursue his personal legend. The king tells Santiago that the only way to suceed is by dedicating his life and soul to the legend and never faltering, even for love, unless the legend is love. Santiago accepts and journeys onward, encountering thieves, rulers, shopkeepers and a woman that he falls in love with. Santiago's love and the large amounts of things he encounters stand between him and his legend. As the king said, Santiago has to choose between his legend and the life he left behind.       Coehlo's overall message is that if you want to achieve your dream, you must give up all else for it, just like giving many things up to survive in life. The way most of us look at dreams is as the illusions of our mind, nothing more. Coehlo's look is that seeing the dream one way: as a vision, is to lose sight of the dream, what does Santiago think though? Read and find out.    A piece of simply written, but deep work that is sure to please all readers!
B0000026WD|2.0|Michael Jackson should have called this album \\"Bad\\" instead of the one that preceeded it. At least it would have lived up to its title. The only thing \\"Dangerous\\" about this album was the damage it ultimately ended up doing to his career. \\"Dangerous\\" is a nearly 80-minute glimpse into the eventual unwraveling of the Jackson phenomena. It's here we see the first cracks in the veneer. <br /> <br />I truly wanted to like this album, because despite his \\"eccentricities,\\" I really believe that Michael Jackson is one of the most talented performers of all time. Just not worthy of the \\"King of Pop\\" title he gave himself, if this album is to be used as an argument in favor of that. <br /> <br />The lead-off single, \\"Black or White\\" was not entirely unlistenable, but the video that followed was the first sign that all was not well with Michael. Not only was it a nearly 20-minute video in the days when such clips were fading out of style, it featured Jackson smashing cars and grabbing his crotch almost incessantly before finally ending with his morphing into a black panther. It was most likely this video that hurt sales of the album, despite Michael's statement that he would edit the video. <br /> <br />But \\"Dangerous'\\" biggest problem is not the videos as much as the music itself. In retrospect, Jackson may be thinking that firing Quincy Jones might not have been the smartest career move. As good a producer as Terry Riley is, his work on this album does absolutely nothing to advance New Jack Swing. In fact, the only time when the album displays a spark of the old inspiration is \\"Jam.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Dangerous\\" isn't the absolute worst album Michael Jackson has ever done (that title goes unequivocally to \\"Invincible\\"), but he's definitely working below his grade level. Sony Music must have been scratching their heads and saying to themselves, \\"What were we thinking? We give him a billion dollar contract, and this is what we get in return?\\" <br /> <br />Unless you absolutely have to have everything Jackson, skip this one.
B000002I25|5.0|In 1967, the year of SGT. PEPPER'S, PET SOUNDS, ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?, SURREALISTIC PILLOW, DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED and THE VELVET UNDERGROUND AND NICO, The Doors released this self-titled debut album which had and has as much influence as any of them.<br /><br />THE DOORS introduced the world to Jim Morrison and his bandmates. They were never better. From the opening notes of \\"Break On Through To The Other Side\\" The Doors began to weave a dark tapestry of depravity and humor noir. The carnivalesque notes of Ray Manzarek's keyboards meshed perfectly with Morrison's rich but bleak baritone. The overall effect is the aural equivalent of an opium den.<br /><br />The dusky, smoky, cloying sweetness of the notes is reinforced by the lyrics which range from the merely aggressive (\\"Break On Through\\") to the demandingly intoxicated (\\"The Alabama Song aka Whisky Bar\\") to the overtly erotic (\\"Crystal Ship\\") to the profoundly disturbed (\\"The End\\"). Morrison's fixation with Nietzche, Celine, and the Oedipal Conflict is never more laid bare.<br /><br />Had Jim Morrison stopped performing after THE DOORS and vanished into the trackless wastes of the world he would have been considered a prodigy. As it was, he devolved into a suicidal alcoholic whose artistic visions became progressively weaker on succeeding albums. Although there were subsequent Doors songs that matched or exceeded the best on THE DOORS, the band never spoke so clearly or consistently again.
B000063DHK|5.0|This is a portrait of a band, at their peak, playing all of their best songs up until that point in time.  The show starts off with a great moment in the Churchill Speech/Aces High intro. The only real slow point of the album is the cliched call/response segment during \\"Running Free\\".  I'm also not a big fan of the artificial manipulation of crowd noise during certain parts of the album.....during most of the songs, you can't hear the crowd at all, then it is boosted louder even than the music in intros and other sections as an \\"effect\\".   <br /> <br />The track list is amazing, the notes on the CD booklet are amazing...these kind of tours just don't happen anymore...they can't..bands like Van Halen and Iron Maiden played every large and medium sized city in the US back in those days, and concert tickets were relatively affordable.  This is Arena Rock's heyday.  This was a band being very succesful, while making the kind of music that they wanted to make, with little or no compromise. That is to be respected.
0140157352|4.0|The very good point and theme of \\"Getting To Yes\\" is that it is better to start a negotiation objectively than to start one positionally. Anyone can negotiate positionally by just naming a price or stance and then hold a \\"take it, or leave it\\" posture. However, to have real meaningful negotiations and subsequent strong agreements/contracts, one needs to go the extra mile or put in the extra effort to discuss things objectively.<br /><br />While others report that there were not enough examples in the book or any psychological reasons why objective negotiation works over other techniques, I propose they missed the point in that objective review identifies the real issues that are to be or need to be overcome in the negotiation process. This is due to the fact that objective negotiations focus on the basic interests, mutually satisfying options, and most importantly the fair standards which to judge the ultimate strong agreement.<br /><br />With the objective approach, one is always asking \\"because why\\" to determine the standards and fairness behind what the other party is judging the negotiation from. Without the standard from which each party starts, it may be difficult to reach a strong agreement that will last over bumps in the road that may occur in the future. In addition, questions will tend to generate answers, whereas, statements tend to generate resistance of which you do not want.<br /><br />Other topics and techniques are discussed like, separate the people from the problem, focus on interests, create options, and others, but the big takeaway is objectivity should come from both sides. If done so, your agreements/contracts may have a better chance of lasting longer and repeat business may keep coming back.
B00005JOVH|4.0|I went to see this one last night with Amy and my brother, Steve, and it's a romping good time! Entertainment plus! Not particularly deep, that's for sure, and full of plot holes, but a great film nonetheless. <br /> <br />I'm not a reader of the X-men comic books - unlike some people - so I wasn't disappointed with how the characters' looks changed, or anything like that. I also didn't think that the Phoenix storyline was pushed anywhere near to the back, as a subplot or anything. And I didn't think that there were too many mutants, either - there should have been more of some of them, like Angel, and many should have been introduced better, but that's a scriptwriting issue, not a numbers problem. <br /> <br />I was annoyed at how Wolverine suddenly lost his macho-ness - boys don't cry, etc. - and about how so many character sacrifices didn't mean a damn thing in terms of driving the plot forward. And, for that matter, how none of the characters seemed to be able to think of anywhere near efficient solutions to the problems - like in the climactic scene, where the boy should have been the solution. <br /> <br />All in all, it's an entertaining movie, and an enjoyable one. I can see why comic-book addicts would be annoyed, but ultimately what goes for this film goes for all adaptations - provided you keep the theme of the story, the idea, then changing what people do, and how, etc. - within reason, of course - is justifiable.
B000F48CD8|4.0|Great record. Melodic, rockin, but way too short. Guess it was too hot up in that attic to record enough songs to fill up at least 35/40 minutes. Maybe next time...
B00000373U|5.0|I can not praise this album any more than I already have to  <br />everyone, it's absolutely brilliant. And I truly believe that <br />cause it's very rare that I love an entire album, from start  <br />to finish. Either/Or is one of those them. <br /> <br />The late Indie Icon, Elliott Smith is the most underrated  <br />musician I can possibly think of. This man is a genius, his  <br />lyrics are deep and mysterious, yet literal in their own way. <br />I also love how in Smith's records he composes all his music. <br />Guitaring (of course), drumming, and for some people who don't  <br />know he his an amazing pianist who could play Rachmaninoff  <br />after a year of learning to play the piano.  <br /> <br />The Album starts off with \\"Speed Trials\\", which is in fact  <br />possibly my favorite song on the album. The way he sings this  <br />is so melodic and solemn, it really captures the essence of his  <br />songs. One thing I also want to mention is that the first 5  <br />songs alone are literally gold. \\"Alameda\\" is so calming, so  <br />simple, and perfect, and the lyrics in this one are so youtful  <br />in a way, like he wrote it at a young age (you walk down  <br />alameda shuffling your deck of trick cards/over everyone/like some precious only son) <br /> <br />This album is hands down one of my favorites of all time. You  <br />don't even have to be a fan of Elliott to like this, it's just   <br />that good. It's unfortunate that he is no longer with us, a man  <br />of that caliber and shy innocence he was notorious for. Why is  <br />it that the brilliant people in our lifetime leave us in such a  <br />corrupt way? <br />5 STARS. <br /> <br />R.I.P. <br />
0596007124|3.0|This might be a good college text book on the subject since you have a whole semester to complete the book. But for professionals and busy people, this is way too verbose.  Imagine an experienced carpenter who bought a well-hyped replacement tool for a hammer. He would open the `how to' manual of that tool to quickly learn how to use it. But the manual is flooded with things like \\"why you don't want to use the hammer anymore\\", \\"the physics and mathematics behind the replacement tool\\", \\"analogy of the replacement tool and a crocodile\\", \\"why the earth is round\\", \\"why am I stupid to buy this tool\\", so much that the carpenter just can't use the tool right away. In other words, I agree with the 1-star reviewers. But I still give a 3-star because this is better than the \\"for dummies\\" book on the same subject. (I noticed that negative reviews of this book got lots of `not-useful' votes. So I expect this review to also have lots of those. Ultimately, the buyers are the one to decide.) <br /> <br />The book says you may still use the book even if you do not know java but knows c#. I disagree. Many java implementations of the gang of four patterns are different from the corresponding c# implementation as far as optimization goal is concerned. For example, take the popular singleton pattern. You may use a similar java approach for c# but the optimum way to implement it in c# is different (see Microsoft's Enterprise Solution Patterns using Microsoft .Net, to see how to implement singleton in c#). Also take the observer pattern. In c#, it is a simple subscription to an event by a client object from the publishing object. <br /> <br />If you are new on the subject, shop for a more concise book. True, repetition helps you learn, but talking about books, isn't it that you can always re-read the portion you do not understand?  <br /> <br />Additionally, shop for similar books that have examples in the language you are using. <br />
B0000033P2|5.0|Yet another one of ELP's early masterpieces. Pretty much the same pattern as \\"Tarkus\\", but more introspective. A feeling of victimization seems to permeate the songs on the album, particularly on the obvious single, and its most famous tune: \\"From The Beginning\\". Oddly, though, though Emerson is as prominent on this album as he usually is, it is Lake who owns it, as he did on the \\"Love Beach\\" album, the lyrics having more import this time around. You find yourself grasping its more accessible libretto, as it touches some vulnerable, persecuted part inside you. There is, of course, the prerequisite classical cover on this album, represented by \\"Hoedown\\" from Copland's \\"Rodeo\\", and it's probably the one tune just about everybody thinks of when they think \\"Emerson, Lake and Palmer\\", so much so, that, on the copy I have, there's actually a live reprive of the song ending the album.<br /><br />\\"The Endless Enigma\\", part one and two, starts off very hushed and eerie...you are immediately put in mind of a lonely, dark road, somewhere in New Mexico perhaps, no moonlight, perhaps 2am RMT, with some disembodied spotlight scanning a fifty foot area, with prairie dogs and possum scurrying across it, perhaps a jackrabbit or two also, as minor predators chase them. Then Emerson comes in with his Jimmy-Smith-meets-E.-Power-Biggs organ and there's no looking back! Emerson goes absolutely Gestalt on this album, on the \\"Trilogy\\" cut, a cut that seems like it SHOULD have been part of the \\"Enigma\\" suite, where he hits you with such force and volume that you can almost SEE the sound coming out of the speakers! Lake Then goes off on a egomaniacal rant during \\"Enigma\\" that hints at his now familiar messianic tendencies, that puts him up as judge of all mankind. This feeling is infused in all the songs on the album with lyrics, even the lighthearted \\"Living Sin\\" seems to be assessing SOMEbody! Only \\"The Sheriff\\", another \\"fun\\" tune, seems to escape this attitude.<br /><br />After you've heard this album, I promise you, you will be exhausted!<br /><br />Buy it!!, I promise you, you will be exhausted!    Buy it!!

She is 17 months old now and absolutely loves \\"Brown Bear\\". The illustrations are unique and large so it's easy for her to focus. She wants us to read it to her every night and doesn't seem to tire of it.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all babies and toddlers.
B000002B7O|5.0|from start to finish this album brings you on a journey which will send shivers up your spine when you hear how fresh ozzy sounds and the production of the album captures what ozzy set out to do, create a masterpiece which has songs that are all excellent from the first to the last. even though i am a big fan of tommy aldridge and rudy sarzo i don't think they had what it would take to write songs like this album. tommy is my favorate drummer and when i heard bark at the moon i was dissapointed. it seems like the song structures didn't have the same quality that was on diary. i guess it was mainly randy too. bob daisley and lee kerslake together with randy wrote all their music with bob writing lyrics for the first two albums. lee kerslake is a killer drummer that has a lot of experience in the music business, and bob daisley has been around with rainbow, uriah heep and other bands as well. when they wrote the songs for diary they put their mark on every song, the slow part in diary, the marching drum part, that is lee kerslake, kller part, the intro to over the mountain with the fast triplets is one of the best drum intros ever. with randy having the schooling from teaching guitar at his moms store. these extremely talented and experienced song writers got together to make this album their little baby, may i say. ozzy still sounded good and i had heard that they wanted to do songs in different keys. when i listen to this album it makes me think what a combination of musicians do when they are put to the test. i am sure even if they did another album with sarzo and aldridge it would not have been as good, great players for the road though. my favs from this album are over the mountain, little dolls, s.a.t.o , and diary of a madman, but they are all great, so get ready to hear the best band that ozzy had and turn it up loud, oh ya, don't buy the new version with the added bass and drums, it just totally sucks. bob and lee definately got burned from sharon, what a dissapointment for ozzy. hope you like my review.
0736041850|5.0|No matter what type of exercise program you are doing or starting, this book will help you do it better - not just weight training either. The illustrations really help to get your mind focused on what's happening during specific exercises and everyone seems to agree that is a good thing. Great layout. When you are ready to vary your routine this book can help you by identifying substitute exercises for those you are getting tired of or simply don't yet have the strength to perform. You should be aware that this book does NOT give you a routine to follow, but rather verbally and visually sets out numerous exercises that will be the staples of just about any resistance training program. The information on common training injuries - identified by bright yellow pages throughout - is also indispensible.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This was a wonderful adaptation of Austen's book. The quality of the film and theatrical aspect were beautiful and very well done. I thought the casting was perfect. I preferred the darker, brooding Darcy played by Matthew McFadyen in this version. I felt that each actor fit their character in looks better than some other adaptations. Rosamund Pike (Jane) was actually pretty, unlike the actor who played Jane in the BBC/A&E version.  <br />I was disappointed by all the holes in this movie. It really didn't give enough information for someone not familiar with the book to understand the background of the characters and the traditions of that time. They made it seem as though Bingley and Jane didn't spend much time together as well as Darcy and Elizabeth. I felt that it was almost hard to believe that in the very little time Bingley spent with Jane, there was no way he could have already been in love and the same with Lizzie and Darcy. But I understand that they couldn't have a theatrical adaptation last for many, many hours to show each and every time they encountered each other. The artistic changes made in this movie were worthwhile. The scene in the rain with Darcy proposing to Lizzie was wonderful, and Catherine de Bourgh showing up at night was fun too. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, a very good movie, done very well. I am very pleased with it and will watch it over and over again. Even if it didn't follow real closely to the book, the important parts of the story were there and the emotions of the characters were still conveyed perfectly. I am quite satisfied and anyone who is an Austen fan should add this to their collection.

B000EOTAM6|2.0|The live action adaptation of Peter Chung's beloved anime series Aeon Flux is one of the most visually impressive sci-fi films to be released in the last year, and it's also one of the most incredibly trite and tedious as well.  Charlize Theron slips into skin tight leather as the acrobatic heroine/assassin on a mission to overthrow an oppressive regime, I think.  The story of the film takes a back seat to the visuals and to Theron who sleepwalks her way throughout the film's running time, but you'd hardly notice because she looks so damned good.  The action and special effects are nicely done, but the film's incoherent storyline, wasted cast (Frances McDormand and Johnny Lee Miller are wasted beyond belief), and otherwise surprisingly tepid direction from Girlfight director Karyn Kusama make Aeon Flux a film that's strictly for fans of modern, empty sci-fi; and even fans of the anime series that it hardly resembles may find it hard to enjoy.
B000FILW86|5.0|Like with Cheap Trick's self-titled 1997 release, I can not stop listening to this CD!!!  There is so much confidence within Rockford and a certain whimsy that comes off as \\"Yes this is great and we're not even trying,\\" much like the way Heaven Tonight seemed. A few tracks that I especially love are: \\"O Claire,\\" (very Beatles sounding) \\"This Time You Got It,\\" (so energetic) \\"All Those Years,\\" (again, very Beatles-like) and \\"Give It Away\\" (classic Cheap Trick). <br />I strongly recommend this CD.
3832790810|3.0|Ok, let me be clear! If you are a photographer and looking for some new and non-traditional nude poses with this book, you are in the wrong place.<br />There is no doubt that Guido has the talent and the \\"eye\\", and this is truly a great EROTIC book. The photos are artistically erotic and beautiful, and not like any cheap stuff you find on numerous porn sites out there. The models are stunning! Of course there are some inspiring arts - at the end he is still a good photographer. Just, it seems to me all the lighting techniques are all too basic and nothing innovative. Well, I'm not talking \\"nude has to be black and white and in low-key\\", those days have passed long ago. But the lighting in Private room is simply too normal. He even did not use tripod in all of his shots, which lead to hand-shake. I can tell that some blur is intentional, but there are some look really like technical error.<br />Again, on the other hand, if you are looking for some EROTIC nude photos, I highly recommend this one. Just dont buy it for learning more about the real nude art that hangs in museums!

0380789035|5.0|I wouldn't say I was a complete Gaiman fan but I have enjoyed his books in the past. This novel develops his style from the quirky if slightly naive Neverwhere days to it's fullest potential. The story 'drifts with purpose' across an Amercian landscape populated with mythical characters made real by the power of belief and desparate to cling on to their existance in an evolving social framework. A subtle commentary on the power faith with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing to the end plus the odd laugh in incongruous circumstances.

B000BW7QWW|1.0|From all the trailers and hype surrounding it, one would think that Serenity would surpass all expectations. Well, it didn't. It has got to be one of the most cliche`d science fiction movies I have ever seen. If you are reading this -- and are a highly charged fan-- please consider that as a neutral observer my comments are not meant to offend. I am simply pointing out truth without bias in or against the film. <br /> <br />To give the film credit, the special effects were stunning. I loved the introduction to the worlds, and the beautiful alien landscape designs. (Although one of the buildings looks suspiciously like the Dubai Emirates Office Tower of the U.A.E)However the alien landscapes after that are fairly \\"star warsy\\" and nothing really original stands out. The soundtrack was absolutely brilliant also, and was one of the few things that was quite perfect. Some of the ideas highlighted in the movie also had merit; I particularly like the idea that China and America had merged to become the world's greatest superpower. I also liked how Chinese and English were merged in the film. But that is where the praise must end. <br /> <br />The story begins with River Tam who has just escaped an Alliance facility with her brother, Simon. Apparently this girl is a dangerous weapon and a psychic, and so the Alliance must get her back at all costs. This escape scene was far too fake and easy really. It was over before it started. And no one seems to notice that River Tam is the 17 year old incarnation of Haley Joel Osmont from the Sixth Sense. The wide eyes, occasional raspy word and mental breakdown are the only glimpse we ever get of her real character. The fighting scenes weren't bad, but they weren't great either. They could definitely take pointers from another cancelled show like Mutant X -- one that had far more flair, orginality and character development. <br /> <br />After the two renegades are picked up by the Serenity, we meet the cast, and it isn't very pretty.Captain Mal seems to be a carbon copy -- pun intended-- of Han Solo right down to the scruffy hair and wisecracking drawl. He even dresses like him, which is quite unsettling because one gets the feeling that one is watching a bad Star Wars remake. I find it laughable that people actually find Serenity better than the prequel Star Wars films, which were not perfect by any means, but easily beat Serenity.( In the bonus features Josh Whedon even admits that he was heavily influenced by Star Wars. Sounds like a confession to me.) <br /> <br />The characters of Jayne and Zoe are blase`. Jayne is the stereotypical tough guy while Zoe is the token black character that must accompany the all white cast. I can see that the actors are trying to make do with the script they received, but it isn't working. There are brief refences to \\"the war\\" now and then. After a Star Wars like chase through the hills, the soldiers turned thieves, make it back to the ship after Mal shoots a man who wanted to come with them. Zoe  later confronts Mal stating that they never would have left a man stranded in the old days. This scene could have been far more poignant, but Mal's blank stare leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br />After the introductions have commenced, confusion ensues. Apparently they want to kick off River and Simon. There's supposed to be some conflict here but the others don't seem to have much of a problem kicking them off -with the exception of Kaylee. Simon and River head on their way when River loses control in a bar and kills a few dozen people. Once again the fighting isn't all that great. River Tam looks like a skeleton with eye bags. The beautiful, curvy woman on the front of the Serenity cover was truly put their to be eye candy, because River's eyes never become blue. And she doesn't look anything like she does in the movie. <br /> <br />Back to River, subliminal messages are planted in an \\"Oaty Bar commercial\\" where cute  Chinese style cartoons suddenly \\"burst outof their blouses\\" due to eating an oaty bar. Disturbing to stay the least. Apparently they were planted with sublimnial messages by the Alliance, who hope to track River down by making her lose control. Mal then takes River back to the Serenity and no one except Kaylee is really happy to see them. (And she is probably more happy to get into Simon's manly arms, as they later tumble passionately as the move nears the end) <br /> <br />River then has more of her crazed fits and mutters 'Miranda' over and over. They then go to the planet and discover the  <br />\\"terrible secret\\". For the sake of the reader I won't spoil the ending, but this  does not explain why River is a deranged maniac. (I know she was experimented on but the viewer was lead to believe that River Tam's outbursts were related to the secret.) River then eerily metamorphoses into the tiny, black haired girl from the Ring. Fighting ensues as the crew decides to reveal the secret to the known worlds so that the Alliance's power is weakened. <br /> <br />More fighting ensues as the assasin sent to trail them, the only interesting character in the film, arrives. There is even more fighting and at the end of the scene River Tam has suddenly become Mila Jovovich from Resident Evil. The pose seems xeroxed right out of the movie which is really strange. (The 'secret' too seems 'inspired' from this same movie in case you were wondering) Inara , the courtesan, is confined to the looking-pretty-staying-behind-the-brave-hero-role. Similar to mary Jane fromt the first Spider man movie. <br /> <br />Overall, I had to fight to keep my eyes open. And yet I continued to watch, waiting to find out the secret. Perhaps I thought it would redeem the whole movie, but I was to be sorely disappointed. No offence to Firefly fans, but if the T.V show was anything like the movie I can see why it was cancelled.  <br /> <br />This movie is really all hype, and the only reason it was made because Josh Whedon is the creator of Buffyand Angel. With his name behind the movie the people at Universal could guarantee to tap into his legions of fans. In a few years time everyone will remember Star Wars and Lord of The Rings. But no one will remember Serenity.

B000FILW86|5.0|I'm writing this with red eyes, not from the herb but from the relief and the memories coming back strong. In my home where us kids were the class of 76'-80' it became a ritual of the any new Cheap Trick release to gather around the turntable and fawn over the album photo's while listening intently to each track play into our virgin ears,it was a great time with great songs, but as the 80's continued this event began to be a stress and with grit teeth you would try to convince yourselves that the next song played would be the real deal, a real zinger that would make you extra proud of that bumper sticker and poster over your bed. Even if CT is not your favorite band you know that feeling about something you loved that became hopeless. <br />  The Listening of \\"Rockford\\" began believable, after all the first three songs of any album are the sure things, but seeing the track #'s advance and the songs not loosing but GAINING quality absolutly shocked me big time, and that continued 5,6,7, I thought there is no way! 8,9, I began to well up inside 10,11 Wow, I was and still am so happy that the Band that gave me all those good times so long ago had really, REALLY found their way back home, back home to Rockford and back home to the hook filled  <br />driving songs that made us so happy, so happy we could CRY. <br /> <br />P.S. Buy this CD and truely compare Robin's Vocals to anything you have ever, or will ever hear. Unbeleavable.
0393317552|1.0|I have some concerns with respect to the credibility of the book: \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" by Jared Diamond. I felt that I had to \\"second guess\\" most of his evidence, because it was ambiguous, incomplete or false.    Firstly, Diamond uses the term \\"Eurasian\\" to describe cultures and societies, when the term is usually used to describe a geographical landmass or tectonic plates. Throughout the book, he uses the term \\"Eurasian\\" when it supports his hypothesis and replaces the term with European or western Eurasian to support another part of his thesis. He doesn't separate Europe and Asia to explain societies and cultures, even though Europe and Asia contain different religions, cultures and languages but separates \\"North Africa\\" from \\"Sub-Saharan Africa\\" even though they are part of the same continental landmass and have more commonalties. On pg. 161, Diamond attempts to explain his reasoning behind using the broad and vague term \\"Eurasian\\", when he states that: \\"my use of the term \\"Eurasia\\" includes in several cases North Africa, which biogeographically and in many aspects of human culture is more closely related to Eurasia than to sub-Saharan Africa\\". I believe Diamond confuses contemporary North African culture with the cultures that inhabited Northern Africa from 10,000 BC to 8th century AD. For example, from pre-dynastic to the mid-late stages of the Ancient Egyptian civilization, the ancient Egyptians had contact and traded with cultures in Ethiopia (sub-Saharan Africa). The Ancient Egyptian and Amharic language (Ethiopia) belong to the same language group which is Afro-Asiatic, and also belong to the same sub language group, which is Semitic. Diamond makes vague generalities in supporting his thesis and fails to engage significant evidence that challenges his thesis.      When studying the development of different cultures and the spread of food production and technology, he alters the definition of different terms to fit his hypothesis. Any hypothesis can be supported if you constantly change the variables you are testing. I found that part the most distracting. He does this with the terms \\"North African\\" and \\"Sub-Saharan African\\", terms that carried little meaning between 13,000 BC until the 7th century, but are used to separate the significant accomplishments of Ancient Egyptians (Africans) with other Africans. On p. 92, he states that: \\"the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia and later, or not at all, on other continents.\\" That statement is false, since written records of the Ancient Egyptian (African) language have been dated from about 3200 BC, making it the oldest and longest documented language. The Sumerian language, as Diamond claims is the oldest language, developed around 3000 BC. Furthermore, a recent archeological discovery has suggested that some Gerzean pottery with early hieroglyphics located in Egypt could have originated since 4000 BC.  Ancient Egyptians were also the first to develop mathematic concepts (ie. Decimal system) and science (ie. astronomy, medicine) during that time period as well, and significantly influenced Greek science and mathematics. Diamond does not mention any of this and I believe that he leaves out significant achievements by non-Europeans to support his thesis.    Throughout the book, Diamond also poses the following question in the background: \\"Why were Eurasians, rather than Native Americans or sub-Saharan Africans, the ones to invent firearms, oceangoing ships, and steel equipment?\\" But Diamond doesn't engage the most basic question relating to the motives of these cultures: Did Native Americans or Sub-Saharan Africans have a need for firearms/oceangoing ships? More to the point, did the Native Americans, sub-Saharan Africans, and other so-called non-Eurasians, want firearms/oceangoing ships? The answer would have forced Diamond to research the cultures and religions of Native Americans and Sub-Saharan Africans in more detail, rather than explaining it with geography and/or food production.    Also, he does not include the significant accomplishments of Ancient Egypt, including papyrus, an early form of paper, that originated in Africa not Europe or Asia. On pg. 190, Diamond states that: \\"Continental differences in axis orientation affected the diffusion not only of food production but also of other technologies and inventions.\\" It is known that Ancient Egyptian technology including scientific/medical discoveries traveled along the north/south axis towards the Middle-east and eventually to ancient Greece. Diamond doesn't mention any of this, which further questions the credibility of the book.    Another problem with Diamond's style is that he seems to negate the influences of Non-Europeans, specifically Africa and China, to the current Western hegemony, ie.) gunpowder from China, natural resources from Africa, by either not mentioning them at all or underemphasizing their importance. It is quite likely that without the influences from non-European civilizations that current Western hegemony would not exist today. He also makes outright false statements such as in p.247 when he states that: \\"Delivered in grenades, rockets, and torpedoes, those incendiaries played a key role in Islam's eventual defeat of the Crusaders.\\" According to historical records, there is no evidence to suggest that grenades, rockets and torpedoes were used during the Crusades.    I agree that the domestication of plants and animals could predispose agriculturalists to further development, however geography and domestication of animals and plants alone is insufficient to support his thesis without explaining the role of the people and societies occupying the geography. Geography might be a factor to explain how Western Civilization became the dominant civilization in the world today, however European civilization did not arise in a vacuum. Regardless of the probable geographic advantage of Europe and Asia, factors such as political intentions, morals, ethics, religion and culture all served to explain why some civilizations were determined to expand and build empires through conquest, while others did not.    Jared Diamond is an evolutionary biologist and biogeographer by training, however he deals with subjects that he is not qualified to address, such as history, anthropology, archeology, and sociology to name a few. Diamond claims that his theories offer an alternative explanation to traditional racist dogma, however I believe his theories do just the opposite. By stating that Europeans developed into the dominant civilization by \\"chance\\" or \\"luck\\" with respect to geography, strengthens racist theories that European civilization was \\"destined\\" to become the most powerful.    My criticisms have nothing to do with \\"political correctness\\", but rather I take issue with Diamond's style of revisionist history that does not emphasize the influence and significance of non-European civilizations towards current Western civilization. While reading the book, I was constantly second guessing the facts of Jared Diamond because they were either inaccurate or ambiguous.

B00006CXXU|5.0|This is my favorite CD, which I've had for nearly three years, since it came out. I love it so much that when a couple of tracks started to skip, I had to buy a new one (which I hardly ever do). Christina's vocals are amazing, the lyrics are heartfelt and beautiful, and she creates some of the best pop music I've heard.  <br /> <br />What I love most about this cd is the versatility it shows. Song styles vary from club (Dirrty), to inspirational power ballad (Beautiful, Soar), to rock (Make Over, Fighter), to hip-hop (Can't Hold Us Down), to R&B (Impossible, Loving Me 4 Me), to funk (Underappreciated). My favorite song, possibly ever, is the second song on the cd, Walk Away. It's a beautiul, emotional, haunting song about the burn of heartache, done in a more traditional blues/soul/jazz style that Aguilera is continuing to experiment with on her upcoming cd.  <br /> <br />I believe Christina Aguilera will be around for a long time, and will continue to impress with her vocal and artistic abilities. This is her best cd so far.
B00004W221|5.0|Rudy is based on a true story about a young boy (played by Sean Astin) growing up in a blue-collar family with a dream to someday go to college and play football at Notre Dame.  His family and teachers say he's not smart enough, not athletic enough, and why doesn't he accept his fate working in the local steel mill with his father and brothers.  He refused to let his dream die and becomes a walk-on player. <br /> <br />The original movie came out in 1993.  Sean Astin was in The Lord of the Rings.  Ned Beatty portrays his father.  David Anspaugh is the director. <br /> <br />Rudy is one of my all-time favorite movies.  The acting is wonderful, especially Sean Astin's performance.  The fact that it is a true story kept me watching from the beginning to the end.  The music score is well written and inspirational. <br /> <br />I would recommend Rudy to anyone, young or old, who has a dream and needs the inspiration to pursue it.   <br />
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I have always been an RHCP fan and they continue to amaze with this latest CD...Although there are some songs that could've been left off there is definitely enough great songs for two cds... <br /> <br />BEST Songs: <br />1. Snow (Hey Oh) (BEST SONG BY FAR) <br />2. Tell Me Baby <br />3. Hard to Concentrate <br />4. Storm in a Teacup <br />5. Wet Sand <br />
B00005MEW1|3.0|I thought on the whole the music was very fitting, I sort of find it running through my head, which is sort of disconcerting. On the down side, yes, they can't make up their minds whether it is Dracula or Orlock, and there are other things that are rather disturbing from an authenticity standpoint. To me, there is no excuse for not using the original names and places and so forth - tinting as well, to get as close to Murnau's original film as possible. Had they placed this music with a more faithful rendition of the film, I would be 100% happy because I think the music is a great fit for Nosferatu.
B000EGCITQ|1.0|I dont know if it was the album cover or the album title or both that made me check this cd out. Now, in my mind, this is possibly the worst disc I have heard all year. I wouldn't call it music, not yet. I mean I would be surprised if people are actually listening to Pink. The music lacks substance, a logical conclusion of a rhythm, it sounds quite forgetful and nausea inducing. I don't think Pink should make anymore discs. Complete waste of my time. Want to check out some good pop? Keep looking. Anything but Pink.
B000FILW86|4.0|First off, Cheap Trick are one of my favorite all time bands. They are indeed a class act that stick to their guns and write good old fashioned rock & roll style tunes. The last 10 to 15 years, critics have shun then, radio stations ignore them and you just never really hear anyone talking about them, yet they manage to survive and thrive at that.<br /><br />They are an enigma in so many ways. I mean who are these guys really? They don't look like a rock band, or at least two of them don't and yet here we are talking about yet another release from a band that nobody seems to know anything about. What's with that? Well I'll tell yeah, it's called loyalty from both the band and it's fans. Cheap Trick has for the most part, never really let it's fans down. Sure not all their releases were stellar, yet the Cheap Trick vibe was always present and always honest to it's fans and that speaks volumes.<br /><br />Now for what I thought about this effort. Well after listening to it a number of times, I'm pretty pleased with what I've heard. It's definitely a very good release from these guys and certainly better than the last few efforts. However I would not go as far as calling it a great cd or an earth shattering release. Rockford is a very solid cd that does return Cheap Trick somewhat to their earlier days. It's a really strong release with a massive amount of old school vibe to it, yet it still sounds very fresh in somany ways. This cd is without a doubt their best release in a long time and a welcome addition to any Cheap Trick collection. I'd certainly give it a 4 outta 5 though without any hesitation.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like Cheap Trick and apparently their are still many of us who do, you'll like this cd.
0688156819|5.0|This book is gruesome and shocking but at the same time very touching.  Maybe only Tim Burton can handle this delicate balance.  Melancholy can be read in less than 15 minutes.  But all the short stories are incredibly moving.  You might think twice before passing it on to a child though.  It could be disturbing for the little ones.
0380820846|4.0|As you have already read about the synopsis of the novel, I'll not repeat it here.<br /><br />This is what I expected Colin's story to be.<br /><br />Not has in depth as Anthony, definitely not has passionate as Benedict (My favorite) just light hearted.<br /><br />I will say I was most please that we saw another side of Penelope.<br /><br />I really recommend reading the other books in the series just so you can get a better understanding of who Colin is.
0062502182|4.0|This is an excellent companion reader to bring before going on a long journey.  A good friend of mine gave me this book before I went on a six month long backpacking trip to Europe and North Africa.  It is the most appropriate thing to read when you are going through major professional and personal changes in your life.  It helps a lot with the introspection.
B000001EG6|4.0|Dick James Music still had enough faith in Elton after the relative failure of his debut effort, \\"Empty Sky\\". And thank goodness! This album is on a totally different plane of quality and craftsmanship than \\"Empty Sky\\". For the effort, Gus Dudgeon was brought in to create a lush, full sound, which would be a characteristic of all the albums he produced for Elton. In addition, Paul Buckmaster provided the masterful orchestral arrangments. The result was a masterpiece for its time. <br /> <br />Everyone knows \\"Your Song\\". But Buckmaster's orchestral arrangments lend themselves just as well to ballads like \\"I Need You to Turn to\\" to authentic rockers like \\"The King Must Die\\" and \\"Take Me to the Pilot\\". The backing gospel vocals on \\"Border Song\\" are truly uplifting. \\"Sixty Years ON\\" is a true masterpiece: the music and lyrics providing a gravitas seldom matched by any of Elton's work. \\"No Shoe Strings on Louise\\" is a great country song...a breath of fresh air from the otherwise heavy feel of the rest of the album. Then there is \\"First Episode at Heinton\\"...oh well...I guess that's what the fast-forward button is for. This song sounds like something on the old goth soap opera, \\"Dark Shadows\\".  <br /> <br />The remastered version throws in a fiery version of \\"Bad Side of the Moon\\" as well as \\"Rock and Roll Madonna\\", two fantastic early rockers from Elton. This album marks Elton's real break out as an artist.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This new double disc is stunningly brilliant.  Truly great music grows on you slowly and then stays in your head and that's exactly the case with Stadium Arcadium.  I will say that the first disc is stronger than the second.  Every song on the first disc is among RHCP's best stuff and certainly worthy of airplay.  The second disc is a 10, too, and could easily stand alone as a new release but has songs more for the cult RHCP followers. <br /> <br />Both Stadium Arcadium CD's have been playing non-stop in my player since its release date.  Every song is great.  (It's amazing how talented this band is to be able to come up with so many endearing original songs.)  The best song overall is \\"Especially in Michigan\\", maybe their best ever.  Give these CD's at least 6 attentive listens and it will become the crown jewel of your record collection. <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium will be seen in the future as the product of a band at their absolute pinnacle.  I have all of the band's albums and this is their best, which says so much given their other hits (is it mind boggling or what the catalog this band has produced?)  RHCP have been in the game for over 20 years and this is the result of musicians mastering their craft.  (People have said U2 is the best band but their last album is a red-headed stepchild compared to this one.)  Stadium Arcadium is gold.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|This CD came from the 1988 Live HBO Special that was one of the best musical performances to come along in quite awhile. Roy is joined with many musical greats in both vocal & instrumental talents. This CD is the highlight of Roy Orbison's career. If you own this CD, then you must buy the DVD. To see the performance live is a very special treat.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|I confess I did not get the special edition, but nonetheless, I purchased the album anyway. I listened to 6 times in the past two days, and let me tell you, a great studio album since \\"Ray Of Light\\" in 1998, It has been a while since I bought a studio album of Madonna's . But with every song you pretty much have to listen to with your eyes closed, the beats are amazing!!! The first three songs pulls you in and, \\"Get Together\\" is playing in my head as I am writing this, this shows you how much this album is affecting me. Aside from the first three, the rest is awesome, like \\"Forbidden love\\", \\"Issac\\", \\"Push\\", \\"How High\\",\\"Jump\\" and other songs that will pretty much have you dancing, but not in the car, that could be dangerous. Either way, you'll love it if you are a Madonna fan, or a dance fan.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|I don't like to review movies I haven't finished watching yet, but in this case I'll make an exception.  Because this movie absolutely isn't worth starting, much less finishing.<br /><br />The movie is based on Anthony \\"Swoff\\" Swofford's memoir of his tour of duty in Operation Desert Storm.  Not surprisingly, we get the whole story of Swoff's experience in the miltary from his own point of view.  This wouldn't be such a bad thing, except that as a viewpoint character, Swoff is biased, myopic, and pretty close to useless.<br /><br />I knew I was in for a bad journey when the movie began with a vision of the protagonist's boot camp.  We watch the ritualized humiliations and debasements Swoff undergoes at the hands of his unaccountably sadistic drill instructor (DI).  These humiliations are exaggerated beyond realism, a hoary old narrative device intended to make us sympathetic with the hero.  But this part of the movie is over in barely five minutes, much too short a time for us to even learn the characters' names, much less build any sympathy.<br /><br />But when the DI begins striking Swoff for no reason, culminating in smashing the kid's head into a chalk board for no reason other than that he can, this is a major strain on the willing suspension of disbelief.  It is strictly against regulation for DI's to strike or curse at recruits.  But I guess the creative team behind this film didn't trust you and me as the audience to sympathize with Swoff if his DI was merely hard-nosed and mean.  So they reach for crass, unmotivated violence to keep us hooked and steer us to the desired conclusion.<br /><br />This is just the first of many moments where this movie tries to duplicate the artistic success of Stanley Kubrick's vastly superior Vietnam film Full Metal Jacket.  But that movie gave us a much longer boot camp scene, so we felt like we were seeing an experience rather than being crudely manhandled.  And where Swoff is supposed to be an unaffected hero for us to care about, Kubrick's Private Joker was supposed to be an unreliable point-of-view character.  Kubrick trusted us to sort out his hero's biased viewpoint.  This movie doesn't trust us to remember the characters' names and relationships from one scene to the next.<br /><br />Like Private Joker, Swoff goes from boot camp to the war, though Swoff pauses for Advanced Individual Training.  In both AIT and the theatre of combat, Swoff stares at the world with a kind of wide-eyed wonder that makes Elijah Wood's Frodo look cynical by comparison.  Most notably, the bad treatment he receives at boot camp continues unabated.  Whether it's his thick-skulled battle buddies, his harsh platoon captain, or a dim journalist sent to his unit to cover the non-war of Operation Desert Shield, somebody is always doing him dirt somewhere.<br /><br />And crucially, Swoff is presented to us as a passive victim of this dirt.  With only one notable exception, nothing bad that happens to him is ever his fault.  He is not an actor, he is acted upon.  I can imagine making a movie with myself as the hero, in which everybody throws mud and spits on me for no good reason.  But come on, the only reason we ought to be interested in a character like this is because he's so perspicacious that he recognizes the part he plays in events, or else he's so self-centered that, like Private Joker, he has no idea how unreliable he actually is.  Swoff lacks the courage to be either of these; he just presents himself as helpless in the throes of forces over which he has no control or influence.<br /><br />The movie can't even decide how to reveal its characters to us.  At one point, all of a sudden and for no apparent reason, Swoff stops his squad mates on patrol and walks off to speak with some Bedouins they've spotted.  But as Swoff walks away, the camera stays with the squad.  We're left hanging for about two minutes without a point-of-view character, which means that, for about two minutes, the forward thrust ofthe narrative grinds to a halt.  And when Swoff returns, we find out he's been speaking to the Bedouins in their own language.  Swoff speaks Arabic?  Wow!  Prior to that moment, the movie had given us no reason to believe he knew anything at all beyond what the Army absolutely needed him to know.  If a character revelation like that is going to come out fairly late in the movie, it needs some prepared foundation.  Except, apparently, here.<br /><br />Perhaps, toward the end of the film, some event transpired to mitigate this tiresome drivel.  But when I looked at the counter on my DVD player and saw that I had been watching vor seventy-five minutes, and it felt like the movie was mired in a hypertrophic Act I from Hell, I stopped the disc.  I'd already lost more than an hour of my life to this pelf.  I went and read a book.

B000B5UL7G|5.0|My liking of Robbie Williams sits out of cilter with most of the music I listen too. But in the same respect I love good story tellers in music and after all that is what Mr Williams does best. That and his [...]-sure attitude that makes it hard to hate him for too long. I am not sure how others will feel but I see a similarity between him and the great story teller Alice Cooper. Infact a great deal they are two of rock/pops best entertainers who don't mind mixing up the themes in any given release. Both have a razor blade hidden amongst even the sweetest of lyrics.<br /><br />So onto the music well certainly with a change in partnership there will be change. Certainly the songs offered are far more meloncholy (bar one or two) but really this is the way the material has been heading for some time, especially on previous release 'Escapology'. He is growing up. He always has a lot to say about it and says it in abundance. There are songs of not feeling worthy of love, regret of lacking love, self doubt whilst living the high life where to the outsider everything is to be envyed. Occasionally slipping into a Bowie-esque trance we have 'Spread Your Wings', and then a tint of UK Ska early eighties in 'Tripping'. 'Ghosts' is a great opener which almost displays disbelief from Williams that he is still standing and people are still prepared to listen. 'Make Me Pure' is stripped and wears its heavy heart on its sleeve very nice indeed really being an aucoustic led piece of poetry. 'Advertising Space' is sublime in the same way that 'Feel' was. A tribute to Elvis and celebrity, it is completed by a very nice orchestration that swoons in the back ground. 'Please Don't Die' is low key and is the owner of a great chorus and again Bowie like phrasing. 'Your Gay Friend' seems a little like filler and a little too lite for this great release, perhaps a grower later. 'Sin Sin Sin' is electronic pop much like 'Radio' if not a little cheerier a summer hit for sure. The female vocals used in conjunction with Robbie's voice add a new element. 'Random Acts of Kindness' has an Eastern mysticysm attached and is blunt in asking at each bridge why people just can't get along and show each other basic respect. 'The Trouble With Me' is surely The Smiths with a little less angst and continues the high quality. The Stones obviously came into the studio for 'A Place To Crash' a great party song that will go down a storm live with doo wop horns and brassy female backing singers. Great! William's seems to like to end things on a sombre note and does again with 'King of Bloke and Bird' another therapy session it would seem and a look into his future in his thrirties, he seems to fear loosing youth. A little blue perhaps its predecessor would have been a better closer.<br /><br />So there we have it. An artist who is as British as a seaside holiday in a caravan and loved in his home land and many parts of the world as a result. Don't forget though to appreciate how fine a song writer and singer he is too.conjunction with Robbie's voice add a new element.

B00005MP58|5.0|I'm reticent to look at any production and say, \\"This is the definitive interpretation of the book!\\" but A&E's Pride and Prejudice makes a good case for such a statement. <br /> <br />Austen fans will be enthralled with a production that adheres to the book AND is entertaining to watch.  The costumes, sets, music, and direction are excellent.  The casting couldn't have been better.  Jennifer Ehle makes a perfect Lizzie, Colin Firth is perfect as Mr. Darcy, and the two have excellent chemistry.  The Bennets are well cast as individuals and work well as an ensemble; I have no trouble believing them as a family unit.  Julia Sawalha is a particular standout as Lydia, and you'll really enjoy watching Mary (Lucy Briers) try to flirt with the brilliantly cast Mr. Collins ( David Bamber). <br /> <br />The \\"movie\\" originally aired as a five-part mini series, so, while it runs fairly smoothly, there are still parts where you could easily stop the DVD if you just don't have a 5-hour block to watch TV.  There aren't a lot of extras, but the ones present are worth viewing. <br /> <br />If you can buy only one Austen production, choose this one.  It's awesome. <br />
B000007T1M|5.0|\\"Spiders\\"!! Enough said...greatest song ever? Well to me it is, 5 stars only because of \\"Spiders\\". As for the album as a whole its actaully just an average System outing. \\"Toxicity\\" is the gold standard for SOAD and it was their peak moment in music history. \\"Steal this album\\" is also very good and very underrated. So their self titled debut is a solid start to an outstanding politcally charged band and worth picking up or downloading. One more thing about future SOAD, Serj has to be on display more as he spews forth some hauntingly beautiful vocals like in the afformentioned \\"Spiders\\". That is when SOAD really shines, when there is Serj, Serj, and more Serj. No offense to Daron but leave the singing to you know who.
0060825219|5.0|This is a curious book, investigating what love really means to one person, learning how the subject of that love reacts to it, and consequentially how this alters the way in which love is then given.<br /><br />What you have is a man who's wife has vanished, after having first made him realise his dream. Then he has to establish why she's left him, if left him she has, and how, when he finds this out, he must go about dealing with it.<br /><br />Again as with other books by this authour you find yourself examining things in your mind which relate to paralells in the story, so that you learn from it, and gain strength from it, negatives become positives, a learning curve, and an invitation to better yourself through lifes trials.<br /><br />Also, again, i was put in mind of Antoine de Saint Exup&eacute;ry's book, The Little Prince, the same as i was when reading The Alchemist.<br /><br />I was impressed, and that takes some doing.
B000FDFVZ6|3.0|I think the beginning of this book was wonderfully written. But the middle it got a bit on the boring side.  <br />I didn't love it as much as most people, but it was worth reading. It was an interesting story and gave a different viewpoint...from a young girl in heaven.
6305313687|5.0|While that may sound like cliche hyperbole to some, it's true. American History X tells an all-too-real story about modern issues such as racism, affirmative action, and white supremacy. This movie really makes you think about these issues, and for that, along with the fine acting of the cast (especially Ed Norton), this movie is outstanding (a word I seldom use). <br /> <br />The movie deals with Derek Vinyard (Norton), an intelligent, charismatic, and well-spoken neo-nazi skinhead, who was driven to racism after the murder of his father. Vinyard has just been released from prison, and is trying to sever ties with his racist past, and also trying to convince his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) not to follow in those footsteps, as he is starting to do. <br /> <br />The flashback scenes (including the now-infamous scene involving the curb) are very well-done. In black and white, they actually play out like Danny Vinyard's bad memories. <br /> <br />Another interesting point is how well-spoken and articulate Derek is. He actually does bring up good points about Rodney King, and illegal immigration in America. (I am not racist, and do not condone neo-nazism in any way, but I do agree with him on these issues.) <br /> <br />In short, this film is a must-see. Edward Norton was robbed of the Oscar.
0312330537|2.0|Have you ever had an experience where a gregarious, but slightly dodgy stranger engages you in conversation and launches into a rambling series of tall tales about their life to which you respond by smiling and saying \\"Really? How interesting.\\" in an attempt to be polite and non-judgmental - but as time goes on inconsistencies within the narrative become more and more glaringly apparent until with dawning horror you realize that you are in fact sitting next to a delusional psychopath who not only considers you a gullible fool, but possibly intends you mortal harm?  Reading Shantaram I experienced just such an uncomfortable feeling of being taken for a ride by a career grifter.  I missed the hype surrounding the initial launch of the book so I don't know whether it is intended to be a real life story presented as actual fact, or a deliberately hyperbolic allegory built upon a skeleton of events from the author's life.  Clearly a lot of the success of the book so far has depended on its being perceived as the former, and since the incidents in the story are outside my (and probably most readers') direct experience, or otherwise unverifiable (Mumbai underworld activities, mujehadeen guerilla warfare) I am quite willing to give the benefit of the doubt.  However, small implausibilities in the more mundane sections of the novel chip away at the writer's credibility and gradually bring into increasing doubt the veracity of the whole.  For example, overhearing a conversation in Urdu between Karla and Nazeer, Lin says that he understands only every third or fourth word - but conversational Urdu is practically the same as conversational Hindi in which he claims to be fully fluent.  Later he says that he can perform twenty sets of thirty pushups with a minute of rest between sets - please try this at home - it's a pretty tall order for even an Olympic athlete, let alone someone drying out from a three month heroin binge.  On another occasion he writes that nine men were ableto survive for a month in the mountains of Afghanistan with no other food but the flesh of a single goat - how?  These are just a few random examples, but the point is that if we can't trust the author's account of his language abilities, diet or workout routines, can we really trust the more sensational accounts of his apparently superhuman fighting prowess, ability to withstand torture and sexual success with a string of smoking hot babes?  Of course it could be that Roberts' intention is to present events in the hyperbolic, super-real style of 80s Bollywood in which Indian everymen are able to overcome insuperable odds and take on armies of evil gangsters with their bare hands - in which case the novel succeeds brilliantly as a sort of psychadelic, smellovision fable for our times.  But if he is presenting the events of the novel as autobiographical fact with a completely straight face then one can't help suspecting that we are reading the delusional ramblings of a self-aggrandizing windbag.  Structurally the book suggests comparisons with Sade's longer works - sprawling lists of sensational incident separated by babbling philosophical treatises - but spiritually the character Lin has most in common with is Tomb Raider's Lara Croft.  If, as I suspect, the book is in fact no more than a colorful fabrication purporting to be true I can't really understand why James Frey was hung out to dry whilst Roberts remains the toast of the town.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|To me there are only a couple of that rare super excellent type of tv series, Millennium and X-files (as groundbreaking as 24 or Lost may be, I don't like them). A new addition to the list would be this. It's got a lot more. How the brothers/father relationship evolves, strong character development, creepy story week-in week-out, how the hunt for \\"the\\" devil progresses yet never disrupts the story line of individual episode, and yeah something tv series don't always give you, great cinematography. All is just superb. Sorry it's so good that i forgot to mention it is a horror movie. Never thought this genre would care about all these things ya....
B000EULJLU|5.0|Ok so this is not Tools best but that would be near impossible to ask since \\"Lateralus\\" is the most perfect album your going to ever come across. \\"Right in Two\\" is the standout track and one of Tools best songs ever. Though most people seem to think it's the somewhat overrated \\"Vicarious\\".\\"The Pot\\" is another awesome Tool outing. As for the so called filler on this album yes \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" and \\"Lost Keys\\" are a tad bit boring,however \\"Viginti Tres\\" is an amazing and beautiful instrumental and a great way to close out \\"10,000 Days\\".It's obvious Tool saved the best songs towards the end of this album. Sometimes you just cannot beat a good instrumental to sit back and relax to and the lack of words can be a good thing. Here is hoping Tool does not wait another 5 years before releasing their next album.
0684853523|5.0|Thank you Stephen King for writing this book! It validated me and the process I go through for writing. The only other thing I have to say about  is that judging from the amount of reviews and how they are torn between love and hate... well that's just another messure of good work.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I thought \\"Californication\\" was a great CD.  Then I thought \\"By the Way\\" was even greater.  But this CD really blows them away.  All songs on these two discs are fantastic.  \\"Especially in Michigan\\" is a great song along with \\"Animal Bar\\".  Great stuff guys!
0375830995|3.0|I recently read The Book Thief by this same author and was so moved that I HAD to pick up I Am the Messenger. I was hoping to have another amazing read, so perhaps my expectations were too high. While I felt it was still well-written with well-developed characters and an interesting storyline, I was disappointed in the end. My comment when finishing was, \\"Huh...that was it?\\" As others have noted, some of Ed's (main character) solutions to his problems were a bit too convenient and simple to be life changing and I was ready for it to be over 3/4 through. This title definitely pales in comparison to The Book Thief (which everyone should read) but I'll still try anything this author dishes out in the future.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I resisted seeing this movie for a long time, thinking who needs another P&P?  It's been done many times, and quite well (BBC miniseries and the Greer Garson, Laurence Olivier versions stand out).  Cynically, I thought this is just another Hollywood grab for some sure dollars. <br /> <br />However, I found this version to be refreshing and inspired.  Many people have commented on the youthfulness of the characters, the transposition to more rural as opposed to drawing room settings, and the more unrestrained atmosphere, as opposed to the buttoned-up proto-Victorian image of versions past.   <br /> <br />However, what I liked about it, was that it had a very clear grasp of the central relationship between Darcy and Lizzy, from the first attractions of their mutual chemistry, to the unfolding and appreciation of their respective characters.  In other hands, the attraction between the two would have been unfathomable, particularly where the dialogue is harsh, but Keira Knightley does a great job conveying the conflict between her head and heart, and the scenes between the two lovers are charged with enough emotion to thrill the heart of any romantic. <br /> <br />Because of the intense focus on the central relationship, the other characters sort of fade into the background, and I don't think Mr. or Mrs. Bennett are done as well as in some other versions.  However, Collins and \\"his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourg\\" are done very well, and the last interview between Lizzie and Lady Catherine is re-cast very well, and is more coherent. <br /> <br />In other words, I think this wasn't just made to make a buck, but made from a sense of trying to draw out some of the themes and relationships and show the characters in a fresh light. <br /> <br />I was enchanted.  This is definitely a buy. <br /> <br />
1581806574|5.0|Dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it. DragonArt: How to Draw Fantastic Dragons and Fantasy Creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper.<br /><br />DragonArt is divided into three major parts, Fantastic Dragons, Unique Details, and Other Fantasy Creatures, along with an introduction, a section on how to use the book, and a brief guide to fantastic creatures.<br /><br />Lessons in this book are progressive in nature, beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design, all illustrated with step-by-step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout. And author/artist Jessica \\"NeonDragon\\" Peffer has a clear, easy writing style that can be easily comprehended, absorbed, and acted upon, an example of which follows below.<br /><br />\\"Okay, so we're going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds. Sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct, but that will happen if your creature doesn't look believable. To help make your dragon as real as possible, base its structure on real creatures,\\" she writes at one point (page 44). \\"The ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat, bird, and reptile body types. The trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out. You want it to feel like a single creature.\\"<br /><br />This advice, incidentally, is very reminiscent of that given by Leonardo Da Vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk, making Peffer well read or naturally very insightful, either of which speaks well for her. Under \\"How You Should Make an Imaginary Animal Look Natural,\\" the increasingly famous Renaissance man writes, \\"You know that you cannot invent animals without limbs, each of which, in itself, must resemble those of some other animal. Hence if you wish to make an animal, imagined by you, appear natural -- let us say a Dragon, take for its head that of a mastiff or hound, with the eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the nose of a greyhound, the brow of a lion, the temples of an old cock, the neck of a water tortoise.\\"<br /><br />DragonArt also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures, including basilisks, chimeras, gargoyles, and griffins.<br /><br />For those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book, a companion DragonArt Kit: How to Draw & Paint Fantastic Creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon. Author Peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art Website NeonDragonArt.com, which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves.imals without limbs, each of which, in itself, must resemble those of some other animal.

B000EQ4G5K|5.0|Been a fan of Rihanna's music since \\"Pon De Replay\\". Her 1st album was good & her 2nd one is even better. I like how she keeps the reggae vibe going. Get your copy today it's worth the money.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I watched this series from the first show to the last (which came much too soon).  It's the story of world-famous New York neurosurgeon, Dr. Andy Brown (Treat Williams), who moves with his two children to a new life in a place called Everwood, Colorado, after the tragic death of his wife.  It's completely captivating right from the start - beginning with Andy giving up the \\"high life\\" and opening a general practice in the (formerly) one-doctor small town and letting everyone know that his medical services will be free!   <br /> <br />A great cast of characters, superbly acted by a wonderful group of actors.  I would recommend this show to anyone.  Everwood was by far the best series television has ever offered and I look forward to the opportunity to purchase seasons 2-4 sometime in the very near future.  If things go as they should, seasons 5 through whatever will also be available for purchase at some point. <br /> <br />If you've never watched, you should.  Great writing, great cast, great music, great everything.  Did I mention this show is great?  Enjoy the show and please continue the efforts to put this series back on TV where it belongs.
B000084T18|3.0|this album isn't bad.  The rest of his albums are PUTRID!!!!  His lyrics in this cd are alright, but the beats are very good.  However, if you want to hear some real hip-hop listen to Big L (most slept on MC of all time!), Wu-Tang, the Roots, Jay-Z, Biggie, Nas,... you get the idea.  But for how much I hate 50 and everything he is about, this album isn't half bad.
B000FILW86|5.0|Since the early 90's Cheap Trick is a band that always seems to border on obscurity whether it be with radio, the media, critics, or rock music fans in general.  Heck even I started to wonder if this band had anything left other than playing gigs anywhere and everywhere doing their hits for the older crowds much like most bands from their generation. <br /> <br />I will admit when I first saw that they had a new album out I wasn't expecting a whole lot other than a couple of good songs and alot of filler.  So by the time I finished listening to Rockford, I was stunned, completely stunned.  I had to check the date on this again to make sure this was actually a new album.  <br /> <br />\\"Rockford\\" my friends just may be the best full studio album put out by any classic rock band in more than 10 years.  I am floored how good this is, I hope it gets the attention it deserves.  <br /> <br />Who would have thought Cheap Trick would produce a gem like this in 2006???   I am still stunned!!!

B00003003R|5.0|In their lifespan of jsut over seven years, Guns N' Roses managed to become one of the best bands ever. With their 1987 debut \\"Appetite For Destruction\\", they managed to create one of the greatest albums ever made. Their two follow ups, 1988's \\"Lies\\" and their 1991 double cd \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" and \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" were solid efforts as well. However, by 1993, due msotly to the behavior of their increasingly self destructive lead singer Axl Rose, Guns N' Roses called it quits. However, their fans still remember them and even today they are still acquiring new fans.<br /><br />Anyone who lived with Guns N' Roses at their peak (unfortunately, I was two and a half when they split) knwos that they were one of, if not the, best live acts around. They always put on an amazing, energetic show and all their fans left happy.<br /><br />This two disc set, \\"Live Era: '87 - '93\\" captures Guns N' Roses live throughout their seven year run. You get heart pouding, blood pumping live versions of their biggest hits, including \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", \\"November Rain\\" and \\"Paradise City\\". You also get to hear some of their lesser known material such as \\"Yesterdays\\", \\"Rocket Queen\\", \\"Used To Love Her\\", \\"Estranged\\" and \\"Patience\\".<br /><br />For the most part, all of the performances are solid and energetic. If you are a big Guns N' Roses fan, then I think you'd be very happy with this album.
0895260131|1.0|Well, reading that the this book claimed to separate the fact from fiction, it only caused fiction to become fact.   There is absoluetly no mention of jihad in the Quran and hadith. EVER. It talks about the civil wars that went on during the Prophet's( peace be upon him) time and lists codes of ethics to be held, but that's all. Terrorism is never allowed. All the codes of war that Muslims were to follow are not by terrorists, making all thier actions the fault of themselves and not the religion. Why is it so hard for people to understand? Religion is perfect, humans are not. Politics has filled everyone's brains and souls that they see things in only my governement against yours, my rights versus yours, my nationality over yours.  Islams states War is not holy, it is a last resort. [...].
B000F6IOBQ|1.0|To me this was an absolutely repulsive movie - am sorry I bought it.  If you like cruel scenes of a vampire attacking and sucking the blood out of a twitching horse this movie is for you!
0385473788|4.0|I'll admit that this book was slow to begin with and hard to get into but I really enjoyed it towards the end.<br /><br />The thing that struck me the most about this book is Anne's innocence.  She is aware of the situation that she is in but her passion for life and her faith in people displays her innocence and the fact that she is so young.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the way she obviously matured through the years that she was hiding and completely horrified by some of the topics that she was dealing with in her diary.<br /><br />A very good book.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|AFI still manages to create an album unlike anything on their previous records.  <br /> <br />I've been a fan for almost seven years, and I'll admit, when I first listened to Decemberunderground, I was a little skeptical. I wasn't mentally prepared for it. Miss Murder and Kill Caustic (the previously released tracks) are nothing like the other ten tracks on the album, except for Affliction, and even that's stretching it. But after my second listen, I was in love, and the deluge of genuine emotion on this album touched me in the most poignant, eloquent of ways.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are intense and gripping, despondent and devastatingly real. Some melodies are beautiful and gracefully tragic, while some are reminiscent of AFI's rapid, raw adrenaline past. Quite simply, Decemberunderground dug deeply into my heart, and refuses to let go.  <br /> <br />For those who were expecting an imitation of Sing The Sorrow, or a remake of Black Sails In The Sunset, you'll be disappointed. There are references to AFI's older works on this album, but they're not painfully apparent. You can't compare Decemberunderground to their other records, or base it on a premediated standard, and I imagine if you did, you'd miss the expressiveness that this album has to offer. They've never repeated themselves, and are constantly changing their sound, so holding a grudge against them because you want AFI to musically go back 10 years is just stupid. In a nut shell, enjoy Decemberunderground for what it is - a masterpiece - and leave your preconcieved notions (or desires) that this was going to be the next Answer That And Stay Fashionable at home.  <br /> <br />Here's a small track by track digest: <br /> <br />1) Prelude 12/21 - A nice opener to the album, and the beat's pretty infectuous.  <br /> <br />2) Kill Caustic - The first example of the fast-paced parts on this album. Very straight-forward, no-nonsense, and catchy, with grating vocals and dissonant guitar.  <br /> <br />3) Miss Murder - Reminds me vaguely of a hybrid between the Art Of Drowning and Black Sails In The Sunset, with group \\"Hey's\\" that've been basically non-existent, but dutifully missed by fans, in AFI's songs since 2000. And it's in three, which gives it an interesting, bouncy feel.  <br /> <br />4) Summer Shudder - The melody is dance-worthy and kind of bubbly, and lends hindsight to the album's later electronic feel. The use of effects is awesome.  <br /> <br />5) The Interview - I honestly don't know why everyone's been giving this song such a bad rep. I think the lyrics are gorgeous, like \\"For a change, I'll refrain from hiding all of me from you,\\" and \\"Today, this small favor I'm asking. Hold me - you may drop me tomorrow.\\" And the ending is perfect - the dual vocals coupled with the organ is absolutely stunning.  <br /> <br />6) Love Like Winter - To put it bluntly, the chorus to this song is effing snazzy. There's more hints to Decemberunderground's electronic aspects here, too. I never thought I'd see the day that AFI would use happy synthesizers - but it's a nice change, nonetheless.  <br /> <br />7) Affliction - Haunting, and the chord progression is done extremely well. The lyrics are sad, and when Davey sings, \\"So stay sweetly numb. Remain lifeless, love. Stay sweetly numb. Maintain lifeless love,\\" not only does it break your heart, it shows just how much his voice has matured.  <br /> <br />8) The Missing Frame - I like this song, and I can't really explain why. It's just awesome - like an early eighties pop song, but in a good way, and it's still kind of dark.  <br /> <br />9) Kiss And Control - Wow. This song is beautiful, exquisite, magnificient, insert amazed adjectives here. The chorus is dramatic and downright heartwrenching.  <br /> <br />10) The Killing Lights - I think it sounds like something off of Sing The Sorrw, but that's probably because of the \\"Oh!\\" at the beginning. Overall, it's melodic, but maintains a wee bit of darkness.  <br /> <br />11) 37mm -Almost entirely electronic, and feels like a seducitve mixture of VNV Nation and Clan Of Xymox, which isn't surprising, considering that Ronan Harris helped produce this album.  <br /> <br />12) Endlessly, She Said - A pristine closing track. Its sadness is drawn out to infinite lengths, and is remarkably epic. The last chorus, with the dueling group and single vocals is brillant. As if that weren't enough, the lyrics are fantastic, as well.
B0002VE1XO|5.0|The first time I heard Loreena's music I was with my best friend at the University, ten years ago, trying to escape from the burdens of the world. He gave me a copy of \\"The Visit\\" and I loved every song. I didn't hear from Loreena again until February 2001, when I came into a music store and, by instinct, I bought a copy of \\"Book of secrets\\". This fantastic piece of art transported me to a magic and enchanted place. It was like to be born again in some fantastic land lost between the memories of my childhood and the beginning of my adulthood as Loreena's crystal voice starts surrounding your soul in a soft and lovely atmosphere. \\"The Mummer's dance\\"-one of my favorite pieces-is strongly linked to the most important and clue moments of my life. Every time I feel in a crossroad I play this song, close my eyes and, immediately, everything comes back to its original place.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I have just finished watching The Shawshank Redemption for the 71st time. Every time I watch this movie I am drained yet positively inspired. Every time I watch this movie I feel empowered and strengthened. Every time I watch this movie, I feel a connection between the main characters of this story and my own heart.<br /><br />We've all been in prison in one way or another. Some people are behind steel bars and some people are behind invisible bars but do the bars make us or do they break us? In other words, is it what happens to us or what we do with what happens to us that matters?<br /><br />Andy Dufrane is sent to Shawshank for a crime he didn't commit. While there he suffers through the ins and outs of prison life and yet Andy learns to make the very best of it. He learns how to give out hope even if it is not received. He gives out hope because he still wants to feel normal...to feel human...to feel alive. He knows in the back of his soul that hope is the best of things and through hope, anything is possible.<br /><br />I resisted this movie like a bad disease when it first came out, but a friend and I rented it a year and a half later and we were absolutely mesmerized. You could say it was formulaic, you could say it was too long, you could say a bunch of [...]about it but it still does not diminish the powerful impact that this movie so freely offers. If you don't walk away from this movie feeling better about life, maybe you have given up hope...maybe you're still confined in a prison of your own making.<br /><br />Here's hoping you break free.
B00006RINF|5.0|This is a pretty good release for the most part. The music is all good and I like Cristina's vocals a lot. I also don't really mind the male vocalist singing (if that is what you want to call it) either. It's not perfect or falseto but it's not bad or even terrible like the lead singer from Shadows Fall. I personally like Unleashed Memories a little better, but this is pretty solid too. Great goth metal in opinion. Are they overated? Yes. But they are also good too, which is something rare I guess. I also don't think they sound like Evenescence either. The only similarites is the female vocals though Lacuna's are a whole lot better than Amy Lee's any day. But that is where the similarities end, Lacun being Goth Metal and Evenescence being Goth Rock. This cd on a whole seems to me a little darker than their previous efforts and their latest release also. That doesn't bother me at all because this is goth metal we're talking about. A good buy, no doubt.
B00005OM4N|5.0|(OMG! This is my first review!!!)    Britney may not be Britney Spears' most successful album, but it's her most (dare I say) critically acclaimed.     I do however, have a couple of gripes. The ballad (there is only one present with the exception of \\"That's Where You Take Me\\") here isn't one of the main attractions like Sometimes or When Your Eyes Say It in her previous albums. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman will probably grow on you more than likely if you force yourself to listen to it more than once or twice. But to the average listener, it may come of as a little too cheesy. Another gripe is the lack of a standout single. ...Baby One More Time, Toxic, and Oops!...I Did It Again stand at a gargantuan height above the rest of the songs on their accompanies albums. That isn't the case here. Then again, the album is consistent, a strength previous albums by Britney, lacked.  When its all said and done, this album is one of Britney's finest moments. She evolves as an artist by exhibiting her songwriting as well as focusing on her sexuality. The songs on the album are generally more sharper and the arrangements have a sonic twinkle to them. And while it may not be my favorite album by Britney, I can't deny that it one of her best.     1. \\"Slave 4 U\\" - Thumping exotic beats, SEXY! It sounds so different from anything she's done, awesome song. 9/10    2. \\"Overprotected\\" - It's \\"in your face\\" feel and powerhouse chorus gives it away, an obvious Max Martin produced track. Kinda catchy, I like the message more than the song itself, lol. 7/10      3. \\"Lonely\\" - A fan favorite, that shows a lot of edge and shows an angry side of Britney but pops out once the chorus starts. There's a little rap in the bridge and surprisingly it doesn't come off corny. A very good listen that shows lots of attitude. 8/10    4. \\"Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" - Cheesy yes, but its a point in every girl's life that we all can relate too (well at least the girls anyway). The lyrics are reflectiveand gives us a small insight on the real Britney (at that stage of her life that is). 6.5/10    5. \\"Boys\\" - Born from the snore that was Not A Girl. Boys opens with a funky beat and slightly erotic lyrics provided by the Neptunes. This has a very good bridge, and it's an excellent song to dance to.     6. \\"Anticipating\\" - Neo disco!!! A great addition to the album. 9/10    7. \\"I Love Rock N' Roll\\" - Cover of the Joan Jett classic. Kinda unnecessary addition. 3/10    8. \\"Cinderella\\" - Brit returns to her roots of super pop. Sounds like a leftover from Oops! era. 8/10    9. \\"Let Me Be Me\\" - Awesome beat, great vocals. . .but a mediocre song. 5/10    10. \\"Bombastic Love\\" - One of my favorites. I love it! Dangerously catchy. 8.5/10    11. \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" - One of my favorite songs on the album. A highly energized ballad that shows a gentle side of Britney. 9.5/10    12. \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" - I wish the album would have ended with track #11, this song is comepletely disposable.    Overall = 8/10
0385484518|3.0|My dad bought this book for me after he had previously read and enjoyed it.  I agree with the people who think this book is somewhat cliche, but what interested me was the information about Lou Gehrig's Disease.  I really didn't know anything about it before, so in that sense this book was eye-opening.  It is a very scary disease, and I really hope a cure is found for it ASAP.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|I typically like this kind of guitar sound and production, but this record just doesn't blow my skirt up.  I find it uninteresting and I'm surprised it has so many good reviews.  The sound is laid-back and yet it feels like it's trying too hard to be atmospheric, and it never really lets go.  There are some nice songs here, some duds, and a bunch of stuff in the middle.  Perhaps I'll like it in twenty years, but for now there's plenty of other great stuff to listen to instead.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Before this, Floyd had no real greatest hits album. Instead, they had three different compilations: Relics, Works, and some other one that I forgot the name of. Oh well. But this a fine set of songs here my friend. This also is the second most expensive album I have bought, the first being The Wall. Doesn't matter though, it was money well worth spent. Moving on. This has all their hits on it (well, most of them I guess). It also has some songs form their pre-Dark Side Of The Moon days too, including the title track. In fact, from what I heard, they took about seven minutes from that song for space for the other songs; at over sixteen minutes, it's still a solid track in my opinion. They also edited other songs for length and to make both discs sound like a real album. Most of the songs kinda flow into one another. I love the art and photos also as I always do, Storm always does a good job. My only complaint is why they didn't include tracks form More, Obscured By Clouds, Atom Heart Mother, and Ummagumma. It's too bad, because I would have loved to hear what they would have picked from those albums. Other than that, this is a great compiliation set and I recommend it for those who are long time fans or beginners of the band. You won't regret it.

Anyone who is interested in the behavior of autistic children and is also looking for some laughs should run to the store and buy this book. It's a novel you won't want to miss!
0451191153|5.0|This was a great book as far as the big picture goes.  Not a  fan of Ms. Rand's ridiculous \\"romantic\\" situations or some of the dialogue, but there is a serious moral to the story.  I Read Atlas Shrugged first and I still can't decide if I should have read The Fountainhead first.  I understood a lot more of The Fountainhead because I had read Atlas Shrugged already, but then again if I had read The Fountainhead first I could say the same thing.  In whatever order they're read, both are well worth it.
B000001E29|3.0|Can anyone tell me what a cast recording is?  All the vocals on this CD are by Tom Waits.  I was hoping to get the recording of the cast of the play.  Which means to me that there are some women singing, and several man should be singing as well.  Not Tom Waits on the entire album.<br /><br />Where and how can I get the real cast recording?  Does anyone know?<br /><br />This is a great CD, but I wanted something else.  I wanted a cast recording and singing.
B000E33VWW|5.0|When I read that Phillip Seymour Hoffman was going to be playing Truman Capote, I was aghast: not that he isn't a revealtion as an actor, but he's physicality is light-years from Capote.  It's a bit like having the Venus of Villendorf playing the role of the Frank Lloyd Wright garden sprite. <br /> <br />But PSH totally, completely pulled it off.  This is a brilliant performance; he pulls off the mannerisms, the accent, the vanity, the ruthlessness and the self-doubt of Capote.  One of the most brilliant writers of his generation, Capote managed to squander his talent in an orgy of booze, drugs and self-destructive behavior, culminating in his literary seppuku, a short story titled \\"la Cote Basque\\", a scandelous Roman-a-Clef which led to his banishment from New York society.  This movie follows him from the time between his comet-like burst on the literary world with \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\" and later \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\".  Capote audaciously invented a genre: the non-fiction novel.  This is that story. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is uniformely superb.  As is the script, the art direction (you'll want to take screen-shots), and just about everything else about this movie.  Oddly enough, I find it's excellence off-putting: it's brilliance is not necessarily something that I want to own.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|At first I was not going to buy this album because Miss Murder sounded a little too gothic for my taste but my friend decided to pick it up and I listened to it at his house and first chance I get Im picking up a copy. This album is a good album for them as they have matured a lot more. Plus this is not an album that will appeal to any mass besides the die hard fans who have been with them from the beginning. As I have heard many times its an album that you have to grow on and that really is true for most people because you need to grow up to listen to it. Many people are stuck in the little rut of Black Sails which is a good album but they grew up and you need to as well.
0385491026|5.0|In essence, Cat's Eye is a story about the relationship between victim and bully. But in reality, it is so much more. It is a chronicle of an era, a psychological study, and above all, a beautiful piece of writing. <br /> <br />Elaine Risley is a successful Canadian painter who comes back to the city she grew up in for a retrospective exhibition. Her return to Toronto, a city she always hated, sparks a chain of painful memories and forces her to confront herself. In doing so, Elaine keeps coming back to Cordelia, her best friend who bullied her mercilessly when they were young. Elaine realises that Cordelia is still a part of her life, although she hasn't seen her for years and doesn't know where she is, and that in order to free herself from her memories, she must also free Cordelia. <br /> <br />Elaine's early childhood was spent moving around the north of Canada with her entomologist father, mother and brother. During this time she longed for female friendship, but after moving to Toroto and a permanent school, she realises this is not what she wants. Girls are sneaky and sly. They destroy each other. Elaine feels like an imposter whenever she plays with girls, and has to learn their ways. Boys, on the other hand, are her secret allies. When Cordelia comes into the scene, she almost immediately begins to take out her feelings of inferiority on Elaine. Although Elaine eventually emerges from this bullying intact (or so she thinks), the scars still remain years later. In order to protect herself, Elaine became detached from herself and the events occurring around her, and this continues throughout her later life. This is reflected in the writing style, which can seem cold and clinical in places, but is also incredibly emotive and almost heart breaking as well. <br /> <br />Overall, this book is a beautiful account of someone's life and their attempts to reconcile themselves with their past. Although I know many people who absolutely hated it, I would reccomend everyone at least tries it. Interestingly enough, I didn't like this book much the first time I read it, I found it depressing. But second time round, I fell in love. So give it a try; stick with Cat's Eye till the end, it's worth it.
0307277674|2.0|When I see hundreds of reviews of one book here at amazon, I wonder what encourages the late comers to write further comments. For instance, \\"Harry Potter Book 1\\" has 5212 reviews. Now, what was going through the mind of the 5212th reviewer, what can she/he say that hasn't been already said?<br /><br />For Da Vinci Code there are 3313 reviews already. I will be 3314th (if someone with faster fingers won't beat me to it). I have something to say that hasn't been said before. I can't be one hundred percent sure of course, since I didn't read all the 3313 previous comments, I scanned them quickly. If you find out that this had been previously noted, then my apologies. So, here we go:<br /><br />R&eacute;my, a French, isn't likely to have peanut allergies. It is a stretch to kill a French person with a peanut-laced cognac. Nut/peanut allergy is primarily a North American phenomenon and it is largely unheard-of in Europe. Readers from France: What do you think? Didn't you find this to be a little weird? None of my French friends have ever heard of a peanut-allergy case in France. Please write to me with your comments.<br /><br />No, that was not the only thing that bothered me in the book :-)<br /><br />Like most negative reviewers I also thought the book was, at best, a light-weight entertainment. I like the idea of a mystery novel on the holy grail, but did it have to be so insultingly simple, and so lyrically void and so childishly predictable?<br /><br />The best story I read about the holy grail is to be found in Georges P&eacute;rec's masterpiece Life, A User's Manual (La Vie mode d'emploi).<br /><br />Back to The Da Vinci Code, over at readliterature, we filed this book under \\"rubbish\\" (sorry, I know it hurts when people thrash your favourite book, it happens to me too, but c'est la vie, be brave, you are a big girl/boy), if you would like to read our comments, Dave Barry's take on it, and Anthony Lane's (New Yorker) charming review of the movie, then come to readlit, click on American Lit and scroll all the way down to the garbage can (ouch!).lit, click on American Lit and scroll all the way down to the garbage can (ouch!).
B0000TB01Y|5.0|It's all been said here. This music is wonderfully uplifting and inspiring and the singers, mainly the 2 leads, are remarkable. They make the singers of American Idol look like amateurs, which they are.You will not regret making songs like \\"Popular\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\" part of your musical experience.
0765315246|4.0|I got this book as my \\"eat at lunch break\\" book...  It was perfect for that.  When I was done eating, I could just put it away - it didn't have any big hard to keep track of sequences.  Light reading. <br /> <br />On the other side of the coin, each day at lunch, I got a little smile knowing that I was going back into this book.  I was never bored with it - something that happens too often it seems. <br /> <br />It has surprises, humor, things to think about, action, and sci-fi.  What else can you ask for?
B000001EAQ|4.0|Having received this album second-hand, without previously hearing even a split second of it, or hearing many good things about it, I wasn't sure of what to expect.  I love U2's classic material, but am not a big fan of a lot of what they've done recently, so I certainly didn't have high hopes, but surprisingly, this album turns out to be pretty damn good.<br /><br />Overall, the album has a very techno-influenced feel, and while the band have flirted with such stylings in the past, it wasn't until here that they embraced them full-on.  And contrary to whatever bad expectations one may have about this, there's actually a great deal of strong material here.  \\"Discotheque\\" and \\"Mofo\\" (yes, mofo) are solid techno tracks, \\"Gone\\", \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\", and \\"Last Night on Earth\\" are killer ballads with amazing melodies, and \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" boasts a creeping atmosphere that brings the Doors to mind.  \\"Please\\" is a definite standout, with a very jazzy feel, intermingled with tasteful electronics, and \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" is a nice closer.<br /><br />The album does have its missteps.  \\"Miami\\" is a pretty messy and unpleasant attempt at the techno sound, possibly the first of its kind that the band wrote, before they really hit their stride.  \\"Playboy Mansion\\" features clever lyrics, but a very forgettable melody, and \\"Do You Feel Loved\\", while decent, just doesn't seem to stand out among the rest.<br /><br />While it goes without saying that this isn't what the band does best, this album was a great surprise for me.  Certainly not up there with \\"Achtung Baby\\" or \\"The Joshua Tree\\", but a worthy purchase for sure.  If you have any reservations whatsoever about buying this album, I urge you to give it a try.  Just take it for what it is, and don't keep your expectations too high, and you just might be surprised.
0618477942|5.0|Being a rabid fan of Bechdel's work for years now (including the two stories she did for AMERICAN SPLENDOUR back in her more sketchy-style days), I've often wondered what she would do if she had more space and time to play with.  The answer is FUN HOME, and what a truly amazing work it is. <br /> <br />It's not as funny as an episode of DTOWF; instead, it's more true and profound as Bechdel delves into the more sobering territory of her own past.  Like anyone who prefers to crack jokes at life rather than be mired down in melodrama, DTOWF has reflected Bechdel's ability to confront a problem while safely steering the reader around it to a punchline.  Now she takes the reader down a new path, one that neither she nor the reader may feel entirely ocmfortable traversing, but the journey is then that much more intense.  Armed with beautiful beautiful beautiful art, and a wealth of literary allusions, Bechdel reveals her past and how it was bound up in the secrets her father kept.  But never does she lapse into the bogs of soppy sentimentality.  Instead, the painful moments are simple and true, brought out by the aforementioned art and the direct unflowery language.  A balance is struck between essaying turbulent emotional territory and retaining some detached control in the narration, producing an elegantly crafted book about fathers and daughters, coming out and staying in, and the role of personal bravery. <br /> <br />Readers of THE INDELIBLE ALISON BECHDEL will recognize bits from her coming out story and other short vignettes about being lesbian before knowing what that meant.  Instead of feeling recycled, Bechdel reworks these moments in a fresh way and integrates them smoothly into the other material.  The downside of most autobiographical comics is usually the snapshot feel of the narration creates a distance between the reader and author.  Bechdel's deeper exploration of these crucial moments in her personal development echo the progression of Fun Home from a simple summary of her relationship with and image of her father and his fate to the deeper and more complex exploration of where they could intersect and where they kept themselves apart.  Often, what they both had in common or wanted from each other were exactly the obstacles standing in their way. <br /> <br />This is turning into a book report rather than a review, so I'll just sum up here:  excellent.  Well worth the wait and speculation.  If ever Bechdel decides to do another graphic novel, I'll be the first in line to buy it.  Read this book.  You will not regret it for one second.
B000FGGE68|1.0|This was the worst movie I've seen so far in 2006.  I really wanted to like this flick but I found myself using my cell phone half way through the film and nobody cared.  Unless you are THAT much of a sci-fi junkie that a horrible plot and script means nothing to you or can justify a bad movie because it has some T&A then don't waste you money.  I know 6th graders who could have written a better script thatn this.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I don't want to get polemic about this movie's social significance.  Just want to say that it is a classic American story and a classic \\"western\\".  It is a great romance in the time-honored Hollywood tradition.  It has one of the best film scripts ever produced.  In Heath Ledger, it has a screen-acting performance that is among the best of all time.  It is beautifully photographed.  The music score resonates.  And that mastermind who put it all together -- Ang Lee -- is a genius.  Unmissable and worth at leaat two viewings.

0671027344|3.0|Walking into the halls of an enormous high school isn't every person's cup of tea, especially not Charlie's.  In The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Steven Chbosky, Charlie is a wallflower, struggling to bloom within the established cliques of high school.  Lacking close friends and allies until he meets Patrick and Samantha, Charlie writes a series of letters to an unknown recipient, chronicling the ups and downs of high school life. Touchy taboos such as abuse, heterosexual and homosexual behavior, drugs, and suicide are examined in this riveting and realistic look into what high school life is like.  Those who are used to classic literature and complex novels should veer away from this book.  The overly childish and simplistic style creates a more believable teenage Charlie readers can connect with, but this same style can irritate and frustrate readers.  Also, the exaggeration of the events in high school takes away from the realism of the story.
B000AMMSQC|5.0|This is the most phenominal performance of Swan Lake I have ever seen. Svetlana Zakharova has everything required of a great prima ballarina. Her fluid arm movment, incredible extension, limber form are all wedded to the most expressive performance of Odille I know. The pas de deux in act 2 is langorously performed. Miss Zakharova tantilizes the audience with exquisitely lyrical movement all in the service of the character. She is ably partnered by Roberto Bolle who is himself extraordinary.  What is especially appealing about this performance is its staging conceived with TV and DVD in mind. The costumes, the court coreography are wonderful. Antonino Sutara as the Jester is worthy of praise as are the quartet and trio of swans. If you have only one performance of Swan Lake let this be it.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Allow me to apologise, my original rating is 0 stars, but for some reason AMAZON.COM doesn't allow that.... <br /> <br />When i first heard about the release of the 1977 version, i know that it was a smile on most STAR WARS fans who craved the original trilogy in the way they remembered it. <br /> <br />But when the details came about that the original 1977 version will be non anamorphic dvds, it was disappointing.. <br /> <br />But what added fuel to the fire was the offical statement released by LUCASFILMS, saying that we do not have the offical prints and they are in a bad state.... <br /> <br />Most classics were originally in bad shape, like WIZARD OF OZ, KING KONG and GONE WITH THE WIND, but look at them all shine on dvd today. LUCASFILMS claim they are at the forefront of dvd technology and movie making, but this does cast a doubt on their abilites.... <br /> <br />If other studios can do it, why not for a set of films that generations have grown up loving..Passing a sub standard package for the sake of increasing the company's revenue is rather unsettling.... <br /> <br />But i can bet you, LUCASFILMS will release the original versions in full glory when HD becomes more of the industry norm.  <br /> <br />Please don't support the purchase of these dvds and send a clear message to the studios, we pay for quality... <br /> <br />
B000001FGG|4.0|\\"Wheels of Fire,\\" Cream's double-barreled assault on the rock world, blasts listeners with a scattershot of progressive rock, blues, and jazz-rock, half studio based, half live. Clearly, the strong personalities of Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, and Eric Clapton are at work here, sometimes yielding classic performances and other times conjuring up what now seem examples of excess or misdirection.<br /><br />Tracks such as White Room, Deserted Cities of the Heart, and Those Were the Days exemplify the freewheeling progressive vibe. Crossroads, Born under a Bad Sign, and Politician all showcase the band in its blues mode. As You Said (which foreshadows Jack Bruce's subsequent solo work) and Spoonful incorporate jazz-rock motifs, with the latter also leaning heavily into blues.<br /><br />On those tracks, the trio consistently plays to their strengths and at times, such as in Spoonful, both spur each other on and spar with each other. Jack Bruce is not shy about playing lead bass, Ginger Baker could outplay any four-armed drummer, and Eric Clapton does not sandbag his efforts.<br /><br />Traintime, Toad, and Pressed Rat and Warthog, (as well as the bonus track Anyone for Tennis found on some masterings) are not Cream's finest moments.<br /><br />This blast from the past ultimately has more going for it than against it. Even the lesser tracks merit a listen every now and then, and the great songs have achieved the iconic status accorded those performances that transcend time.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|his intentions are a little confusing, but i think on the whole this worked out pretty well considering it seemed like it would never happen.  definitely worth it for the Dub Trio track (check out their super-ridiculously tight album New Heavy from which this song is taken), the Massive Attack song, the fact that he got Norah Jones to act that sexy, and the amazing packaging.  It really is pretty incredible packaging.
1401307787|5.0|The langauge in which this book is written  so clear and effective it is actually amazing. How Jon Kabat communicates such a foreign consept so easily and effectively.

1592401791|5.0|Pure and simple, this book is a treasure.  <br /> <br />Geoff Emerick's story is truly inspirational, and I found myself savoring each page of \\"Here, There, and Everywhere.\\" Not only will you learn more fascinating information about the Beatles than you ever thought possible, but, more importantly, reading this book will lead you to learn something about yourself.  <br /> <br />Emerick's lifetime of crafting innovative sounds, his determination to follow his dream, his intense collaboration with the most creative musical minds of the era, will have your head spinning with endless possibilities and the wealth of opportunity that lies before all of us... if only we have the insight and willingness to grab the brass ring. What's more, his detailed descriptions of the creative process and his refreshing honesty in describing the human beings -- yes, flawed human beings, not superhuman icons -- responsible for making the most influential recordings of modern times makes this not just the best Beatles book ever written, but one of the best books I've ever read, period.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended!  <br /> <br />
B00004TJLD|5.0|This review is for the item listed as \\"I Robot (HDAD Plus DVD-Audio) [Original recording remastered]\\"    Ok, the question is: since this is only a STEREO DVD audio, would you need to upgrade, if you own the CD already?.  The answer is YES, for TWO reasons.   1) We haven't been favored with a REMASTERED version of the Parsons catalog (with the exception of the first record, 'Tales of mystery and imagination'). The GREATEST HITS package did improved the songs through remastering, but the individual CD's, like this one, are still as they were first released almost 20 years ago. So little attention has been put on them by the record company, that it was really a miracle that these records were released as CD's at all.  2) Even the remastered version wouldn't compete with the final product contained in this DVD Audio. Since it's a DVD, it's meant to bring a higher quality of sound than the CD could ever possible deliver.  This DVD is double sided. One side plays on DVD AUDIO players, the other on normal DVD players. If you don't know the difference, it's just that originally, the DVD AUDIO was designed as a special product to be played by specific players that could read a higher standard of audio, just like Super Audio CD's are designed to be played by special players.  To hear the quality of this DVD (or any other DVD audio available) at its best, you'd need a DVD AUDIO player. You'd notice that the improvement is amazing. The sound is clearer. The treble is polished, the bass and drums enhanced (David Patton must be very happy that his bass is more distinguishable here). The overall effect is a sharper and fuller sound that you won't ever be able to get from a CD.  If you own a conventional DVD player, the effect will be of a lesser quality, but still a great improvement over the conventional CD sound.  Both sides present PCM stereo sound (not encoded Dolby Digital) which ensures a purer, unaltered sound. For those for whom these numbers mean something, the DVD Audioside is PCM 24/192 sampling, the other side is PCM 24/96.  That it's not multi channel might be a put down for some, but I guess that would be only for those who haven't had a chance to ever hear how a stereo DVD sounds. Whatever, it's what's available now, until something better comes out, if ever.  Unlike other DVD Audio's available, the format of this one is very simple, not including videos or special materials, just a screen showing the song that it's being played.  The booklet includes the lyrics and original information of the album, spread in 8 colored pages, more faithful to the original LP album art. As simple as it is, it's more presentable than the one page booklet that originally accompanied the CD.  NOTE: in this DVD AUDIO format, \\"Turn of a friendly card\\" and \\"Eye in the sky\\" were also issued.    2007 UPDATE: This year we saw the release of most of the Alan Parsons remastered catalog on CD, It's been a great improvement over the original publications, with very neat and informative booklets, inclusion of extra tracks (mostly demo and alternate versions) and polished sound. But just in case you are wondering, the sound is still bound by the limits of CD. As I said before, there's no way you will get the same quality than from a DVD Audio.

1572815108|4.0|This deck has smaller cards than the other version.  It makes doing readings easier.  The deck has more dynamic pictures than other decks.  There is a sense of vibrancy and energy.  Another feature of this deck is that it has Knight, Queen, Prince, and Princess as the court cards.  This makes the deck more gender balanced than the ones that have King, Queen, Knight and Page.  This is an important feature to look for, since the Qabalah, the underpinnings of the Tarot, is partly about the Middle Pillar and balance.  The other deck that I am aware of that has this balance is the Golden Dawn version.

0679411585|4.0|Even though part of the title reads more like an afterthought, I had a lot of thoughts about this book since I read it a few years ago, and none of them were second thoughts.<br /><br />This book is about daring and superb leadership. If there had been anyone other than LTC Hal Moore running his battalion, it most assuredly would have been been overrun in the first major battle of the Vietnam War between North Vietnamese (NVA) and Americans. This was also a story about poor leadership because the book tells about a follow-up battle at Landing Zone (LZ) Albany where the North Vietnamese launch a horrific ambush against another American battalion led by an inexperienced and ineffective commander. The difference provides a sharp contrast of consequences between battalions, and the role of leadership in battle. After this ambush the NVA walk among the wounded GI's during the night executing them while they are calling for mercy or their mothers. The story briefly mentions Spec 4 Howard K. Smith Jr. the nightly news reporter and son of Howard K. Smith, who pretended to be dead in the elephant grass, and survived. Incidentally, poor leadership continued in Vietnam as officers kept changing commands to get their \\"tickets punched.\\" By the time they were beginning to lead effectively, it was time to turn command over to someone else.  Hal Moore kept his command protesting the practice, but eventually had to relinquish command to the policy of the day.<br /><br />The Battle of the Ia Drang pits two highly skilled leaders against each other. Moore's tactical skill enables him to predict where and when the NVA commander will strike at every turn. As a result, his unit decimates the North Vietnamese division they landed right next to.<br /><br />Moore is able to make you feel the excitement from the very beginning, before they leave for Vietnam. Reading about the battle, you actually feel what it is like to be hungry, thirsty, out of ammunition, or wondering if your wounds will be treated. You feel comfortable with a commander who promises that he will leave no man behind, and will be the last to leave the field of battle.<br /><br />Equally interesting, is what the author added at the end of the book, a \\"Where are they today?\\" part. It is nice to know what eventually happened to all of them who fought this horrific battle and cheated death.<br /><br />This is primarily a man's story. It is probably even more important for those who served, maybe more so for those who served in Vietnam.  But for anyone, especially for those who may think battle is glamorous or glorious, it is a story worth reading.<br /><br />It was a fight for survival.fortable with a commander who promises that he will leave no man behind, and will be the last to leave the field of battle.

The author has such a commanding and light-hearted voice, there's something very strong and feminine about Gilbert's writing style.   <br />I'd recommend this to anyone who's ever gone through heartbreak and questioned the meaning of life.
B000002INR|5.0|Say what you will about the 80's, but it did bring forth some great hard rock.  This album is all killer, no filler (except for maybe the weird little isntrumental thing known as \\"Tornado\\").  It's all about big riffs, big boobs, and a big ol' time.  God bless all of that.  I disagree that this sounds dated, but maybe that's becuase this is one of my all time favorite albums from the 80's.  You owe it yourself to own this.
0156907399|1.0|I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|AFI has definitley changed, as all great bands have. People need to give this album a chance before they shoot it down and shout \\"SELL OUT\\" faster than the powerful \\"Kill Caustic\\" takes off. I, like many AFI fans, heard \\"Miss Murder\\" and was momentairly confused. But once you listen to the album open-mindedly you'll see just how far AFI has come. This album seems to have a more electronic influence, but that only compliments their undeniable talent. Highlights of the album include \\"Love Like Winter,\\" \\"Affliction\\", \\"Miss Murder,\\" and \\"Endlessly She Said\\". The album is more melodic than some of their previous work, but that just makes is more enjoyable and makes Davey's vocals all the more beautiful. AFI does not fit the emo genre that they have been sadly shoved into because of the bands generous amounts of makeup. Don't judge this album until you've heard it in it's entirety. <br />     For those of you living in the past that can't move on from some of the bands older material, grow up or go listen to your \\"hardcore punk\\". Sooner or later you'll figure out that all great bands mature and change (Green Day, Smashing Pumpkins, Misfits, Red Hot Chili Peppers.. *cough.. BEATLES...cough*) and soon you'll realize what an idot you are for not giving Decemberunderground a chance.  <br />Change is good. AFI can prove it.

I LOVE IT!!!!! ORDER IT NOW!!!!!!! GREAT PARTY TUNES!  ENJOY!!!!!!!!! :D
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This movie is great for someone who hasn't visited Japan, but want to or plans to.  It's labelled as a romnatic comedy, but the romance is not anything steamy.  The comedy is smart, culturally eccentric, and sometimes just seems too dry.  The movie is more like a well done excerpt on the film crew's journey in Japan rather than a movie which stands on its own.  There was way too much karaoke in it- it was more of a filler to make the movie last longer.  Scarlett Johansen gets great reviews for this- she poses great at the beginning.  The Japanese imagery in the movie is impeccable- when they show the pond, it's breathtaking.  Nothing too awe-inspiring otherwise- too critically raved for what it is.  Not a must see, but an \\"I don't mind seeing.\\"
0425152251|3.0|Written by a Norwegian, the author tells about the history of the Vikings before settling down to the subject of philosophy.  In order to recover from life's curveballs and feel more alive, a little delving into ancient and more modern styles of philosophers hit the right vein, as women are more cerebral than men (it's a fact).  In ancient times, Sophia was the goddess of women, thus the choice of the female name who learns about the great masters.  Myths are merely stories or tales passed from one generation to the next. <br /> <br />Philosophy is a way of thinking from the era six hundred years before the birth of Jesus.  Prior to that, people believed the mythological explanation for how the balance of nature was maintained, and why there was a constant struggle between good and evil.  Evil is still reigning supreme in today's world.   She will meet him someday, sooner that later.  True insight comes from within. <br /> <br />Some adults do stupid things they should regret afterwards.  If they possess a superego, they will attempt to make things right again.  Socrates, the most enigmatic figure in the entire history of philosophy; his outer appearance is along the lines of Garrison Keillor.  His teachings were all oral, and he was killed because of his philosophical activities.  Some people in power don't want the underclass to be able to think for themselves. <br /> <br />We know of him through the writings of Plato in 'Dialogues', who became one of the greatest philosophers of all time.  He, too, was sentenced to his death for listening to people and putting in print how they affected him.  By playing ignorant, Socrates forced others to use their common sense.  Only the understanding which comes from within can lead to true insight. <br /> <br />Aristotle questioned Plato's theories.  Where Plato used reason (like I do logic), Aristotle used his senses as well.  He is credited with creating the terminology scientists use today.  He founded the science of Logic,which clarifies our beliefs.  His criteria for happiness are 'a life of pleasure and fulfillment,' 'a life as a free and responsible citizen,' and 'a life as thinker and philosopher.  All three must exist for us to find happiness and fulfillment. <br /> <br />A man dressed as the \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" figure to deliver to Sophie and Alberto this story of Freud.  \\"Is some kind of censorship being exercised on these premises?\\"  He's called a cultural philosopher with specialty in neurology, later termed psychoanalysis.  His theory shows that our actions are not always guided by reason.  We carry the \\"id\\" (pleasure principle) from childhood into adulthood, throughout our life.  He came up with the term \\"ego\\" to regulate our more subliminal desires.  Also, the \\"superego\\" concerning moral expectations.  Our consciences are a part of the superego.  Men perform as if quantity of life is sacrificed for intensity of experience.  Men are physical while women are cerebral and relationship-oriented.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Once in a while all this music world needs is a band just to simply cut it up.  These guys just let it out.  Sure it's a bit \\"generic\\", but they have a sound all their own.  To me that's more talent than some out there.  Some \\"experimental\\" rock bands come off as too tedious and sometimes annoying with \\"new\\" sounds, or you can't tell them apart from the next guy (any band or artist who's ever appeared on VH1...or Mtv).  How many bands can sound so familiar and simple, but yet different and complicated?  Listen to this album with headphones at full volume.  The instruments, the change ups, the melodies, the moods, the vocals will blow your mind.  The Funeral...one of those songs you can't wait to get to when listening to the album and when it's over you have to hit the back button to listen again, and again.  Haven't seen them live, but I can imagine that song is craziness.  Much like My Morning Jacket's Phone Went West.
067101756X|4.0|Colonel Corso's book is a great read, very interesting, and filled with \\"fantastic\\" stories. I mean, stuff that's pretty far out there even for the UFO community. Corso covers subjects such as the Roswell incident, reverse engineering of alien technology, the alien threat during the military buildup of the Cold War, and other secret government projects related to alien presence. All of this is extremely riveting stuff, based on the premise that this book is a memoir and therefore everything in it is true. But there is a problem. I have a feeling that a lot of what Corso is saying in the book is a lot more science fiction than truth.  <br /> <br />The main problem with his story is that he puts himself at the center of this \\"above top secret\\" government operation to reverse engineer alien technology - starting with his Govt R&D role in 1961. The Roswell crash occurred in 1947, 14 years earlier. Are you telling me the US military had highly advanced alien technology for 14 years and did absolutely NOTHING with it, letting it collect dust in a file cabinet?! That is, until our hero Corso shows up in 1961, saves the day and single handedly reverse engineers everything within a few years with the help of some defense contractors. This in turn shapes the future of technology on Earth. That is far fetched at best. I won't even get into the claims he makes about aliens as they related to the Cold War and the space program. Those are even more difficult to accept as reality. <br /> <br />Even with that being said, this is a great book and hard to put down. I definitely recommend it to anyone with even a slight interest in the subject of UFO's. Read the book and make your own conclusions about General Corso's claims. Hey, sometimes fact is stranger than fiction right? In this case, that would definitely have to be the case!
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|\\"My name is Susie Salmon and I was murdered on December 6 1973.\\" This riveting line is the beginning of the award winning book The Lovely Bones by Alice Seabold. Seabold writes this book from the viewpoint of Susie Salmon, who is watching her family from heaven as they try to cope with her murder and continue on with their lives.  I think this book is a phenomenal read because of Seabold's original writing style and concept. I have never read a book that was written from this particular viewpoint and I like it because it kept me engaged in the story. It is very refreshing to find an author who avoids writing a story that is very cliché  and instead is able to write a story with a plot and format that is all their own.  I think that if given the opportunity everyone should read this book however; I think that this book is only for mature audiences due to its discussion of sensitive subjects such as rape and life after death.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatres and enjoyed it but found it a bit choppy.  This one, the directors cut, is 47 minutes longer and incredible.  The battle scenes in both rival LOTR movies but the directors cut story is so far above and beyond the theatre version.  A must own.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Augments rather than repeats previous work. If you liked \\"MCMXC.A.D.\\" or \\"Love Sensuality Devotion,\\" round up with this album. All that is missing, as always, are printed lyrics (particularly the French and Latin - the English can usually be found on-line) and album notes.
B00000K31V|1.0|<br />While \\"appauling\\" says it all, I guess I should elaborate. It's the least I can do, as Cronenberg & Company choose not to.  <br /> <br />Jennefir Jason Leigh is awful, as usual, but you can't really blame her or anyone else in the movie. Except of course for having been duped into participating. Ian Holm for Godsakes was awful. All I could think of, was \\"Bilbo! How did you get mixed up in this?\\".  But I am quite aware that the characters were not in effect professional actors in ExistenZ as much as they were amuteur actors playing roles within an interactive game. So everyone, apart from JJL gets a free pass.   <br /> <br />The movie itself, has been applauded as a work of technogolical philosophy, but it was always and inescapably immersed in Cronenbergs immature fascination with bloody fleshy goofiness and misplaced eroticism. It's as if he's still a six year old boy on the playground, trying to impress the six year old girl on the playground by eating a bug or poking a dead squirrel with a stick. Enough already.   <br /> <br />I watched this in a film class so I couldn't turn it off or walk out. I was dreaming of going home and playing with my kids or immersing myself in some competent movie or philosophy but I was stuck.  <br /> <br />There is a twist at the end, that may get you or not, but like a long-winded joke, the last minute of intrigue can't hope to justify the other 96 minutes of low brow schlock. <br /> <br />I am also aware that incomprehensibility was planned, and a part of Cronen's art, but the philosophical, metaphysical and technological ideas raised have all been dealt with competently and more effectively in 30 seconds of any decent Simpson's episode.  <br /> <br />Mr. Cronenberg, please go back to the school yard. Little girls are waiting to be impressed! <br /> <br />
B000002KZ6|5.0|ALSO AVAILABLE AS A DUAL DISC WITH SOME EXTRA TRACKS. <br />HOPEFULLY IT HAS BETTER SOUND. <br /> <br />Released in 1983, this is the Talking Heads' fifth studio album. It came after three years after Remain In Light.  In those days, 3 years between albums was a long time.  In the sixties some groups released a couple of albums a year.  If they didn't you wondered what happened to them.  Now, groups go up to a decade between album releases. <br /> <br />The sound quality on the original CD is OK but not excellent.  It is a little bit muddled and not as sharp as it should be, especially considering the musical style the band used at the time.  There is new version out, on a dual disc.  One side is a normal CD and the other is an audio DVD.  There are some extra tracks on this.  <br /> <br />This might be the Talking Heads best album, if it didn't all sound the same and eventually get stale and boring.  I think if they had left out Pull Up the Roots, the album would have been near perfect.  Pull Up The Roots just drones on with a disco beat.  It almost sounds like one of those extended mixes created just for discos.   <br /> <br />Otherwise, this CD is just filled full of great songs and real classics:  Buring Down the House, Girlfriend Is Better and Swamp.  When I first heard Swamp, I had no idea who it was.   <br /> <br />This album is the basis for much of the live CD/DVD, Stop Making Sense.  I think that many of the songs are even better on this live album. <br /> <br />If you like this album, than you should check out the early Tom Tom Club albums, especially Dark, Sneak, Love Action.  Tom Tom Club is spin off band featuring Franz and Weymouth.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Playing this album in my little truck in 1973 transformed me from a highway in Tennessee to distant stars where God told me secrets of the universe, and that was before I hit 5th gear. You have to be spiritual to appreciate this to the max I would think. But shouldn't we all be spiritual beings? We have one life here on this big blue ball, what a treat to have moments when music touch you and make you think. One of Yes best!
B0000640SB|5.0|After the horribly cheesy \\"Independence Day\\" of the previous year, it was great to see the actor that saved that movie from being completely unwatchable - Will Smith - get a chance to save the planet in a quality film. From the opening of the film where \\"Mikey\\", an illegal alien from another planet is disguised as an illegal alien from another country, to the end when we see the earth just as a marble in a pouch of many belonging to an extraterrestrial being, I found this film to be thought provoking, original, and very funny.<br />Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) and Will Smith (Agent J) are perfect in their roles. Not since Lenny Briscoe and Mike Logan were partners on \\"Law and Order\\" has the young cop/old cop routine been done so well with such great chemistry and deadpan humor.<br />All of the supporting roles work too. Rip Torn is great as Zed, the head of the secret government organization - the \\"Men In Black\\" - who are in charge of overseeing the visits of extraterrestrials who have chosen to establish contact with earth and in some cases become semi-permanent residents of this planet. His great one-liners include telling a group of rejected job applicants - who really don't know what kind of job they've applied for - \\"Congratulations gentlemen. You are all we've come to expect from years of government training\\". Some of the rank and file employees of the agency are aliens themselves. Unmotivated and not particularly loyal, they enjoy hanging out in the break room drinking coffee, smoking heavily, and collecting cheap miniatures of the Statue of Liberty. Vincent D'Onofrio is also outstanding in the dual role of Edgar, a human who gets eaten by a malicious alien cockroach, and also as the cockroach himself as he tools around New York City in his \\"brand new Edgar suit\\" - Edgar's skin - in an attempt to appear human while trying to start an intergalactic war.<br />Any human who happens to encounter an alien won't remember it thanks to the neuralizer - a device the size of a fountain pen - that the \\"Men In Black\\" administer to erase any resulting memories. This includes employees of the agency themselves, should they choose to quit or retire. The underlying purpose of all of this covering up makes sense when Smith's character, during his orientation session, tells Tommy Lee Jones that he thinks that people could handle the truth about aliens living among them. Jones' (Agent K's) response is: \\"A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals and you know it.\\" This is hard to argue with when you think about the acts that people throughout history have performed as a mob that they would never have done as individuals.<br />I really enjoyed this film, and its smart humor has held up over the years. I think in the future many will wonder, as I still do, why this film didn't get a nod at the Academy Awards other than its award for best makeup, at the very least for the screenplay.ntain pen - that the \\"Men In Black\\" administer to erase any resulting memories.

B00005JO9G|4.0|This series is one of the best Vampire & Werewolf series I have every seen. I enjoy the story.  Excellent screenplay.  However, my only unfortunate scene was the \\"sex\\".  It came at such an awkard time and was so unnecessary.  It was like a slow down spot in the middle of action. If it had been edited out I would have given this movie 5 stars.  I know directors like to be explicit but I still think that is when they have a moment which I call \\"lack of creativity\\". Directors if you ever read these posts then my hint to you is to be smarter than the average director.  Keep the flow like you did in the first Underworld. There was no appetite missed in that one.   <br />By the way when you watch the special feature on the first Underworld and they show the drawing with the hybrid which would have had all the little hairs all over ...SWEET! <br /> <br />Great story and great action.
B0000029DD|5.0|If you buy just one album in your entire life, and there are far too many phenomenal ones out there to narrow it down to only one, but one you should highly consider for that one album is that of Jeff Buckley's Grace. The album succeeds on so many levels one almost becomes dizzy listening to its greatness; whether through the outstanding taste for composition which Buckley possessed in his short life, the musicianship with which so few so-called greats of our time could only wish for, or the virtually seamless genre crossing, one simply cannot listen to this and find something not to like. Unless you're a Top 40 fan, of course, but then again you don't really count as a music fan anyway. <br /> <br />The thing which makes Grace such a wonderful piece of artwork is much more than the sum of the three things mentioned earlier, although those are certainly an irreplaceable part of the foundation. It is the thing which all of our favorite albums do to us again and again, even if we think we have gotten tired of it after awhile or simply forget about it due to new musical discoveries, yet it always takes us back to that one place or time in which you first heard it, and again enchants you with its wonders. It is the way Buckley croons on Lover, You Should've Come Over that makes us think about every love we've ever had. It's the way he writes a song like Eternal Life that makes us want to fly down the freeway at 80 mph and scream it at the top of our lungs. It is the way we are soothed onto a bed of notes and dreams of Buckley's voice in our heads when we hear Lilac Wine. For me it's the way my heart breaks in the blissful, melancholy way whenever I hear Hallelujah and want to weep or marvel at Corpus Christi Carol. It is all these things and so much more, on virtually every track, which is also a key ingredient in making a favorite album for me. <br /> <br />Structurally, the music is also interesting to listen to as Buckley begins many songs as a usually composed pop tune and then smoothly guides them in another direction so flawlessly we didn't even know the song part was switching, let alone changing any of the numerous genres Buckley was a master of, be it rock, gospel, folk, classical or anything else he probably could have played without a second doubt. The band required for a recording like Grace is inevitably part of the big picture, Buckley stating in interviews that they rehearsed for three weeks before the recording sessions, being the same three weeks in which they first started working together. Even some of the few remaining great rock bands of this day and age could toil at these songs for years before perfecting them. <br /> <br />All of the praise for Grace, unfortunately, is bittersweet. While it would have been one of the best debuts of all time, this was Jeff's only complete studio album before his untimely death, the only other releases of his own material available being a few live albums, some unreleased tunes, and the earliest stages of work for his next planned release, My Sweetheart The Drunk, which was in progress when his tragic death occurred. Although I am selfish and lament his loss because of the great music I will hear, that doesn't diminish the fact that music was his way of speaking to the world where he was coming from, and the loss of him both personally and to the music world is a tragedy which cannot be put into words. I've heard few albums of this caliber, in any genre. I doubt you will either, but let me know if you do, because musicians like this are few and far between.
B000001E29|4.0|When I first got The Black Rider I didn't know that it was originally a stage musical, directed by the famous avant-garde Robert Wilson and written by the legendary William S. Burroughs. I thought is was another great Waits album, full of clear characters, simple, dark tales of love and death, and a fantastic array of horns and winds.But I later found out that the play premiered in Germany in the early 90's, more recently played in Sydney and San Francisco before coming to the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles (where it closes 6/11).  <br />This latest production I saw on June 6, and I was amazed at the beauty and wonderful theatricality it featured. This included the orchestra, actors and the great Waits' lyrics. Having possessed the album for years, it was fun to witness actors singing his tunes, some even affecting his famous voice... <br />The music is part burlesque/cabaret, part beer hall, certainly Brechtian, part (as usual) low-bro gutter poetry, and in concert with Wilson's expressionistic explosion of color, fabric, 2-D set pieces of angular chairs and tables, and the actors physical and vocal beauty, Waits' essense resonates and affects.  <br />This music is so imaginative, captivating and up, seeing it only heightens it's impact.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|The most disappointing thing about the new AFI album are the supposed fans. I never realized there had to be a dummies guide to being a fan for a musician until I read the disgraceful posts by some of you. You were never real fans of this band no matter how many times you listened to their cd or saw them in concert. You were a fan of yourself and your personal tastes. You shold spend more time learning the word loyalty and less time posting ridiculous reviews on how pathetic a band is because their 12 songs did not meet your expectations. Music is a way of expressing art, emotion among other things. If AFI wanted to right hit songs that appealed to their fans nonstop they could hire Brittney Spears's writer.  <br /> <br />Would you call your friends-family disappointing, if they made a career change or picked up a hobby that you would not find fun? Black Sabbath, Neil Young and even Nirvana never wrote music that they thought would be exciting to fans. They wrote from the heart...some people liked and some they didnt. AFI is no different .. they have progressed with their own times and thoughts and this is the music they are presenting to us. Maybe not every song sounds like River of the Pheonix but I most certainly believe that every song was written in pure passion. I support ths band no matter what for simply making the music that they have \\"overall\\" and do not judge one album by the next. Thats more pathetic than any album I know of.

B000AMJDHY|2.0|There is nothing extraordinary nor remarkable here. This album's got a lot of merchandising as different or cool. There is nothing ground breaking not special. Just a so-so like everybody else music. This album has got undeserved hype. And what's with those long song titles? How good can it be if the music is just plain and simple. What a dissapointment.

0743454537|4.0|It takes a lot for me to get weepy over a book, but when I finished reading \\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" I was nearly in tears. What a sad, beautiful book! The story revolves around Anna Fitzgerald, a 13-year-old girl who was Rhode Island's first \\"designer baby.\\" Anna was conceived for the purpose of being a donor match for her older sister, Kate, who has a rare form of leukemia. The donor procedures that Anna is forced to endure become more invasive over time, and when her parents ask her to donate one of her kidneys for Kate, Anna decides to hire a lawyer. The fact that Anna sues her parents for the right to make decisions about her own body creates numerous tensions within the Fitzgerald household. Anna's parents, Sara and Brian, are torn between both of their daughters as they struggle to respect Anna's wishes but also pray for a miracle to keep Kate alive. Meanwhile, Anna's delinquent older brother, Jesse, moves beyond his recreational drug and alcohol usage to much more extreme measures of acting out. As the family goes through the motions of settling this case in court, 16-year-old Kate remains in her hospital bed, where death is a looming reality.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult uses multiple viewpoints that give each of the main characters a chance to tell their stories. The only person we fail to hear from is Kate, who finally makes her feelings known in the last chapter of the book, and her final words are not at all what you'd expect them to be.<br /><br />There are several structural problems with this novel that bothered me. First of all, I don't think the character of Sara was as well-developed as she could have been. Her devotion to Kate is completely understandable, and obviously the reader will sympathize with her because she is a mother who is on the verge of losing her child. However, I couldn't get past the fact that Sara was so unsympathetic toward Anna's plight until the very end of the book. It's obvious that Sara is a smart woman and the grief she is feeling about Kate's health hasn't impacted her ability to think rationally, so why is she so blind to everything her younger daughter is going through? I also had a hard time buying into the fact that Sara decided to represent herself in this case. Not only has it been almost 20 years since she practiced law, but why on earth would her character make the decision to represent herself in court? With Kate barely clinging to life in the hospital, you'd think Sara would be more than willing to hand over the case to another attorney so she could devote more time to her sick child. I also can't believe that the judge would actually have let Sara represent herself in a situation like this. Also, the whole issue of Jesse and his pyromaniac tendencies was a little extreme. Not only was it pretty farfetched to have the character behaving that way, but it also doesn't make any sense that he was able to get away with it for as long as he did.<br /><br />Despite those inaccuracies, I still really enjoyed this book. Picoult has written an excellent novel that handles a very difficult and moral issue with honesty and grace. Also, even though the reader is aware of the gravity of Kate's situation from the beginning of the book, nothing will prepare you for the surprise twist at the end of the novel. It is more heart-wrenching than anything you can possibly imagine.<br /><br />\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is a beautiful, thought-provoking novel that will leave you questioning your own set of morals and also give you a greater appreciation for the people you love the most.feeling about Kate's health hasn't impacted her ability to think rationally, so why is she so blind to everything her younger daughter is going through?

0440214041|5.0|This is the third book I have read by Grisham, and so far I have really enjoyed each one. Grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller. This book does not have any courtroom/court-case scenes, which I really enjoy, but it still kept my attention very well. Grisham gives you just enough \\"inside details\\" to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. For example: at one point, the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings, but that was way off the mark in the end. This characteristic of Grisham's writings makes for a very enjoyable read. <br />One of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted, then it VERY quickly blossomed into an open show of affection, even though at the same time, Darby was supposedly mourning for Thomas. Even so, that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book, and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very captivating, page-turner book that really holds your attention. I highly recommend it, as well as Grisham's other books. So far, I have found Grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Read and enjoy.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|Oh well.  Another Sequel that steered away from what made it's predecessor great.  It seems to happen all to often these days.  This film was simply a bloodbath with little or no reasoning behind the violence except to go through 100 gallons of fake blood.  The scenes did NOT add to the story at all.  The first movie used blood and stuff when needed and did it very convincingly.  <br /> <br />Right from the get go, it seemed like the film was directed by some B-Horror movie clown that bases the whole movie on blood and stuff with no story to tell. <br /> <br />Basically, the whole film was:  <br /> <br />- Talk a little bit about the backstory but never really resolving anything. <br />- Scoot Speedman fights some other dude. <br />- Talk a little bit <br />- Scott fights some dude. <br /> <br />Lather, rinse, repeat.  Uggh. <br /> <br />I wanted this to be more storyline oriented and not so teeny-bopper violent.  And NO, I like action and violence...when its needed.  Not just for the hell of it. <br /> <br />Here are some other problems: <br /> <br />- The main bad guys die too easily and are weak. <br />- Very rushed story/movie <br />- Acting was not as good as before. <br />- Too much pointless sex.... yeah, Kate is HOT...but I wanted to see a good film.  I can look at her on the internet anytime. <br />- Left open obviously for another film, but why bother at this point? <br /> <br />The only good things were Markus being a really cool bad guy and the fact that we do learn a LITTLE about how everything came about.  But, we didnt get nearly enough story here.  I would have traded about a half hour or lame fight scenes for a half hour of relevant dialogue. <br /> <br />Too bad, the first one was magnificent and really took me by surprise.  This one just didnt cut it.  It wasn't horrible...but it fell way short of expectation. <br /> <br />I know... you may think an extended version might help.  I dunno, maybe.... but I doubt it only because if they simply add some dialogue that wont be enough so I bet that even an extended cut won't save it.
B000002HJD|5.0|I guess I consider myself a Doors fan.  I have all of their albums (except for Other Voices and Full Circle), including all of the Bright Midnight recordings. <br /> <br />I only picked this one up recently as I was skeptical.  I would have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  It is surprisingly good; the way the music and poetry ebb and flow from manic, live/pseudo-live performances to intimate settings with Jim talking specifically to me.  It has become one of my favorite albums and I've listened to it over and over without tiring.  Each listen I strain to try to comprehend what Jim was trying to say and each time I feel I am getting closer. <br /> <br />I suggest to the critics that they put on a quality set of headphones, turn the lights low, and dedicate the time to listen to this from start to finish. <br /> <br />Yes, I know some considered it sacrilege that the surviving Doors put music to the readings that Jim meant to be his own, but I am so glad they did.  I feel the music and sounds compliment the poetry making it more accessable to the masses. <br /> <br />Thanks James.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I hear many of my friends who have seen \\"Citizen Kane\\" say that it is \\"extremely boring\\" or even a \\"waste of time\\".  So, I feel that I should explain it to them.  Ok, so here we have a guy, basically the Ted Turner of his time who has just died.  His last word is \\"Rosebud\\".  Now, everyone knew who this guy was, so everybody is going to want to know who or what rosebud is.  Some reporters assume that rosebud is a girl and therefore a major part of discovering Kane's true personality.  So, basically they interview a slew of people who knew him in an attempt to find out more about him, which fills the majority of the film in the form of flash backs.  In the end the reporters give up and the secret of rosebud and Kane is lost forever.  Now, What's the point?  The point(s) are that 1. power corrupts, 2. love isn't bought, and 3. there are more important things in life than money and prestige. It isn't thaat hard to watch this movie, even for the new generation.  I should know, I'm only 17 and I listen to Metal, but I still know a brilliant movie when I see it.  So, get your heads out of your butts \\"Gen M\\" and find your brains.  Remember, the practical out-weighs the theoretical.
0385336691|5.0|Lee Child doesn't disappoint. Having read all the Jack Reacher novels, I wonder how a writer can continue to pen thrillers that hold one spellbound. Lee does this and more. Each novel of his I pick up has Reacher involved in bizarre, unusual plots with more twists and turns than a corkscrew. Bigger than life, literally and figuratively, hero Reacher is a man's man and a woman's man. This woman for one finds him not only intellectually challenging, but emotionally as well. He acknowledges that remorse is missing from his DNA, but acting on what one believes is right and not beating yourself over the head about it after the fact, is the mark of a balanced individual. Keep it up Lee. I love it!
1400079179|4.0|I thought the book was easy to read, interesting and exciting enough for a regular guy to find it hard to put down. It looks like the 'intelligent' crowd considered this book poor in literary quality...heck, I just wanted a fiction book that captured my attention long enough to finish. This book did that and for a movie guy that doesn't read too many novels, that's hard to find. The harsher 'religous' critics must have read the book in a defensive posture. Relax, it's just a fiction novel not a revolutionary textbook. I question how many of the movie boycotters even read the book - it's fiction, based on truth or not is immaterial. Was anybody griping about the existence of talking trees in the Lord of the Rings? Take it as just a novel and enjoy a thrilling story.

B00005AQE8|5.0|What is the difference between 2pac and Kanye West. Tupac Amaru Shakur was actually a very bright person who pondered many things affecting youth, culture and the world, his songs were more poetry with beats then an idiots rants about non essential music with Showtunes on the backround.    Mostly now, I rarely listen to rap music, only because the majority on the radio and MTV is spoiled garbage that I decided to stop listening to rap alltogether. But certain times I actually would put on an old school rap album and know the difference between good and bad rap. Producers on this album included Daz Dillinger,Dj Quik, Dr Dre and Johnny J, and put out an album which had everything from a party song, a bang your head steadilly song, laid back, some emotional tracks and some gangsta rap anthems. 1pac was a lyricist, someone who knew how to flow, wrote great songs with a concience and  intelligence, and spit venom on his foes. For anybody who thinks Kanye West is a great leader and speaks out on bad things going on is an ignorant, some of his songs that were supposed to be politically charged really had no merit whatsoever, singing about injustices then turning himself as a money loving prick on the same song. Maybe 1pac should still be with us and Kanye 6 feet underground.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought Chariot after hearing \\"I Don't Want to Be\\" and \\"Chariot\\" on the radio. After I listened to it once I fell in love. I left it in my car CD player for a couple months. I've had the CD for over a year now and can still listen to it over and over again without skipping a single song.  <br />Gavin DeGraw is so amazingly talented. I recently saw him in concert. It was the best concert I've been to. He really cares about his fans too. He stayed after the show to meet and greet everyone. He is such a nice guy, not many musicians would do that.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|To me the Allman Brothers creative peak was four LPs: Idlewild South, Fillmore East, Eat A Peach, Brothers and Sisters.  <br /> <br />If you are an ABB fan you own this CD already (I did). You can also get this show in trading circles (along with some other fine audience and soundboard recordings) if you want to go to the effort (and ultimately more cost than this).  <br /> <br />Released after Duane's death, this was originally a double LP. Great one as well - my personal favorite of the four listed above (it just beats out Fillmore East). Their first top 10 CD and the CD that propelled them into playing Stadiums like RFK or venues like Watkins Glen. <br /> <br />The sound is superb, the songs are excellent. What truly makes this worthwhile is the second disc of live music and the SOUND of that music. The Whipping Post and You Don't Love Me alone are to die for.  <br /> <br />Even though I had the Remastered CD (and the SACD as well) I popped for this and don't regret it one bit. I doubt you will either.
6304698690|5.0|A very, very good movie. The Secret Garden was one of my favourite books as a child-I read it over and over-and while this movie still isn't really the book it's a good adaptation and a great kids-and-adults movie in it's own right. Mary Lennox, the spoiled, neglected child of wealthy English parents living in India, goes to live with her uncle in an isolated part of England after her parents die of a fever. There, left to her own devices, she discovers an invalid and fascinating cousin and a mysterious garden  which she slowly brings back to life, slowly coming back to life and growing along with it. A very unusual and crafted film, this is one kid's movie that's handled with great cimatography and great performances from the stars, thus producing a great and very enjoyable children's movie.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|Nothing good on this CD, a big dissapointment. Songs are boring, and not even one good song.
B000001FNL|5.0|As most people know, the Gibb brothers have always been gifted with the ability to identify with the world through their soulful songs. This album is remembered most for \\"Jive Talkin'\\", but listen closely to all songs. There's familiar ground here for everyone to hear.  Don't miss out on listening to \\"Baby As You Turn Away\\" (an incredibly arranged song). The album has all great tunes..... Yes, even a country style song: \\"Come On Over\\"(another favorite of mine). If the world hasn't turned your heart to stone, you won't be disapointed with this disc AT ALL.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Bottom line is that this album rules!!!  It is definitely better than the rest, and that is no short order in my book.  The music is awesome and a natural follow-up to Lateralus without being like Lateralus.  This is a very unique album and one that will stand the test of time.   <br /> <br />I don't really understand why people are at odds with those songs that sound like \\"fillers.\\"  I listened to the past Tool albums and they all have these \\"filler\\" tunes that make no immediate sense to the listener.  After a few listens we all put it together, and it makes sense in some way.  This album is like that.  You have to listen to it a number of times to get the whole feel.  Each time I listen to 10,000 Days I like it more and more.   <br /> <br />I won't breakdown each song.  All I will say is that they are all connected in some way.  Some of those \\"filler\\" tunes are natural lead ins and seques into other longer songs.  Also, why shouldn't Tool put out those mellow songs (which really aren't that mellow)?  Maynard has an amazingly diverse voice that allows a band like Tool the freedom to explore more melodic and mellow tones.  Musicians like any human being on this planet deserve the opportunity to grow as they see fit.  Tool understands that, and pursues that growth. <br /> <br />The last thing I will say about this album is the artwork.  The CD packaging is off the hook!!!!!  Have fun, but don't go blind. <br /> <br />Peace, <br />The Plumber
B000002BBY|4.0|Oasis isn't the Beatles, and who is? If you're looking for the new Beatles, it's probably never gonna happen. Rock and roll is about character and swagger. Liam and Noel Gallagher were young kids with big mouths who shot off about everyone and everything.<br /><br />As far as Radiohead and My Bloody Valentine, comparing them to Oasis is like comparing apples and spaceships; not the same ballpark, not even the same sport. All three bands are genius in their own ways.<br /><br />Oh, and about asking Radiohead what they think of Oasis?<br /><br />\\"We felt there was nothing left for anyone else after this single dropped. Rock and roll had been perfected. It was either change genres or find new jobs.\\"<br /><br />Thom Yorke on music after \\"Wonderwall.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, this is an amazing album, almost as good as Oasis' debut \\"Definitely Maybe.\\"
B000069AUI|5.0|...and I still go back to it, along with the other Coldplay cds, which I've bought, I think, all of by now.     I tend to fall in love with specific songs more than with specific bands, but not in this case. I find that the more I listen (to this cd in particular), then go back to other cds, then return, the more Impressed I am with their child-prodigy-like brilliance. Coldplay's music is sweet and yet profound...out of its time in a way.      Inspire is just too tame a word for what it does.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Although i havent listened to this album in a while, i had to write a review because I felt bad that this album had unnecessary poor reviews.    I think this album was very good and a step up from Let Go. Dont care of this album was rock, punk or pop, it was good. The music and production on this album was better than her debut and you have to give Avril alot of credit for making this album more personal and taking more effort into this than campared to Let Go which most of the album was just The Matrix team. I discovered both albums at the same time and found myself listening to this one more than her previous. I cant really say I have a favorite track because each of the songs are just as good as the next. Each song catches your attention. I can listen to the CD from beginning to end, unlike Let Go where a few songs sounded boring and forgetable.     I think its stupid for people to label avril as punk rock,pop or whatever, i dont really understand it but I dont think avril is pretedning to be anything, shes just growing like any human being and has her own thing going wheather shes wearing baggy gothic clothes with a tie, or a tight skirt with platnium blonde hair..its bad to label people and actually wouldnt be surprised if she did a killer electronica rock inspired album..lol..I would totally be looking foward to it just as much as any other project she does in the future because I like Avril's lyrics and personality..KEEP ROCKING AVRIL!!
B000002LND|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT CD FROM MY FAVORITE QUEEN OF ALL TIME, BUT IT IS NOT THE LIMITED EDITION.  THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING.
044651652X|4.0|This book is a very good example of how a good writer can make a story really shine. The Bridges of Madison County is about an Iowa farmer's wife (Francesca) falls in love with a traveler while her husband is away for the week. The couple has a fling for a week then they end it without every contacting each other ever again. Robert Waller uses great description and vibrant details to make this story come alive. The story has passion, mystery and illusion. You will love this book if you're the kind of person that enjoys reading books for hours and not being able to put it down. This book is a short read, taking just over two hours to read. This book is told through two points of view, Francesca and the traveler, in a diary type of format. Even though this book might be hard to fallow in the beginning as soon as you figure it out you it is worth it. This book ends very abruptly and the ending is a cliff hanger. I recommend this book for reading because of the story line and the writer is very interesting in the way he describes the situation. Hattie O. 4th period
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I'm only 14 and everyone I know that likes RHCP is older than me.  I've only really heard their greatest hits, but like other reviewers say, you shouldn't review this cd unless you've listened to the whole thing, and thats exactly what I did... over and over.  There are so many good songs that it's hard to pick a favorite.  Of course there are a few wierd ones but thats the RHCP.  I listen to this album pretty much everyday, it never gets old, definetely buy!
B000F5FNSE|5.0|the lightning thief is one of the best books i have ever read!!!!! if you want a book about the greek gods and mythology packed with fun, thrills, adventures, and fast paced action, then read this book. i would recomend this book from ages 10 and up. enjoy!!!!!
B000002H4Q|4.0|\\"Breathe\\" and \\"A Chain Of Flowers\\" are available on the Join The Dots boxset. <br /> <br />\\"Hey You!!!\\" will be released with all its brothers and sisters in August 2006 as the next reissue campaign from Rhino (US) and Fiction/Uni (UK) takes place.  They are releasing the deluxe editions of The Top, The Head On The Door, and Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me.  They corrected the omission of \\"Hey You!!!\\" so we have the full album as it should be.  Why it took them this long, I have no idea.  Prince's 1999 cd suffered the same fate (Warners omitted \\"DMSR\\" to make the 74 min disc, but corrected it in 1991 when the capacity was increased). <br /> <br />OK, I should write a review... <br /> <br />KMKMKM came out the summer I moved from my childhood home.  I remember the video of Robert Smith dressed like a bear or something in the video for \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\" and I recall falling in love with the song.  I went out, bought the cassette, and the rest is history.  This shows The Cure in all facets of their career...moody, gloomy, depressing, happy, poppy, dancey, quirky, rhythmic, tribal, etc.  Take all of The Cure's works prior to 1987, mix it up onto a double album, and you have this one.  Essential...even the filler is enjoyable if you are real Cure fan.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris exposes the fallacy and fallibility of religious faith in \\"The End of Faith\\". This well written and researched book takes the reader on a path of logic and reason that leads to the inescapable conclusion that faith is merely a means of perpetuating myths and a veil of ignorance. In fact, these myths and beliefs portend great danger for our modern world, witnessed by the violence we see in the news everyday.  <br />It is obviously time for mankind to grow up and put away such childish things. The realities of our modern world demand such evolution.
0060512806|5.0|(contains a minor, non-plot-related spoiler) <br />The greatest thing about this book is not the plot, but how it's written. Neal Stephenson is a true master of every literary technique you could find in an English textbook, and reinvents them in unique and funny ways. When Stephenson goes on for several pages about the technological details of Van Eck phreaking (and gives a humorous example), you think it's just a bit of a diversion, some comic relief. And then, later, it comes back in a big way. The book is rife with other examples of this sort of foreshadowing. <br /> <br />I've already become too verbose; so all I have to say is, \\"read it!\\"
0525948023|5.0|When I heard the title of Tolle's new book, I thought, \\"It's about some kind of utopia.\\" <br /> <br />     But it isn't.  It's about what it would take to get there. <br /> <br />     Here is his description:  \\"'A new heaven' is the emergence of a transformed state of human consciousness, and 'a new earth' is its reflection in the physical realm.\\" <br /> <br />     Only speculation can envision where that transformed state might lead.  So imagine a world where even half the human race were conscious; or even one-fourth; or even one-tenth.  Consciousness generates a \\"vibrational frequency\\" as Tolle describes it.  A kind of magnetic pull to anything around it.  People around a conscious person are influenced by that pull. Anyone who has heard Tolle in person has felt that.  It's like being drawn toward something so perfect and profound you want to be part of that state of existence.  Multiply that by millions of people generating the same attraction and then imagine the effect on those who are not conscious and the new earth it could create. <br /> <br />     A new earth where no one would wantonly harm another living thing because to do so would feel like harming yourself; where there would be no need for laws or the institutions that enforce them; where people would live in harmony with each other and their environment; where wars would cease to exist; where people by natural inclination would look out for others so no one would be in want.  This perfect world could come about because of the awakened awareness of our own true nature--consciousness. <br /> <br />     But that's my idea of utopia. Tolle only implies how such a world may be possible. <br /> <br />     And of course as the Taoist writer Deng Ming Dao says, \\"There is no utopia. There never will be.  There is only the valiant attempt of each person to live spiritually in a world where spirituality is almost impossible.\\" <br /> <br />     We are fortunate in this period of time to have a great teacherlike Eckhart Tolle to show us how to make spirituality possible.  And to do it in such precise, clear language, profuse with examples and the words of other great spiritual teachers, as to make it possible for anyone who earnestly seeks spiritual truth to find it. <br /> <br />     What one finds in reading this book is how to reach the perfection of the \\"new heaven\\" if not the \\"new earth.  That may be all that's possible, and ultimately all that matters. <br />                     ----- <br /> <br />   (As for the negative reviews of this book, ever notice the same tone of voice and language in all of them.  I smell pranksters.)
B00005JP4U|5.0|I had goosebumps throughout this movie. Think about giving the DVD to your friends and Family at Christmas along with a flourescent light bulb! Go Al Gore.
B00005RZV4|5.0|From the first song, this album explodes. I'm not a live album fan either, but this one is an exception. As an old time fan I also like the very nice blend of both old and new songs , both fast and slow songs. It is very well done. Too bad every album cannot be as good.
B0007P3582|1.0|first thing is first..i do NOT hate rap...REAL political rap that attempts to powerfully change something...or any 80's-early 90's rap.(when they actually were full of real talent!)...they were able to get powerful statements out to your urban undereductated public all while being skilled DJ's and lyricists....that is NOT what 50 cent or 95% of what is being passed off by mtv today are....modern rap, as is newer country, is merely here to make ignorant, xxl dressed kids feel like the cruel city streets are the place to be. also, this whole \\"pimps are cool biotch!\\" thing has really worn out its welcome..majorly...and stylish faux-chrome wheeled cars do not make you look tough, they make you look like a sissy.     now i know some fat rap loving 16 year old with a shaved head and a xxxxl t-shirt will mark this \\"unhelpful\\" because you know, rap is the ONLY type of music that the black community has...and i tend to dislike it...and bummer, that makes me racist...obviously, i was being sarcastic..hello people?? jazz? r&b? soul? funk? reggae? heck, even good ol' rock 'n' roll was initiated by black folk!    all in all, 50 cent blows, get mostly anything else..this is selfish and contrived.
B00000IPAX|4.0|Blink-182 released their breakthrough album in 1999. ENEMA OF THE STATE brought them much needed attention. The Punk/Rock group was given movie soundtrack spots, including for the film American Pie with the bands' track \\"Mutt\\". Blink-182 has interesting guitar solos and amusing lyrics. Drummer Travis Barker is the promising musician of the band, and it amazes me that he hasn't aspired to a higher form of music because he would do so well. The band has a unique style of switching singers depending on the songs they perform. The record is at times repetitive, but after awhile the sound changes. As a whole, ENEMA OF THE STATE is a good Punk/Rock album.
B000A88EVE|5.0|I must admit, upon first watching this film, I was struck by three things: the gorgeous cinematography, the sometimes cringingly bad acting, and the plain silliness of it.<br />But, I always watch DVDs with their commentary, and I am glad that I didn't dismiss this film after the first viewing and went ahead and gave it a second go.  The director (Nicholas Roeg) was apparently going for a different sort of film structure than I was expecting, and the explanation he provided as to his reasons helped to eliminate a lot of my confusion.  He also discusses a lot of the main themes of the movie, most of which I simply wasn't looking for in the context of a \\"sci-fi\\" film.  This helped me immensely, and I actually decided afterwards that it is, indeed, quite a brilliant film, despite the overacting of Candy Clark, and, it pains me to say it, the sometimes just-plain-bad acting by Bowie (see the TV meltdown scene).  But hey, I figure that that is to be attributed to its era of origin.<br />In short, I do recommend this movie, but be prepared for some unconventional scenes and to do some unconventional thinking.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|May 2, 2006, one of the most popular and influential artists of their time, Pearl Jam, releases their eighth studio album simply entitled \\"Pearl Jam\\" with promises to deliver a sound reminiscent of their early grunge days. Although the kept a bit of their promise, including heavy Vitology-like guitar riffs and a notable return of Eddie Vedder's dominant vocal style, all in all, the album falls short only surpassing \\"Riot Act\\" in quality. <br /> <br />Tracks such as \\"Life Wasted,\\" \\"Gone,\\" and \\"Inside Job\\" provide Pearl Jam fans with classic, hard-hitting tunes while the remainder of the album lacks either musically or lyrically.  Their first single, \\"World Wide Suicide\\" is a bit infectious and \\"Marker In The Sand\\" displays a wonderful chorus as Eddie takes his voice up a few notches but I can't help feeling that something is missing.  Much respect must be given to the band for attempting to dig up the band's roots and going with what works, however, the years may have took the best of what the band has to offer. <br /> <br />Highlights:  \\"Life Wasted,\\" \\"Marker In The Sand,\\" \\"Gone,\\" \\"Come Back\\" and \\"Inside Job.\\"
B000FFJ85I|2.0|I am going to be completely frank at the risk of being labelled - all pejorative connotations aside - a \\"purist.\\" <br />There are different definitions of the AFI purist. Perhaps you consider the \\"real\\" AFI to date back to the pre-Answer That/Very Proud era, including countless limited release 7\\"s. Maybe the \\"true\\" AFI plays that dark sound evoked with Black Sails and the surrounding EPs. <br /> <br />But that was then, and this is now. <br />I don't like what AFI has become. <br />Sing the Sorrow was a departure from AFI's catalog. It was subtle, but it was there. I understand their need to mature - you can't keep writing the same old punk rock songs forever - but their evolution has put them in an awkward yet commercially volatile position. You could say Decemberunderground was foreshadowed by the deviation of Sing the Sorrow, but I would say that AFI took a page from STS's less-than-frequent experimentation and wrote a whole book around it. <br /> <br />I read another track-by-track review, which made a good point: AFI has become renowned for the intros to their albums, which are also staples live. The reviewer called \\"Prelude 12/21\\" their worst yet. <br />Though this may be true, it's still pretty friggin' good. If nothing else it certainly does its job of introducing the mood of the rest of the album. There is just something haunting about it, and it's probably the sum of all parts. But the fact is, AFI drops some dope beatz on this track, reminiscent of J-Kwon's \\"Tipsy.\\" Kinda weird. <br />AFI's decision to follow up with \\"Kill Caustic\\" was a good one. This, however, doesn't mean it's a good song. It sounds to me like AFI trying to keep to their roots, but their stylistic change has veered them too far off course to do it effectively. The screaming, the meter of the vocals, the dynamics - all off. Maybe the song was overproduced, or maybe it's supposed to be like that. In any case, not so good. <br />Now I feel like I had an advantage over plenty of reviewerswith \\"Miss Murder\\": I took it at face value. I took it for what it is, and it's a pop song. It's the candidate most likely to do well in commercial radio, and it was an appropriate choice. Most don't agree, especially in its juxtaposition to Green Day's recent \\"Holiday.\\" The feel of the two songs may be very similar, but once you get past the comparison, \\"Miss Murder\\" is pretty solid. It's definitely a dark-natured radio rock song, but I enjoy it as just that. In fact, if I were to compare it to anything, I'd think of The Clash's \\"London Calling\\" first. <br />I'm not going to go through every song here, but the album overall is weak. The only other standout track for me was \\"The Interview\\" which also doesn't sound like the AFI I grew to love. For every good song, there are about 3 subpar songs that delve too deeply into their techno-industrial ideas to carry any meaning past the part of the song you're hearing. My final opinion: I ordered tickets to see AFI because I was excited to see them. Now that I've heard Decemberunderground in its entirety, and I know they're touring to support it, I'm looking forward to seeing Dillinger Escape Plan, and AFI is just a perk.

0440236738|5.0|Listening to \\"No Second Chance\\" and now \\"Gone for Good\\" on audio tape has been the most fun I've had with a novel in a while.  This is weird because I held off on reading more Coben because I didn't really like \\"Tell No One.\\"  The plot may not be unique, and in fact shares many traits with his other novels, but Coben is such a clever writer obviously having fun telling the story.<br /><br />Will Klien has just buried his mother.  Before her death, in an incorent daze, she says \\"He's alive.\\"  This could only mean one thing.  Will's brother Ken, disappeared 11 years ago from the scene of a brutal murder.  Ken's blood was at the scene and he was a suspect.  Will always thought his brother was dead, but now...things have changed.  Will hopes his girlfriend Sheila will help him, but then she disappears.  The plot takes off from there.  It goes from street people to the mob to childhood friends to the FBI to dark secrets.  Some plot points I guessed, maybe because I hoped the story would turn out that way.  For a full summary, read the Amazon.com review.<br /><br />There is a sense of fun throughout the novel.  Even at the darkest moments, you feel Coben is having fun telling the story.  Klien's parts are told from his point of view, which is probably Coben's, and its hard to separate Klien from other leading men such as Mark Siedman from \\"No Second Chance.\\"  In fact, in both novels, the characters make the same point about how in movies people fighting always stand up and slug it out but in real life fights usually end up on the ground.<br /><br />A lot of authors have twists and turns, but Coben keeps the twists coming right up to the very end.  Everything is revealed in a natural fashion.  No twist feels contrived.  Coben certainly has his flaws, but for an entertaining book, pick up Gone For Good!

B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Gotta just love her - That's Rihana with a master piece 'A Girl Like Me'. The two numbers 'Unfaithful' and 'SOS' gives great listening pleasure and turns you on. Very groovy numbers and here she makes you rock and dance to the tunes with the rythm of your soul. The Kisses don't lie chorus is catchy and Crazy little thing is a Reggae and my fav as Reggae music is all in my charts. Rihanna has got brilliant vocals you can't resist to give a hear to listen. Final Goodbye is a soft, catchy ballad. Break it off is a nice number and great beats n tune. The number 'Million Miles Away' is a dreamy piano ballad for the seperated hearts. Rihana's proved her talents right with the Reggae and Rythm n Blues vocals and sure gonna be on top of the charts at a time of dancehall/reggae wave - My fav pick to just Chill!
B000063DFQ|5.0|Simply an excellent album. Just love to ride my new Honda Goldwing with this album playing loud on my 6 disc changer, think it might lead to a speeding ticket cause I go faster when this is playing. If you love heavy metal you gotta love this album. No need to skip any tracks on this one.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|It's a scary thought, but to my knowledge, this is probably the worst album that DJ Dangermouse has worked on in the past two years, and this album is TREMENDOUSLY good.  If you haven't heard any of his previous albums, let me refresh your memory on the ones you MAY know about (if you don't, BUY THEM!!!). <br /> <br />The first Dangermouse project I got into was Dangermouse & Jemini, which came out a little before the Grey Album (the mashup album of Jay-z's Black Album and the Beatles' White Album that basically put DJ Dangermouse on the map).  Then came the newest offering from the Gorillaz (you may remember the catchy tune with De La Soul in it that was on the radio).  Then came the Adultswim Sponsored DangerDoom with MF Doom.  All of these projects have been amazingly produced, quirky, intelligent projects. (I won't comment on the Pelican City projects that Dangermouse did because I haven't really heard them) <br /> <br />They all have a little different feel to them, but they've all got a very similar, catchy production style that is fun and strange.  Strange in a way like that just feels so good. <br /> <br />As for Gnarls Barkley, Dangermouse took an old, fat, goofy looking Cee-Lo Green, a man famous for not really being a rapper but not really being a crooner in the Goodie Mob, and made an album that is just zany enough and just fun enough to make you want to have it.  The single, Crazy, is bigger than you'd ever expect the sum of those two parts (Dangermouse and Cee-Lo) to be, yet still manages to fit PERFECTLY as what you'd EXPECT from both of those characters.   <br /> <br />Please don't get me wrong, though.  Cee-Lo's already got two solo albums that have received relatively good critical acclaim, they just never really were able to cross over into the mainstream.  Ironically, it took the work of a fellow mad scientist to put Cee Lo where he deserves to be.  He writes surprisingly simple yet complex lyrics throughout the entire album (the only track I really dislike is Feng Shui), and this album is what I would consider a must own.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|Well, let me first say that I'm not one of these territorial fans who go around cursing this band because they've \\"sold out\\" or \\"they're not punk\\" anymore. Just because they evolve their sound over time doesn't mean that they've sold out, it just means they're true recording artists. What it DOES mean, however, is that they indeed are no longer punk. <br /> <br />I was first turned on to A.F.I. when someone showed me the \\"Art Of Drowning\\" album. I was blown away by their uncanny ability to bring such sad undertones and real feeling to a genre that was based on being so brash and rebelious. I then picked up \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" right when it came out, and was REALLY taken back. I discovered that I was listening to a band that had completely come into their own, and it was a real joy getting to hear that happen while they were doing it. <br /> <br />Now, fast-forward three years to present day, and the release of \\"Decemberunderground\\". This is probably the bands most anticipated offering yet due to the success of their previous record. I've listened through the entire thing a couple times now, and I feel it's something I will grow into, but know that it's nothing that will ever compare to the last three albums these guys have put out. And who can really blame them? \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" was such a success and milestone for A.F.I., and that sometimes is hard to triumph right away. Having said that, there are some very good tracks to be heard on this latest LP. My favorite thus far is 'Love Like Winter', and that's because it has the strong hooks and dynamics that keeps these guys always progressing. I thought '37MM' was pretty interesting because it threw in a ton of techno influence, and of course the first single 'Miss Murder' is probably the strongest song on the album. For you die hard fans, you'll like 'Kill Caustic' and 'Affliction' due to the fact that they vibe on the old A.F.I. formula of punk guitar riffs and edgy scremaing from Davey Havok. Also, the bridge in 'Affliction' is quite fantastic.  I'd have to say I was most dissappointed with the \\"emo\\" sounding songs on this album. 'Summer Shudder' and 'The Killing Lights' are both soaking wet with sweat from an emo kid's wrist band. All catchty tunes for sure, but I can't think of one reason to put them on an A.F.I. record. It almost sounds like the band's making more of a bid to get on MTV than to stay true to the roots that won them the fanbase they have today. <br /> <br />And while I've outlined the fact that this album is a little commercial and slightly style-scattered, I still love the fact that this band maintained their staple, which is creating a record that has a central theme throughout the entire playback. They once again bring out the feelings of disillusion and lonliness, yet for some reason they're able to keep on packaging that and their modern rock sound into one tight album after another. If you really are a \\"thick and thin\\" fan of A.F.I., and you don't mind listening to an album from them that has a couple of dull spots, definately pick up \\"Decemberunderground\\". It's not their brightest star in the sky, but they've once again managed to put together a CD that when you hear it, you say to yourself, \\"Oh, that must be A.F.I.'s new one.\\" And I know, as a musician, there's no better compliment in the world than that.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|First of all let me start by saying that I've been an AFI fan since I first saw them on their tour for \\"Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes\\". I've watched the band change their style of music several times, and never once have I thought that they did it because they were trying to sound more MTV-friendly or any junk like that. I've watched as a lot of their original fans left as soon as they showed any sign of becoming more popular. Sure there are a lot of bands out there that do sell out and try and turn their music into something more marketable, but AFI has always seemed to make the music that they want to make, and not just what they thought would sell. But because of this, many of their fans have been alienenated because they wanted them to make another album just like 'Black Sails' or just like 'Very Proud of Ya'.<br /><br />That said, I think that this album is a remarkable achievement for AFI. While I won't lie, their are albums of theirs that I like better, I think it really shows that they put a lot of work into making each one of the songs on this album unique. Davey Havoc has obviously worked very hard on getting more range in his voice and the way in which he screams sounds a bit more perfected, though some hardcore enthusiasts might be turned off by that. The base lines are much more interesting than previous albums, and the guitar parts are much clearer and more defined. You can still hear many of the same themes in their lyrics as with previous albums.<br /><br />I think that it's really strange that people would think that they were so visionary and genious in their first albums but not see the genious in this one. The first albums, honestly, sound quite generic for punk rock, as there are probably hundreds of bands out there that have that garage-punk feel. Yet since then, every album AFI has come out with has gotten more and more original, more developed, and is a more specific AFI sound, yet people say this is \\"selling out\\"? Come on. Strange also, I think many people get turned off by them because they have this younger fan base (I can't tell you how I felt the first time I saw a 12 year old wearing an AFI shirt...), and so they assert that as AFI having purposely changed their music in order to get their fans, which is false. I can almost guarantee that if this album somehow could have come out when they were on Nitro, before they became super popular, a lot more people would have opened their mind to it and given it a chance, but now it's just like \\"oh, AFI has younger fans now so the music must suck, and why should I listen to it?\\" Which is just rediculous and close minded. Like the band for their music and not for their fans (Tool, anyone?)<br /><br />So, if you're an old AFI fan but have enough of an open mind to realize that they put A TON of work into this album (more than any other album previously), and they've ALWAYS made their music for the right reasons, and they STILL put on some of the most amazing shows I've seen (last time I saw them in Seattle was unbelievable),  give this album a try - AND I DON'T JUST MEAN ONE LISTEN - let it grow on you a little bit. Hopefully then you can appreciate the album for what it is and not just get scared away because a couple of little kids like the music, too.lso, I think many people get turned off by them because they have this younger fan base (I can't tell you how I felt the first time I saw a 12 year old wearing an AFI shirt...), and so they assert that as AFI having purposely changed their music in order to get their fans, which is false.

0553278223|5.0|The Martian Chronicles is actually a collection of stories rather than a novel.  Each story is separate from the others, with different characters and different conflicts.  Though they are all different they all concentrate on the same subject, mars, and its exploration by the people of earth. <br /> The reason I read this book is that after reading Fahrenheit 451 I found Ray Bradbury to be a writer I really liked, and although I didn't like The Martian Chronicles quite as much as Fahrenheit 451, I still enjoyed reading it. <br /> At first I was put off by the idea of the stories, but eventually it came to be one of the things I really liked about the book.  The stories made it easier for me to pick up the book and read for only short periods at a time. <br /> Another thing I liked about this book was Ray Bradbury's descriptive writing style.  The descriptions of the Martians and their cities were really detailed.  It was interesting to see how Ray Bradbury imagined the inhabitants of mars. <br /> The only way I was really let down at all by this book was with the lack of aliens.  I kind of expected the book to mainly deal with the aliens of mars, but they didn't  really play that big of a part in most of the stories, of course if the had the theme would be different and the book might not have been as good. <br /> Overall I thought this book was really good and well worth reading.  I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates good writing. <br />
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I love this movie. I don't think it did terribly well in the theatres, but similar to the Family Guy, the secondary markets kept this one alive till it blew up. It's a staple in any college kid's collection and a movie whose references have seeped into young adult culture. Although it falls under the \\"stupid movie\\" category, it's very intelligently written and is a wonderful satire on both the fashion industry and Hollywood. To try to describe the plot would be difficult, other than the major premise that for hundreds of years male models have been used as professional assassins, unbeknowst to them. It's a great movie and Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson shine.
B000F48CD8|4.0|A reviewer below made a claim that anyone who consideres Jack White to be a great musician has never read a musical theory book. Ahem. Sir, please step down from your high horse. I have seen The White Stripes perform live twice, both times were great but the second time left me and the other three in my party with a magnificent euphoric feeling that i had never felt, nor replicated since. In my humble opinion, Jack White is this generations greatest musical artist. He is always creating, experimenting and trying new things, and only seems to be getting better. To critcize a musician and those who enjoy his music because it doesn't fit your idea of \\"musical theory\\" is not only ignorant, but also incredibly condecending.  <br /> <br />Now on to the album. It is true that \\"steady as she goes\\" is the albums best song. That being said, i have listened to the album through and through and never feel the need to skip a track. \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" (the song, not the album) is a bit of a departure, and not for everyone but i particularly like it. Level is a good funky rock and roll song with some decent riffs. Bottom line? This album is what you get if White Stripes records and Brandon Benson records were to mate. I still prefer White Stripes albums but this is a very good album and well worth your time and money.
0312323867|4.0|After reading Something Borrowed I desperately wanted to know what would happen next in the Darcy-Rachel-Dex-Marcus saga. And with Something Blue, I was not let down. While not as captivating as it's predecessor, Griffin remains true to her great character writing. I thought it was great that this novel was in Darcy's voice. A good read for fans of Something Borrowed.
B0000DEO90|5.0|Paul, Linda and their band do a great job on this double CD set of the live, three LP album released in 1976. Paul's voice is full of energy and the band is electric. Their passion to perform enhances even further the great recordings on this two CD set.<br /><br />The two CD set starts off strong with the medley of \\"Venus And Mars-Rock Show-Jet,\\" then the tempo slows down in just the right way with a somewhat more mellow \\"Let Me Roll It.\\" Awesome! It's great to hear the crowd enjoying these fine live performances. I really liked \\"Medicine Jar\\" in which Paul sings that \\"there's more to life than blues and reds;\\" Paul is referring to how life can be fresh and exciting without drugs. \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is the classic song Paul wrote about his first wife Linda; and \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" never ceases to move me when I think of special people who have been in my life. \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" is also a slower, pensive song so when Paul and the rest launch into \\"Live And Let Die\\" there's just a little extra shock value at the beginning which is really awesome and helps you enjoy the song and its raw honesty about the cruelty in life all the more!<br /><br />On the second CD, \\"You Gave Me The Answer\\" is a great song with a nice beat and a great musical arrangement! Love it! \\"Listen To What The Man Said\\" and \\"Silly Love Songs\\" are great songs, too. The two CD set ends nicely with \\"Soily.\\"<br /><br />This was not recorded all on one night; Paul, Linda and the band were on tour and they wanted only the very best versions of the songs for the album set. Nevertheless, don't be fooled: this is a WHOPPER of a two CD set. You'll never know that these songs were recorded on several different occasions; they were pieced together that professionally! I also agree with people who write that the sound is better than they would have expected for a live recording made at that time. I was pleased with the quality of the sound even when I listened to it all again on my portable CD player.<br /><br />There are no liner notes; instead you get some awesome pictures of Paul, Linda and the band while they were on this tour. Some of the pictures have been colorized for an extra-special \\"psychedelic\\" effect; I liked that because it highlights the \\"intensity\\" with which the band played. And, if you have any doubts about that, get this CD and find out why I'm so enthusiastic!<br /><br />I recommend this two CD set for Paul's fans (obviously), and fans of good ol' rock and pop. There are some classic Beatles songs, too, that add a nostalgic element to this song set and that's always a plus. Enjoy! Bless You, Paul!  SMILESable CD player.  <br /> <br />There are no liner notes; instead you get some awesome pictures of Paul, Linda and the band while they were on this tour.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|Typical corporate PR bull. Of course their official standpoint on the issue is that the original prints are not available. That way, in a few years, they will \\"miraculously\\" restore them and release them on whatever consumer format happens to be dominant at the time. Come on, LucasFilm is squeezing every penny they can out of a 30 year franchise. It is SO obvious their marketing BS stinks. I recognized that foul stench!
B000E41MS6|5.0|OK, <br /> <br />I had reservations when the combo of Russell T. Davies and Christopher Eccleston was announced. Russell was best known as the creator of \\"Queer as Folk\\" and Christopher was, at least to me, the nasty Duke of Norfolk in 'Elizabeth' starring Cate Blanchett. <br /> <br />Now, let me mix in that I am HUGE fan of the Early Doctor Who (read as 16mm telecine and monochromatic and you get the idea). I really enjoy the years from Patrick Troughton to Tom Baker. I like Peter Davidson too. <br /> <br />I am a \\"fan\\" of the 'classic' Doctor Who. I am not a *fanatic* (I don't have a 27-foot long scarf, my mom would never knit one anyway :) ) <br /> <br />Now you have a picture of a HUGE fan of Doctor Who. Still am! <br /> <br />Let's turn forward to 2005 and the new series. <br /> <br />I was ROCKED when I watched the first episode. Yes, gone are all the hokey effects, the \\"clamps and bits of wire\\" and the sometimes entirely passable acting and rubber suits. <br /> <br />Christopher Eccelston brings the Doctor to the new series and he is absolutely FANTASTIC (yes, one of his favorite sayings!). Billie Piper ROCKS as Rose. She is one of the best companion characters I have seen. <br /> <br />And Russell... well, what can I say. He gets my vote as almost on level with Sydney Newman (he created Doctor Who, in case you didn't know) with just about a genius in regard to the way he resurrected a series, gave it a new flair and set it on the road to success. I will never question him for what he has done to bring back my all-time favorite series. <br /> <br />OK... now a few notes about the new series. <br /> <br />'Rose' is a great opening episode.  <br /> <br />I found 'The Unquiet Dead' to be quite a good episode and had a nice 'Who' touch to it. <br /> <br />'Father's Day' is good with a nice performance by Billie Piper. The interaction between the Doctor and Rose's mum is not to be missed. <br /> <br />'Dalek' let me down a little at the end, but it was a great start, had an almost Stargate quality about it. <br /> <br />'Bad Wolf' has a great introduction to it. \\"You are now live on Channel 44,000. Please do not swear.\\" \\"Oh, you have GOT to be kidding me.\\" <br /> <br />The Slitheen episodes \\"Aliens of London\\" and \\"World War Three\\" are great. Good writing on what happens when you pop off for a jaunt in the TARDIS and leave loved ones behind. And then you find the time machine has whoops a 18 hour abscence into 12 months... <br /> <br />This is a great television series again and I really enjoy it. I have raved about it to anyone who cared to listen. It's quite simply, excellent!!!

B000F6IOC0|1.0|I really liked the first Underworld ... while not perfect, it developed a compelling and interesting storyline with great visuals, a good cast (ok..Kate Beckingsale) and a narrative platform to develop and extend the series into a compelling franchise. By those standards, Underworld Evolution has got to be considered a flop. It has a confusing backstory that adds nothing to the central characters and instead substitutes infantile fights and violence throughout the length of the movie and Derek Jacobi in one of the sillier and embarassing roles of the year. No extension of the promising storyline from Underworld is developed instead leaving you with the expected .. stay tuned for more! Well those who stayed till the end may have gotten the message but anyone expecting something similar to the original Underworld probably left a long time ago.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game has quickly become an essential book for any science fiction fan. Card creates a world where gifted children are trained to become generals and soldiers in a war of galactic proportions. Although the basics of the plot itself follows a standard course - Ender is found to be the most gifted of the children and the burden of being the best and staying there slowly weighs him down, but because the fate of first his friends and then the world rests on his shoulders, he keeps going - Card's imaginitve details make this novel such a pleasure to read. It's the kind of novelistic candy you can enjoy by turning off your brain and reading and absorbing it in the same way you would a television show. This is a highly enjoyable read and one that everyone, at any age, should take up.
0689878451|5.0|I work at a library. When I read \\"...And Tango Makes Three\\" as it came in as a new acquisition...I LOVED it. I loved the message that a family isn't always, nor does it have to be, a \\"traditional\\" setup for it to be real and functional. No...Roy and Silo prove the ultimate definition of the word \\"family\\" really equals one thing. LOVE. As long as the love for the child is there, it doesn't matter if there's a mom and dad...or two dads...or two moms.<br /><br />I ordered this book as a gift for a friend and her baby. She loved it as much as I did, and I know she will read it over and over again as her child will be brought up in a home that embraces tolerance and cultural diversity.<br /><br />Fantastic book. I may just order another copy for myself!
0393327655|5.0|This book is simply a life changer. For someone such as myself who is already an atheist this book articulates some of the arguments that I had failed to make clear in the past. At the same time it brings very important matters into a whole new context. I feel this book is largely a success in that fashion. There are so few people who have the testicular fortitude to put forth solid truths in such a fashion as Harris. He simply lays out facts, cites them, and then places them in a functional context so you can see the situation as clearly as possible. I feel his book is not only important but necessary. He outlines very real dangers in within the world we live in, and in doing so I hope he opens up a lot of eyes. There isn't anything as important as the way our lives are affected by people with power. Every decision they make matters to us and it is about time we begin to question the driving forces behind these decisions. I feel that hard core people of faith can take lessons from this book that are invaluable in the world they live in. You can be religious and question the drive behind another religious beings decisions. It only takes a slight deviation from your own views to point the world towards perdition.

0393327655|1.0|Sam Harris is very intelligent and tries hard to show it.  Unfortunately this book should never have made it past the editor's desk without wholesale revisions.  The first substantive chapter is thought-provoking and lays out an interesting schema; unfortunately, the author has difficulty writing more than a single cohorent paragraph and then relating it to his overall thesis or to a chapter's thesis.  The reader doesn't need three pages of unexplicated direct quotes from the Quran to get the author's point.  Similarly, the reader will be insulted by the quote on Buddhism picked by the author closing his eyes and pointing his finger at a random page.  Clearly, given the title, the publisher knew it would sell.  There are lots of other well-written books on the issues around religion and terrorism ... avoid this one.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|Back in the fall of 2002 I saw the promo for a new show called \\"Everwood\\". The storyline intrigued me. I usually try to pick one new show per year to watch and stay with. I chose \\"Everwood\\" for that year. I was fed up with endless and frenetic crime, lawyer,reality, and medical shows which now grace (and saturate) our airwaves. This seemed different. The show intrigued me from the beginning. Shortly into the series I became aware that the writers of this show were doing something very clever, but I could not put my finger on it. About mid way through the series I figured it out on my way to work. The writers had worked a subtle Rockwell motif into the story. It is most explicitly seen in the opening credits during the first season. The shots of the cast are not only done in Rockwell's style but are also seen in quintessential Rockwellian settings. A clever twist- take a hip, yet disfunctional, New York family of the 21st century and plunk it down in \\"fly-over country\\" - the small town America of Norman Rockwell. The  motif was again alluded to, when, in a later episode, I noticed a copy of Rockwell's  \\"Country Doctor\\" hanging on the wall of the doctor's den. The point was then made quite explicit in the episode \\"Miracle of Everwood\\" when the journalist makes reference to the picture as he attempts to justify the inaccurate story he is going to publish. I was pleased to discover that in the commentary track Berlanti talks about the motif in the opening credits and how hard and expensive it was to do. Details and texture such as this can add so much to the storytelling.  Furthermore, some of the editing was of a very high quality and emulated a lot of techniques used in cinema: graphic matches, matches on action etc. Whoever chose the songs also did a very good job. The selections were not just the music popular today (also designed to sell more WB cds). Some great standards from the past were used as well, such as Etta James' \\"At Last\\". I have great respect for Berlanti and the writers on this show. The constraints of the medium force them to work very fast and to appeal to as big a market as possible.In such an environment it is hard to produce anything that rises above the level of schlock. Thus, it always amazes me when anything really good emerges from such a format. While I, like other fans of the show, am disappointed to see it cancelled, I have to say that the miracle is that it lasted as long as it did. Given the moronic network it was on and the minimal backing it received, we were fortunate to get four years out of it. While it was killed off undoubtedly before its time - there is one blessing. It will remain one show that never \\"jumped the shark\\". The idiots at CW have seen to that.

B000F6IOC0|3.0|Part 1 never did much for me. About the only good thing I can say about it is that it has Kate Beckinsale in leather. Here she's in leather and I think she gives a better performance. She looks incredibly hot and I like the story more and there's also more action. Her relationship between her Scott Speedman's character develops more as well. I don't know why so many people give this one a low rating and talk about part 1 like it's all that. I had a lot more fun watching this one than I did with the first movie. I like the main villian that has bat wings although it's never really explained how he got like that. We just know that he's a half-breed that's trying to free his very strong werewolf brother from his hidden prison cell.

B0000CGV00|5.0|There are a few works by Part where he isn't exactly meditative, but I haven't heard anything like this before. This is one of those recordings that, whether the fault of the engineers or simply electronics weren't built to reproduce things like this, that takes any sound equipment to its limits. Not something you can appreciate on a clock radio for sure. It's a moving work as a whole, but the central chaos is painful. In a good way though.    And the Choral Fantasy is wonderful here. My new favorite Beethoven work.
B00005JP4W|5.0|This is an amazing film on many levels.  What makes this such a great film is that it is in fact a lecture on global warming, but done in such a way that it both conveys an enormous amount of information in an engaging and dynamic way, and provides a human context to that information by interspersing the lecture materials with highlights in the life of the presenter.<br /><br />Al Gore uses Keynote, a program that is Apple's equivalent to Microsoft's Powerpoint, but offers far sharper images and dynamic transitions.  This is emphasized by the huge plasma screen that Gore uses to project his images--if only my university had such screens!<br /><br />I originally became interested in this film after buying a Macbook and discovering Keynote--Apple's website has a brief intro to the film focusing on its use of Keynote.  As a professional lecturer, I was intrigued by this presentation tool and interested to see how a prominent politician would use it.<br /><br />Gore's presentation in the film is quite spectacular, and he must have received plenty of help in putting it together.  Overall one leaves the film with a much more coherent understanding of what is happening to our planet and what we can do to solve the growing crisis.  This film will hopefully encourage those who have had their heads in the sand to pull them out and confront the situation, and find ways to combat it.<br /><br />To put it mildly, hydrocarbon emissions, deforestation, melting glaciers, powerful storms, and eroding ice shelves all add up to a disaster whose proportions will make 9-11, Katrina, and the 2005 Tsunami look like minor incidents in comparison.  Gore uses statistical charts, but also amazing dynamic maps and satellite images showing the patterns of ocean currents, storm movements, and potential effects of rising ocean levels on the world's coastlines.  The visual effects are stunning and shocking.<br /><br />Thankfully the film ends on an up note, suggesting ways that we as individuals, communities, and nations can combat this crisis.  Here is my only caveat to the film:  it could have focused more on this final section, which in comparison to the rest of the film seems rushed.  And yet the ultimate message is clear:  do something now before it is too late.e as individuals, communities, and nations can combat this crisis.

I guess the DJ played this CD because he knew it is so vanilla it wouldn't offend anybody. There is nothing about this gentleman's voice or the arrangements that jump out at me. I will commend him for the great song selection. But I just felt bored while listening. Very bland.

I expected somewhat of a story line like \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" but soon found myself drowning in page after page of statistics and data.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Unlike many BBC productions, North and South, based on the Elizabeth Gaskell novel, did not air in the United States. However, thankfully it has been released on DVD to garner American fans.<br /><br />North and South tells the story of two people, Margaret Hale, a sheltered young woman from the south of England; and Mr. Thornton, a mill-owner in the industrial North. Not just a love story, North and South shows the conditions and struggles both workers and dwellers during the Industrial Age had to endure.<br /><br />The production is truly superb. There is wonderful acting from period-drama newcomer Daniela Denby-Ashe, but Richard Armitage gives a stand out performance as the brooding Mr. Thornton; viewers will be hard pressed not to fall in love with him after this.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South rates among the top of costume dramas.

0790729377|5.0|This is a very emotional film.  It induces emotion in the viewer, and for that I give it five stars.  I'm more interested in constructive criticism than in praise, so even though I think it is an excellent film, I will just focus on what I think is wrong with it.<br /><br />One problem is that Blanche DuBois is simply too pretty for the role.  We don't understand, on a gut level, why this beautiful girl would worry about hiding behind dim lighting.  The script makes it clear that she is supposed to look \\"old\\", and yet she doesn't.  That's a fault of the film.  It makes her final passionate scene with Karl Malden incomprehensible.  He holds her up to the light, she looks very pretty, and yet we are supposed to believe that she looks terrible in bright light.  For that I blame the director, Elia Kazan.  What in God's name could he have been thinking of, and why did he mess up so badly on that important detail?<br /><br />Another important fault of this film is that Stanley Kowalski's attack on Blanche isn't set up properly.  Are we just supposed to believe that he is an animal, and chalk it up to that?  Sorry, not good enough.  We should have seen it coming.  Again, another big mess-up by Kazan.  When the script has the characters doing something that doesn't ring true, there's a problem.  We needed to see that attack being led up to.  We needed to think \\"Oh my god, I know what he is about to do.\\"<br /><br />Stanley Kowalski is actually the good guy throughout most of the movie.  All of a sudden it turns.  It's incomprehensible.  Somewhere between the writing, directing, and acting, somebody dropped the ball somewhere.  The Stanley Kowalski who attacks Blanche is not the same man who appears earlier in the film.  He's not an \\"animal\\".  He's not set up that way for us. Blanche is the snob, and Stanley is okay, but that is turned on its head at the end.<br /><br />Insanity is a nice little copout.  We can make our actors do anything, and just say okay, they went nuts.  Very touching, but not very realistic.  How does someone go insane?  What stages do they go through?  Blanche's descent into insanity, into an inability to tell reality from fantasy, should have been more realistic, more researched, more consistent with the way it actually happens.  It does happen to people, people who are extremely bipolar, people who are schizophrenic.  More research should have been done, to show what the descent into insanity actually does look like.<br /><br />I have high standards, but that's a good thing, I think.  Still, I've given this film five stars.nuts.  Very touching, but not very realistic.  How does someone go insane?  What stages do they go through?

B00005ATQD|5.0|Eyes Wide Shut is a drastically misunderstood and underrated movie.  It is one that can be enjoyed deeper and on many different levels the more times you see it.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are both brilliant in their roles.  How this movie got overlooked at oscar time, I'll never understand.  Stanley Kubrick again creates more emotional imagery and mood to tell his story than anything else.  An artform that he is by far the best at.  And he does it with elements that would be taboo and detructive to most other people's styles.  He weaves a web and takes you exactly where he wants you to go once he's got your attention.  Perhaps the word artist is more fitting to describe Stanely Kubrick than any other director in the history of cinema.  Sadly this is to be Kubrick's final film.  He was one of the best, and this is one of his best.
B0007O38F8|1.0|To sum it all up real quick: this album is filled with pathetic ryhming and his inability to rap is so easily filled by singing. 50 Cent is a shame to hip hop and I wonder if the likes of Pac, Biggie and Eazy were still with us would 50 Cent be where he is now?
0783225849|5.0|After Alfred Hitchcock spent most of his career perfecting the suspense genre, with one movie he redefines the horror genre.  Few director's have manipulated an audience in this fashoin.  He uses character development that makes you like and dislike almost all characters in the movie to a degree.  The main character(s) in this movie change with brilliant transitions, sometimes shockingly. The antagonist of the movie changes face literally.  The plot that is even initially created becomes secondary and insignificant by the movies turn.  And ending you are in for is anything but predictable.  Done low scale and in black and white, at a time when everything was in color, Psycho broke the mold of the original horror picture and set the standards for every one thereafter to follow.

Also they said they wanted to go out and \\"get some squirrel\\" [sick] There word for soemthing I wont repeat because iam a gentleman!  As they were getting ready, gelspiking there hair, putting on there strpped hilfigure dress shirts, i didnt know what to do.<br /><br />Thats when I noticed Batman Begins was on the Hotel tv's pay-per-view!!!  I thought they might want to stay in and watch it, but they didnt!!  This was different from years ago when we ALL would have and then discussed it afterwords!!!  So as they left, the smell of Hugo trailing behind them to the closed door i setled in!!!<br /><br />What a great movie!!! i watched it twice in a row that night (although ihd alredy seen it in the theatre)!!<br /><br />It made me think, PEO-PLE!! that friend's change but heroes dont!! sure, maybe Spider man has a blak costume or superman realizes he ahs a new power, but Heroes are always that, HEROES!!! they are our omfort and protectors...Thye are and alwyas will be our...FRIENDS.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Perhaps the most subtly funny dialogue I can think of in a movie ever.  It attacks serious subject matter with absurdity in a style that never makes it seem hokey, and a the same time, never takes itself seriously.  Stanley Kubrick's screenplay is genius and Peter Sellers is amazing!

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, and I found both the movie and the score to be magnificent.  The music suits the movie very well and was excellently composed and performed.  It captures the spirit of the movie and it suits the times, flowing with the movie and enhancing it.  It is one of the few movies found where the music stays with you, as in Harry Potter, the Chronicles of Narnia, the Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, and others.  I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone who enjoys classical music at all, and perhaps even to some who don't.  I would also recommend it to anyone who plays the piano--even if you don't play classical, you may find it helpful.
B000001ES9|5.0|Many will think Zeppelin after their first listen of this album which is not a bad thing at all , but poor David Coverdale is still looked at as a Rober Plant rip-off with no identity whatsoever ; Geddy Lee does a great Plant impersonation in this one before entering the fascinating prog-rock rock world flapping his own wings. <br />This is a true work of rock 'n' roll art with a great opener, catchy middle which keeps anticipated for more and more and an ending that will absolutely blow up your mind making you wanting to replay it.Surely, the L.A. scene which was in its high during the late eighties based their edge and style on such albums. <br />
B00006V9A0|4.0|When I first decided to buy this album, I knew very little of Nirvana, save the notorious death of frontman Kurt Cobain, and had only heard a couple of their songs. I wasn't sure which of their albums to buy (because I didn't know of the strong popularity of their album \\"Nevermind\\"), so I ended up purchasing this one. It was great from start to finish, including all my favorites that I had heard on the radio and online, and it opened up a new door in which I wanted to buy the rest of their albums (on the top of the list being their final performance on MTV's Unplugged). I've seen some other reviews here saying how this album was unnecessary and \\"damaging to Nirvana's legacy\\", but I don't see how it is. And if you're one of those people, you most likely own all the songs listed on here anyway (except perhaps \\"You Know You're Right\\", the only new song on the album), so try to see it from a casual fan's point of view. I have become a strong fan since then, but I still believe that this album is a good introduction to the grunge greatness that is Nirvana, and it includes most of their famous hits (\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", etc.), so this is a perfect album for the unseasoned Nirvana fan.<br /><br />While Nirvana may not be quite as talented as fellows-in-grunge Alice in Chains, there's no denying that Nirvana has plenty of personality. Every word that escapes from Kurt Cobain's mouth seems to be laced with a desperate emotional tie, making you believe that he's being sincere about the lyrics (which you can't understand sometimes, but it adds to the mysteriousness of the whole affair), and though he may be no Jimmy Page on the guitar, he strums out some driving riffs and brief, compelling guitar solos that complement the song very well. Bassist Krist Novoselic is quite the bassist, creating some deep, quiet bass lines that perfectly complement the loud, boisterous guitar work. Drummer Dave Grohl is definitely the backbone of the band, pounding out some heavy drum riffs and keeping in beat the whole time and tying the entire thing together to keep it from falling apart. When all the instrumentalists are playing together, they form an excellent harmony that is the reason Nirvana reached the legendary level that they did (and perhaps because Kurt died; funny how that will boost an artist's popularity. i.e. Jimi Hendrix).<br /><br />All in all, if you're already a seasoned Nirvana fan, then you don't have to pick this up, unless you're dying to get your hands  on the new B-side that opens up the album. Other than that, like I've said before, the average casual fan might want to purchase this in order to acquaint themselves with this wonderful group.<br /><br />Track Selections: \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Lithium\\", and \\"In Bloom\\"<br /><br />9/10e band, pounding out some heavy drum riffs and keeping in beat the whole time and tying the entire thing together to keep it from falling apart.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|Despite going as far as to say that the 'original' versions of the Star Wars trilogy (episodes 4 - 6) no longer existed, George Lucas now releases them onto DVD in an attempt to OWN ALL OF THE MONEY IN THE WORLD!!! <br />It's a scheme worthy of the Sidious himself because, despite all of the grouching that you read here, every Star Wars fan will buy it! <br />Why? Why would anyone buy this DVD if they already own the 2004 issue and this one has no extras apart from the commentary? <br />Because of what keeps Star Wars going despite a lack-lustre set of prequels and a tonne of overpriced merchandise - nostalgia. We all (yes, me included) want to relive our youth when Han shot Greedo under the table, Jabba the Hutt was just a name and not a badly CGIed character and the Death Star just sort of 'popped' instead of spectacularly exploding. <br />Yes, we may have the pre-'Special Editions' ('Special'? Ha!) on video but who watches videos these days? No, we all need to shell out another $60 for this trilogy and relive our youth in shiney DVD quality while George scratches his beard and tries to think of another way for us to part with our hard-earned.
B00000IP3S|5.0|Blind Guardian is, without a doubt, one of the greatest power metal bands in existence at the moment, and the album being reviewed here is definitely one of their best, if not THE best. Every song on here is rich, dynamic, and compelling, mixing the high-voltage intensity of thrash/speed metal with the epic musicality of power metal. It also marked the final time lead singer Hansi Kursch would perform while playing bass, allowing him to expand on his vocal talents and therefore leading up to their masterpiece \\"A Night At The Opera\\" that would come seven years down the road. All the musicians in the band are at the best on this one, playing with incredible speed and precision uncommon in a band such as this one. Even live, this band never fails to deliver, though Hansi's voice may not be nearly as epic as heard on here (more than likely because you can't multi-layer your voice in concert), but the crowd more than makes up for the lack of a backing choir. But that's another review all in itself, so let's just stick to this album.<br /><br />First of all is lead singer Hansi Kursch, who has a melodic, penetrating growl (a la Metallica, not death metal) that puts James Hetfield to shame, and while he may not have an amazing range, he has enough force behind his voice to compel you into believing that the stories of which he sings are of his own experience and not just works of fiction. His bass doesn't have much clarity due to the muddled production, he plays at high speeds without skipping a beat or messing up his vocals. Lead guitarist Andre Olbrich has a innate sense of musicality and plays wailing guitar solos that give every song a unique personality, providing a mood for the anecdotes. Rhythm guitarist Marcus Siepen is good at keeping the band in the right key, playing complex Euro-style rhythm sections instead of the chugga-chugga riffing of most American metal bands. Last but not least is drummer Thomen Stauch, who has great skill in keeping beat and doing some excellent drum work while pumping out intense double-bass at quite high BPM, intensifying the speed of the band as well as giving it a solid ground on which to play on. It's a shame that he left, but his replacement Frederik Emkhe, while he isn't nearly as good as Thomen, does surprisingly well to step into the former drummer's shoes in his absence.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're looking for some intense, precise, HEAVY metal, then Blind Guardian is definitely the band for you; or, if you're a BG fan but still haven't purchased this album, then your collection will not be complete without out (obviously). This album is a staple in the library of any metalhead, as it is difficult to find a power metal with the personality that Blind Guardian shows. Other good bands in this vein are Hammerfall, Stratovarius, Helloween, and Iced Earth.<br /><br />Track Selections: \\"Imaginations From The Other Side\\", \\"The Script For My Requiem\\", and \\"Born In A Mourning Hall\\"<br /><br />10/10t drum work while pumping out intense double-bass at quite high BPM, intensifying the speed of the band as well as giving it a solid ground on which to play on.

B00000J7S8|2.0|Diana Krall's popularity is not hard to understand, she's easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice - rich, round, and polished.  But that's where the good news ends.  The selection of material and the narcoleptic Bossa-Nova-on-the-rocks arrangements combine to create a CD that is nothing less than a love song to Darvon, in fact, inside industry sources maintain that the entire CD was recorded in the frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to eliminate the middle man.<br /><br />The rule with standards is, don't do them unless you can bring something fresh to the fair.  Ms. Krall beats these exhausted warhorses mercilessly; cruel and unusual punishment considering it's a wonder they're still standing.  The resuscitation of Popsicle Toes is both the final insult and injury, for blissful years this sliver of saccharine twaddle resided in richly deserved obscurity; how could she do this to us?  Wherever there are hotel lobbies occupied by mildly inebriated people who aren't listening to each other, much less the ambient audio wallpaper, there will be a demand for music of this type.  The Diana Kralls of the world can always find work because for many - smooth equals good.  Walk, don't Krall.  Beyond this woozy, soft-focused world there is music that is real, and really matters.
B000E41MRC|5.0|<br /> <br />Having seen \\"The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl\\" I thought I had seen \\"Triumph of the Will.\\"  Right at the beginning of Ray Müller's documentary (1993) a shot of marching Nazis from \\"Triumph\\" is juxtaposed with a large school of little pink fish from the footage for Riefenstahl's recent \\"Underwater Impressions\\" and the effect is rather funny.  The marching monsters still look scary enough but the school of fish immediately puts this impression into a comical perspective.   <br /> <br />Little did I know!  The 1993 documentary contains many sections from \\"Triumph\\" but the effect of watching \\"Triumph of the Will\\" (\\"Triumph des Willens,\\" 1935) in its entirety is very different indeed.  Forget about comical perspectives. With the exception of a cat catching a glimpse at the Führer, Riefenstahl's film of the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, financed by the Nazi Government and commissioned by Hitler himself, is serious.  Monumentally serious.  Perspectives projected by the film, which \\"doesn't contain a single reconstructed scene\\" (Riefenstahl), are accumulated in the style and service of the militaristic ceremonies they document and surely with the intend to inspire awe.  Quite organically in fact does Riefenstahl's mis-en-scene grow out of the Nazi rhetoric itself, the goose-stepping shadows of marching SA men reinforcing her imagology in the same way as the flashy gestures of the orators reinforce the aggressive delivery of their screamed slogans.  \\"Sieg - Heil; Sieg - Heil; Sieg - Heil!!!\\" \\"Argumentum ad nauseam\\" is indeed a technique of propaganda generation and if a self-proclaimed \\"artistic documentary\\" starts to mimic the cultivated stupidity of the documented it should not only be accused of collaboration with organized idiocy;  it should be accused of the ultimate achievement: of having crystallized the images of banal militaristic rhetoric into something glorious and sumptuous, a colossal apotheosis of power and kitsch.  Hitler Kitsch.  It is the \\"divine\\" presence of the Führer which is towering above the elevated center of this carefully constructed montage.  \\"The party is Hitler!\\" screams Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess. \\"But Hitler is Germany, as Germany is Hitler!\\" Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer -- und ein Film. <br /> <br />Ironically though \\"Triumph of the Will\\" is a very interesting film if seen by a moderately educated  viewer today.  Our knowledge of WWII, the images of Nazi atrocities, holocaust, concentration camps, etc., which have become part of the collective memory, and last not least our over-saturation with modern propaganda and advertisement function quite effectively as the \\"de-kitsching\\" distance which the film itself fails to provide.  While our senses will still be numbed our minds can no longer be seduced.  Riefenstahl claims that she was not really interested in the political content of the speeches and presented the  chosen sections entirely for the dramatic impact which she observed from the gestures as well as from the degree of audience enthusiasm.  We can thus witness an impressive collection of rhetorical climaxes in very quick succession and this allows us to understand the essential Nazi gesture. \\"A people that does not protect its racial purity will perish!\\" screams Gauleiter Julius Streicher his massive bald head filling the entire screen.  His hand stretches out imploringly on \\"people,\\" clenches into a fist on \\"purity\\" and, in a powerful cadence, crushes down on us with \\"perish.\\"  He must have rehearsed this \\"pure\\" martial gesture a thousand times in front of a mirror.  The Nazi rhetoric is basically a rhythmic tour de force.  While completely ignoring strength of argument or logic, it concentrates entirely on accumulation of powerful slogans, sound bites, cadences and the complete elimination of \\"weak\\" gestures.  It is a highly ritualized rhetoric of archaic, of brutal, of bombastic mantras--a militaristic rhetoric which is used as a weapon against thechaos of \\"decadent\\" democracy.   <br /> <br />Kitsch, in the totalitarian realm of Nazi aesthetics, is the absolute denial of weakness.  Interestingly an earlier Riefenstahl \\"propaganda documentary\\" of the 1933 Nazi Party Congress (\\"The Victory of Faith,\\"  \\"Der Sieg des Glaubens\\") shows many technical problems and frequently exposes Hitler in awkward moments.  Interviewed by Guy Müller Riefenstahl appeared to be genuinely furious about this (60 years later!) and refused to even call it a film.    <br /> <br />This special edition also features Riefenstahl's short \\"Day of Freedom\\" (\\"Tag der Freiheit,\\" 1935) about the Wehrmacht, very similar stylistically to \\"Triumph,\\" as well as historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro's excellent commentary. <br /> <br /> <br />     <br /> <br />
B00005R8DB|5.0|It is almost impossible to listen to the title track of this masterpiece without thinking of the cubist paintings of Braque, Picasso, and Duchamp.  In the same way these fearless innovators tried to deconstruct painting into primary elements and start from scratch, Monk seems to be breaking the musical language into fragments and pasting it back together.  But painters work alone.  Monk had to make his revolutionary vision comprehensible to fellow players, accounting for the twelve takes required to get the title composition on tape and the observation by one sound engineer that, \\"After working with Monk I'll never be afraid of anything ever again.\\"<br /><br />A jazz milestone, Brilliant Corners is celebrating its 50th birthday this year.  The album was given to me as a gift a few years after being released and even after repeated playing I truly had no idea of what the heck I was hearing.  What's so strange is that it still sounds \\"modern\\" and abstract today, off-kilter, cattywhumpus, and a bit otherworldly.  The 20bit re-mastering is glorious and offers a glistening precision my old Riverside LP never had, that much is certain.<br /><br />Not only has Sonny Rollins never sounded better, he must be given special consideration for walking into Monk's world and making sense of it.  Known for angularity and disjointed construction, Monk can also be one of the most emotionally compelling of composers and players.  This is abundantly in evidence on Pannonica, an original composition, and on the standard, I Surrender, Dear, which is unrecognizable by the time Monk is through with it.  (Solo Monk interpreting standards is three degrees away from heaven, there are many examples scattered throughout his body of work.)<br /><br />Bemsha Swing returns the tone home to the \\"expect-the-unexpected\\" style we met in the introductory bars.  Max Roach, who performs the Herculean chore of providing a rhythmic bed for Monk's creations throughout, really shines here, demonstrating that he too is comfortable throwing in accents precisely where you would never expect them and right where they satisfy most.  Because this CD is such a lasting jewel in the history of jazz, purchasing this technically superior version is recommended.hrowing in accents precisely where you would never expect them and right where they satisfy most.

B000FDEUFS|5.0|Let's set the record straight. When it comes to The Allman Brothers Band, especially the classic Duane Allman / Berry Oakley era Allman Brothers, I can't be objective. Yes, I'll admit, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool, certified fanatic. Having seen the orginal line up a total of five times....make that five, breath-taking, awe-insipiring, super fantasmaglogia times, I'm clearly not an unbiased source. I saw the ABB on one of their first tours in the winter of 1969 at the Capital Theatre in Portchester, NY. No they weren't the headliners. In fact they played third on the bill to Johnny Winter and headliners Delaney & Bonnie & Friends. Then I saw them three times at the Filmore East and once at the Manhattan Center on 34th Street, accross from Penn Station.    The best of those five shows was the last \\"public\\" concert at the Filmore East. The very last night was a show Bill Graham put on for a celebrity, invited-only audience. I was at the \\"last public\\" show and I'll never forget the intesity of their unforgettable performance. The previously unreleased material on disc two of this new Deluxe Edition of EAP was from that last Filmore show I attended. Cue this puppy up to disc two and hang on to your hat, cause you're in for a ride.     Listen to Duane soaring off into the stratsosphere on \\"Statesboro Blues\\", \\"Don't Keep Me Wondering\\", \\"One Way Out\\" and \\"You Don't Love Me\\". Hear Berry's oh so thick, so heavy and inspired bass lines. Gregg is in great voice, (never sounding better for my money) and Butch and Jai Johnny are just as steady and precise as a Swiss chronograph. Believe me, it just dosn't get any better than this.  The remastering job they did on these thirty five year old tapes is truly magnificent. The unreleased material, as I mentioned earlier is a treasure. The graphics, the packaging, the beautiful vintage photos and the liner notes by Scott Schnider all combine to make this new EAP absolutely indespensible. You can't call yourself an Allman Brothers fan if youdon't rush out and purchase this one. It sure brought me back to that hot sweaty June night on New York's lower east-side where The Brothers obliged the crowd's cheer of \\"Play-All-Night\\"!!!! What a thrill that was!!!
B000E5KUK6|5.0|I must be the only person who gave this 5 stars because i must say i genuinly loved this film. Matthew Broderick plays an excellent role in this movie as the scientist who is hell bent on finding out what made Gojira. It has been 12 years since this remake of the original 1954 legendary classic that first introduced us to Godzilla. <br />For those who are not familiar with the monster in this movie then Godzilla is a lizard mutated by nuclear bomb testing and grew to 100's of stories tall. For some reason Godzilla migrates to new york starting a huge amount of destruction in his path. <br />This movie can get really silly and unrealistic at times, as if the 100 ft tall lizard wasn't unreal enough but at times we see Godzilla be the same height as the empire state building and then all of a sudden a monster that size disappears. <br />It is undoubtedly a movie jam packed with action and amazing special effects and if that's all you're looking for in a movie then you will truly love it.

0767836324|5.0|Robin Williams, Bob Hoskins, Julia Roberts & Dustin Hoffman make up the best starting line up for a movie ever. The story is based around Peter Panning (Williams) Name sound familiar? well it is Peter Pan only 40 years old. Peter left Neverland and forgot who he was and eventually began to age and forgot about his childhood. Work becomes Peter's first priority over his marriage and his family which isn't a good thing. Determined to make Peter remember who he is Tinkerbell (Roberts) comes to collect Peter and remind him of who he truly is. <br />Once in neverland we are first introduced to the scary and imposing figure that is Captain James Hook (Hoffman) and his trusty sidekick Smee (Hoskins). As the story progresses of Peter being brough back to neverland we see the painful task of reminding Peter who he is so he can go into one final battle with Captain Hook. Apart from Hook, Peter has one adversary to overcome first and that's Rufio (Dante Basco) the new leader of the Lost Boys since Peter's absence. <br />Because of Peter's neglegance of his children his son Jack is easily persuaded to join Captain Hook along with his little sister and this is a true low blow for Peter. <br />I have already said too much but all's i'm going to say is you'll love this film as much as i did. Very heartwarming, funny and just a plain nice film that is for the entire family.
B000FILW86|4.0|Since I first saw Cheap Trick at the age of 11 in 1978 (Cobo Hall in Detroit) I knew I loved this band.  Having purchased all of their independent releases after they left the major labels, this is by far their best effort.  Robin's vocals are rough at times but he is still one of the finest pop/rock vocalists I have ever heard.  If you enjoy CT, you will find some magical moments in almost every song.  This is rich music and CT has delivered their fans another incredible experience.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|This is in my personal opinion one of Will Smiths best movies, it didn't recieve that much love from the critics but i personally adored every minute of this movie.  <br />One day in July huge alien spacecraft settle over the major cities of the world, without any warning or indication of their plans they just hover over the cities. In an effort to communicate with the alien spacecraft the millitary send helicopters out to them to try and gain some type of positive reaction, but the reaction they got wasn't planned or wanted. They attacked and destroyed the helicopters and then initiated their initial plan, the center of the crafte opened and revealed a weapon that could destroy miles of the city. Within minutes New York, Washington, Moscow, London, Berlin and other major cities where wiped out in a matter of minutes, this sparked the millitary to launch a counter attack whith no effect whatsoever because they have a shield that cannot be penetrated.  <br />That is all i am going to tell you about the movie as i feel i may have ruined the best part of it for you but i must say this that this is an incredible movie and for it's time had some of the best special effects. Full of action and in a way holds some truth by showing how vulnerable our planet would be if something like this where to happen.  <br />Buy it i promise you will love it
0440224764|5.0|I found this book to be very good and it holds your interest all the way through. While the ending may be disappointing, it is just the final twist in a book that keeps you guessing all the way through. If you start to read it, you wont be able to put it down...
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie had me laughing from start to finish and it wasn't necessarily the jokes but just the whole concept of the movie itself. Brought to us by the Matt Stone & Trey Parker who brought us South Park this is just another example of why these guys are so admired in the world of comedy. Team America a thunderbirds like crew of police who are determined to destroy terrorism from the Muslims. <br />To most people this would be considered to be a racist attack on Muslims but that's not the case, it is merely a poke of fun at the way people look at Muslims since the start of the war and that is shown by how they speak in the movie because after all they are from \\"turka turkastan.\\" <br />The Team itself are puppets worthy of Thunderbirds and it is very comical how they walk and did i mention the puppet sex scene? yes you heard me right a puppet sex scene which will have you roaring with laughter(That was when the wee came out). <br />Like in South Park even the celebrities aren't safe in this political movie as they are part of a crew determined to gain control of the world. <br />If you are a fan of silly type comedy then you will certainly love this film because it is hysterical.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies ever seen,it can be watched over and over and never lose it's humor.Since this movie came out I doubt that there has been any movie as funny and entertaining as this one,it is much much more than a five star.If you've never seen it, you have no idea what you are missing,it is truly a classic. Tom Hanks is at his best in this one.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|The story in this film is very ornate, and its not as gratuitous as some might want you to believe.Blade and Co are summoned to help the regular Vampires fight off a \\"Common Enemy\\", which is part of a story that has many twists and turns.  Overall, its indeed very cool, is a notch up from the first BLADE, but has the \\"Del Toro\\" factor; that is, Del Toro seems to know he is ramping up a Franchise, but he also adds his own little twists and, in a word, perversions. Possibly the key addition to this world, is Del Toro's attempt to remove the sub-text of why Vampires do what they do, and to change the \\"Anne Rice\\" factor.  The DVD  extras are superbly plentiful in this  set. Two Sets of commentaries on disc one ( go for the Wesley Snipes and David  Goyer commentary first, in my view, since that is the most entertaining, and Del Toro's and Frankfurt's commentary is basically a lot of stuff that might be something you need to know as a fan, but not as a movie fan, maybe as a movie maker, and certainly shows that an excess of perversion never stopped amnyone from making good films).  Disc two has two main sections. There is no doubt that Del Toro is creative, however his little obsessions are a tad too much when viewed and heard in this context. The Making of Section is probably the best item to view first. And in the out-takes and deleted  scenes, the commentary is sometimes useful, but is often just plain off the yuck scale. So, its good to see the deletes and out-takes, which are, I think ( my opinion) mostly done correctly, some deletes are just on the level of \\"Why?\\", and the out-takes are fun.  All in all a pretty excellent Value Package. Done before Del Toro did  HELLBOY, it is very illustrative of his creative skill and indulgence in some weird obsessions.
B000002JPA|4.0|OK, before Octavium, before prog megastardom and aggro with Queensryche there came this album. All the rest followed on from here and this disc is really the launch pad for one of the few genuinely successful prog metal bands of the last 20 years. By successful I mean people actually know who they are, rather than a band who - as Spinal Tap might say - have a more selective audience.<br /><br />Other reviewers have done fine jobs detailing track by track this excellent record so I'll not do that, rather just add a few of my own thoughts.<br /><br />Firstly this is a highly influential album. This is a prog band that was also accessable to general music fans and one with real crunch to it's tunes. Just listen to the first two minutes of Pull Me Under. Two minutes and not a second wasted as a huge build up prepares the listener for the distinctive vocals.<br /><br />The best ad for this disc would be to listen to the first three tunes, Pull Me Under, Another Day and Take the Time. This will show you the changes of pace this mob were capable of and the talent at their disposal.<br /><br />Dream Theatre somehow managed MTV acceptance, they made the hair metal mob happy, they garnered heaps of prog fans who went along for the ride and their musical chops were displayed in a way that even got the shred metal guys along for the ride.<br /><br />A very very good album from a truly interesting bunch of guys.
0440241413|1.0|I think about this crappy book a lot. This woman is the most despicable character in modern fiction. She lies to herself and others. She justifies stupidity in a glib way. She has a shopping addiction, and in the end everything works out for her. She never deals with her problem. Can you imagine a book about an alcoholic who's spiraling downward and in the end everything miraculously works out great so she can continue drinking every day and night?! Or a fat woman who can't control her eating, but in the end gets a job as a plus size model and a boyfriend who loves fat women, so she can continue overeating and getting fatter and fatter all the time?! This book was the epitome of frustration for me. She never gets control of herself, and this is supposed to be ... \\"hilarous\\" as the reviews say? To me it's just very sad and completely implausible. (PS. Yes I realize it's fiction. It's still annoying.) <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Only 14 episodes.... sigh. Sure, it was cowboys in space all over again, but so fresh and fun and just original as all get out. <br /> <br />I sat and watched all the DVDs back to back, even though I'd seen some of the shows originally.  <br /> <br />It spawned the movie, Serenity, which is sure to become a cult classic. And if the cast does a second season on DVD, I'll buy that too.
B00005JNRY|4.0|For \\"Cars,\\" the folks at Disney/Pixar created a world in which automobiles replace every other being on Earth. I found this fascinating and baffling at the same time; they drive on roads and highways as they usually would, but they also have the ability to enter buildings, hold cameras, and sit in stadiums like humans. Obviously, this means that they take on human professions; at one point, a Porche named Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) says that she used to be a lawyer in Los Angeles. Interestingly, cars also take on the role of other life forms, including insects (which are appropriately reinterpreted as miniature Volkswagen Beetles with wings) and livestock (replaced by tractors).     But all this is to be expected in an animated film, and in this case, it works even better because the story enables viewers to forget about such unrealistic things. This is a good thing for audiences of any age. For kids, \\"Cars\\" is a cute, well-crafted film with loveable characters. For adults, it's an entertaining animated comedy that manages to be humorous and insightful without getting sickly sweet.    True to the tradition of family friendly Disney films, this is the story of friendship, learning, and redemption, and it offers an important life lesson while maintaining a comedic disposition. One would think that such a formulaic plot would have gotten stale a long time ago, but for whatever reason, it still works. There are probably many reasons for this (not the least of which is the appeal it has for children). The one I stick to is that, no matter how inaccurate, sappy, or unoriginal a story may seem, everyone loves something with a good heart that can deliver a happy ending. \\"Cars\\" is certainly not new in terms of its basic structure or characterizations, but the fact that it literally brings mute and/or inanimate objects to life makes it fun. Pixar is a studio that has proven itself capable of such a task, starting in 1995 with talking toys and continuing in 1998 and 2003 withtalking bugs and talking fish.    Now we have talking cars, and no one seems to like talking more than Lightening McQueen (Owen Wilson), especially if it's in front of a camera. Lightening is a rookie racecar, but he already has a following that outshines most other celebrities of the racing scene. One particular race results in a three-way tie between him, the mean spirited Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), and the competitive but decent King (Richard Petty). In order to break the tie, one more race will be held in California. The winner will receive the prestigious Piston Cup, the fictitious equivalent of the Heisman Trophy or the Stanley Cup. Lightening wants to win with every fiber of his being, not only because he believes it'll turn him into a bigger celebrity, but also because he'll become the new face of a well known car company (he wants to get out of his current sponsorship: a car wax called Rust-eze).    Unfortunately, things are about to get bumpy for Lightening. Even though he's popular, skilled, and photogenic, he's also an arrogant publicity hound. Because he believes he's such a hotshot, he feels he has the right to pressure others into doing what they shouldn't. On the way to California, his mode of transportation--a big rig named Mack (John Ratzenberger)--falls asleep on the road (a situation which isn't helped by a group of neon lighted punk hotrods). This causes the rear hatch to open and Lightening to be dumped off the side of the road. His attempt to find Mack leads him to the famous Route 66. It also leads to a high-speed chase with an irritable, aging police car (Michael Wallis as Sheriff). Not surprisingly, Lightening is caught and arrested.    Thus begins his stay in Radiator Springs, a remote, dilapidated desert town. It has definitely seen better days: buildings have chipped paint and rotting wood; the neon signs are faded and buzzing; and the only intersection with a traffic light is useless because yellow is the only one that seems to workproperly. It's filled with a variety of colorful characters, all of which are somewhat odd but completely good. There's Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a hillbilly tow truck; Ramone (Cheech Marin), a vintage car that loves to change his paint job every day; his wife, Flo (Jenifer Lewis); Filmore (George Carlin), a wasted Volkswagen van whose mind is still stuck in the sixties; the hippie-hater Sarge (Paul Dooley); the Italian tire duo of Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and Guido (Guido Quaroni); the shy fire truck, Red (Joe Ranft), and Sally, the attorney Porche who left the city life of Los Angeles for the freedom of the open road.    The most important character of this group is Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), a character who ultimately takes on the role of the Wise Old Man. He also seems bitter and short fused, especially around Lightening, whose desperation to reach California in time has made him immature and shallow (little does he know that his disappearance has become major news). He's ordered to tow a road-paving machine in order to fix the damage he caused during the high-speed chase, something he's unwilling to participate in. But it eventually becomes clear he's learning a very important lesson: if he wants to achieve his goals, he has to understand the value of thinking of others, not just himself. The relationship he and Doc share is an interesting one: as it turns out, Lightening can actually teach Doc a valuable lesson, one that specifically relates to letting go of the past.    But other characters also need to learn a thing or two, as well. What the locals want is for someone to drive through their city and make use of their services. In other words: they want to revive their home through business and companionship. Ever since a new highway was built out of convenience, Radiator Springs has been all but forgotten. No one is more dedicated to the welfare of the little town than Sally, and eventually, Lightening begins to notice. This in turn reawakens feelings withinhim, feelings of affection and admiration. They also bring about compassionate feelings that make him see the townsfolk in a new light. They're a good group of people (actually, they're automobiles), and they deserve to be treated with respect. But the question remains: will he learn his lesson before he's found and taken to the big race?     I suppose it's unimportant to answer that question. \\"Cars\\" is not about telling a new story; it's about telling an old story in a new way, and that's what makes it such a fun experience. What most impressed me was how the world we all know is adapted to serve the needs of living, breathing cars. Even the scenery takes on a particularly vehicular quality; many of the desert rock formations resemble the shapes of cars, hood ornaments, and hubcaps. I was also impressed by many of the vocal talent the filmmakers assembled. Only Larry the Cable Guy could voice a rusty tow truck with a thick southern accent (they even work in his trademark phrases, \\"Git-r-done!\\" and, \\"I don't care who you are: that's funny right there!\\"). Only George Carlin could voice a character that sells \\"organic\\" gasoline and blares a Jimi Hendrix record in the morning (he seemed to rely on Al Sleezy, the Hippy Dippy Weather Man for this role). All the elements came together to form a decent addition to the Disney/Pixar lineup, a film perfect for kids and adults alike.
044022165X|5.0|I was a little reluctant to read this one, mainly because I was so bored by Grisham's \\"The Client\\" and because I heard this was a \\"funny\\" book. Usually funny means excessively silly and cute. <br /> <br />However, just a few pages into this novel I knew it was different. Maybe becuase I could relate to the Rudy character, having graduated grad school not too long ago and having concerns about what Id be able to do with my degree, it kept me reading non-stop.  <br /> <br />THe writing is personable, like it's really written by a young man just out of law school. The humor in it is just right, not over the top silly, but enough to make me laugh every so often. It's also fascinating material for anyone who has considered going into law ot just like watching law-based shows on TV.  <br /> <br />A few reviewers have pointed out that there are a couple inconsistencies with the story, particularly the ending, though by that time I was more than willing to cut Grisham a little slack and overlook it. THe previous 500 pages of enjoyment I got gave him some leeway in putting together an ending that was, maybe, a little clumsy. <br /> <br />Whenever I read one of Grisham's novels I think that the main characters, in some way, reflect on his own experiences and opinions from when he was an attorney. All I can say is that I am very glad that the legal profession turned out not to be his true love and that he decided to become an author. I highly recommend this book!
0767836324|3.0|This was a cute idea and a blown opportunity.  Spielberg's trusty messages are on full stage here.  This gives us our \\"how to be a good parent\\" message just like his \\"War of the Worlds\\" did and the obvious diversity in your face make-up of the Lost Boys is as plain as Jeff Goldblum's daughter in \\"Jurassic Park:  The Lost World\\".  Why couldn't we just have a rousing, magical tale with pirates et al?  Why does he have to teach us a lesson in his films?  That being said, the performances are first class.  It is just a shame that the focus of the film was so blurred.
B000001DVD|5.0|this album totally rocks from start to finish. this is when def leppard were at their best and most original. even though i heard some people say it sounds like ac\dc it is true in some ways, but after listening to this album they have their own unique sound and don't sound like anybody else. great band back then, you can also tell when bands are hungry and young and want to get sucessful at their job. just like a lot of other rock this is three chord rock and that is what ac/dc is most famous for doing. this starts out with let it go. great song, i love the intro to hit and run, great way to start the next song, just cool. high n dry is a cool tune and pete willis puts a nice solo on this one. bringin on the heartache is kinda sappy although it is well written. switch 625 just rocks, crank it up loud and enjoy, good riff. you got me runnin is also a good tune. lady strange is one of the best they ever wrote in my mind. great song. on through the night rocks too. i also thought this is probably leftover from the first album, who knows. mirror mirror is cool. no no no is a great song. overall this album was the last this band was ever that good. i think they should have kept pete willis or they should have got somebody better than phil collen at least. just doesn't seem to do nothing for them like pete and steve clark did. after this album they went down and the better songs on piromania pete willis wrote. after that they were finished. but this album still sounds fresh when you put it on and crank it up. hope you enjoyed my review.
B000EYK4GW|4.0|I bought this movie a couple of days at the Disney Store where I work. I believe Dumbo to be one of the finest classics to come out of Disney during the 1940's. Walt Disney himself said this movie was to be his favorite one to come out of his own studios. <br /> <br />However, with the Big Top Edition, I expected better remastering of the movie. The majority of the picture and sound are crisp and clean and very brilliant in color, however there are moments when it's not. For example, in the beginning of the \\"Pink Elephants on Parade\\", you can see some faded color with scratches on the film clearly seen over Dumbo's face. The sound in the song sung by the black ravens, \\"When I See An Elephant Fly\\" is a bit underdone in the remastering as well as it becomes harder to hear in this portion of the movie--almost as if the film had aged so bad that the soundtrack is beyond repair.  <br /> <br />Other than these difficulities, I believe the release deserves four stars. If you have kids, the bonus features are specifically geared towards them. They'll enjoy it.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|This movie was definately shot well and was entertaining for the most part, but the hype behind it is silly. I've heard some people refer to this as one of the greatest war movies ever made. Gimme a break. The trauma that these characters went through was hard to empathize with. They weren't in battle. The movie strings you along, until at the very end you relize there will be not conflict. Are they trying to tell us that war is hell if you don't get to shoot someone?  <br /> <br />I'm sure the book was much deeper than this movie. At least in a novel you would get some insight into what the characters were thinking. I understand they were away from family, girlfriends, etc. Big deal. I'm sure they could have picked a better story to portray the brave men and women who served in desert storm. Ones who actually engaged the enemy and suffered the trauma of battle. Don't get me wrng, I'm very proud of all the men and women who serve and protect this country. I just feel that a movie marketed as a modern day war movie -- should show us the life of the many heroes that fought and served in that war. Not the lives of a few that mourn the fact they didn't get to see any action.    <br /> <br />Just my opinion. Based on some of the other reviews it's not a popular one. Oh, well.

B000009RC2|5.0|Having just recorded with Miles Davis (Tribute to Jack Johnson, 1971), guitarist extraordinaire John McLaughlin and thunderous drummer Billy Cobham joined together with Jan Hammer (electric and acoustic piano), violinist Jerry Goodman, and electric/acoustic bassist Rick Laird to produce this remarkable 1971 debut.  The approach taken on the Inner Mounting Flame fused the energy of rock with an admixture of jazz, resulting in a rock-jazz hybrid (with an emphasis on the rock side of the equation).<br /><br />The music on this album simply burns and at times the intensity is frightening.  Odd meters abound (e.g. 5/8, 9/8, although even more exotic meters are used), with numerous and hairpin metric shifts and some really weird root movements.  McLaughlin plays with such passion, volume, and sheer speed that he makes contemporary electric guitar \\"shredmasters\\" look like they are moving in slow motion...or simply asleep.  Although this album really knocks you for a loop, there are also some great grooves and quieter, more calm and reflective moments (A Lotus on Irish Streams).  All of the guys in the band are excellent musicians and most importantly, they listen to one another - as a result there is some excellent interplay, especially between McLaughlin, Hammer, and Goodman.  Cobham of course is a true virtuoso and his superb technique never ceases to amaze.  Last but not least, bassist Rick Laird is the anchor in the band and keeps everybody from launching into orbit around the Earth.<br /><br />The remastering of this album is OK and features some detailed liner notes and good sound quality.  Of course, as somebody who once owned this on vinyl, the CD will never hold the same magic, but the music will always be incredible, no matter what format it is presented in.<br /><br />This landmark recording is very highly recommended along with the follow-up album Birds of Fire (1973).
0780624890|5.0|This is still an awesome movie.  Wesley Snipes shows he's got many angles to his acting.  He gives the character Blade depth and heart and it carries though to the very end of the film.  Awesome special FX and a good storyline make \\"Blade\\" not just your average vampires gone wild type of thing.  I can still watch it and enjoy every minute. Buffy ain't got sh*# on Blade OK.  Aqua Man can't touch this, for real.
B000002UA2|5.0|This 1972 soundtrack for the Barbet Schroeder film \\"La Vallee\\" was recorded during two, one-week sessions, between which a tour of Japan was sandwiched.  Interestingly, the album works as a cohesive whole, in spite of the short recording time, and the \\"dry\\" production (especially on Nick Mason's drums) lends the album a very tight feel.  It has been written that Obscured by Clouds is the last true group effort and I pretty much agree.  The album also finds the band poised on the cusp of massive, global superstardom, which would become fully realized with the mega-smash, mega-million selling album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973).<br /><br />Lyrically, Roger Waters begins to reflect on issues that he would develop further, including his war-victim father (Free Four) and Dave Gilmour refers to science fiction with Childhoods End, which is the title of Arthur C. Clarke's classic from the genre.  I guess it is worth noting that Childhood's End was recorded without the final verse and that Roger would write all lyrics for the group following this album, thus \\"relieving\\" Dave of this responsibility.  Dave's vocals are also excellent and he really comes across as a confident singer.  His guitar playing is also in top flight too.  In addition to tracks with lyrics, there are quite a few instrumentals as well.<br /><br />Musically, I think Pink Floyd was in fine form on this album.  My favorite cuts include the atmospheric, VCS3 synthesizer heavy instrumental tracks Obscured by Clouds, Mudmen, and Absolutely Curtains (loads of Rick Wright's sustained Hammond organ), along with the heavy instrumental When You're In.  Burning Bridges, Wot's...uh the Deal, and Stay are also superb and feature the trademark drifting and spacey Floyd sound.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is the thunderous The Gold It's in the..., which reminds me somewhat of the bone-crushing Nile Song (from More, 1969).  Free Four is the only bouncy and lighthearted track on the album, which stands in stark contrast with Water's dark subject matter - the ruminations of someone on their deathbed.<br /><br />With respect to this 1994 remaster it is just OK and features good sound quality, images from the film, and all lyrics.<br /><br />All in all, this excellent album is a personal favorite and is very highly recommended along with Atom Heart Mother (1970), Meddle (1971), Wish You Were Here (1975), and Animals (1977).Water's dark subject matter - the ruminations of someone on their deathbed.

B000EHRVP6|5.0|I watched this film one night on an \\"off\\" mood, AND all by myself which didn't help.  I guess I witnessed something deeper than what alot of other people saw in \\"Hostel\\".  It's not your average horror flick where you want all the characters to die and get it good.  By the time things went \\"south\\" in \\"Hostel\\", I sort of \\"cared\\" about the 3 tourists guys and the 2 Japanese tourist girls.  This film touches a primal nerve in anyone who is human, if you feel deeply about humanity and all that stuff. I did not expect \\"Hostel\\" to become an evil, witchy, and sadistic film (which it did, and took it's sweet time about it).  There was a realness I haven't quite seen captured in horror films and I don't know how they did it.  Maybe because \\"Hostel\\" flips the script on you, and taps into human fraility and vulnerablity which we all possess.  It exploits all of our weaknesses.  There was an understated sadness throughout the film, you could sort of see it in the characters eyes.  You  feel disconnected and lost when they are in Amsterdam and even more disarrayed when they make the journey to the hostel from hell.  It was eirie and surreal when they arrive there and just got more bizarre and disheartening as the film went along.    Alot of people say it wasn't bloody or gory enough.  I think the psychological mind f*@#$ is worse than  typical movie FX.  They show just enough to make you crawl inside your own skin and want to die there. I have never in all my life had to literally hit the stop button and end a movie out of pure \\"fear\\" or \\"sickness\\".  I had to turn it off after the white guy got it.  Unfortunately,  I have yet to see the rest of the film but have heard alot through hearsay.  After I turned it off, I paced around my house for an hour and sort of began having mild \\"panic attacks\\".  I ended up having to wake up my roomate and explain what was happening.  Since then I have calmed down but I still intend to watch the rest of it.  I would like to say I absolutely hated\\"Hostel\\", but instead I have to say this film literally did what no other film has done to me.  It made me think about it days afterwards.  I would like to say the director and ALL of the actors did an incredible job.  They made this film beyond memorable, so good for them. In hindsight,  leave it to Quintin Tarantino again for involving himself in brilliant filmaking.

068987474X|1.0|<br />I hate to sound rude, but this book repeats itself SO much....It became annoying to me while reading it. Also, it seemed that the \\"advice\\" provided is more common sense/common knowledge to anyone who's ever had a male friend. Seems more an insult to women than an offer of assistance. If you must read it, buy a used copy.
0684853523|5.0|Stephen King pulls back the curtain on his craft and talks about it in this well-done book. I recommend it. It has good insight into his world of writing. It is not a how-to-write book but more inspirational than step-by-step guidance.

I hardly ever find time to read, but it takes no more than five minutes to read each chapter of this book.  Plus, I find myself not wanting to read any more than one chapter at a time, because the concept each chapter covers is so deep, I need time to fully process the message before I sit down to read again.  If you were to read this book straight through, you could easily do it in a day, but you would probably want to read it again several more times soon after and then keep it on hand to refer to time and time again.
B0000041CZ|1.0|I do not like this performance at all.  It's dry, there isn't much energy or passion.  There is a sort of crispness to the playing...things are cut too short.  Tempos are odd.  The emphasis is wrong.  It just doesn't feel right. <br /> <br />I tend to be tolerant of perverse performances such as Glenn Gould...but at least Gould has energy, intensity, flow.  This...is just annoying to listen to.  I'd choose any mediocre pianist playing the WTC in a \\"normal\\" way over this strange and unpleasant performance.  Get a different CD of the WTC, not this one.
B000002GQE|5.0|The Moody Blues' 1967 sophomore effort broke new ground in Rock music. In the same year as THE DOORS, ARE YOU EXPERIENCED? SURREALISTIC PILLOW, SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, PET SOUNDS, and DISRAELI GEARS, DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED built on the not-just-guitar-and-bass-and-drums orchestrations that moved Rock beyond Rock 'n' Roll by incorporating the London Symphony Orchestra as an integral part of the album's musicianship.<br /><br />Very much in the SGT. PEPPER'S mold, the Moodys conceptualized \\"a day in the life\\" of Everyman, from dawn to dusk, and created the world's first integrated Rock Symphony, complete with poetical interludes. While the resulting album is far from perfect, DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED is startling in its vision and breadth.<br /><br />Sometimes the Moodys become pretentious (the insipid LSD-inspired poetry would have been more effectively replaced by Shakespearean sonnets) but the overall impact of DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED is memorable and lingering, well deserving of its place as a classic.
6304712944|2.0|THE REASON I AM REVIEWING THIS IS BECAUSE IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY AMAZON TO ME AND IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE IT RECOMMENDED BUT HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM. <br /> <br />I had listened to the Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, Robert Goulet cast album and loved the score.  I finally got a chance to see the film and it was unbearable. <br /> <br />I would say that it is the cast - most have never been in a musical and never have done a musical again.  But I saw Richard Harris do it on stage and he was brilliant. <br /> <br />I have to put the blame on director Joshua Logan.  Logan was one of the greats of Broadway and Hollywood but at times he got caught up in the luxury of the movie (look at South Pacific).  And this film is overly luxuriant.   <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the show then try and find the Showtime production of the Richard Harris stage production.  This was a beautiful filming of a stage show.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|When I first saw the previews for this film at a movie theater, I really had no intention of seeing it.  Despite the fact that I like both Emma Thompson and Collin Firth, I really didn't think I'd like it.  The theme seemed too contrived and forced, a way of cashing in on the recent burgeoning interest in children's stories that has been fostered by the likes of Harry Potter, Lemony Snicket, and Lion, Witch and Wardrobe.<br /><br />Recently I was feeling a little down and in the mood to watch something light and fanciful with a happy ending.  They say nothing helps a person over a down time than a little laughter, so I decided to give Nannie McPhee a try.  I was very surprised.  The concept, while hardly new, of a nannie shaping up the troublesome children of busy parents is always fun.  I grew up in the Mary Poppins era, so the idea was familiar to me.  How much more entertaining the sinister Nannie McPhee than the saccharine Mary Poppins!  And how much more \\"evil\\" the troublesome kids!  I had a lot more fun than I expected to have.<br /><br />My favorite character is the cook.  Her staunch insistence that the kitchen was off limits to the children because she \\"had it in writing,\\" was delightful.  When she ended up restrained and gaged by the little monsters, with all hell breaking lose around her, it was truly wonderful.  Her's was probably the most challenging role.<br /><br />I've seen Firth in better roles--his Mr. Darcy is definitive in my opinion, and I've seen several versions of Pride and Prejudice, including Olivier's--but he was a little limp in this role.  This is probably because he is not the focus of the story, despite the fact that it is his character's predicament and sacrifice that is the turning point of the tale.  In many ways one has to respect the actor for this underplayed characterization, because he does not try to take over the \\"stage\\" from his younger collegues, ala Jim Carrey.<br /><br />The children are very good, particularly the oldest boy, Simon.  His growth as a character really made the story.  In fact, I'd say that it is his growth as a character that is the lynch pin of the entire story.  The actor, Thomas Sangster, was superb and one looks forward to seeing him develop in other roles in the future.<br /><br />A lot more fun than I expected it to be.e oldest boy, Simon.

B00004TJKI|5.0|This is a classic 1950s murder and courtroom drama flick of the first order. Jimmie Stewart plays the lead as a laid-back country lawyer as much into fishing as law, who gets handed a red-hot murder defense case. The local prosecutor brings in a big-gun outside Deputy State Attorney General (George C. Scott) to stomp on Stewart, and the fun begins... It is David vs. Goliath time in the courtroom!<br /><br />Lee Remick is really good as the town floozy, whose boyfriend (Ben Gazzara) shot a local man who allegedly molested his girl. I thought that Joseph N. Welch, as Judge Weaver, was particularly good, and in fact he was hilariously authentic. (If only more real judges were like him...)<br /><br />This film manages to be both funny and authentic, and avoids crossing the line into slapstick. The courtroom drama is more or less technically correct, although few lawyers are as skillful as Stewart and Scott are in this film. Although the law on \\"irrestistable impulse\\" has changed since this film, that fact detracts not at all from what is an engaging story and enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />Don't miss this one. The discerning viewer will enjoy this film many times. RJB.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|Kate Beckinsale slinks her way back into the black leather that solidified her as an action star in \\"Underworld:  Evolution.\\"  It's a continuation of the original \\"Underworld,\\" and picks up almost immediately where the original took off.  In it, Selene (Beckinsale) takes on her vampiric ex-allies as she seeks out more of the truth behind her betrayal.  Of course, hybrid beau Scott Speedman tags along on her quest.  This time around, her arch enemy isn't ol' Viktor from the original flick, but Marcus, son of the original necksucker, Alexander Corvinus.  Marcus is on the hunt for his brother, William, who just happens to be the baddest wolfman in the pack.  He's become such a powerful werewolf that he cannot revert to his human form.  He's also completely unable to control his aggression which means that no one's safe when Willy's on the prowl.  In order to protect his vampire family, Viktor locks William away in a seemingly impenetrable prison many centuries before this film takes place.  When Marcus is awakened by Kraven, he immediately begins his hunt to find the key that will open his brother's prison.  This leads him to both Viktor's dead body and Selene.<br /><br />Confusing enough for ya?  It really helps if you've seen the first flick in case you want to follow the plot.  Of course, plot is of little necessity in a film like this.  Action is the driving force that makes this flick watchable.  Fans of the original will recognize Lucian, Kraven, and Amelia from the original flick in brief flashback sequences and Marcus' awakening scene.  Fans of the original will also recall Selene's famous swandive manuever which is done repeatedly in this sequel.<br /><br />I have to admit that I prefer this flick to the original.  It has more action, a swifter pace, and for once, the werewolves and vampires actually use their supernatural strengths to do battle.  Gunplay fans be not afraid, there are just as many bullets flying in \\"Evolution\\" as there were in the original flick.<br /><br />The cast is anchored by the wonderful Derek Jacobi as Alexander Corvinus.  Unfortunately he isn't given much to work with here.  Tony Curran portrays sinister son, Marcus.  Thankfully, he has more than a few words to work with here.  He plays his character to perfection.  The rest of the cast does a fairly solid job.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty good here, though the werewolf transformations get tiring to watch after awhile.  The CGI is very obvious through most of this flick.  Think \\"Van Helsing\\" with a little more blood and a lot more atmosphere.  Marcus' wings, which have been mentioned by other reviewers, are pretty cool to watch in action, but watching people get impaled by a wing can also get old after awhile.<br /><br />If you enjoy action, \\"Evolution\\" is worthy of four stars.  If you're more into plot-driven drama, this film is only deserving of three stars.<br /><br />Enjoy it for what it is, an action-thriller with plenty of explosions and gore, a brief bit of nudity, and whigged-out werewolves and vampires.flick. <br /> <br />The cast is anchored by the wonderful Derek Jacobi as Alexander Corvinus.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is, simply put, a very intelligent show. If you like science fiction that challenges your head, heart, mid, soul while taking you on amazing adventures, try this. Firefly is for you. it appeals to so many people because it causes one to think to get through Firefly. <br /> <br />Even the fans have to agree that the terraforming theory is quite simply old. It first appeared in 1967 and the theory has been touted as utter rubbish by modern science but this is SCIENCE FICTION. If we colonize other worlds it is MAY happen by terraforming, who knows what will happen in 500 years. <br /> <br />The dialogue is far from hollow. There is pathos or ethos for the sympathetic characters. Like Farscape or Mutant X --both highly orinal series -- it is extremely easy to care about the characters. <br /> <br />Suffice to say, Fox showed terrible jusgement in cancelling a show that was cancelled for no good reason. No one saw it the first time because Fox juggled show times, pre-empted episodes and ran shows out of order but now that it's made it to the big screen everybody is suddenly interested because it is finally getting the recognition it deserves.  <br /> <br />Truly an excellent show!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Speaking as a massive Pearl Jam fan, this is the best thing Vedder and Crew have delivered in a long long time, but that's not to dismiss everything leading up to it. After listening to this one, and only previously listening to Ten and maybe Vs., and then going directly to this album, it would give one the impression that Pearl Jam declined in quality after it's debut, and finally are making their massive comeback. One who assumes this could not possibly be more wrong. For me, every release of theirs has held it's own against the original, and I view this album not as a comeback, but as just another step forward for the band. Any massive Pearl Jam fan would agree with this. So don't get the idea that this overshadows the rest of PJ's career, this album is just another phase of Pearl Jam.  <br /> <br />Now that I got that out of the way, now to talk about the cd. This disc rocks like a beast, and it is filled with pure emotion in regards to the world at large, as well as introspective lyricism. Vedder has never been as revealing and honest about himself as he is on the songs \\"Life Wasted\\" and \\"Gone\\". And the band has never made as massive a statement on what's wrong with the world today as they do in \\"World Wide Suicide\\" and \\"Unemployable\\". The songs never repeat themselves and each song stands out. \\"Wasted Reprise\\" is perhaps the strongest, and simplest song here, Vedder quietly stating \\"I've faced it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again\\" over Boom's organ, Vedder is speaking in regards to his own demons that he has revealed to us, as well as the unavoidable ills of society he has protested against in the 9 songs following it. Vedder is looking upon everything wrong in his life and society and is stating under the emotional burden of what he's witnessing, that he won't take it anymore. This idea is expanded on in the previous song \\"Gone\\" where Eddie can't accept what's happening around him anymore, and has to take the car out and drive until he finds a betterlife. Vedder manages to do in 13 songs what took Bob Dylan many albums to do, start out writing protest song and gradually move into more personal territory.  <br /> <br />Musically, the album is the catchiest and loudest Pearl Jam has been in a long time, the subtlety of Riot Act and Binaural could not be used for the themes this album it built on. This disc is built on pure anger towards the world, and so it requires an equally powerful force to drive it. Stone and Mike strum out chords and leads that attack with full force (most notably on \\"Comatose\\" which hits with the force of hurricane). Jeff and Matt produce carpet-bombing rhythms, a force-to-be-reckoned-with. You'll see what I mean when you pop this one in your cd player.  <br /> <br />Some rreviewers for major newspapers have said that Pearl Jam have become irrelevant in today's world, but with this effort, they could not be more wrong. This album is about witnessing tragedy in society and war everyday, and the guilty burden one feels knowing that one is living their routine life while others are praying for their loved ones to come home safe from war, and others are desperate to get by in a corrupt business world. The album is about facing what's happening outside one's zone of comfort, and doing something about it, something the band does through their massive statements on life as we know it. Pearl Jam are one of the few bands out there today who have the guts to use their voice to speak out against the things that others would rather not think about. <br /> <br />These are things the band has been doing all along, and to say that this is a comeback would be terribly wrong, this is just a progression from what's come before.
0553573403|5.0|This review is in two parts. The first is simply a review, the second is a response to some of the bizarre statements written in other reviews.<br /><br />The biggest problem in modern-day fantasy writing is the demographic of its audience. The vast majority of fantasy readers are males who have not finished Jr. High. Hence, the majority of fantasy books {or those that are expected to sell} are written for an audience who evidently need everything spelled out in triplicate.<br /><br />It is thus a refreshing change to read books that are willing to be subtle and vague. There are surprises planted in the first few chapters of this book that have not yet been exposed [This assumes I am right about a particular, very well veiled subject that continues to be alluded to throughout the book]. The characters' emotions are intimated by their actions and words rather than point-blank internal monologue.<br /><br />It appears that the saga is going to be about 6 books long, so it is understandable that the plotting is a bit slow at the beginning. It does take a bit of time to get into the book. Once you are, though, you are hooked. Be warned -- there are many pages in this work, and many pages in the saga, and be prepared for some late nights reading until your eyes go on strike with teary picket signs.<br /><br />Some particular aspects of this work that might be of import:<br /><br />i) There are multiple points of view throughout, and these are from characters with truly different personalities and perceptions. Some of these characters are not obvious \\"good guys\\" either.<br /><br />ii) The characters and the actions are gritty and life-like. This might offend today's overly sensitive readers, but it conveys the timbre of the times.<br /><br />iii) Some main characters die. You have been warned.<br /><br />iv) If you are someone who loves the \\"magic\\" side of fantasy, understand that, like many other things, the magic in the book is subtle and not well codified.<br /><br />v) Many characters have \\"tragic flaws\\" that will cause them to do things that you really wish they didn't. The characters are not \\"round\\" they are \\"Ice Cream Cones:\\" rounded but with a point.<br /><br />Now, to respond to some comments made by other reviewers:<br /><br />One reviewer understimated the originality in the characters. He predicted [saying he could see things coming \\"a mile away\\"] that Catelyn would grow to love her stepson and that Stansa will end up being a tough cookie. He was very wrong on the first count and, so far as can be deduced after 3 books read, the second as well.<br /><br />Another reviewer claimed that the author failed to finish even one storyline. The shows a misunderstanding on two levels. First, some storylines are concluded [c.f. page 727-728]. Also, a major question is answered on the last page of the book!Secondly, it is the nature of good writing for the end of one storyline to feed into another. It is a multi-book saga, you cannot expect closure at the end of book 1.<br /><br />The same reviewer claimed the characters displayed \\"gross idiocy\\" by certain actions. I would direct the reviewer to Shakespeare's plays where the protagonist, guided by his tragic flaw, did the same. It will only come out later [if I am correct] how deeply a given character's principles affected him his entire life. Unfortunately, that cannot be fully appreciated within the first book.<br /><br />The same reviewer appears to believe that magic must somehow play a major part for something to be considered \\"fantasy.\\" The supernatural takes many forms in this book, and it becomes more pronounced later in the saga. The reviewer chastises GRRM for not having an invasion of demons from the north, as though all cards must be put on the table in the first volume.<br /><br />Finally, there has been a repeated chiding that the tale is \\"ripped\\" from the War of the Roses. Isaac Asimov, when explaining how he was inspired to write The Foundation Chronicles [later awarded the Hugo for BEST Fantasy/Sci-fi saga of ALL TIME] explained that he was completely inspired by the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. Anyone care to take off points from him?the Hugo for BEST Fantasy/Sci-fi saga of ALL TIME] explained that he was completely inspired by the rise and fall of the Roman Empire.

B000EMGAGW|2.0|Let me start by saying that the album isn't terrible.  The typical Mobb slang and Dun language is still intact and when backed by that cinematic, dark production that they're known for, that's when they really shine.  Tracks like \\"Put 'Em In Their Place\\" and  \\"The Infamous\\" (gotta love the ALC beat on this one) are easily the standouts for that very reason.  The \\"Capital P Capital H\\" and the \\"Outta Control\\" remix are other standouts.<br /><br />There are several things that bring the album down.  There are a few songs where the production is mediocre.  Then there are some where the lyrics are just plain awful.  \\"Backstage Pass\\", \\"Creep\\", \\"Give It To You Baby\\", and \\"Stole Something\\" would be perfect examples.  It's sad too, because those songs have decent beats to 'em.  In fact, that's where they fall on their face the most -- when they try to make club joints.  Some of the beats are pretty questionable too (Click Click & Pearly Gates).  Also, call me crazy, but I could've sworn I heard Havoc biting 50's flow every now again.  That is simply unacceptable for a rapper with his credentials.  My final gripe is the fact that I'm tired of 50 singing, doing hooks, and being all over every G-Unit release.  I'm fed up with all the Ja Rule biting he does (yes, you read that right).<br /><br />Blood Money isn't necessarily a terrible album, but it's not as great as these bandwagoneers say it is either.  It's decent at best.  If you're expecting something other than the typical G-Unit release, then also expect to be disappointed.  If you're a G-Unit groupie, then this is right up your alley.  I'd recommend that everyone else download this and test it out before actually paying for it or just wait for it to hit the bargain bins and buy it used.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: Put 'Em In Their Place, Outta Control [Remix] feat. 50 Cent (My Favorite), Speakin' So Freely, The Infamous feat. 50 Cent, Capital P Capital H, and It's Alright feat.

B000FFJ85I|5.0|First off let's just say that this is not the album for those who wanted to hear a band simply rehashing their last album, or the one before that, or...ad infinitum.  This is also not an album for anyone who views or uses music as no more than a consumable product, something that comes in a conveniently (and easily) degestible form(ula) that is immediately recognizable, comprehensible, and ultimately, disposable.    Now that we've gotten that out of the way, here's who it IS for:  Anyone who perceives music as actual artistic expression that should not be circumscribed by the preconceived notions of any mind other than that (or those) that created it, will see Decemberunderground for what it really is...something that is not yours or mine or anyone else's who was external to its creation, but rather the masterpiece of four ever-evolving artists.  Such listeners will see it as an astounding mixture of layer upon layer of sound, ethereal storytelling, and raw emotion that is best digested slowly, and is comprehensible only in ecstatic glimmers of insight over long years of listening.     To put it bluntly, this album is ******* beautiful.

B000002LHX|5.0|The breakdown to Batdance, all I have to say is:  FUNKY AS HELL AND A MASTERPIECE!!!!
B0002EXH5E|4.0|<br />Risk was definitely a risk. Way more mainstream than than early Megadeth, yet Dave as usual made it a masterpiece. The guitars have been thickened up, the vocals arent as angry, and some of the spead have been toned down. But despite all this, its still an amazing Megadeth album. While is experienced it did well commercially when it first came out, it also experienceed a backlash from \\"hardcore\\" Megadeth fans. Don't let that deter you though, Risk while not as heavy, is still an amazing album
B00005JOVN|3.0|`Poseidon' is of course the (second) remake of famous disaster movie `Poseidon Adventure' and the 2006 version comes with improved special effects. But what is truly remarkable about this new version is that it is shorter than the original by about 20 minutes. Wolfgang Petersen as director chose the opposite direction of King Kong,' and that is the real problem of this remake. <br /> <br />`Poseidon' is, as you know, about the survival of the passengers in the titular doomed ocean liner. After the extremely dull opening 20 minutes, where we are introduced to the cardboard characters played by Kurt Russell, Josh Lucus, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, Freddy Rodriguez, Kevin Dillon, Stacy Ferguson, and Andre Braugher, the film suddenly gets into gear when a big `rogue wave' hits the ship, and completely overturns it. <br />  <br />Now, WARNING. The sequences showing the disaster may be shocking to the younger kids as Petersen sticks to the `reality' of these scenes with lots of blood and dead bodies. The deaths are not suggested, but blatantly shown, with the state-of-the-art skills of ILM technicians. <br /> <br />[EFFECT-RIDDEN] These effects about the water, fire, even explosions, are the only raison d'etre of this remake, and though you can easily see how and where Warner Bros. and other film companies spent as much as estimated $ 140 million, but you will never understand WHY.  <br /> <br />The 1972 original is sometimes (rightly, I think) accused of its corny dialogues or hammy acting, but the truth is we love the original `Poseidon Adventure' because of these corny and hammy actors. Shelley Winters' role might look ridiculous, yes, sure, but we love her for what she is, and love Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens too. It is still great fun to watch them even if the whole situation is totally unconvincing. <br /> <br />What we get in this unnecessary remake is lots of actions that gradually changes from \\"catastrophic\\" to \\"overblown,\\" and finally \\"very silly.\\" I not only stopped caring who dies or not, but stopped caring what is happening on the big screen. I know I might be a little unfair, but for those who fondly remember the fun of watching the original and the other Irwin Allen productions, this remake is simply pointless except for the big, loud actions.
0066214122|5.0|This story by Michael Crichton was done very well. Like all of his other \\"techno-thriller\\" books, this is certainly a page turner. As a matter of fact I finished it in 4 hours. This is my first Crichton book and it did encourage me to read more of his works. <br /> <br />The plot of this book revolves around the computer programmer Jack Foreman. After Jack is fired from his past job, he takes the responsibilities of a stay at home dad. After being out of work for 6 months, he recieves a call from his former employer asking him to consult the firm again on his program \\"PREDPREY\\". This program programs nanoparticles to use predator instints in order to achieve a goal. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Jack's wife, Julia, has been acting strangly. Her company ends up using Jack's program for its nanoparticles and needs help. Jack looks at this a chance to see what is causing his wife problems. <br /> <br />The problem is that tiny particles have exscaped the building that was storing them and are in the process of taking over the Nevada Desert Ecosystem. Jack must find a way to get these nanoparticles back under his control.

B000F6IOC0|3.0|Some movies are created for special effects carnivals: a subservient storyline serves merely as the glue to hold together 106 minutes of action. Films such as UNDERWORLD - EVOLUTION is one of this genre and if the viewers take it for that they won't be disappointed.  Writer (with Danny McBride) and Director Len Wiseman pulled out all the unused parts of the original UNDERWORLD and have recycled them and magnified them into a sequel starring Wiseman's wife Kate Beckinsale and he knows how to make it work.<br /><br />The script for the film is probably only a few pages long so the bulk of the piece is action. And here the real stars appear: Production Design by Patrick Tatopoulos, Art Direction by Chris August, Set Decoration by Lin MacDonald and Costume Design by<br /><br />Wendy Partridge are only a few of the names that deserve the credit for the success.  Everything is shot in a shade of blue (Simon Duggan is the cinematographer) but of course that is appropriate because it all takes place at night when vampires can function.  The story is rather easy to condense: lycans vs vampires with a cross section of a hybrid to spice things up come into a centuries old conflict struggle for power.  More than that is unnecessary to know.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale is ever beautiful and is such a fine actress that she brings some warmth to this comic book heroine.  But the rest of the cast is paralyzed by silly dialogue and that holds down the likes of Derek Jacobi, Scott Speedman, unintentionally hilarious bad guy Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, etc.  But keep your eyes focused on the locks, the wonderful wings of Viktor  with all that they can do, and the entertainingly gruesome and ultimately tiring 'turning' of men into distortions of werewolves.  As for Beckinsale and Speedman, they make a nice couple, but it is more a 'blood in, blood out' romance.<br /><br />Not for the squeamish or those who look for story, but for what it is UNDERWORLD part II and obviously to be continued is a special effects delight.  Grady Harp, June 06d is a special effects delight.  Grady Harp, June 06
B0001L3MI0|1.0|This film was filled with cliches, macho posturing, glorification of violence, fear of \\"the other,\\" and all sorts of manipulative emotional triggers.  As I watched it, I thought of the book, \\"Operation Hollywood: How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the Movies.\\"  \\"Independence Day\\" served all the interests of our overgrown military establishment - lots of joyful explosions, jingoism and rallying around the warrior president.  There's even a scene of a US suicide bomber, thrusting his jet into the core of the \\"mother ship.\\" <br />There was a review of this film in the satirical paper, \\"The Onion.\\"  They mentioned how the representation of aliens as invaders who are going to destroy us helps to engender a pattern of thinking that frightened US citizens apply to people in other countries, immigrants, socialists or whoever our military state is targeting for oppression. <br />If people are interested in learning more about how some of us are being manipulated by these sorts of films, I'd highly recommmend Eugene Jarecki's documentary \\"Why We Fight.\\"  It's an expose of the military industrial mafia that Eisenhower warned us about, and the culture that helps the Pentagon profiteers get away with their crimes. <br /> <br />This quote from \\"Patriotism\\" by Emma Goldman is dedicated to Will Smith, who in the movie is a pilot who is driving the new jet-fighter, and exclaims, \\"I've got to get me one of these\\" -  <br />\\"The powers that have for centuries been engaged in enslaving the masses have made a thorough study of their psychology.  They know that the people at large are like children whose despair, sorrow, and tears can be turned into joy with a little toy.  And the more gorgeously the toy is dressed, the louder the colors, the more it will appeal to the million-headed child. <br />An army and navy represent the people's toys.  To make them more attractive and acceptable, hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent for the display of these toys.\\"
B000FILW86|4.0|After being so disapointed with \\"Special One\\" (which had too many downtempo tracks and some tuneless techno-ish screwing around) I was surprised at how hard \\"Rockford\\" rocked! The band sounds like they have something to prove again on CD. It's the hardest and most consistantly rocking CT album in a long time. Theres no dull songs that plod on for too long or time wasted on studio experiments: \\"Rockford\\" is all about what CT does best: pure Power Pop, Sweet Ballads and Melodic Hard Rockers.     Musically theres nothing new on \\"Rockford\\" that CT hasnt tackled before, but this time around the conifidence, energy and hooky songwriting that many CT albums after the horrible \\"The Doctor\\" lacked (\\"Cheap Trick (97)\\" - an exception) is back now in full force. The band's re-found energy makes songs that would sound ordinary on thier other albums fun and entertaining listening. Despite using various co-producers, studios, and engineers the album sounds remarkably tight and consistant. Some tracks match the sonic glory of thier classic 70's-80's Epic era.    Cheap Trick has nothing to prove to anyone that they are a great band, but God bless 'em, they keep trying to do so while pulling it off with far more class and style than many other classic rockers still out there recording and touring. I just hope Big 3 Records will try to get this CD played on the radio, something thier earlier independent companies failed to do.
0385720920|2.0|This book stunk.  The author's books have always been populated with blank characters for whom the reader never feels a thing (they exist only to advance his criticism of society), but this one is so empty it's like a black hole.  After reading Diary and Survivor, I realize Palahniuk's books are less novels than they are almanacs, collections of random facts, albeit interesting facts.  It's like he's read every urban legend story in the world and just vomits up tidbits onto blank paper and then connects them with cardboard characters.  I think most people read his books for the reason I've lasted this long: the packaging is awesome.  All of his books have awesome covers, and you'll feel better when you realize that's why you and others are buying them too.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM.  OK, so I can't play all of it around my 5 year old or at work...details.  I heard clips of her previous work and wasn't all that impressed but this one I have to play over and over.  I love \\"Leave me alone I'm lonely\\" (does any married woman not feel that way sometime?), the song with her dad makes me weepy, the attitude on some songs is so fun but mostly the girl can write and she THINKS and there's just something very real about her and she touches something very honest in me.  I bought it for \\"Dear Mr. President\\" and I'm glad I did.  I love this. <br /> <br />I'm old and not really into the pop scene.  I saw P!nk on Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards and didn't really understand the song and just thought \\"oh great, now my 5 year old boy has a song to sing about not wanting to be a stupid girl\\" I put her in my little box where I put the other teeny bopper rockers, you know, the Avril Lavignes and Ashlee Simpsons of the world.   <br /> <br />Then I saw her on Oprah (which I also don't usually watch) and they were discussing the discussion thats been started by the song.  And she impressed me...not typical...smart girl.  And then I heard a clip of Dear Mr. President and thought \\"she's really ok\\" and then I heard she recorded it with the Indigo Girls I took notice. (I'm an Indigo Girls fan).  I'm glad I did.  Its been a long time since I've been excited about an album.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This album never gets old it is one of the best ive run upon from start to finish it is extraordinarily awesome the highlights of the   peice include heart in a cage, electricityscape, vision of devision , and red light. This is a must have work of musical genious
0152023984|5.0|Yes, it's a child's story, and you can finish it in a few hours without any trouble.  Nonetheless the themes are so sad and honest, the magic of the world painted so invitingly (though juvenile), the meaning so dripping and lovely, it's a work for any adult as well.      It demands another reading--I feel I've only begun to grasp the significance and symbolism, the lessons of love and meaning, of childhood and adulthood, of life and death.      One of the highlights of dating a cute French girl has been this book.
B0001AP12G|1.0|umm how can a so called child of god put out a explict album and play it off as if hes some big christian with that song jesus walks  im sure if jesus was here to see this he would be dissapointed because it seems all that mr west is trin to do is use jesus as a marketing tool <br />to the music its not good at all id advise you to listen to something else anything id rather listen to apples in sterio
B000C65Z1G|5.0|The Constant Gardener is an amazing film.  I've not read the novel upon which it was based.  This film falls into that category of film that haunts you during and after.  You never really know where the story is headed, and the screenplay manipulates the viewer into changing your mind about key characters, their fidelity, and their motivations.  The locations in Africa, with the shantytowns, the open sewers, the long lines, the privilege station of (some) aid workers is so realistic.<br /><br />This is a great film.  Don't plan on going dancing right afterward... your mind, and your muscles, will not feel joyous.
B000065KFV|5.0|\\"How can these heavenly creatures be real?\\" asks one of the characters in of \\"Heavenly Creatures,\\" the exquisite and horrifying docudrama of a shocking, real-life murder. Famed director Peter Jackson uses spectacular special effects and great actors to show us how these heavenly creatures became monsters.<br /><br />In 1952, Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) is a loner at her proper New Zealand school, until the day Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) arrives -- an intelligent, witty, daring girl who appeals to Pauline. Soon the two of them are nearly inseparable; even Juliet's four month stint in the hospital doesn't separate the girls through their letters and shared fantasies.<br /><br />But soon their parents becomes concerned that their close friendship is \\"unhealthy.\\" It is, just not in the way he thinks. The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense: they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality. Now Juliet is being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together... such as murder.<br /><br />Peter Jackson starts the movie by emphasizing what a beautiful, peaceful country (via a cheesy 1950s documentary) New Zealand is. But beauty is not everything -- fairy tales can become nightmares. Jackson doesn't just show the audience what the two girls did, but showed why they did it. Even then, he doesn't make excuses.<br /><br />At first the movie seems almost whimsical, with fairy tale figures coming to life, beautiful woodlands, and hillsides transforming into blooming gardens. Nobody except Peter Jackson could have pulled off the idea of including living clay figurines or four-foot-wide butterflies. Somehow it not only works, but adds to the surreality of the story.<br /><br />But as the girls go deeper into infatuated madness, Jackson warps the whimsical world around them. Settings get darker and more distorted, and the line between fantasy and reality is completely wiped out. The scripting keeps that creepiness going (\\"Our main idea for the day was to murder Mother\\"), as do Richard Taylor's handling of CGI and prosthetics. (How DID they do the zoom through a sand castle?)<br /><br />But the movie really centers around Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, and these two carry the movie beautifully. Lynskey can switch in an instant from sullenness to smiles, naive girl to murderous woman. And the luminous Kate Winslet plays the somewhat devil-may-care Juliet, whose vivacity and charm overrule any of Pauline's reservations.  \\"It's everyone else who's bonkers!\\" she says gleefully when Pauline casts doubt on her own sanity.<br /><br />The most terrifying horror is the real kind -- the kind that is in the human heart. With its brilliant direction and equally good acting, \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is destined to be a modern classic.darker and more distorted, and the line between fantasy and reality is completely wiped out.

0060736267|5.0|I don't know how many times I've read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. My parents had a copy in the house where I grew up in Queens, and it was among the books I read again and again as a young teen. Perhaps that was because it was about a young girl growing up in New York, perhaps it was because it was among the few books (in the ramshackle, eclectic collection of my parents' house, which a friend once described as \\"decorated in Late Brooklyn Depression\\") that was clearly about the joys of being a kid. But I think it was really a lot more than that.<br /><br />The movies they made from this book are TERRIBLE, or at least they don't reflect any of the magic I found here, so please don't let them set your expectations.<br /><br />What Smith did so well -- and why this book has remained a classic -- is show the shabbiness and the innocence, simultaneously. The story, which you probably know is about Francie Nolan and her family in Brooklyn's tenement neighborhoods from the early 1900s, treats the poor with respect but without romanticism. It's nostalgic for the joys that children find -- in the flowers at a library checkout counter, in the opportunity to choose the best candy from the penny store -- without painting such a rosy glow that you ever want to go back there.<br /><br />Another reason that this book works so incredibly well is the author's marvelous ability to show each main character's viewpoint. Francie and her mother argue; instead of showing just Francie's side, you also know exactly what is going through Katie's mother's mind, and you know that BOTH of them are right. That's an important message, especially for teenagers, and I distinctly remember deciding to adopt some of the attitudes I saw in this book. How many books did you read as a child that had that kind of influence on you?<br /><br />Smith never shied away from issues of sex and drink, either, so if you're considering this book as a present for a child of, say, under ten, you might want to read through it first yourself. (Not that this will be a hardship; I just re-read it last night, at the grand old age of 48, and I obviously still love this book.)<br /><br />On the other hand, this might be a good book for a pre-teen, as the sex and substance abuse are treated with clear eyes and a kind heart. If you want to talk to kids about the choices that people make (\\"Could Francie's father have stopped drinking?\\" you might ask the kid), this would be a great vehicle for doing so.<br /><br />But heck -- you don't have to get that serious about it. This is a great story, wonderfully written, and the time-and-place comes alive.ead through it first yourself.

B00005YU1O|1.0|\\"Waking Life\\" is absolutely gorgeous. I loved the animation dripping and flowing as a dreamlike constant. The movie, on the other hand, lacked direction. I found that the connections the dialogues made, while staying on topic, seemed to just dump information and not guide the story in any direction. The dialogues made me think, which other reviewers have claimed is the best part of the movie, but the film didn't allow any time for the ideas to come to life. Instead, I was left frustrated by a lack of flow. There was no resolution or rising or falling action in \\"Waking Life\\": just content. I did not like that.
B00000JGHM|5.0|you will hear a couple of gunshots in this movie.  I remember that this is the first greast movie I ever saw.  It plays out like a tv show but manages to cut out all the excess fat perfectly.  Suer, you would like to know a bit more about the charaxcters, but even the people from the casting department admit tehy were still hiring actors up to the last day of shooting.  I have not seen such a star studded cast in a GREAT movei like thsi since True Romance\\".  The feeling you have for the characters is so strong, you will never see another movie like this. They spend pretty much the whole movie planning out the heist and when it happens, you are glad they waited.  Cops and robbers going at it just like a movie should be:)<br /><br />The special featrues are a bit short and has like a 100 minute running time.  It gives you a lot of good insight on the real story behind the movie.  And also michael mann and the rest of cast give good info.  And good stuff on how it was written to ne a tv show.  Teh commentary was pretty boring, but I like excitng commentaries, I guess I expect them all to be like Anchorman:)
B000EULJLU|5.0|Like many people who have reviewed this album, I was anticipating its release and felt initial disappointment because it seemed bland and uninspired.  After listening to 10,000 Days almost constantly for the past few weeks however, it has revealed itself as a beautiful and complex work that has an almost intoxicating effect. It does not have the driving passion of Aenemia (which is arguably the best album of the last decade) but everyone gets older and 10,000 days reflects a more mature and introspective sensibility.  If you want an excellent Chardonney which is accessible the first time you try it, listen to A Perfect Circle.  If you want a rich and subtle Cabernet Sauvignon, listen to 10,000 days.  But try listening to it repeatedly and see if you dont have the same experience that I had, that it takes time for all the layers to unfold and bloom.
0812550706|5.0|Today, I noticed that there were 2298 reviews for this book posted on Amazon, with an average rating of 4 and a half stars.<br /><br />In contrast, the King James Version of the Bible had 224 reviews, averaging 3 and a half stars.<br /><br />That says something.<br /><br />Ender's Game really is a unique and innovative \\"soft\\" sci fi story.  In a genre where half the men are named \\"Rip\\" and the women fight, kick, and spit like the best man, having a story that focuses on a kid at age 6 is... different.  The ending is a real surprise, and a treat.<br /><br />I don't like Orson Scott Card's politics or philosophy.  But I do like this book.  And legions of fans obviously agree with me.
078401213X|5.0|Pi is a film that will most likely stay with you long after you watch it. Darren Aronofsky (Requium For A Dream) created an entertaining experimental film with Pi. A very dark movie (aside from being black and white) with a great techno score, and extremley bizzare scenes and images. Pi is a great movie, but I dont think it's so deep and powerful as some reviews stated. There was a few things that went wrong with Pi that I wont go into, but as with most filmmakers making no budget films all their mistakes suddenly become artistic expression. Anyway if you enjoyed Eraserhead or similar films like it then you cant go wrong with Pi.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|The publicity machine behind the launch of this album became somewhat tiresome and annoying. I mean really, between the TRL requests and MySpace, it was getting a little out of control. But let's talk about the music, which is still quite solid. Not as tight as Sing The Sorrow (which worked better as a whole and concept) and of course NOTHING like their pre-2003 material, but it still rocks. It's also nice to hear Davey sing in a different octave (most notably on Miss Murder). For those \\"purists\\" who are looking for the sound of Black Sails, Answer That, or All Hallows, here's a newsflash: bands grow up, they mature, and perhaps you should follow their lead. To you, it may be called selling out. To the rest, it's called moving forward and not being monotonous. Best tracks are Affliction, Missing Flame, Endlessly She Said (classic Davey screaming), and Rabbits Are Roadkill (bonus track on the import). The rest are also very good, but the album as a whole doesn't work as a \\"concept\\" (if that's what they were going for again). I still recommend it, and feel their live shows make everything come full circle, as they're one of the best live bands out there.
B000000H4V|4.0|Yeah, lets face it, everything after Roots was [junk] and Roots wasn't that good either. This is their last great album, but this is really damn good. It's perhaps their 2nd best, Arise is a bit ahead of this. This is the most mature release from the band despite being the slowest and maybe the lightest of the first 5 albums. But that's said, brutality doesn't necessarily make an album better. Although this is wayyy faster than 'Roots' (listen to 'Refuse/Resist', it's as fast as their old stuff) Max Cavalera's vocals are at their best here. Andreas Kisser has done better stuff in the previous albums, but he has also done here well. He's better than I first thought although I still wouldn't rank him up there with Adrian Smith, Chuck Schuldiner (RIP) or even Kirk Hammett but he's still decent. Igor is one of the best metal drummers and the drums and their sound sound excellent on the album. In general the production here kicks @ss. The bass here is also very heavy due to it, but it doesn't kill the music. There is no really a bad song although not all are excellent and some sound similar to the other, hence I rate it 4.25 stars (to hell with the rating system) and not 5. Standout tracks include Kaiowas which has the most Brazillian sound, 'Refuse/Resist' is an excellent opener and 'Territory' which is and instant Sep Classic and is also the best song on the album, just listen to the drums and you'll instantly fall in love with it.    Make sure you have all the Sep albums from '87 to '96 since Derek Green sucked big time. But like I said, this is a thrash classic, not to be missed in a metal collection.
B00003CWN3|5.0|boys dont cry tells the story of brandon teena, who is actually teena brandon, a gril suffering identity crises as she tries so hard to become a man, along the way she falls in love with a girl name lana, make friends, and all the while try to hide her identity from them. hilary swank potrays teena with a force not seen before, she looks so much like a man and even walks like  man its almost as if she is a man. swank also brings raw force during some of the films most powerful scenes, this was truley swanks oscar winning role (then she would win a second in million dollar baby). the other oustanding proformence was chloe sevigny, she gives the doe-eyed lana a vunurable and sincere attitude that demands your attention. i really felt sevigny should have gotten the oscar but then again, she was up against angeline jolie who gave an equally powerful role. during the last forty or so minutes of the movie, my heart pounded as everything came unraveling for teena. if you loved brokeback, then you will love this film too about love that is doomed from the start, a cant miss.
B00005JOHC|5.0|Why wouldn't you release the best and highest rated sitcom currently on tv to dvd. It's in its prime. That makes no sense to me <br /> <br />Anyway, this is the best sitcom on tv right now. Charlie Sheen is funnier than I thought he could be. He was good on Spin City, but not this good. What I like about this show is that the kid isn't annoying. They don't write jokes for him that are cute. They give him stuff that is funny. And Berta maybe be the funniest character on tv right now. Evelyn comes in a close two

B000FDFVZ6|5.0|This book was incredible. Its emotional impact is astounding and I would recommend it for anytone mature enough to handle the adult material. Its characters were beautifully portrayed and developed and the plot, although simple, was never boring. The book is extremely powerful and very easy to connect with. I definitely suggest reading it!
B000031EGV|5.0|Robin Williams stars in this delightful movie about a game called \\"Jumanji\\", a game that must be finished.  If the game is not finished, then the game will wait however long you stop playing the game--even for 26 years.<br /><br />  The special effects are execellent, even by today's standards.  This is a much better movie than Zathura
B00003CWTI|5.0|magnolia is a mosaic of human life that tells of several diffrent stories in l.a. that all seem to center around a talk show called \\"what do kids know?\\". the sotrys consist of a dying cancer patient, his male nurse, and his trophy wife. a sex guru with a hidden past. a talk show host, a child protegie an dhis selfish dad. a former game show winner suffering from unreqainted love. and the last, a coked out girl playing hot and cold with a cop. all these stories, under anderson's control, are carefully woven together that leads to a shocking end were it promises to rain something other then rain. everyone gives a great performence even tom cruise, who lately has fallen on hard times due to his antics but this film made me forget all that and it proved to me that cruise, despite his antics, is a good actor. so, if you loved anderon's other film boogie nights, then you'll love this film.

B000002UB6|3.0|In May 1970, NME's reviewer, Alan Smith, called Let it Be, \\"a cheapskate epitaph, a cardboard tombstone, a tatty end to a musical fusion which wiped clean and drew again the face of pop music.\\"  Mr. Smith was only partially right.  The real end to the Beatles' glorious recording career together was Abbey Road, one of the best albums ever made, a work made with the kind of care, creativity and attention to detail that made Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, Rubber Soul, the White Album, etc., classics.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Let it Be was made at a time when John was on heroin and wanted little to do with anyone other than Yoko, George would have rather been in India or playing with Bob Dylan, and Ringo would have preferred to be making movies with Peter Sellers.  Only McCartney cared about the band and the level of interest of the others shows in this album.<br /><br />What might have been a good idea for the band, to get back to their rock roots and play \\"live\\" in the studio, never quite worked out the way they (Paul, actually) planned.  The songs -- well half of them anyway -- are uninspired and sloppily played.  Spector overproduced them (though he should be given some credit for tackling the project at all.)  Overall, the album has a sad, break-up feel to it.  It's too bad that Let it Be was the last studio album to make it into the hands of the fans.<br /><br />Let it Be...Naked fixes some of the song selection and production problems.  But the whole project stands as a reminder of the sickness and death of the greatest rock band that ever has or ever will walk this earth.<br /><br />Nontheless, this is a Beatles album are there is some fantastic work on it.  A bad Beatles record is still better than a great record by most other bands.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|It's amazing how much better the second disk is than the first.. How often does that happen?   I'll probably pick my favorite songs off the two and make one cd.  :D

6305313687|5.0|if crash wanted to be a great film about racism (and earn that so called oscar) they should have done it like american history x did. unlike crash, history dosent force racism on the screen but instead fires it when necesary. norton truley gives an outstanding performance, looking buff and mean with a swastika on his chest, norton should have gotten that oscar and furlong really redeems himself in this film and everyone else in the film gave great performences. the film tells of a brutal skinhead who is sent to jail after he murders two black men, while in jail, he learns the error of his ways as he be-friends a black man and uncovers the truth about his racist ways. when he gets out, he tries to make ammends with the people he's hurt and convince his brother to not go down the same path he went. switching back from black and white flash backs to present day, the film really flips you view on racism and when norton starts shouting actual racist truth, its scary. great film and if i were haggis, he should of modeled after this film.
B00005Q66T|5.0|GHV2 is great. It's missing 'This Used To Be My Playground' and 'American Pie', and possibly 'Rain'. It would be better if they weren't some edited form. But other than that, this is another must'have from the queen of pop!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead doing what they do best. Hail to the Thief is like a mix between OK Computer(Go to Sleep) and Amnesiac(Backdrifts) and even a hint of the Bends(There,There).

1591396190|2.0|I find this strategy model to be a far too simplistic of the real business world and, thus, vastly over-rated in terms of its value. It deals with the \\"old\\" analog business world and pays little regard to the major changes sweeping corporations with the digital revolution. <br />. <br />In my opinion, of far greater value is a book called \\"BIZNETS: The Webopoly Future of Business\\" by Frank Feather, and I suggest you check that out and compare before buying this one. It covers 6 case studies to find the common threads of successful strategy in the \\"new\\" and future digital business world. <br />. <br />By contrast, Blue Ocean is somewhat tired. Sure, I highly regard the successes of some of the chosen companies. But the way they are presented is so 1980s. I rate it 2 stars. <br />.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This album started a revolution in extreme music.This is a thrash, speed ,death,and black metal album all thrown into one.Although I like the two follow up albums much better because they showcase more sides of Slayer.The impact this had cannot be underestimated.The down side of this is that its a very one dimensional view of Slayer.Speed and more speed.Its hard to imagine the death metal movement happening without this album.It has aged pretty well as well as it still sounds as vicious as ever.Reccommended for any extreme music fan.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|This album is by no means good. But since the first album didn't do very well. I think Rihanna and her label should have gotten more producers. The Carter Admin. did a good job. But maybe if they would have gotten new ones she might have had more success. But all in all, a good album. Stand out tracks are if radio hasn't already killed it, 'SOS', 'Unfaithful', 'We Ride', 'Break It Off', and 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love'.
6301966562|5.0|This was a fun movie and since VHS is almost extinct DVD would be great.  The movie was fun and I would love for my family who has never seen it to be able to enjoy it as well.
0440236738|5.0|A truly excellent book. I just finished re-reading this book. This is a book which shows the deficiencies of a 5 star rating system. The rating system should be 100 points and this would be one of the rare/few books I'd give the maximum 100 points to. Many books that I give 5 stars to would actually only get 95, 96, etc, but this would get the full 100. <br /> <br />Without giving away any spoilers, why would I give this book the max 100 points? <br />1) Coben is a good writer, his books are easy to read and easy to follow. <br />2) This book is truly suspenseful, as you read on, there are parts which you just can't explain until the book reveals it to you, and there are twists until the very end. And it takes an intelligent author to plot these twists. <br />3) The ending is satisfying.  <br /> <br />The cons: <br />1) Too often, Coben's protagonists have a omnipotent friend which drags them out of tight situations. Its too easy my friend, try to think of some other way for them to escape. <br />2) Corny titles for these books. <br />3) No reason to think that Ken was actually dead in the first place.  <br />4) A few logical lapses, but none that detract from the enjoyment of the book. <br /> <br />Why most books don't get my 100 points: <br />1) Characters are boring, undeveloped. Some writers just don't have the knack for creating characters that you care for. They are just 2 dimensional figures that you don't care if they live or die. <br />2) Most writers are bad writers. Their books are hard to read and follow. They get published because publishers need authors to sell.  <br />3) Plots are uninteresting. <br /> <br />There you have it, a truly suspensful book which kept me flipping pages til I came right to the end, and it was an easy book to read and satisfying at the end.
B000AARKOO|4.0|I liked this movie a good bit.poor Orlando bloom has totally made a hobby out of sword-fighting.this is the story liam neeson(star wars episode one the phantom menace/batman begins)tells orlando bloom(pirates of the carribean/the lord of the rings trilogy) to go to Jeruesalem and save it from the arab army.It could have been <br />better though.  <br /> <br />pros:lot of action, some really familier actors,and a good storyline. <br /> <br />cons:the movie is too long ,it can get confusing, <br /> <br />i think that is actually not bad you should check itm out
B00005Y228|4.0|This is a great album full of club tracks. Som are just better than the other. The three stand-out tracks are 'Love At First Sight', 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head', and 'Come Into My World'. A very fell-good have-fun album! Worth the price!
B000ETRCMQ|3.0|Transamerica was a well intentioned movie that attempts to portray some of the family dynamics of a person who is making this radical change in their life.<br /><br />I liked the part of the story line where the main character, Bree, learns about herself as a parent.  This was interesting and touching. The acting performance by Felicity Huffman was not what I expected after hearing about the Oscar nomination.  In my opinion she relied too much on attempting to make her voice deeper.  This made her delivery flat and lacking in emotion which is not the case with real transgendered people.  Some aspects of the plot seemed contrived and, at times, unlikely.  For example it would be more interesting if Bree's family were normal instead of troubled--maybe a little stereotypical?<br /><br />Overall, worth a glance if you have not seen other fine films about the transgender experience.
B00006FM77|4.0|I truly enjoyed dropping this CD in and listening to it - I am listening to \\"Listen\\" even now!  I give it four stars, because I save 5 stars for only the very best CDs, and Chicago's studio versions are consistently better than the live stuff.<br /><br />I will admit that, when I first bought the album some 30 years ago, I struggled to get through it.  I thought the sound quality was bad, didn't like all the extended guitar solos, thought their extra vocal maneuverings violated the near perfection of the studio versions, etc.  I used to enjoy playing through my Chicago albums from CTA thru to the latest album, but tended to skip this one.<br /><br />I always thought Peter Cetera and Danny Seraphine sounded tired on this album.<br /><br />But Rhino has done a great job cleaning it up, the extra tracks are great (the duplicates, in my view - are better than those on the original Carnegie album).  And, 30 years on, it is a real joy now to play it.  I find that I am listening close for little details I have missed in prior listenings.  This offering, with all the original liner notes and artwork reproduced, takes me back to a time when a 12-year old kid didn't really understand what he was listening to.  And, in a small sense, you can catch the live magic of the Original Seven of this legendary group.<br /><br />Rhino's reissues are outstanding.  I am seeing Chicago this summer for only about the fifth time in my life (taking my kids with me).  They remain one of the head-and-shoulders above all others greatest American acts during the course of my lifetime (I'm 45).  The original members are pushing 60 - and I hope that the inevitable revival of mass interest in Chicago happens soon enough, so that a large segment of modern music lovers can enjoy it while most of the band are still original members.  I urge anybody reading this - whatever your age - to go out and buy these outstanding Rhino reissues!!
B000E1ZK50|5.0|As a movie, VAN HELSING just didn't come together.  Something was missing.  Or it had too much.  Either way, most people agree.  I'm not going to go into the plot or the end result here.  That's been done plenty of times.  I just want to discuss the HD DVD qualities.<br /><br />However, the movie presents a mixture of feelings for the horror/action film fan.  Most WANT to love it, but they can't.  And the ones who bought copies maybe feel a little guilty.<br /><br />Now the HD DVD is out there.  For those who want to indulge in a guilty pleasure, feel free to pick up the HD DVD.  The audio totally rocks the house and will blow the walls down.  And the 1080p HD video presentation is crystal clear and intense.  The colors are vibrant and real.  The landscapes are works of art.  And the dungeons and castles are deep, dark and atmospheric.<br /><br />For the moment, at least until Blu-Ray delivers, this is the best a videophile is going to get.  VAN HELSING HD DVD truly brings home the big-screen experience.
B00007JGHM|4.0|This is a really good movie. It's quite funny and very entertaining . I highly recommend it to anyone who is into romantic comedies and the like. Hugh Jackman is fantastic and Meg Ryan is wonderful, as usual. Liev Schreiber is hilarious as Stuart (it's a fitting role for him,...) All in all it was a fun movie to watch, so, you should see it.
B00005JOVH|2.0|This latest installment of the X-men saga made me feel like I was getting in after the movie had already started.  A vital ingredient was missing--a central character whose development was key to the plot.  There were a lot of characters but we really didn't spend much time with any one of them.<br /><br />The result was a somewhat flat action film.  Yes, there was a struggle that needed to be resolved but it really was not amplified enough.  The ongoing metaphor of mutants as the marginalized citizens of our society still worked.  The action scenes were fine, we just were not made to care a lot about how things resolved.  Too bad--many talented actors put time into this movie.  With a little script tweaking it could have suceeded!
B00005JNRY|4.0|CARS is going to be another feather in Pixar's feather-studded hat.  Insightful and delightful, the film offers up the coming-of-age of Lightning McQueen, the rookie racecar that's tearing up the tracks and hot on the trail of the magnificent Piston Cup.  However, Lightning manages to derail himself by alienating his pit crew and talking his truck transport into driving all night and getting him lost in the middle of the desert somewhere along Route 66, the highway that used to be the byway to the western United States.  But that's where the story begins.  Lightning has to make restitution for tearing up the town, and along the way he ends up making friends that enrich and give meaning to his life.<br /><br />Pixar Studios is absolutely the crown jewel of the animated studios.  A lot of new faces are showing up in that market, but no one else even comes close to what Pixar can serve up.  Beginning with TOY STORY and moving through MONSTERS, INC., A BUG'S LIFE (which are lampooned in the end credits of CARS) and including the INCREDIBLES, Pixar has held unchallenged sway over animated movies.<br /><br />CARS has one of the oldest plots in storytelling.  Young upstart with the world by the tail gets taught a new lesson about the real meaning of life.  Scores of movies have used that as their baseline to tell a tale.  Yet, somehow -- probably because Pixar is just filled with magic, CARS pulls off an exciting feel-good reindition of what is probably the most hackneyed of plots.  Owen Wilson stars as the voice of Lightning, Paul Newman as Doc, Bonnie Hunt as Sally, Larry the Cable Guy as Mater, Cheech Marin as Ramon, Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks and Richard Petty as the King.  All of the characters were great.  The world invented in this movie, where cars with personalities exist but people don't, comes across realistically portrayed (given the circumstances -- and viewers have to wonder where little cars come from and how they got invented).  The tractor tipping sequence Mater takes Lightning on is a hoot.<br /><br />This movie is a must out there in the theaters.  Children and adults will have a great time.  The only thing that's going to be better will be the DVD with all the special features showing how Pixar wove their latest magic spell.equence Mater takes Lightning on is a hoot. <br /> <br />This movie is a must out there in the theaters.

0671449028|5.0|Sandra Boynton is one of my favorite children's book authors.  She makes even the mundane bedtime rituals fun, and has cute characters as well as fun reading.  I have all of her books and have read them to all 3 of my children.  My children love pointing to the characters and reading along with me (I have read them so many times, they have the books memorized!).  Easy reading for young children, and short enough for the wee little ones. I highly recommend this book, as well as Sandra Boynton's other books!
0765315246|5.0|Scalzi's novel is set in a future where individuals can enlist in the army when they become old--in exchange for their 70 years of experience and wisdom, they get a new body.  But not just a new body, one that is physically enhanced.<br /><br />These new superstrong and savvy troops are trained to fight all over the galaxy where aliens and human colonists vie for prime real estate. Life expectancy is short and violent, even for the supertroops.<br /><br />I loved the fantasy of trading in a worn out body for a young strong body while maintaining the years of wisdom and experience.  It probably appeals to anyone who has started to feel the ravages of age--just when you are figuring things out.<br /><br />\\"Old Man's War\\" grabbed me from page one to the end.  Scalzi has a talent for narrative that brings you right into the future.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Ever since the first batman the movies have steadly declined. Batman and robin was the definition of Horrible. This is a fresh start for batman and the BEST comic book hero movie currently made. Every thing is realistic and well thought out and explained. Its dark and gritty almost perferct. The only thing that bugged me was Kzatie holmes's Rachel character I dont see why she was there playing Character that should have been Harvey Dent. other than katie holmes the movie is perfect.
B0001AP12G|5.0|yea well hes not the best, but I think the college dropout displays some clever lyrics that make some serious topics a little more light hearted. The lyrics on Late Registration are way worse cause they lost the lighthearted metephors that were simple enough to make you wonder why you didnt think of it. Plus the beats on this cd are great, and you can attack him all you want for using samples, but if you do it to him then do it to all the other hip hop producers who sample. Its an art in itself
1577312082|1.0|Bought it on basis of recommendation by a friend of the book, spend a lot of time commuting so thought the CD would be ideal, read some of the glowing reviews and decided to try it.  Maybe I'm just a redneck with prejudices, but I had a terrible time understanding the Teutonic accent, and his microphone-voice combo results in rather smeared sound which is quite impossible to understand. Turned out to be a waste of my money.
B000BO0QHW|2.0|Let me be the first to admit that Norman Brown is a very talented guitarist, often drawing comparisons to George Benson. He's actually one of the few listenable artists in the genre, and that's being as about as nice as I can on speaking about his chosen field of music. This collection of \\"greatest hits\\" probably are some of the most requested, often played songs on Smooth Jazz radio. I guess that's a good thing, as I find a majority of this album, mostly covers, to be a waste of air, and as sleep inducing as a Nyquil daquiri. Most Smooth jazz artists, Brown included play these familiar, popular classic songs about as close to the vest as possible, never deviating, and only prompting me to want to grab the original song. I have no problem with covers, but as a jazz artist if you are going to cover something, then do your own thing with it and take a few liberties. IT\\"S OKAY!! NOTE FOR NOTE PLAYING ISN'T NECESSARY!!! WE DON\\"T NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT YOU ARE PLAYING LUTHER\\"S \\"ANY LOVE\\" WE KNOW THE SONG, OKAY??!! I know that smooth jazz has been successful following a formula, and I wouldn't expect them to change any time soon. It's just a shame that the whole spirit of real jazz is lost on a few talented musicians in the game. Brown's version of \\"That's The Way Love Goes\\" is very nice, but the rest of this collection does nothing for me at all. I got this cd for free, but since I don't need any drink coasters, I'll pass it on to my wife who'll enjoy it and probably ask me to take her to his next concert. So if any of you Norman Brown fans see a man with a beautiful woman on his arm, yet he's wearing a pained expression, come on over and strike up a convo. It beats falling asleep in my chair.
B000F1IQN2|1.0|there are so many things to say about the movie but l hardly put my thought into the correct order.Just as an ordinary movie it is exciting but politically it is not honest.l watched several movies of the director,steven spielberg,like shindlers list,saving private ryan,and munich.l noticed that at those three movies the theme was turning around the sufferings of jewish and their honorable struggle with their enemies.it is quite disturbing.why should it be so?they killed children and innocent people of course the opposite side did the same but that doesnt make jewish right.in short the movie is just a show and it has no humanistic character except for the Juden lives itself
B000ETQRCM|3.0|Pearl Jam is a band that just simply likes to tour and make music and they don't have any pressure. <br />We have previously heard 7 albums off of them, with rock, variating from The Who, Neil Young, CCR- influenced soft but aggressive stuff to more heavy sounding grungy stuff, well, there's been plenty. <br />So, in a way you don't expect another \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs.\\" from these people who have integrity and ambition still left in them. Obviously, Pearl Jam have not \\"refreshed\\" all that much, but these are just some new songs by them, nothing revolutionary, but something new to say again. The overall sound of the ablum is mainly, the slightly \\"powerless\\" and simple but epic chords as a base for the aggressive voice of Eddie Vedder, and of course a few nice solos by McCready, but I would've liked a few more. <br />\\"Worldwide Suicide\\" is simply a nice song, but perhaps a bit too close to \\"Do The Evolution\\", but maybe the lyrics are the most important thing on this album. <br />\\"Life Wasted\\" is truly a brilliant track and so are \\"Unemployable\\", \\"Parachutes\\" & \\"Gone\\", the rest is alright aswell. <br />This simply a nice rock n' roll records, that's all!
B000FFJ85I|4.0|This is a 3.5, but since i have not fully taken time to listen to this whole cd without distractions i can't come to judge so quick.  I really liked what i heard for the first 3 tracks, Kill Caustic could have had some work done on it but otherwise it was ok.  And to set it straight, no I did not buy this album because of MTV, i've seen the video once (Launch.com) for MissMurder, and i thought it was pretty good.  So i saw the price and said why not.  I had liked some songs off of the old AFI cd (not there 1st, im not a die hard fan so i cant compare it to that) so it pushed me to buying this cd.  This seemed kind of like 30 Seconds to Mars 2nd album, it starts off strong but it just loses it after awhile, but thats just me.  I like my music to have full force all the way through (minus some songs here and there, its ok).  A lot of reviews compared this to Depeche Mode, so im guessing its right, i cant think of there sound at the moment. <br /> <br /> <br />Besides that, i think most people will enjoy this album, especially the Teen Scene crowd, it just seems more modern compared to some of there old stuff.
B000002NHN|5.0|Music is a mater of taste.   <br />LM is a very talented master of this style of music/her style of music.  If you like this style of music and/or you like LM, you will like this CD.   <br />For me, she is truly a masterful artist.  For me, she is one of the geat contemporary artists, and one of the great artists of all times.   <br />The technical quality of this CD is \\"to die for.\\"   <br />Not all of the tracts were equally good to my taste.   <br />Overall however, another LM masterpiece.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Are Allman Brothers fans so insecure about the status of their band that they desperately need to hype them by jumping headings to trash a Skynyrd album?  Judging from the review by Kevin C. Boyd, apparently so.  Comparing Skynyrd with the Allman Brothers is like comparing the Beatles with the Stones: they are two uniquely different groups. That does not mean that one is any better or worse than the other. To look at either group in such a simplistic way totally misses the point and demeans both bands.  Skynyrd would be the first to admit that their fore-Brothers and \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\" were one of their main inspirations. That hardly relegates Skynyrd and \\"One More From The Road\\" to the automatic third-rate status Mr. Boyd dogmatically condemns them to.  Where the Brothers were a great ensemble who used a song as a jumping off point for inspired open-ended jams that pushed the boundaries of the music, Skynyrd were great autobiographical songwriters in the mold of the Beatles, who focused their musical energy into precise, incendiary live performances that showcased their brilliant anthems of the common man.  In his diatribe, Mr. Boyd totally misunderstands Skynyrd, while blindly deifying the Brothers.  Skynyrd's powerful performance on \\"One More From The Road\\" no more invalidates the Allman's classic \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\" than does the Allman's landmark recording negate Skynyrd's legendary live album.  To dismiss Skynyrd's performance on \\"One More From The Road,\\" simply because of your own personal bias for the Allman Brothers, Mr. Boyd, is preposterous
0140390693|5.0|Little Women has been an endearing classic since its publication, and it has touched the hearts of many people. However, many reviews already comment on the story, and I only wish to comment on a particular edition, particularly the Penguin classics one. Not only does it have a beautiful cover illustration of the four sisters, it has plenty of end notes printed in the back for a better understanding of the text. Although Alcott's language is not convoluted in any way, the culture the four sisters lived in is very different from ours, and thus there are some idioms or expressions that are now archaic. The notes help explain such terms very well. There was some confusion about one of the editions not having both parts, but rest assured, Penguins includes both parts of the story. Furthermore, the introduction states that this particular edition contains no altercations or editing that some later texts contain, and is presented as Alcott originally intended. Sadly, this edition has no illustrations besides the one on the front cover, and thus may not be the most ideal edition for children. However, Penguins is the perfect edition for those seeking a lovely copy and a fantastic read. Enjoy!
B000F48CD8|4.0|'Broken Boy Soldiers' has one of the best 1-2-3-4-5 punches song for song with \\"Steady As She Goes\\",\\"Hands\\",\\"Broken Boy Soldier\\",\\"Intimate Secretary\\" and \\"Together\\". All are awesome,stellar tracks..  <br />    Then the vibe gets a bit slower and- at times- almost somnambulic with the remaining five tracks... I don't wish to be harsh and call these tracks \\"filler\\" by any means,but perhaps they are more \\"growers\\" than the much-more immediate first five tracks... Even so,after such a rush with the first 15 or so minutes with the first five tracks and then be zapped into almost a zoned-out,slowed-down speed; it's a bit jarring. Maybe that's the point,what do I know? Even so,as a whole deal,this is still a very impressive debut album. Brendan Benson and Jack White really gel as songwriters and the entire band (also featuring Jack Lawrence on bass and Patrick Keeler on drums) swing as if they've been a band forever... <br />    Indeed; I bought this never having heard a note of any of this. Being a huge Jack White/White Stripes fan,I must say that here and about there's material on here that is as good as anything he's done with even the Stripes so far... Cool stuff. It'll be interesting to see how they grow on the next few albums. <br />Cool album overall. Well worth checking out.
1400062756|5.0|There are two ways of looking at success. One is to believe that people have certain innate talents and success is somewhat limited by those talents. The other is to believe that success can be achieved, no matter what the talent level, as long as a person remains focused on developing their abilities. <br /> <br />Dr. Carol Dweck`s Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, draws on personal experience, case study, and practical examples to demonstrate how everyone has the potential to change their mindset and how this change affects a person's ability to succeed in life.  <br /> <br />Dr. Dweck argues that there are two types of mindsets, fixed and growth. The book says, \\"the fixed mindset creates the feeling that you can really know the permanent truth about yourself, and \\"the growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be cultivated.\\" A central point of this book is that people need to understand their mindset and that when faced with the challenges of life, their mindset may either limit their potential or motivate them to learn and grow. <br /> <br />Does this mean fixed mindset - bad and growth mindset - good? Does this mean that people with a fixed mindset are not as happy and that growth mindset people will always be successful? No, it`s not that simple but arguably, the growth mindset is the surest way to success. <br /> <br />I found this book enlightening. It has motivated me to reexamine how I face life's challenges and the limits I have put on myself. It has also made me take a good look at my relationships with family and friends. I've recommended this book to several people who are enjoying this book as I write this review.
B000069HK2|5.0|i can't believe it's been four years since this album was released. yet, i still listen to this album often today even though i have a 500+ cd library. i really can't describe how much this band and this album means to me. before the used came along i was in the whole \\"nu metal\\" stage and that's all i listened to. then i heard the song \\"a box of sharp objects\\" and i thought \\"wow\\", this is really awesome and different. i then bought the cd and i was amazed at what i had just heard. it was so different from anything i've ever heard and i loved it! the cd was beautiful, full of emotion, yet has lots of passion and angst with the screaming/singing mix. not to mention the passionate, poetic lyrics that really hit home and strike you deep, deep down. it was right at that moment when my taste in music changed. from there, i got into finch, thursday, glassjaw, thrice, coheed and cambria, the early november, taking back sunday, and so on. so i just want to send a thank you out to the used for opening my eyes to this new, different style of music and showing me what \\"real\\" music is.<br /><br />although, as of today (june 2006) this type of screamo/emo music trend is so watered down, i feel priviledged to have known this album and the following pioneers of this genre before this style of music started to plummit (which would have been 2004).<br /><br />with my personal feelings aside, this is one of the best albums out there. like i said, they are one of the pioneers of screamo and if you like that style of music, then you'll definitely love this cd. this album is on the same level with brand new's \\"deja entendu\\", finch's \\"what it is to burn\\", taking back sunday's \\"tell all your friends\\", thursday's \\"full collapse\\", coheed and cambria's \\"second stage of turbine blade\\". those albums, all of which are classics in this genre.<br /><br />as for comparing this to their latest release \\"in love and death\\", it definitely tops it. although their new cd is good, it just doesn't have thesame passion, rawness, poetic lyrics, and emotion as this album does. it's very polished and sounds more mainstream and poppy then this one does. nonetheless, if you're a fan of this band then you'll definitely like both albums.<br /><br />as for standouts, that's hard. every single song on this cd means something special to me in a different way. with each song i can specifically remember experiences in my life or what i was doing when i was listening to that song. talk about a record having an impact on someone...<br /><br />i would say that this cd is for everyone but it does have an acquired taste due to the raw, screaming vocals. if you can just overlook the screaming and concentrate on the songs and the emotion that the album is conveying the screaming fits in perfectly with the soothing, mesmermizing melodies of bert mccracken and the used. this cd is a classic and you're cd collection or your life shouldn't be without it...
B000E1ZK3M|4.0|I didn't have high expectations for this movie because of all the mixed reviews, but I am hungry for HD material so I watched it.  It turned out to be a pleasent surprise-realistic story, good acting, good dialogue.  However, don't expect to see a war movie with lots of combat action-most of the movie takes place during the buildup prior to the Gulf War.  Also, while the boot camp portion of the movie is good, it can't compare to Full Metal Jacket.  The HD DVD transfer is one of the better ones and the sound is top notch as well.  Recommended.
0399152717|3.0|Previous Cussler novels could be summed up in the formula: Bad guys exploit ancient historical obscurity to bedevil mankind. NUMA good guys stop bad guys and get the girl. <br /> <br />This book has all those basic elements, but it expands the essential formula in that it has two bad guys with separate agendas, a third almost-bad guy who helps the good guys, and another good guy outsider. It sounds complicated, but it's not. <br /> <br />This book has the potential to be the most interesting of the series, even tossing in an intriguing arctic lost city free of charge. Unfortunately, the story starts to collapse upon itself as it nears the end. For one thing, we're never told explicitly what Gant's secret agenda is or how it's supposed to work. We're never told why Gant wants to kill Kurt Austin long after Gant's aware his secret is out; in other words, there's no point to Austin's death. <br /> <br />This leads to a silly gratuitous Dirk Pitt classic car scene that could have been- should have been- dropped from the book. Cussler likes to insert other characters (including himself) into his novels and I guess this was his vehicle (pun intended) of choice for this novel, but it was an unnecessary distraction. I'd rather have had more about the comeuppance of the bad guys. <br /> <br />Even Austin winning the girl appears half-hearted and Spider Barrett seems a more likely candidate, but I suppose the authors felt it would violate the established formula. The info about the WTO and IMF turns out to be more interesting that the romantic afterthought. <br /> <br />I hope Cussler's co-authors continue expanding and perhaps break out of their self-imposed formula. Unfortunately, this book is only a ghost of what could be.
B000002JS6|5.0|If you have never owned this CD or don't plan on purchasing it, your unamerican. haha I shouldn't go that far, but if you have any rock in roll in you, new or old, this is WELL worth the buy!

I just happened to hear it playing in Barnes and Noble and when I heard the song Sunshine I couldnt believe what I was hearing...............amazing vocals! A wonderful group and an amazing album!!!

Unique and truely refreshing!!!!!!!
0767803434|4.0|Nowadays, Hollywood just wouldn't have the balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism, unless it was an easy target that doesn't spit back (aka, America and it's 1st Amendment).  This film harkens back to the day when people wished our country's foreign policy was a bit more leathery.  Well...ya got it now!  At the very least, a film like this would piss off the surrender-monkeys in the jackass party, not only for what they would see as a glorification of nationalistic jingoism, but for the villification and slaughter of Stalinistic, Castro-like communists that they would only want to capitulate and make peace with.  Makes one wonder if the lefty Glenn Close now hates herself for acting in such a film.  What would they say to a film like this?  Unfortunately, there's plenty of room for criticism in this movie, aside from the political implications therein.  Some (arguably, if not all) of the special effects seemed a bit hokey (hence the 4 stars instead of the five).  I think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything, it would have to be the 90's style CGI, especially the plane crash.  At best, one might go so far as to say it was \\"cute.\\"  And what can a guy like me say to that?  Even as I write this review, scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle against terrorism, in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al Qaida in Iraq, al-Zarqawi, caught himself a couple of 500 lb. bombs with the use of his house.  For those who want to keep westerners depressed and demoralized (not a far stretch from \\"fear-mongering,\\" right?) in the fight against terrorism, this deals a disappointing blow to those who hate America.  What's worse, they can't seem to ban a film exalting American nationalism such as \\"Air Force One\\" from those who wish to see it (oh no!).  And just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching about \\"The Passion.\\"  Sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to every American and not just the idealistic \\"intellectual\\" few, doesn't it?
B000002UJQ|5.0|I still can't get over this album. In a way, it's like Dark Side of the Moon for me, because I listened it to death, but yet i can't get sick of it. Admittedly, this isn't entirely objective, as I am a radiohead fan, but even so, this goes just behind kid A as one of the best albums of the nineties. <br /> <br />1. Airbag: Never been a favourite, but it is very good. The guitar riff is especially catchy. Actually, a friend and I tried to play it as a duet on guitar and piano. It sounded ... interesting. <br /> <br />2. Paranoid Android: In my 'humble' opinion, best song of 90's. It has it all, in fact, like the title track of LA Woman, it could almost classify as a mini album in itself. I can NEVER get sick of the moment where Thom's sneering suddenly becomes this monster, getting angrier and more paranoid by the second. Jonny's solo has to be heard to be believed, especially the studio trickery in the second solo. It has an amazingly misleading title. If it is ever reissued, it should come with some boastful (Best Song of the 90's) subtitle. <br /> <br />3. Subterranean Homesick Alien: Beatiful lyrical imagery, but not as interesting musically. The lyrics are probably some of radiohead's best, certainly enough to warrant looking them up somewhere. <br /> <br />4. Exit Music (For a Film): Not a standout track at first, but is very hushed until the louder section in the middle. It really helps to show off Yorke's vocal range. <br /> <br />5. Let Down: Not really as good as the rest of the album; the guitars are beatiful, but the vocals are a little too whiny for most people... ie me :p. <br /> <br />6. karma Police: An excellent song, close to Paranoid Android and Lucky in sheer brilliance. Actually, the video clip is surprisingly good. It helps to get the message of the song across  quite well. There is this remix my friend sent me of this song crossed with A Day in the Life and a bit from I am the Walrus. It's not as good as either song, of course... <br /> <br />7. Fitter Happier: A bit like an interlude at the opera. <br /> <br />8. Electioneering: Great rocking guitars, very sneering vocals... very radiohead 'bends era'.  <br /> <br />9. Climing UP the Walls: According to yorke, the lyrics are about his part time work at a mental institution. My old cricket club was in a mental institution (no jokes!), and this song gave me the creeps when we drove in through the place past all the bland, barred-windowed buildings. Quite creepy. <br /> <br />10. No Surprises: Like Exit Music, it doesnt really grab your attention at first, but when you listen closely the sarcasm makes you smile. Or shiver. Lyrically, its like Nice Dream, with one particular standout line 'I'll take the quiet life/A handshake/some carbon monoxide'. <br /> <br />11. Lucky: AChingly beatiful, the eerie guitar noises introduce thoms' cooed lyrics, quite similar to 'You and Who's Army', while Colin's base really adds to the tension. Then the chorus explodes, with whoever is playing the lead guitar part (prabably jonny) soaring above the vocals. <br /> <br />12. The Tourist: supremely relaxing, this song is also quite clever in it's lyrics, and fantastic in it's musicianship. A bit Floyd-esq this one. It is supposedly about tourists in other countries, jsut rushing past everuthing to get to the main attractions. 'Slow down, idiot' <br /> <br />This album is not immediately listenable, but if you give it a chance to grow, you will most likely come to love it. If not, oh well, we all have different tastes.
B0002CHIJW|4.0|First off people, this movie goes way over the top with the rape, I agree with all the one star reviews that it is a perverted rape sequence, that the director put in as mere exploitation.  I think the material could've been handled better, like in Last house on the left, but it wasn't.  I give it four stars however, because i like revenge flicks, and I like the plot.  The directing with such a miniscule budget was good.  And the storyline was good.  Also it is a reality, and a movie that people can look at as a reality.  I'm not saying the director meant it to be this way, because I don't think so.  I agree with Roger Ebert in the film being \\"Vile trash\\" but I think it adds something accidentally to the psyche of everything.  It's a film that is good to have if you're a revenge fan, if you have Death Wish, The Limey, the Punisher, Spawn, and other movies like that, then get this movie.  Just because it has something to offer even though it doesn't have that much.

B0007OCG4W|3.0|Closer has a great ability to keep your interest until the very end or should I say the great performances from the great cast make it that way. See it's supposed to be a mixed and twisted love story of how four people meet in the weirdest ways but in the end it just tells the tale of an enormous puzzle of lust, conflict, heartbreak, and most of all lust. For me this movie was a comedy, just wait until you hear the dirty words that come out of their mouths and the crazy computer scene. The problem is that no matter how hard they tried the only person that truly made you feel she was in love was Natalie Portman. It's not the acting it's just the way these characters were written and it didn't work here. Worst of all Closer is badly jumbled by going from one period of time to another in a matter of seconds and it really didn't need to be in that style. Then they mess up by making the film seem like a dirty movie by emphasizing everything nasty you could think up and more and not on the story itself. In the end the characters don't really get closer but further apart and your left with a movie that is only worth watching for its moments of comedy and only worth watching for the good acting.

B0007Y08T2|5.0|\\"The Gallery\\" is the jewel in the crown of Dark Tranquillity's god-like back catalogue, and given the quality of the competition, that's saying something. Whenever I listen to it, I'm always amazed at how such a powerful, emotive, sensual piece of art can exist. Make no mistake; this is not only the greatest album ever to emerge from the Gothenburg scene. \\"The Gallery\\" is almost as close to perfection as music can be. <br /> <br />The real brilliance of \\"The Gallery\\" does not lie in technical skill, although to say that the likes of Niklas Sundin and Anders Jivarp are unskilled would be completely untrue. Datk Tranquillity's real genius lies in their arrangements and songwriting. This may seem like a bold statement, but I believe that in these areas, Dark Tranquillity are unmatched. Not even Opeth, who are renowned for writing songs which rival classical symphonies, can match Dark Tranquillity in this one area. The guitars, bass and drums here harmonise in a way so perfect that it's hard to believe they were written by mere humans. Each instrument compliments each other perfectly, none dominating but all contributing to the artistic beauty of \\"The Gallery.\\" The guitars and bass (and you can actually hear the bass in this album - that's always a good sign), far from being an assault on the senses like so many other heavy metal albums before and since, consist mainly of tremolo picking, the tempo often varying, intertwining around each other to create a lush, melodic, organic atmosphere. Many other, lesser melodic death bands rely on synths almost exclusively to provide melody (Children Of Bodom, I'm looking at you) as a way to get around really putting their backs into making the arrangements work, but thankfully, Dark Tranquillity's melody comes from a higher work of musicianship. Occasionally acoustic guitars and pianos will also kick in to provide a softer interlude in songs like \\"Edenspring.\\" <br /> <br />The drumming also deserves recognition as a feat of songwriting skill. Anders Jivarp's rhythms, rather than just using repetitive beats at a fixed tempo to provide the music with solidity, provides \\"The Gallery\\" with a third thread in it's weave of musicianship and establishes another layer in its melody. He makes full use of the toms and cymbals without disregarding the snare drum, with occasional bursts on the double bass pedal to add energy when the time is right. This is a heavy metal album after all. <br /> <br />And then of course, there's Mikael Stanne. On \\"The Gallery,\\" he's at the top of his game, belting out agonised yet hauntingly emotive shrieks that put even his counterpart in At The Gates, Tomas Lindberg, to shame. There is a distinct similarity between him and Mikael Akerfeldt in the early days of Opeth. However, unlike Opeth, his voice sits at precisely the correct level in the mix; you can turn \\"The Gallery\\" up to a decent volume without the vocals becoming grating, but the chances of anyone considering them too quiet are precisely none. Female vocals performed by Eva-Marie Larsson can also be found on the tracks \\"The Gallery,\\" \\"Lethe\\" and \\"...Of Melancholy Burning,\\" which are very beautiful and near classical in tone. One notable moment is on \\"...Of Melancholy Burning,\\" when one of Eva-Marie's oparetic calls slowly merges with a monstrous howl from Stanne, creating an odd, yet extremely cool effect. <br /> <br />I really don't have anything bad to say about this album. Each song is a masterpiece, a work of art each in it's own unique way. The only pity is that Dark Tranquillity never wrote anything like it again. In my own opinion, \\"The Gallery\\" is absolutely essential to anyone who enjoys music in any way shape or form, one of - if not THE - deepest, most layered, most rewarding albums you will ever hear. It is tangible proof that heavy metal is as much an art form as anything else.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Twenty three years into her career, Madonna appears relentless in her efforts to dominate the music charts worldwide. Most musicians would benefit from a course taught by Madonna on the \\"Secret to surviving in the music world\\" - something none of her contemporaries from the early 80s have managed to do. Whether her present day success is an indication of superior music or effective and shrewd marketing is a question to be considered.<br /><br />  Most critics have labeled \\"Confessions\\" as Madonna's return to her roots. While the genre of music on \\"Confessions\\" is the same as of that of the music that launched Madonna into stardom, the essence of her earlier material is conspicuous by its absence on the new album. The catchy beats of her early music were simply adornments of rich melodies and memorable tunes. \\"Confessions\\" has no memorable tunes whatsoever and the dance beats appear like desperate efforts at camouflaging substandard and forgettable tunes. Excessive detail has been paid to production without there being a solid musical foundation to build on.<br /><br />  While I will always admire Madonna for her stellar work between 1984 and 1996, I hate to admit that \\"Confessions\\" was a huge disappointment and continues the downward trend of substandard music that Madonna started making since her \\"Music\\" album. I truly hope her next studio effort is a reminder of why we fell in love with her to begin with.
0385336691|5.0|I've read every Reacher novel - they're all GREAT. The Hard Way sucks you in right from the start. He could be the best fiction character out there - right there with John Corey (Nelson DeMille), Earl Swagger (Stephen Hunter), and Pike (Robert Crais). Buy the book and read it, you will be very happy you did. I just hope Lee Child keeps pumpin' out these books.
B0000256KE|1.0|I just listened to \\"The Bogus Man\\" twice. What a piece of garbage -- and nearly 10 minutes long. If this is any indication of the rest of the album, then stay away.

B000FILW86|5.0|For those of us who have been fans of these guys since 1977 and have endured the high points (\\"In Color\\", \\"Heaven Tonight\\", \\"Dream Police\\", \\", At Budokan\\", \\"Cheap Trick 1997\\") along with some disheartening lows (does anyone really want to mention \\"The Doctor\\"?), \\"Rockford\\" is an exhilerating, celebratory return to mad cap power pop magnificence. While music that conveys a politically correct, grim, dour world view has it's place, stuff like this serves to remind us that rock and roll can be just plain fun and entertaining while retaining it's visceral power. A great listen from beginning to end.
B000BW7QX6|3.0|Unfortunately, I have to agree with several of the other writers here, like \\"all seeing eye,\\" in their comments. Although I enjoyed the action sequences and special effects of the movie, which were spectacular, the movie's strengths just about end there. I still enjoyed the movie despite it's many faults, but a lot things in the movie just don't make much sense or aren't explained. The main plot idea of a telepathic teenage girl, whose powers can be a devastating weapon, although a staple of the science fiction of past decades, is more than a bit shopworn today and hardly robust enough to anchor the entire plot. The idea is also very similar to that of Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game, with the government trying to create the ultimate human weapon, except for the telepathy element.<br /><br />Two things that were well done were the planetscapes at the beginning of the movie, which are beautiful. Whedon admits he was influenced by Star Wars, and you can see some of that influence here. The movie soundtrack is good and really adds atmosphere to the movie.<br /><br />In this future, as Whedon says in his commentary, not much has changed. The earth is pretty much the same as it always was--there's just more of it--more people, more pollution, more politics, more intrigue, more technology, and more advanced medicine. People have colonized other worlds and migrated off planet, looking for greener pastures. So far so good. This isn't that different from hundreds of other science fiction stories.<br /><br />But the evil secret that the powers that be want protected is when 30 million people die when a terraforming process on a new planet goes bad. I agree again with \\"all seeing eye\\" in his review that this doesn't explain River Tam's disturbed psychological state. The Pax drug that is diffused into the atmosphere of the planet is the reason that all the Reavers, who were normal humans once, have been transformed into homicidal cannibals. Pax is a tranquilizer but for some reason that's not explained, it has the exact opposite effect on a small percentage of the population, which just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Tranquilizers can certainly have bad side effects, such as Thorazine causing tardive dyskinesia (a type of motor tremor), Elavil causing weight gain, and others, but there are dozens of these things on the market and not one has ever, as far as I know, caused people to become homicidal maniacs. Of course in the future they may have all sorts of things we don't have now, but you'd also think they'd bother to test a drug that's going to be deployed in such a fashion and find out if it has any bad side effects. Again, this just doesn't make much sense and takes an otherwise good movie and transforms it into more of a comic book fantasy with poorly thought out and hokey science.<br /><br />The Reavers band together and become marauding space pirates who attack and ravage unsuspecting ships, but they look like the ubiquitous ugly, deformed, humanoid creatures from 1950s science-fiction movies. In the big chase scene, which was great, these baddies are chasing our heroes in their ground flitter. At this point we haven't seen one of them on-screen, but you can also tell they're bad guys because their ship belches out huge clouds of black smoke--so they're polluters as well as bad guys. :-) I don't mean that as a criticism so much as that it turned out to be unintentionally funny.<br /><br />In an early fight scene, a government agent has some sort of stun or paralytic capability, and causes one guy to fall on his sword--that being how a warrior would pay for his failure in some cultures in past centuries, as he says. Although I suppose that's true, again, the whole idea is gratuitous when used in the context of a science-fiction movie. Why would a guy five centuries in the future care about such obsolete customs?  Furthermore, in this future, China and the U.S. have combined into a superpower, but the sword the agent uses is a Japanese design, similar to a short wakazashi. Maybe he was a fan of old 20th-century Kurosawa samurai movies. :-) Still, the fight scenes with the agent, and especially the one at the end between him and Captain Malcolm, are very well done and choreographed, and I say that as a long time martial arts instructor who has occasionally trained movie actors who specialize in martial arts roles.<br /><br />Actually, Whedon does explain it in the commentary on the DVD, but you have to watch that to understand it. Whedon explains that part of the fun of creating a future world is getting to pick out what history you want to include. But it was still hokey.<br /><br />The cast is diverse enough and talented enough so that they could have been standouts if they'd had strong enough material to work with. The cast tries valiantly to make the dialog and script work, though, but unfortunately they're struggling with pretty thin gruel here, but I give them credit for trying. I give the movie three stars for all the action and special effects, which were great, especially, as  Whedon says, the movie was made on a relatively modest budget. But despite the great special effects and action, the story line and the future world imagined here just doesn't quite work. More than anti-gravity would be needed to get this future world and flick off the ground.<br /><br />I did like the concept of the U.S. and China merging to create a great superpower, though. That part was at least interesting.<br /><br />I give the director some credit also for making a movie that does a lot to fill in the backstory for his previous Firefly series. And actually, the fact that the movie was made at all after the original series was cancelled is a great tribute to Whedon. I just wish it had turned out better.he was a fan of old 20th-century Kurosawa samurai movies. :-) Still, the fight scenes with the agent, and especially the one at the end between him and Captain Malcolm, are very well done and choreographed, and I say that as a long time martial arts instructor who has occasionally trained movie actors who specialize in martial arts roles.

0679422714|5.0|This book really brings to light the founder of modern China. I've done research about him before, but I knew nothing of this monstrous scale. <br /> <br />This book reveals Mao for what he truly is: A sadistic, cruel tyrant that wants nothing more than have everything his way. He pushed it even harder than Stalin or Hitler. If anything, Mao wanted to be a God. He did everything to get himself to the top and stay there: Black-mailing, denounciations, and even murder.  <br /> <br />His attitude makes me sick. \\"Half of China may well have to die.\\" I applaud Jon Halliday and Jung Chang for making this book, and for ripping apart the shroud that hid many peoples' eyes from the true side of Mao ZeDong.
B000BC8STC|3.0|Several reviews here talk about the high quality of sound and video.  Not so.  Maybe if you're watching it on a 19\\" TV, but I bought it to use with my home theater system, projecting image onto a large screen.  The video is absolutely lousy, and the sound only acceptable.  I suppose this was originally filmed with the technology of the day in mind.  Back in the early '80's, the largest television screen was probably 24 inches.  But, blown up to today's large screen sizes, the video is sorely lacking in every way.   <br /> <br />Having said that, James' performance is top notch.  The high energy is there, he's in great voice and they put on a great show.  This DVD is definitely worth a watch, and worthy of your collection, but don't expect too much as far as picture or sound quality by today's standards.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a beautiful, and some say the most accurate, telling of the Jane Austen novel. The actors are superb - especially Matthew Macfadyen, who perfectly portrays Mr. Darcy with enough frostiness to make him standoffish, yet enough vulnerability to not completely dislike the character. If the acting was not enough to tempt you to watch the movie, try the witty dialogue or the breath-taking English countryside scenery. I really canot recommend this movie enough. It is something that everyone can watch with no one being embarrassed by nudity, sex scenes, violence or vulgar language. A delight from beginning to end. Run right out and buy this movie!! You will want to watch this over and over again.

B000E6UK32|5.0|Blondie is one of the great bands from the NYC scene of the late 1970s. They had a cool retro underground sound, but they were also capable of hits. They hit the top of the charts several times in the US and UK. For five years they were one of the biggest American bands. They were also one of the first rock bands to artfully move into the reggae, disco, and rap genres. I first saw them on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert in 1976. When I moved to NYC twenty years later, I used to see various members of the band hanging out downtown. It was a surreal experience. Just last week I saw Frank Infante at a club. This was one of the first cool bands that I got into before my brothers. There have been a few greatest hits records from Blondie. This one celebrates their controversial induction into the Hall of Fame. This one collects all their hit singles. Plus in has the \\"In The Flesh\\" remix. This sounds like an Electroclash tune. It also includes some newer material like \\"Maria\\" and \\"Good Boys.\\" One of the best tracks is the Blondie vs. The Doors mashup \\"Rapture Riders.\\" This is pretty good.
B000096I9G|5.0|Ever want to see \\"The Cure\\"?  Or maybe you have seen them and miss them so much.  No matter, if you miss the cure and have seen them or are a seasoned fan waiting to see them live soon this is the DVD to have.  Trilogy links 3 albums. Pornography, disintigration, and Bloodflowers.  I don't understand how they go together but, the DVDs are outstanding.  Filmed in Berlin because, we all know Germany has the most Dark music fans in the world.<br /><br />Although some might argue the disc isn't filmed well because there are not alot of visuals we have to remember it is the music and live performance we're after.  The Cure do normally use more visuals than what are used in the making of the dvd but, we are not buying it to see a circus.  This is the Cure.  Enjoy them for what they are worth.  If you like visuals it shouldn't matter what band you go to see...<br /><br />Who would I suggest this too..... Serious Cure fans.  Especially with the low price.  You can't beat amazons price for the brand new DVD since it was orginally selling twice the price.  Thank god music video prices dropped.  I feel like I've stolen this product... Regardless this is not an action film but a great way to remember the live cure sound and see the cure over and over again for the worlds best price.  A+  This DVD is a must.<br /><br />As for content.... 3CDs played in Full back to back.  I don't know if it's ever been done.  but the cure did it so lovely!
B000EDWL82|5.0|It is 2006 already, and we have maybe the first exciting new band of the year. I first heard this record on the Rodney Bingenheimer show one late night. I thought it was a new obscure Interpol track. Of course I heard the whole album, and it seems that there is another band from England who loves Joy Division and some of the more forgotten post-punk bands. Singer Tom Smith even sounds more like Ian Curtis than Paul Banks does. On the first two tracks, Editors have the atmosphere of U2 (1982) more so than Joy Division. Like some post-punk bands, like Echo and The Bunnymen, Editors have a lot of dynamic with their two guitars, rather than being bass driven like Joy Division. Some of the songs like \\"Blood\\" and \\"All Sparks\\" are very catchy and remarkable. This band is no copyist. There are slow moody pieces and faster dancey songs like \\"Someone Says\\" which is more like Bloc Party. When you think that there is nothing left, they come up with a killer track like \\"Bullets\\" which has the repeating phrase \\"You don't need this disease.\\" There is a very hopeful yearning on most of the songs. The presentation is rather sparse and architectural. Most of the songs have one-word titles. Editors is all about saying more with less. I look forward to seeing them play live.
B000021Y77|5.0|Just what I expected from the DVD cover alone. Lola, with her flaming, bright red hair and tender, spunky, and clever wit, makes this film one of the most unforgettable and exciting foreign films that I've ever seen. For such a simple plot, the film is pure creativity and originality to its fullest. It's a rollercoaster that has many twists and turns as the journey of Lola, who's trying to retrieve money for her boyfriend in distress, Manni, is retold THREE times. Each one is re-enacted in a clever, spontaneous, and yes, even believable way. One thing that Lola, or Manni, could have done changes the whole courses of events completely. Yes, the film is confusing. It makes you wonder if any of those events really happened, or if it's in the imagination of one of the characters. Hell, near the end it feels as if the whole movie was just a dream. That's what makes this film so fun and entertaining. Not only that, but all the suspense and action doesn't take away the affective and well-written dialogue that's absent from 95% of action films. Lola is not just a character with flaming red hair who runs, runs, and runs, and screams so loud that she breaks glass. She has a heart and plenty of spunk that makes her a character worth watching, not just a pretty face to look at. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a fun and entertaining movie that has a bit of a twist, a sense of a humor, and some touchy moments.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|This is probably the most exciting record of the year. Just a few days ago Wolfmother blew everyone away at Coachella. Now we have this self-titled record to deal with. A few songs that were on the EP show up here like \\"Dimension.\\" Those songs are solid. Then we have some of the songs that form the other part of Wolfmother like \\"White Unicorn.\\" I know a lot of people compare them to Black Sabbath, but they are missing out on the whole story. There are many chapters in this book called Wolfmother. They are also as much like White Stripes and The Datsuns. I think this music comes out of a shared loved for blues and heavy rock. I don't think it has anything with copying one band. Then we have the one word song \\"Woman.\\" This is the coolest single of the year. Much rock music has come out of depression and dark stuff. This song single-handedly gets rock and roll back on track, with its monolithic love. Some detractors probably haven't heard \\"Where Eagles Have Been\\" which is an epic rock and roll journey. \\"Apple Tree\\" is basic rock and roll. Some songs like \\"Joker & The Thief\\" and \\"Vagabond\\" remind me of a mix between Thin Lizzy and Devendra Banhart. The heavy rocking song \\"Colossal\\" takes no prisoners. \\"Witchcraft\\" explores some weird rhythms. \\"Tales\\" is more pure psychedelic rock. This album is 13 songs of rock and roll, blues, folk, heavy metal, and every good about music right now.
068987474X|3.0|Like most of the reviewers have already said, it is mostly common sense (especially after ch 6) and it is a short read.  But it's also a wake up call.  When you fall in love with the wrong one, some times love blinds you and you don't realize he is no longer into you (This is for the ones who lost interest).  I found the letters to greg to be both stupid and funny- funny because we can laugh at how dumb they are being. Yet deep down we know it's an exaggeration or either ourselves or someone we know.
B000EJ9VUW|5.0|Liars are a very artistic band from New York City. They have recently moved to Berlin and expanded the sound. Five years ago they were the hippest band out of Williamsburg. They kicked a few members out of the band. They did an unconventional second record that had people scratching their heads. I saw one of their first shows in New York with the new lineup. It was bizarre. Once I heard the album, I knew it was great. A second show in Los Angeles confirmed my judgment. But still people misunderstood them. I think on this third record, the sounds are more pure. They are an artistic band with knowledge of avant-garde stuff. The music is mostly percussion and weird sounds. Angus Andrew's vocals are more musical this time too. Most of the album is part of a story. It's a concept album dealing with two characters. The album also includes three sets of videos for each song. This is probably the most unconventional album since The Fiery Furnaces last one. Liars have done a much better album that will take much time to sink in. We live in an iPod generation where everyone listens to two tracks from each album. Liars have made an album to be listened to by itself.
0553801503|4.0|Just recently finished this book and found this to not be as good as the others in the series. The pacing of this Crows is much slower but still has a few high tension chapters. This book continues the stories of the ruling families of Westeros but the focus this time is primarily around Oldtowne, King's Landing, Braavos, and the Vale. We see a brief bit with Jon Snow but none of Dany or Tyrion, but then again, this book was much longer but cut into two books by the author.<br /><br />Again Mr. Martin is able to continue to craft a story where everyone gets punished and shaped by the strife and conflict. Pain and punishment is a central theme throughout his books, but this leads to hope with certain characters and justice for others. The most attractive part of his works centers around the different characters and how they are going to fit into the whole picture. Mr. Martin is able to obscure his direction, yet leave little tantalizing clues. Is the Hound really dead? Who will be the three heads of the dragon? Who were Jon Snow's parents? All these things are finely woven into a beautifully crafted story that you hate to take the journey through because it is fraught with suffering, but cannot deny for the climax may be worth that trip.<br /><br />If you haven't read anything else by Martin, don't get this.  But if you read the first three books, you are going to buy this book without looking at any of the reviews.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Nirvana, regarded as one of the greatest rock groups of the genres 50 year history. The band included one of musics greatest geneuses Kurt Cobain. His legacy remains one of the most touching and most interesting in rock history. Add bassist Chris Novoselic and drummer David Grohl and you have one of the top-ten greatest rock 'n roll bands of all time. As an underground alternative Seattle Nirvana released one underground record before hitting it big with signing to DGC, after which they rose to fame and became the succesful  monsters they are today. However, the death of Kurt Cobain surely changed all that. Kurt along with Nirvanas legacy lives on as one of rocks greatest storys. I will rate on the pros and cons of this compliation. <br /> <br />Pros:  <br />-You get some of Nirvanas most successful songs on one disc. <br />-You get an unrelased track which was recorded before Kurt's death \\"You know, Your Right\\".  <br /> <br />Cons: <br />-Only one song from the underground debut Bleach?! Eventhough it wasn't popular at the time of it's release as they got bigger more people own it and their is more great songs from this album.  <br /> <br />-Nirvana has more great songs than just the hits and some of their most over looked tracks are their best songs. <br /> <br />-It excludes \\"Aneurysm\\" which is regarded by many as their best song.  <br /> <br />-Why put songs from the unplugged album on here i believe the unplugged album should be heard as the whole concert not just a few songs. especially \\"All Apologies\\" it's good unplugged but it has more meaning electric.  <br /> <br />-It is completely pointless i mean Nirvana only had 3 albums (4 if you count Incesticide) So realisticly you should have a state of mind that it's not that many albums. <br /> <br />Overall: <br />If your just buying this for \\"You Know, Your Right\\", the money you'd be paying is not worth it, download the song instead. If you want a good introduction to nirvana buy Nevermind and stay away this compliation is nothing but a cash-in attempt and is useless trash.
1400079276|4.0|I want to take issue with Zachary Hanson's (below) bombastic criticisms of this book.  <br /> <br />\\"Maddeningly inexplicable plot elements tossed off that add up to little more than bizarre Oedipal wish fulfillment, soft-porn, macabre anime-style violence and fantasy sequences\\" is a terrible abstract. The sotry of Kafka Tamura is supposed echo the story of Oedipus. To try and use that as a reason why the book is not good is simply foolish.  <br /> <br />Violence in this book is actually quite rare, and the sex scenes , while somewhat graphic, mirror those in other Murakami novels. They're c ertainly nothing offensive.  <br /> <br />Also, I personally found the dialogue between Hoshimo and Nakata to be some of the most beautiful literary dialogue I've read in a long time. The quote used is taken out of context, and without a reference to the fact that one of the characters has the intelligence of a child, it may appear banal. On the contrary, the story of these two men actually surpasses in many ways the parallel story of Kafka Tamura. <br /> <br />This book, while not on par with the superb 'Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,' is a beautiful, well told story that will have you thinking about the control we have over our own lives. <br /> <br />If you've read Murakami before, you'll see much of the same symbolism, as well as repeated themes.  <br /> <br />In any case you won't be disappointed.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|This album is one of Floyd's most overlooked...I think it's one of their best..I get the feeling this albums about war..It showcases the bands ability to express emotion....This is one of those albums that has to be listened to in its entirety...Try sitting in a dark room with this album playing in your headphones...quite the journey....Good Job FLoyd...hoohoo
B000002U82|5.0|for it being recognized by every generation as one of the greatest album's of all time. Pink Floyd doesn't hold anything back in their greatest achievement. The album will have you enchanted from beginning to end. <br /> <br />This is the third album in what I consider Pink Floyd's legendary three: Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and Dark Side of The Moon. It is also the best of the three. <br /> <br />Their performance is truly amazing. It's instrumentally, flawless. From the amazing guitar to the subtle sounds in the background. This is what makes the album. The lyrics and vocals are both very good, Pink Floyd's best in both areas. It's also a much easier listen than Wish You Were Here or The Wall, which is a good thing in my opinion. <br /> <br />Because it's appealed to so many people out there, you should really give it a try. You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />If this review was helpful to you, please check out my reviews for: Wish You Were Here and The Wall. <br /> <br />Thanks for your time.
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero was the last of Nirvana's recording catalog...Thought by many to be their greatest album..for me though it seemed Nirvana changed their sound for this album...Bleach was pure grunge...Nevermind their second album helped make the transaction between Seattle authentic grunge to Main Stream alternative grunge....So I guess you could call this album \\"Alternative Grunge\\" Great album non-the-less...It goes from heavy to light heavy to light...Which is what makes this album...Classic tunes for one of the last \\"rock\\" bands....R.I.P. Nirvana...Oh yea by the way Mr. Grohl should have stuck to drums...
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This show is so awesome. Ever since I saw the phantom traverler preview commercial of this episode I knew I had to check the show out. I did  then I was hooked.The only bad part I did not like was the season finale which if you have not seen I will not spoil it for you. So buy this when it comes out I Know I'm going to be first in line then check out the second season next year on the upn.
0140187537|4.0|A thoroughly decent and ethical man is influenced by but not swallowed up by the ubiquitous soft corruption in his hometown. Throughout, a novel about bedrock morals and the test that modern times gives them. A much slighter, smaller story than \\"East of Eden\\" or \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" this later novel probes some of the finer intellectual notions the others do not.
B000ESSTL0|5.0|But in Depeche Mode's case, there was nowhere to go but skyrocket to the top. Already having massive success with Music For The Masses and the following tour, Violator cemented Depeche Mode's status as being a worldwide phenomenon and the best electronic band of all time. Now, Depeche Mode's masterpiece Violator is here in remastered form and sounds better than ever. Tracks like Clean, The Sweetest Perfection, World In My Eyes, and Blue Dress sound like different songs and there have been major improvements with the overall audio quality of the entire album. The 30 minute documentary, \\"If you wanna use guitars, use guitars\\", is outstanding and gives quite a bit of insight into the world of DM circa 1989\1990 and shows how far they really had come. <br /> <br />There is not much left to say about Violator than there already has been said. It is the best album of the 90s, best electronic album of all time, and #2 in Depeche Mode's best album rankings (With Ultra being #1 and Black Celebration being #3. Songs like Enjoy The Silence, Halo, Clean, World In My Eyes, and The Sweetest Perfection are beyond music, they are truly works of art. Essential listening for those who love electronic and alternative rock.
B000FILW86|5.0|After 40 listens, I still like EVERY song on this album.  The vibe of this album can be summed up in 3 words: <br />  + Energy <br />  + Confidence <br />  + Swagger <br />I am not just talking about the rockers, but this vibe carries through to the slightly more pop-ish songs on RockFord.  This album is the real deal -- a modern masterpiece.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I think that this is a really solid effort by AFI.  I have been listening to this band for many years.  I have heard their sound change from album to album.  I would say that as different as Sing the Sorrow was from The Art of Drowning, DECEMBERUNDERGROUND is that much different from Sing the Sorrow.  Really progressed to a new level with this one.  I like all of the songs on it, and there are many different styles of music on here.  I really like the direction that AFI are going and I hope that they continue to do things their way.  Although all of the songs are good, my favorites are Kill Caustic, Summer Shudder, The Interview, and The Killing Lights.  Not to name all the songs is very difficult, because they are all so good.  I just can't get these out of my head.  If you are a long time fan of AFI and you are not closed minded to the idea that they are progressing to new levels within their musical talent, then you will love this record.  If you are expecting another hardcore record sounding like something they did ten years ago, then you may be disappointed.  I think this record is great, and I believe AFI will be happy with the response from fans on this record and tour.  I can only imagine what they will do next.  It will be interesting to see where they go from here.
068484267X|4.0|This book is very good but very sad.  Excellent writing, but eveyone just keeps dying--it's unbelievable.  It really shows you how difficult life was back in the day.  It makes you count your blessings that we live now and not then.  Definately worth a read.  Frank Mc Court is a very talented writer.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|I was not put off by the amazon review - I went on the talents of ms. harris and mr. knophler and together they are sublime.  I wish they had taken this cd a step further and junked more of the technical spin and let two musicans and vocalists perform.  the fiddle and mandolin are really great and deserve more play time.  it's an incredible cd overall; maybe their next cd will make 5 stars - this one certainly comes close -- js    PS -- Just got tickets for their concert - rarely do I venture out but this one I can't miss.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This charming movie is a refreshing change from modern sarcastic humor and shows us how to be totally romantic without resorting to blantant sensuality.  I have seen it many times, and find new little things to like about it every time.  I love the casting choice for Mr. Darcy- he is so tender and sweet to Elizabeth, and he is very handsome besides.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|Fuirefly is, simply put, not a very intelligent show. If you like science fiction that challenges your head, heart, mid, soul while taking you on amazing adventures, try something else. Firefly is not for you. Perhaps it appeals to so many people because one doesn't need to think too much to get through Firefly. <br /> <br />Every science fiction cliche` in the book is used, not one idea stands out as original. Even the fans have to agree that the terraforming theory is quite simply old. It first appeared in 1967 and the theory has been touted as utter rubbish by modern science. If we colonize other worlds it is NOT going to happen by terraforming. <br /> <br />The dialogue is hollw. There is no pathos or ethos for the less than sympathetic characters. Unlike Farscape or Mutant X --both highly orinal series'-- it is extremely difficult to care about the characters. <br /> <br />Suffice to say, Fox showed good jusgement in cancelling a show that was cancelled for a very good reason. No one liked it the first time, but now that it's made it to the big screen everybody is suddenly interested. <br />
B0009R1T7M|1.0|I subscribe to a magazine called Uncut.  This magazine has introduced me to some really great acts such as Wilco and Richmond Fontaine and opened my eyes to classic artists such as Bob Dylan and Emmylou Harris.  When Uncut voted Arcade Fire's Funeral and Sufjan Stevens' Illinois as albums of the year 2005, I decided it would be worth a try checking out these artists, especially since the magazine's year end CD contained interesting songs by each group.  Despite still loving the magazine, next year I will be more careful.<br /><br />I must admit, I've never made it through Arcade Fire, terrible production and what sounded interesting on one track became quickly irritating (singing lessons are in order in Montreal).  Sufjan received more patience on my behalf.  The album is whimsical so I thought it merely took a few attempts to get it.  I quote another reviewer who just got it right; \\"I've tried and Tried and TRIED to give this album a go\\" but like my soul mate (Sufjan wise at least) on the other side of the planet from my stand point, I find this pretentious.  Is this supposed to be some kind of Pet Sounds?  What sounded somewhat charming for one track becomes unfocused for a whole album.  Yes, there are a few good tunes to be found.  Many are, however, simply amateurish with way too many instruments, my feeling is that that is intended to conceal the lack of melodies.  End result is that one should not buy the hype (as I did!) for as an album, Illinois really has too much noise lacking direction.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|The first word that comes to mind is pathetic. If you are a true science fiction fan,I'm sure you will agree. Good special effects does not equal interesting characters or good storytelling. The acting too leaves one to wonder if anyone except Mal even knows how to act. <br /> <br />There is no tension in this movie. Nothing whatsoever to make you care about the fate of the world. I laughed at almost all of River Tam's parts, because she is given nothing to work with.
B000F3A7LE|5.0|I liked this album from the first release just to hear the Daryl Hall vocals and I wasn't disappointed. After 28 years, I'm not disappointed again. I went straight to disc number 2 to listen to the Hall vocals on \\"Exposure\\", \\"Mary\\" (it's nice to hear him sing the word \\"sister\\" correctly...), \\"Disengage\\", \\"New York, New York, New York\\" and \\"Chicago\\".<br /><br />I think this album is a fine collaboration with Daryl's soaring vocals and Robert Fripp's production. Fripp's use of all those tape loops (aka \\"Frippertronics\\") made me wonder if the 24-bit re-mastering would expose the tape noise to go with it but that problem was taken care of.<br /><br />\\"Exposure\\" is part of a trilogy of albums that included the Peter Gabriel album which I haven't heard and the \\"Sacred Songs\\" album by Daryl Hall which uses Fripp's production throughout. I highly recommend getting the Buddah Records release of that album with bonus tracks.
B0002DB52M|4.0|I haven't seen a movie in a long time that has really pulled me in like this one.  Knowing the history about the American West in the 1800s and the early 1900s augments the plausibility of the type of human nature that this movie represents.  Dark look at humanity, but a hard view to challenge, especially if you are no longer a child!
0307277674|1.0|The Da Vinci  Code is author Dan Brown's alternative history or silly attempt to establish a neo-pagan religion with Jesus an Hippie-in-Chief, worshipping his girlfriend Mary Magdalene while his jealous buddies, the apostles, gripe about her like Beatles resentful of Yoko Ono.<br /><br />This (hold up book) is the Da Vinci Code. I got it paperback for $5.00 at Wal-Mart. I can tell you now, it's vastly overpriced. This book gives Christians on the fence an excuse for not following Jesus. Defenders say, \\"Lighten up, it's just a novel! And besides, it's all true.\\" That is self-contradictory, and besides, it's not all true. The Da Vinci Code claims are easily disproved, but the average American doesn't have the background in the Bible, early Church History or religious symbolism to separate truth from falsehood.<br /><br />Let's take the idea of a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene and the factoid that Jesus founded a royal bloodline. Brown cannot make up his mind about the basis of his claim. It's \\"THE\\" gigantic secret of the ages that the Catholic Church has suppressed through murder and intrigue for 2,000 years. But it's also \\"common knowledge\\" to serious scholars that anyone with eyes can see. Despite the Roman Church out to murder anyone who let out the secret, Leonardo was busily telling the world through cleverly encoded artwork painted on the walls of Catholic Churches. It's this self-contradictory notion that serves as the underlying interest of the book.<br /><br />Let me tell you something about all those pseudo-scholars in the Da Vinci Code. I dare anyone to go to a major university, especially an Ivy League one and find someone in the religious department who actually believes in the existence of God!<br /><br />We live in an age that prizes \\"spirituality\\"-an amorphous New Age benevolence that affirms us in our \\"okay ness.\\" But though we love spirituality, we loathe religion and the thought of a transcendent Father God who might bother us with commands, \\"thou shalt nots\\" and sin. And finally, we live in a post-Watergate age of The X Files, where vast conspiracies by sinister organizations are widely credited with little critical thought. That's what The Da Vinci Code tries to sell us- a new \\"real Jesus\\" with an active sex life who is all about sacred feminine paganism with its duality of god and goddess, and who naturally is hushed up by the big, bad Church whose God is typically spoken of using the scary pronoun \\"He.\\"<br /><br />Author Dan Brown sees the \\"sacred feminine\\" as a kind of religious affirmative action program so that we can add a few goddesses to the starting lineup of gods. Gods and goddesses are not God. They are our bad crayon drawings of God. Far and away the easiest creature to worship are the ones we invent ourselves, because it's very easy to adore the work of our hands and to create \\"gods\\" who tell us what we want to hear rather than the truth.<br /><br />Now let's get to the Dan Brown facts that are not facts. There's similarities between the pagan God Mithras and Christ. What Brown doesn't tell you is there's no record of Mithras as a popular cult throughout the Roman Empire until after the establishment of Christianity. So who borrowed from whom? Christianity came first!<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code says the Dead Sea scrolls and Nag Hammadi scrolls are the earliest Christian writings. The Dead Sea scrolls make no mention of Jesus or Christianity. They are entirely Jewish texts. The Nag Hammadi scrolls, scholars believe, were written between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, although a few texts may date to 150 AD. The New Testament was written in the 1st century, and Paul's letters to the Thessalonians is dated to the 50's AD, over 100 years before Na Hammadi. So much for Brown's \\"Earliest Christian writings.\\"<br /><br />Brown says there are only 12 cups on The Last Supper painting table and the missing 13th cup is the \\"Grail\\" that bore Jesus' blood-which is the womb of Mary Magdalene, who'spregnant with Jesus' child and standing beside him. First, there are 13 cups corresponding to Jesus and the 12 Disciples. Brown was hoping you wouldn't count them. That is not Mary Magdalene next to Jesus, but the apostle John, traditionally  the youngest of the apostles and portrayed in many artworks as feminine and beardless.<br /><br />Then there's the Opus Dei \\"monastery.\\" There are no monks in Opus Dei-the majority of its members are lay people. So in addition to the inanity of being an albino(!) assassin (now there's somebody who will blend right in and go unnoticed as he carries out his campaign of murder for the Roman Catholic Church), this albino assassin Silas is saddled with the role of being a \\"monk\\" in a Catholic organization, Opus Dei, that has no monks!<br /><br />What about the hero of the book, Langdon, being a professor of symbology at Harvard University? Harvard has no department of symbology.<br /><br />Brown keeps calling the great Renaissance artist \\"Da Vinci\\" as in \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" True scholars know Leonardo Da Vinci as Leonardo because Da Vinci is where Leonardo lived. You call Jesus \\"Jesus\\" not \\"of Nazareth\\" and you don't call Francis of Assisi \\"Assisi\\" because that's where he lived. This blunder of calling Leonardo by \\"Da Vinci\\" is a dead giveaway of the shoddy scholarship to follow.<br /><br />The Gnostic Gospel of Phillip calls Mary Magdalene the companion of Jesus and the Da Vinci Code says the word companion in Aramaic means spouse. What they don't tell you is that the Gnostic Gospel of Phillip wasn't written in Aramaic, it was written in Coptic Egyptian and the word means something different.<br /><br />I'll wrap things up with the most famous painting in the Louvre Museum, the Mona Lisa. Brown says the Mona Lisa is really religious, being an anagram of the pagan god Amon and his consort Isis. This sounds ingenious, but for the fact that Leonardo Da Vinci never called the painting the Mona Lisa. He called it \\"La Gioconda.\\" The title Mona Lisa comes from Vasari's biography of the painter, published 31 years after Leonardo's death. Mona is a common Italian contraction of Madonna meaning \\"my lady,\\" so the title means \\"My Lady Lisa,\\" in this cases the wife of wealthy Florentine businessman Francesco del Giocondo. As the old  saying goes, when people don't believe in God, they don't believe in nothing-they believe in anything!<br /><br />There's a boatload of other inconsistencies and bald-faced lies enshrined in the Da Vinci Code. But whether or not you enjoy The Da Vinci Code's portrayal of the whole Christian religion as the cover-up for a naughty little sexual affair between a dead rabbi and his girlfriend, I personally take comfort in Jesus' words as recorded in the Gospel of John:<br /><br />My sheep know my voice and they follow me. A stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the voice of strangers.beside him. First, there are 13 cups corresponding to Jesus and the 12 Disciples.

B000B8QF14|5.0|This DVD is a MUST HAVE for any GD fan.  I saw the band live in Oct 2005 in a large venue then 2 days later in a VERY SMALL venue and the DVD shows EXACTLY what I saw live---PURE TALENT, EXCELLENT SOUND AND ENDLESS ENERGY.  I've seen MANY bands live in my time and the Green Day boys are in my top 2 of live acts. I'm in excited anticipation of what's next---they have their work cut out for them.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|I had to watch this movie twice before I actually understood everything that was going on.  Not long into my first viewing, I began to realize the surreality of it and began to think that it was a dream, I thought at first, was in Sam Foster's mind.  The ending was a complete surprise and I decided I had to have a second look to pick out all the clues that led to it.  The performances were all stellar, although I must admit I am a huge Ewan McGregor fan, which was the main reason I saw this film to begin with.  Although it's a little confusing the first time around, and it's important not to miss anything, it's worth the time to sit down and watch it...watch twice and you just might get even more out of it.

0790731452|5.0|I think Mars Attacks is a stupendous movie! My favorite part was when the Martians were attacking people with the insta-ray guns. This is the best movie I've ever seen! If you really like Martians, then this is the movie for you. I like the fact that it took Slim Whitman to kill the Martians. They just can't take his music! My favorite part about the Martians was that they were super clever. Just look at those gigantic brains! Not only were the Martians super smart, they were also extremely sly. I don't know why we kept falling for the same old trick over and over again. I guess it was because we wanted to believe they were good, but of course that was not true. We didn't know that until it was too late. That was one of my favorite parts about the Martians. They kept on giving us the business and anyway, the movie really stood out! I could imagine the Martians before I had even seen the movie. At the beginning, we could just break the Martians' helmets with a simple gunshot. At the end, they really knew how to protect themselves.They were real villians. Well, you know what they say: you can't last forever! I wonder if there really are Martians out there. Don't you?
B000294SFW|3.0|Inferno is not a bad album by any means, but my interest in it has worn off just a little bit since my first enthusiatic initial listens. it's hard to shake the sense of thinking there are a few too many Lemmy and Co. on auto pilot moments here...but the sense of dynamics is hightened to reveal some fresh ideas in the Motorhead camp. most notable in \\"Keys To The Kingdom\\" which has a great groove and is catchy as hell.
0679720200|5.0|The idea of isolation from society is one that Albert Camus truly made his own throughout his distinguished career, particularly in this novel 'The Stranger'. It is difficult to describe the full depth of a Camus character but it must at least be attempted. <br /> <br />What is distinctive of his characters' isolation, including that of Meursault, is that it is always a volountary isolation. The character is not isolated because he has been rejected by society but because he has nothing but contempt for that which surrounds him. Meursault dislikes much of what surrounds him but this is not to say that he is some sort of loner. It is testament to Camus' ability as a writer that the reader is drawn to, rather than repelled by such a character. <br /> <br />Meursault is essentially a man who refuses to play the game and refuses to do what society dictates. He pays a heavy price for his refusal to adhere to social conventions, however there are no heroic pretentions in what Meursault does. This character is very representative of Camus' writing and perhaps even of Camus himself and the depiction of his attitudes, actions and existence makes a fascinating and fantastic novel.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out, fearing that it wasn't going to be as good as Sing The Sorrow, which really changed my life and the way I look at music. Fortunately, this CD, although completely different than Sing The Sorrow, really rekindled my admiration and love for AFI. Since I have nothing better to do, here is a track by track breakdown of the CD: <br /> <br />Prelude 12/21: A great beginning to the CD, displaying Davey's voice quite well over a very catchy beat <br /> <br />Kill Caustic: Sounds more like their old music, the screams are great as always and it adds a different side to the CD that wouldn't have been there without this <br /> <br />Miss Murder: Arguably their most...pop-ish...track on the CD, but still a good one, factoring in the 'heys' that AFI have always utilized. <br /> <br />Summer Shudder: I consider this the best song on the CD, the chorus is simply stunning and Davey's voice is amazing. <br /> <br />The Interview: Again, another one of the stunners. This song will bring back your faith in AFI if you'd begun to lose it. It's musically and lyrically a cut above most music you'll find today. <br /> <br />Love Like Winter: I like this song, but I am a little unsure as to why. The beginning sounds good, with the echo effect, but I'm not sure quite why this song appeals to me. <br /> <br />Affliction: Again, a bit like old AFI, displaying more of the 'punk rock' side of them. I like it, but I don't think it's my favourite track. <br /> <br />The Missing Frame: The guitar riff in the beginning really drew me in, actually throughout the song I think that the guitar bits are perfect. <br /> <br />Kiss And Control: Davey's voice reaches lower than it usually does, and also goes up to those high notes we know he can. The heavy vocals in the background doing that chanting thing that AFI has been semi-known for is highly effective. This song has punk rock overtones, soft overtones, goth overtones, and the melodic voice. One of the best tracks. <br /> <br />The Killing Lights: Sounds more like a Sing The Sorrow or Art Of Drowning song, just the way it begins with the guitar and the little 'oh' at the beginning. I like it, it's very catchy. <br /> <br />37mm: Probably the most electronic track on the entire album, 37mm is catchy but also slightly haunting, with a beat that drives the song and electronic effects that really add to the lyrical content. Again, the use of choral singing really adds to the full song. <br /> <br />Endlessly, She Said: I have a feeling that this is going to be the most critically hailed song on the album and I always feel as though AFI opens and closes their albums perfectly. This song is epic, really. The lyrics are perfect, and it displays Davey's vocal ranges nicely.
0307474275|5.0|\\"The Da Vinci code\\" is pure genius - whether we care to entertain Dan Brown`s premise on this foundation of Christianity as anything beyond fiction, we must admit that it is a work of a genius that creates not merely a fantastic novel with countless sold copies, but also substantial commotion in the Christian world, matched with equally vast curiosity in the public about topics that are brought to surface by the novel: The Knight's Templar, the Holy Grail, Mary Magdalene, Royal bloodline, and a secret brotherhood society among the most intellectual minds at the time, Priory of Sion.<br /><br />This book has so bravely weaved a new path from the beginning to the present world of Christianity, and in doing so, it has enraged and evoked intense desire for more knowledge on the subject.<br /><br />Brown's gifted talent combines a most perfect setting in Paris, the excitement of an authentic story, the element of Christian history, two likable and well-developed characters - the professor of symbology, Dr. Robert Langdon, and the cryptologist, the beautiful French Sophie Neveu - along with conversations in French and superlative writing quality. Pure reading pleasure.<br /><br />In the title, Da Vinci naturally refers to the true genius of our time, Leonardo da Vinci, and the code builds around the hidden meaning behind the works and mind of Leonardo da Vinci.  If he did not have my attention before, he certainly has the full grasp of it now.<br /><br />It was mesmerizing for me to imagine the works of Leonardo da Vinci with the depth of hidden significance that Brown associates to them. The beloved Mona Lisa and her mysterious smile and the timelessness of that expression, lost as it is in a million interpretations and countless allegories, is now endowed with yet another secret.<br /><br />The Last Supper, the phenomenal masterpiece by Da Vinci on the old dining room wall of Milano's Santa Maria del Grazie church, is mystified with a new identity at the side of Christ, that of Mary Magdalene. It was all a most delicious experience to be lost in Dan Brown's interpretations of Leonardo's masterpieces.<br /><br />Robert Langdon wakes up in the Ritz Hotel with the news of a murder followed with a vague insinuation of his involvement. In the Louvre, Langdon and Sophie grapple with the first clues slashed across Jacques Sauniere's body - Oh Draconian Devil, Oh Lame Saint - only to find it a perfect ambigram for Leonardo da Vinci - The Mona Lisa - they race to the site of the painting. Anyone who has visited the Louvre knows this small priceless painting quietly hangs in the grand Salon Carre, a miniature for the enormous wall engulfing it, and yet a presence so real that you tremble in its magnificence.<br /><br />The words scratched on the Mona Lisa - heavens forbid - So Dark the Con of Man - another anagram - lead us to another da Vinci masterpiece - Madonna of the Rocks - and thus to the mysterious key and the brilliant adventures which follow. Soon the object of their search is made apparent to them: The Holy Grail.<br /><br />Brown brings us back to Leonardo's The Last Supper, and to my surprise, mistakenly calls this work a fresco - which it is not. It is a well-known fact that, much to the disappointment of the entire world including himself, Leonardo chose not to use the fresco technique on his mural, but rather a new technique he was experimenting with: oil and tempera (egg yolk and vinegar) painting on dry plaster.<br /><br />As a result, the masterpiece which took him 4 painstaking years to complete, started to degenerate in his own lifetime. If we had a fresco in our possession, not only would we not mourn the eventual loss of this masterpiece as it slowly disappears into the wall despite the fortunes spent to restore it, we would also understand more of Brown's answers about the painting because it would be in pristine condition.<br /><br />Brilliant book that expects you to think, to follow a complex and fun plot and to wonder perhaps at how much or how little we know about history and how much is yet hidden to be discovered.onder perhaps at how much or how little we know about history and how much is yet hidden to be discovered.
B0000024RZ|5.0|I bought this cd in a \\"Bob Dylan 3-Pak\\" on my eigth grade trip to Washington D.C. I hurriedly opened the pack, and this cd looked the most inviting. Lemme tell you, from the beginning to the end, I listened through this album 10 times on that trip. It still hasn't grown old, and is still one of my favorite Dylan albums. I'd recommend you buy it.
B0009IW88A|5.0|This is a great sound track I had to put it on my mp3 player. My favorite is Track 10 (Molossus). I love Hans Zimmer and James Horner so to have them both together was brilliant.

0312995423|3.0|Although \\"Digital Fortress\\" isn't nearly as good as his other widely praised novels like \\"The Davinci Code,\\" it still makes for a fun read. Yet again, Dan Brown utilises every possible resource, which in this case includes two unnamed ex-cryptographers, to combine a thrilling storyline with the complex inner workings of the National Security Agency, specifically the cryptology department. Throughought the novel two stories are taking place at once, one filled with disaster and deception at the NSA Headquarters in the US, and the other a ratrace through the Spanish province of Andalucia. Brown often alternates scenes from chapter to chapter, leaving one in suspense of what will happen in each, until finally both of them meet at the end for a rather predictable, but enjoyable, ending. What makes this book all the more fun is the code on the final page - one must remember what strategies were used by the cryptographers to find the answers. \\"Digital Fortress\\" is a great book for a rainy weekend or for a fun thriller anytime.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I'd say that this album would be good for the beginning Neil Young listener. Heck, it was enough to get me hooked on him.
B00004SVID|5.0|I bought this album having been in love with PF's album The Wall for years. I also knew the reputation PF had as a live band, and I must say they did not fail me. It is one of the only instances where I prefer the live recording to that of the original. The sound is full, rich, and one can feel the energy bursting out of their speakers. The audience noise also adds to the performance of the concert. People complaining that it's too close to The Wall album are missing the point, Pink Floyd can actually replicate an entire album live! That's an amazing feat for any musician. I would love for a DVD version of this to come out--but until that time I will satisfy my love for The Wall with this live CD.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|i have been an afi fan for 6 years now, from their punk years to now the rock/screamo/pop/industrial sound they manage to pull off another truely great release. i strongly recommend this cd and all their previous albums as well. i love these guys
0634023020|5.0|This is a very nice collection of advanced solo pieces for jazz guitar. The selection is very solid, and the arrangments are really top notch. Jamie clearly put a lot of effort into this project and the outcome is apparant. There is virtually no pedagogy here - just the raw arrangments and a well recorded CD of jamie playing each tune at a performance level at normal speed. The CD alone is worth the cost of the package just as a listening CD. But be warned: although the arrangments are clean and sensibly voiced, the pieces are complex and will take considerable effort to master - but they are well worth it.
1400031567|5.0|In \\"Sidetracked\\" Mankell is at his very best as a crime writer. The story starts as two completely unrelated events: the girl setting herself on fire and the murder of the former Swedish minister of justice. The second one, which turns out to be the beginning of a series is, of course, the matter of utmost priority for the police, so Wallander has to work hard before his planned holidays. However, he cannot let the girl in flames get out of his memory...<br /><br />The reader gets more clues than the police and therefore knows the identity of the killer faster, which allows for concentrating on the work of the team of detectives. Their reasoning can be followed easily, showing differences in approach based on personality and attitude. The psychological side is very important for Mankell, here he brings for the first time the psychologist who helps make the portrait of the killer.<br /><br />The political background of Sweden plays, as usual, a significant role, and the downsides of the system are shown as well as its advantages.<br /><br />Henning Mankell's detective stories get only better as he goes. This is a gem of the genre. Absolutely recommended for the fans of crime fiction.
0618477942|5.0|Quiz time:  Name three things that Alison Bechdel (author/cartoonist behind the fabulous \\"Dykes To Watch Out For\\") had in common with Claire, the daughter on \\"Six Feet Under\\".  Answer: They both had two brothers, their fathers were killed by being hit by a large motor vehicle, and both grew up living in the family funeral home.<br /><br />In Alison's case, the kids shortened the name of the latter to the \\"Fun Home\\", which she had made the title of her beautifully illustrated autobiographical work.  It deals mostly with her relationship with her father, a fastidious and seemingly cold and distant man who inherited the family funderal business, although he also worked as a high school English teacher.  His main passion, however, was restoring and decorating period buildings in their small Pennsylvania town, first the town museum and later a big gothic mansion in which he moved his family during the renovations.  Alison's mother was also emotionally distant, and the family members rarely showed any affection toward each other, a burden that Alison dealt with throughout her life.  It wasn't until was in college and discovered her lesbianism, and wrote home to tell her parents about it, that she was clued in on a secret his parents had been trying to hide all those years: her father was also gay, and the changing cast of students and other young men he had around him as \\"helpers\\" for the renovations were really his lovers.  This revelation triggers a new attempt to get closer to him, and she does manage that to an extent, right before his accident, which she believes was really a premeditated act of suicide.<br /><br />A heartfelt and emotionally powerful story, told with great feeling and honesty by a talented author.  I had some doubts about dealing with a self-described \\"tragicomic\\" (the book is fully illustrated with six panels per each of the 232 pages), but the author is apparently so comfortable with that medium that it allows her to tell her story to its best, and provides amazing detail and clarity to the events she relates. Five stars out of five.s best, and provides amazing detail and clarity to the events she relates. Five stars out of five.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Every so often a group breaks out that doesn't really fit in one genre of music like Massive Attack back in the early nineties and Gorillaz,Gnarls Barkley is such a group(no relation to the famous ball player like I orginally thought).Gnarls Barkley is the combination of acclaimed music mixer Danger Mouse and singer Cee-Lo and St. Elsewhere is a collection of very fun short playful songs that somehow sound retro but fresh at the same time.It's impossible not to sing along to Crazy and Gone Daddy Gone or to smile at the craziness of Transformer or Necromancer.The Danger Mouse beats are cool but they don't overwhelm the songs letting Cee-Lo's voice and unique lyrics shine through.If you take a chance and get this one you won't be disappointed!
B000FFJ85I|4.0|When it comes to AFI, I'm very touchy about my opinions. As someone who's been listening to this band for years now, I have to say that even I have had my skepticisms about their transitions through the years. I was one of the fans who initially dismissed \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" as the horrid \\"sellout\\" album, but with time it eventually grew on me and I realized the true beauty in its nature. And \\"Decemberunderground\\" is no different from that album in any respect. Is this the best record they've ever written? Absolutely not. Does that mean that it's not good? Absolutely not. Just how I learned to expand my tastes and take new ideas into account with \\"Sing The Sorrow\\", most fans will have to with \\"Decemberunderground\\". While it's not at all perfect, it's definitely a nice stepping stone in the ever-evolving AFI sound, and something that fans who want the band to continue to grow and mature should appreciate. <br /> <br />First of all I was not expecting another \\"Black Sails In The Sunset\\" (commonly agreed upon as their best record) or \\"Art Of Drowning\\" when I popped \\"Decemberunderground\\" into my cd player. If you do, you're just going to be turned off immediately. Instead I just decided to let AFI take me to where they wanted to. And while it's true that they've dabbled further into experimental forms of music (there's tons of 80's influence in here), the core of what makes AFI special is still in tact. It's not going to redeem them as the saviors of music or anything like that, but \\"Decemberunderground\\" definitely has some things going for it. <br /> <br />The lead single \\"Miss Murder\\" at first seemed just like a \\"Girl's Not Grey\\" pt 2, in that it had its melodic, catchy chorus, and easily identifiable music. As much as I didn't really care for it at first, it has really grown on me now. There's been cries that the band has gone \\"emo\\", because of experimental pieces in \\"37mm\\" (which sounds like straight new wave) and \\"Love Like Winter\\" (which is full of synths and dancebeats). However just because the band is experimenting doesn't mean these songs are bad. Part of the thing I began to love about \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" was the way AFI could throw curveballs at us, and still make them work. \\"Decemberunderground\\" is no different. \\"Miss Murder\\" and \\"Summer Shudder\\" are upbeat, poppier pieces, which are destined to be the record's singles. For the older fans, \\"Kill Caustic\\" and \\"Affliction\\" are old-school tinged rockers that are sure to get the blood flowing. \\"The Interview\\" and \\"The Missing Frame\\" are two slower pieces that rely more on melody and atmosphere to attract the listener, rather than sheer force. And the album closer \\"Endlessly, She Said\\" (however cheesy the title may sound) is simply a great way to end the record. <br /> <br />Musically this is probably one of the most multi-talented bands in any musical genre. How many other bands do you know which can throw out hardcore pieces one second, then instantly transform into upbeat rockers and then to slow experimental works following that? I can probably count them on one hand. Davey's voice hasn't really gotten any better or worse, but it does sound a little different this time around. Maybe due to the production. However I love the screaming he experiments with on some of the songs. It brings back the memories of \\"Shut Your Mouth And Open Your Eyes\\". Jade's guitar playing once again takes the cake. He proves how influential he has been in shaping the band ever since he officially joined up on \\"Black Sails In The Sunset\\". Adam and Hunter continue to be a solid backing section, and Hunter's bass playing has never been so fully showcased as it is on this record. <br /> <br />\\"Decemberunderground\\" is probably going to take time for most listeners to appreciate. Like I said you can't go in expecting any of their previous records, because as it's been shown, AFI has never made the same record twice. While it's definitely different from anything the band has done in the past, and it's alittle rough around the edges, this is a bold record that proves AFI will continue to grow and expand their sound. And in almost all cases they will do it successfully. If you're an AFI fan, at least give this a listen before writing it off. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely not as bad as most are making it out to be. As it's been already evidenced, AFI are no longer \\"in the shadows, growing wings\\"; Now they're out flying high.
1400043662|5.0|This creative novel from the always facinating Haruki Murakami is more satisfying and focused than The Wind Up Bird Chronicle because it doesn't keep going off on tangents detailing the past of sevral quirky characters.This novel focuses on the experiences of 2 different characters:A 15 year old runaway who finds a new home in an old library and establishes a connection with the mysterious woman who runs it/A slow witted but charismatic old man who can communicate with cats who finds himself on a mysterious quest to find a stone that may open the door to a different world.There are plenty of fantasy elements but it's blended in so well with reality they don't overwhelm the characters.Murakami nicely sidesteps the rules of conventional storytelling,you don't just go from Point A to Point B and this creates an unpredictable reading experience.For such a creative story though it has the sweet nostalgic feel of a coming of age story at times,terrific sly humor and even a suspenseful climax every bit as creepy as a Stephen King book.A great one of a kind book that is the literary dream equivalent of a David Lynch movie.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Significant Other has a huge nostalgia factor for me. I still like most of the songs on this cd, even if Fred Durst's lyrics are totally lame. People can hate the band all they want, but just don't hate it because it's not the most talented thing you've ever heard in your life.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Let's face it...there's never going to be another Dark Side Of The Moon or The Wall and this new release from Pink Floyd singer guitar player David Gimour which takes a sweet laidback approach was initially diappointing to me.I miss the clever lyrics of Roger Waters,hell I miss the glory days of Pink Floyd before hip hop took over the world!However on subsequent listens this album really grew on me.With great mellow guitarwork ,Gilmour's smooth vocals it casts a tranquil spell.It'll never become a classic like most Pink Floyd releases but if you give it a chance it's a pleasantly satisfying often beautiful album.
0790732254|2.0|Think of this as the touring company of the original production, and they just happened to have a camera on-hand.  Elizabeth Taylor catches some of the outlines of Uta Hagen's original performance, but only crudely, and without the sense of a desperate, vulnerable creature beneath all of the crude bluster.  And just gaining weight and donning a fright wig do not a performance make.  As George, Richard Burton bring a more serious talent to bear on the character, but he seems to share playwright Edward Albee's illusion that George is a sensitive, superior creature telling necessary truths, instead of a vicious weakling who strikes at other's vulnerabilities as a way to stifle his feelings of self-loathing and failure.  As Nick, a smart fellow who may actually has something of value beneath his empty charm and predatory nature, George Segal is pleasant but suggests none of the intellect that would make him a college professor or the coldness that would make him the user that the script insists he is.  Worst of all is Sandy Dennis as Honey.  Melinda Dillon's peformance in the original Brodaway production was a small miracle, as a woman of substance emerges from beneath a soft and giggly exterior.  Dennis just plays the surface, and plays it badly; shrieking and blubbering and generally getting on your nerves.  You would never know from this performance that she was in fact a charming and gifted actress in films far less competent than this one.    The competence was guaranteed by Mike Nichols, who had made a name for himself as both a performer of original comedy with Elaine May and as a skillful director of other's comedies, from an off-Broadway production of THE KNACK (where he first worked with George Segal, who played the lady-killer Tolan) to the early plays of Neil Simon.  His directorial debut shows that he had a good grasp of cinematic technique and vocabulary, but also that he had a tendency to use it glibly; the film is full of visual echoes of more serious directors, but recycled as shock tactics and quick grabs for stylishness.  This glibness infects Haskell Wexler's photography, which goes for pockmarks on actor's faces and flashy lighting effects.  The script, by Ernest Lehman, is mostly a matter of rearranging a few scenes to allow for exteriors and blue-pencilling a few of the rawer profanities in the Edward Albee original.  What's lacking is the sense in the original that something profound is happening before our eyes--that sense may have been illusory, but as the original-cast recording on Caedmon Records (now out of print, alas) makes clear, the right production was full of it.  This smooth, compromised film never achieves a whisper of it
B000006045|4.0|Between the peaceful bliss of their release Protection and the meandering mess of 1000th Window Massive Attack released their darkest most satisfying album Mezzanine.Chances are if you've seen shows like House or Prison Break or movies like Flight of the Phoenix(all made 7 years after this album's release)you've heard the throbbing menacing beats from this album.Each song has a different vocalist but they all have in common slowbuilding dark claustophobic music.Definitely the perfect Halloween soundtrack.
B000002BQK|5.0|For her fifth traditional, non-holiday studio album, Mariah Carey raises the bar and creates a beautiful R&B-laced album.  But this album is much unlike most albums in this category.  This is a true work of art, a beautiful concept album at its best!! <br /> <br />Everything about this album is perfect!  From the lyrics to the music to the production to the sequencing, very, very little could ever be done to improve this record.  It is hands-down Mariah's best work, and actually my favorite record of all time! <br /> <br />Following a difficult marriage and painful divorce, Mariah digs much deeper than ever before, uncovering personal layers of herself listeners never would have imagined.  The album doesn't dwell on the bitterness of the divorce, but, rather, salvages the memories of the relationship.  Songs like \\"My All,\\" \\"The Roof,\\" \\"Breakdown,\\" and the title track reflect upon lost love, express the personal agony of ending a relationship, and recall bittersweet memories of past relationships. <br /> <br />Although some of the aftershocks of her break-up with Tommy Mattola are evident in 'Butterfly,' the record does not focus solely on the topic.  The album also consists of catchy, ear-candy tunes (\\"Honey\\", \\"Babydoll\\"), well-crafted love ballads (\\"Fourth of July\\", \\"Whenever You Call\\"), and beautiful personal reflections on life (the closing number \\"Outside\\", and the exceptional \\"Close My Eyes\\"). <br /> <br />The musicality of the album is top-notch.  Each song is very distinct from the rest, leaving the listener with a different feel for each track.  However, while diverse, the tracks work in unison to create a complete work of art.   <br /> <br />Mariah also leaves behind a good bit of the pop dance and ballads of her earlier career and ventures into the R&B territory, a place she had been wanting to explore years prior to this release.  The result is beyond satisfactory.  A smooth, more dynamic artist is born, and success is written all over this move.  The music of this album is pure ear candy.  But that's definitely not the only reason this album remains so superb. <br /> <br />Lyrically, this album is astonishing.  Some of the best song lyrics I've ever heard exist in the tracks of this album.  If you are not a Mariah Carey fan, don't let this hinder you from checking out this gem.  You may be surprised by what you hear.  This album appeals to non-lambs as well. <br /> <br />This album is one of the most vulnerably personal and exquisitely crafted albums I've ever heard.  The only thing else I can say about it is that I will forever be waiting for the day when Mariah creates another album as stunning as this one.  Trust me, if I could give it infinity stars, I would!!  It really is THAT awesome! <br /> <br />The songs... <br /> <br />1.  \\"Honey\\"  10/10:  An excellent choice for the first single!  The beat, the lyrics, the music, and especially the video, are all hot!  A smart, sexy summer single, and my second favorite Mariah #1 (the first being \\"Hero\\") and possibly her best upbeat song ever! <br /> <br />2.  \\"Butterfly\\"  10/10:  A gorgeous, bittersweet ballad co-written with her long-time collegue, Walter A.  The lyrics and music are beautiful, and I love the background vocalists! <br /> <br />3.  \\"My All\\"  9/10:  A very nice, wistful ballad about lost love.  I would have picked other songs on this CD to go to #1 before this one, particularly because I like their lyrics more, but it's great! <br /> <br />4.  \\"The Roof\\"  10/10:  One of my all-time favorite Mariah songs (and my second favorite video, right after \\"Honey).  It's so catchy, with clever, nostalgic lyrics, and a hauntingly compelling tune.  Awesome!!! <br /> <br />5.  \\"Fourth of July\\"  9/10:  A nice love ballad, sounding very much like a continuation of \\"Underneath the Stars\\" from 'Daydream.'  I play it multiple times every July 4th! (lol) <br /> <br />6.  \\"Breakdown\\"  10/10:  I love this song!  It is very possibly Mariah's best hip-hop collaboration ever!Bone Thugs 'N Harmony add so much to this track!  An excellent mid-tempo number with very clever lyrics about the painful aftermath of a break-up.  It's ridiculous that this song was so overlooked when it was released!! <br /> <br />7.  \\"Babydoll\\"  9/10:  A cool, smooth, mid-tempo R&B ditty with excellent lyrics by Mariah & Missy Elliott.  Works very well after \\"Breakdown.\\" <br /> <br />8.  \\"Close My Eyes\\"  12/10!!!!:  I break the rules and give this song two more points because it is Mariah's best song ever, and probably my all-time favorite song!  A very personal, reflective ballad with THE BEST LYRICS EVER!!!  Mariah doesn't overdo it here, singing quite soft and beautifully, a side of her I wish I could hear more often.  OUTSTANDING!!!!!  Words cannot express how much I love this song!!! <br /> <br />9.  \\"Whenever You Call\\"  10/10:  A beautiful love song!  Classic Mariah.  It will bring tears to your eyes.  I want it played in my wedding! <br /> <br />10.  \\"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\\"  9/10:  A lot like 1995's \\"Daydream Interlude,\\" this dance version of \\"Butterfly\\" brings back the lyrics from the original's chorus and effectively bridges the gap between \\"Call\\" and \\"The Beautiful Ones.\\"  Works very well. <br /> <br />11.  \\"The Beautiful Ones\\"  10/10:  A stunning cover of Prince's original hit with guest vocalist Dru Hill.  One of Mariah's best covers!!  Some people may complain about the song being 7 minutes long, but I love it that way!!  The longer it plays, the better it gets.  Wonderful! <br /> <br />12.  \\"Outside\\"  10/10:  A very passionate (and heartbreaking!) soul ballad about never feeling like you belong.  Mariah digs very deep into herself for these lyrics, and many listeners will be able to relate.  Her vocals are awesome, and the lyrics are superb and somewhat reminiscant of \\"Looking In\\" from 'Daydream.'  An excellent closing number!!
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Between the white market of the offical arms trade we have the people that sell illegally and semi-legally weapons. This is an interesting story of these gun runners today and its effects today.     It had a ring of truth to it. The story was well written.     The acting was good. Nicolas Cage in particular.
B000001GXL|3.0|I have old LP and cassette versions of the Concerto #1 and something has gone wrong, in my view, with this CD version.  First, the audience applause is gone altogether, just blanked out--a shame, it seems to me.  Second and more importantly, Michelangeli's wonderfully wild dynamic range has been dampened, modified, and noticeably limited, while the orchestra is now bolder.  The choice of balance is regrettable here:  Deutsche Grammophon has shortchanged Michelangeli of his poetic power; we no longer fully hear his crashing chords and exquisite faint passages, the jocularity and impishness  of this early masterpiece by Beethoven.  I bought the CD with high hopes; try listening to the original DG versions and I do think you'll hear what I mean.  But then it is still Michelangeli,  still stirring and blindingly accurate and memorable.
B00001OH7P|5.0|David Bowie has always been ahead of his time and this release is no exception.  Bowie's sexual ambiguity and song-themes are still being challenged by lesser-artists and pundits, but has anyone else stepped up to the plate in the last 30 years?  It Ain't Easy... Nope, not even today.  I can but imagine how it must have been for young David in his early days.  Maybe the whole Ziggy persona was the only way anyone would have given him a chance?  I digress, I believe Ziggy was the epitome of what Bowie's stood for all of these years.   <br /> <br />The songs.  The lyrics.  The story.  The concept.  They're all beautiful.  All great.  But more, the musicianship of the \\"Spiders from Mars\\" is beyond their time as well.  The Beatles flirted with touchy subjects in the 60s after first becoming \\"teen idols,\\" but has anyone really taken it to such a level that Bowie has attempted?   <br /> <br />Listnening to this album.. it's hard to think of it in the context of the early 70s.  It is tinged with elements from the 50s, 60s, 80s and most surprisingly, elements that I believe have yet to come to fruition.   <br /> <br />David Bowie has always seemed a bit spacey, but even today he seems ahead of his time.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This show is absolutely great, its worth every minute spent watching it.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Medical Dramas really; I never watched ER or Scrubs or anything like that. But I loved Grey's Anatomy.<br /><br />The mix of drama and comedy and realism was done excellently.<br /><br />I myself am a medical intern, and i assure you much of what you see is realistic about the medical world. They may not get the medecine right 100% of the time, but they do get it right! In fact they do it so well that i find myself giving my own superiors quotes and clinical facts from the show.<br /><br />They also give a pretty true portrayal of an interns life.. it is that hectic and that non-stop and the doctors are really that gruelling if not more so.<br /><br />Yet we still find time (if even it means making more than 24hrs in a day) to get caught up in all the drama of surrounding life.<br /><br />If there's any show to put on your must see list its this!!

I actualy went out and bought the golden hum by remy zero, gotta admit it was a good buy<br /><br />anyway i'm done, cheers everyone
B000A59PMO|4.0|I have been a fan of Veronica Mars since she uttered the words \\"Go Pirates!\\" in the season one premiere. Like many of the reviews here have already stated, the show is excellent. Writing, plots, balance of comedy and drama, all are great. If you have not watched the show you, should tune in to the CW this fall and watch season three. You cannot go wrong watching this show. I think USA Weekend Magazine said it best: Veronica Mars is \\"Nancy Drew-meets-90210 drama\\".    However, I cannot state as much for the DVD set for season one. It leaves a lot to be desired, particularly in the special features section. But it is still a good value for any fan wanting to catch up or simply add this to their collection.    The box itself is a beautiful box (pictures provided by yours truly). It's thinner than most six-disc sets. The DVD holder that the box contains has the same picture as the outside of the box.     It unfolds like a book, two panels facing you, with some Veronica snapshots and some small quotes from reviews of the show. Each side then flips open once again, so you have all four panels facing you at once (not like many sets, which turn like pages of a book). From left to right the panels contain: (1) the DVD booklet; (2) discs one and two (with Veronica and dad pictured respectively); (3) discs three and four (Logan, then Duncan); (4) and finally disc five and disc six (Wallace then Weevil). So, DVD booklet, then two discs to each remaining box panel. On the panels, if the discs and booklet are removed, there is a wide shot of Neptune High School covering all the panels.    The DVDs themselves are kind of layered over each other. The top disc of each panel covering the bottom half of the bottom disc; so you have to take out the top disc to get the bottom disc.    The DVD booklet is patterned after those old black and white marbled notebooks everyone used to use in highschool. Inside are pictures of the cast and the characters they play. Following that,  are the episodes, with the writer, director and original air date listed. Following that is a small, one-or-two sentence description  of the show. Each page has small snapshots of the characters.    The layout is very nice, and incorporating the highschool student theme into the layout is very nice.     Popping the DVDs into your DVD player (or PC), you get the title menu, then the main menu. It features some funky rock music and the menu options, with a slide show of some shots from the show playing.     The last disc has the one special feature included on the disc, It features just over 22 minutes of unaired scenes. They play as one chapter, in chronological order of the show. Before each scene, the name of the episode it was supposed to appear in flashes on the screen, followed by a title-like quote of what the scene is based on.    There are no complaints about the audio or video quality of the DVDs.    All in all, it is a very nice set, IF you are just buying the DVD set because you are late to viewing the show and need to catch up. If you are buying for special features, you will be disappointed. And if you are buying the box set just because you are supporting the show, then thirty five bucks is not too shabby a price for a dvd set like this.    Lastly, go Pirates!
B00006SFBD|5.0|What can i say, opeth is one hell of a kickass band. Heard about them last year from a friend and immediately read some reviews on the official site. Had to check them out right away and my god was i pleased with the result.<br /><br />The first song i ever heard was masters apprentices and i fell i love with that song right away, soon went out and bought deliverance and nearly dropped my jaw. That album has got to be one of the best i have ever heard.<br /><br />Wreath - Great way to start the album off, nice and heavy, great guitar work with clean vocals at parts throughout, still don't know how mikael does it but he's damn good at it.<br /><br />Deliverance - Starts off heavy and quickly slows down to a nice clean vocal presentation eventually kicking it back up to heavy riffs and fast drums. My fav part has got to be around 7 mins or so right to the end, that ending part was sick.<br /><br />A Fair Judgement - no screaming at all and some very nice clean vocals, very good track and a nice break from the growling and screaming.<br /><br />For Absent Friends - Very nice change to the long songs before it, mellow and peaceful only building up to the next one.<br /><br />Masters Apprentices - Starts out nice and heavy and keeps it that way but with all long opeth songs breaks down into clean vocals with mellow guitar and drums<br /><br />By The Pain I See In Others - Longest track on the album, one of the heaviest as well, great end to a great album<br /><br />Go out and buy it
B00006RCNW|5.0|The Series: <br /> <br />Vic Mackey is \\"a different kind of cop\\"--one with a morality different than yours or mine. He's intensely loyal to those he cares about... but don't get on his bad side. <br /> <br />The Shield is about the adventures of Mackey and the other officers and detectives of the fictional Farmington District of Los Angeles. It is a gritty, in-your-face cop drama which pulls no punches and asks questions most other cop genre shows don't even think about. In its first season, The Shield deals with (among other things), gang warfare, a serial killer and a potential riot. Every episode is laced with several subplots, every one compelling, filled with colorful characters. The main characters of The Shield are, without exception, deep, interesting and incredibly well-acted. Seriously--these characters rock. <br /> <br />In terms of quality, The Shield not only sits atop \\"cop shows\\" but television in general. Most series take a little while to get on their feet--often, the first season of a show isn't as good as the ones to come. Not true, here. The Shield knows exactly what it's about from episode one, moment one. It hits the ground running hard. Watch the first five minutes of the first episode, and you'll know that this show is quality, quality, quality. <br /> <br />The DVD Release: <br /> <br />Every episode (Read that again: *Every Episode*) has an optional commentary featuring, essentially, the entire cast (depending on who is featured in the episode). The special features on the final disk has a ton of material, including audition tapes (!), featurettes and a seemingly endless reel of deleted scenes. It's awesome--one of the best DVD releases I've found. <br /> <br />Warnings: <br /> <br />Amazon.com has Glenn Close listed as one of the actresses, here. She does later appear in the series, but is *not* in Season One. <br /> <br />This almost shouldn't have to be said, but The Shield is an intensely adult series. Parents' discretion is necessary, here. <br /> <br />In General: <br /> <br />This is one of the best series that television has to offer. Even if you normally have no interest in the cop show genre, you owe it to yourself to give this explosive program a try.
B000002GGU|5.0|Being that I hear most of the music i like from dad and the radio I tend to give most albums he has a listen to, just to see what i think.<br /><br />Gotta say this is a great rock album, lots of catchy tunes and some nice guitar riffs all throughout this one.<br /><br />My fav song on the album is summer of 69, i love the lyrics on that one alot.<br /><br />Anyone that likes good rock tunes with a nice upbeat rythem to them should defintely give this one a listen to, you won't be dissapointed
B000050HTO|5.0|Bob Dylan has always been amongst my favourite singers.I like his electric guitar period with Highway 61 revisited being my best.This double disc compilation is very good and gives a nice overview to his career.Highly recommended.
B00004RD54|5.0|This is by far the best effort by an underrated artist. If you have ever felt distance from life and a certain amount of disdain, depression and downright get to the point fatalism. You will love this dive. Having been a heroin addict for seven years of my life, this musical dissertation on the lower end of human behaviour really strikes home. I love the song Heroin, almost as much as I love the drug. It takes you through the highs and lows in a seductive sort of way. From the time the spike goes in and all the misery goes out, you are there. A completely honest musical fiasco. Raw and untamed. Just like most who are addicted. An honest effort. God bless Lou Reed.
038533348X|1.0|This book is absolutely horrible. Seriously, it's hideous. I can't stand to have this book in my house. I buried it along with my dead cat (meow) (that's an inside joke for you three CC fans out there).
B00095MLGC|5.0|I discovered Porcupine Tree via their \\"Deadwing\\" album (2005). It got a little bit of air-play on my local radio station with the heavy rocker \\"Shallow\\". At my first listen I was mesmerized! I could not believe a modern rock band was playing this type of music.<br /><br />I read some of the reviews on Amazon.com and then bought \\"In Absentia\\". Again, fantastic, incredable, prog-rock. Since then I have begun to dig back into their earlier works. \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\" was next. It just kept getting better. The Snapper Records Remasters were not only great sounding, but a real bargain.<br /><br />This week I received \\"Up the Downstair\\" in the mail. It too is a fantastic collection of songs. Not as \\"heavy\\" as Absentia or Deadwing, but very cool. I can tell you right now, Burning Sky is destined for my Best of Porcupine Tree mix, along with the title track and Always Never.<br /><br />After even more research to figure out when these different albums were actually recorded/released, I realized that the bonus disc entitled \\"Staircase Infinities\\" was previously released as an EP with very limited quantities available. It is essentially leftovers from the recording sessions for Up the Downstair. But, by no means are these \\"throw-aways\\" or filler. They are mostly instrumentals though, but thats cool. I like the Staicase Infinities tracks even more than the over-all Up the Downstair songs! All this for only $14. And you can dub both discs onto one cd for the car. Up the Downstair is a little over 48 minutes, and Staircase Infinities is another 30 minutes.<br /><br />Now I'm thinking about ordering some of their \\"Live\\" material such as the Warszawa cd recorded Live in Poland 2001, or \\"Coma Divine\\" which has also been remastered and expanded by Snapper Records of the UK.<br /><br />I'm very suprised that there are over 140 reviews for Deadwing, showing how popular it is, and only a dozen or so for most of the back catalog? When I found out Porcupine Tree had been making music for the past 15 years, I was floored! Steven Wilson and company are easily THE Best band that no one has heard of!<br /><br />Keep spreading the news...making music for the past 15 years, I was floored! Steven Wilson and company are easily THE Best band that no one has heard of! <br /> <br />Keep spreading the news...
B000929AJQ|4.0|This album was good but really mainstream and almost bordered along the lines of pop rock. It took me awhile to get into it but I do genuinly like it.<br /><br />Personally instead of this I'd recommend NIN fans to get into TCR @ t-c-r.net check out their album the chrome recordings which features ex-nin nails Chris Vrenna. Amazing, Trent would have been proud.
1400032717|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I like that information was put into the story so I learned things which is always a plus.  I found the story simple but fun.  The ending was perfect and did not leave you wondering.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is my favorite album of all time. Linkin Park is the most talented group of musicans to ever make music. My two favorite tracks on this cd are Papercut and Pushing Me Away. Two masterpieces. Love the pain in Chesters voice. This cd is raw emotion, which to me is music.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|First of all I wanna clear suttin up...My crew is Blood Money Productions and we have had this name for over a year so I nor did any1 else take the name from this cd... <br /> <br />I thought this cd was aiight but nowhere close to being as good as old Mobb material. The only misstep they got on this album is trying to go pop. Otherwise, it's aiight. <br /> <br />Top Tracks: <br /> <br />Smoke It <br />Put Em In Their Place <br />The Infamous <br />It's Alright <br />Pearly Gates <br /> <br />myspace.com/getthebloodmoney
B000EULJLU|5.0|Music in general usually falls into this predictable category: sing a tune, throw in some guitar and sing the same tune again. Not Tool, they do their own thing and the music is all over the place (in a good way.) I am not a Tool fanboy, I heard Vicarious on satellite radio and I thought \\"Wow, someone finally gets it!\\" I immediately picked up the album and was pleasantly surprised track 1 was not the only good song. This album puts you on an emotional journey - it's hard, it's soft, it's fast, it's slow and the more I listen the better it gets. I have listened to it all the way through 5 times now and when I hit play again it seems as if a new song was magically inserted - it's that deep. I am a picky music listener, dont leave reviews and am not easily pleased. My message is clear - pick up this CD, you wont regret it.
B000002LQR|5.0|The landmark 1991 album that rocked the charts and made platinum is without a doubt the BEST Rhcp album ever. The sound is solid, and the music is rocking. I understand that some of the songs are about shagging, but forget it. The lyrics on all of the songs rock, and show a deep soul for the Peppers. My all time favs on this album are...basically everything, though Im not all that partial to Funky Monks and Naked in the Rain (both great songs anyways). Everybodys favorite Under the Bridge is here as well as the rocking Give it Away and Suck My kiss. Besides that, you have The Power of Equality and the amazing solo on If you have to Ask....anyway I could go on for ages. This record rocks. Buy it today.
1932907009|3.0|It's a good read with many useful things in it. If you're going to write a romantic comedy, then yes this is the book for you, but if you want to write something different, look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Like I said, it's worth reading, and has a couple of good tools, but nothing you probably haven't read in someother \\"how to\\" book. <br /> <br />The thing that pissed me off about this book is in one section he brags about working with Steven Spielberg (yes I would too) but he says one rule in writing a screenplay is not to use the media (which he learned from Spielberg) and that this rule would never be seen broken in a Spielberg movie. Ummm... has he not seen \\"War of the worlds\\" or even \\"Close Encounters\\" where Spielberg clearly breaks this rule?!?! But yet he goes on to diss M. Night Shyamalan's \\"Signs\\" for breaking this rule and saying it made it a worse movie.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I had waited for almost four months until i finally had the honour of hearing this album. It blew my socks off. An almost complete combo of the EXCELLENT Blood Sugar Sex Magik and the amazing Californication, the band seems to be becoming more complex after the blah By the Way. Flea is slapping again, and Anthony's vocals have improved so much. Chad shines as well, but John Frusciante is the driving force behind this album. On Turn It Again he gave me one of the best solos I have ever heard. Key tracks are: Dani California, Charlie, Shes only 18, Slow Cheetah, Torture me, Especially in Michigan, Warlocks, Wet Sand, Desecration Smile, Tell me Baby, 21st Century, She Looks to me, Readymade, Make you feel better, So much I, Storm in a Teacup, We believe, Turn it again and finally Death of a Martian. <br />But here comes the \\"but\\" part. <br />There just seems to be something missing, I just can't find out what is though. The mellow songs on this album (Snow, Stadium Arcadium, and Hey) are very lacking, not being up to snuff with the melodic songs off of Californication and By the Way. Also, it seems to be just a few songs too many, but hey, buy the album anyway. It is truely amazing and is one of my fav albums of all time. Buy this album and you will not regret it.
B000BZ99WY|3.0|Lt.Gen. Dallaire's account of his tenure as UNAMIR Force commander is a good read but I do not think it quite hits the mark for which he aimed.  His accounts are riveting but I think his military experience sometimes hampers the re-telling and the thrust of the story, how evil genocide is, gets lost.  He wants to retell everything and so you sometimes get lost in his mission's minutiae rather than the real point: Evil prevails when good people do nothing.   <br /> <br />Notably, the book is written along the lines of a Unit Log.  Our forces maintain them and I am sure the Canadians as well as all professional armies.  This is my main gripe about the book.  It is written in a straight-forward, chronological order much as you would expect a Unit Log to be kept.  He does flesh out the events rather than getting the standard \\"1900 hrs. Unit came under fire.\\"  He does have a good writing style and I like how he explains fully everything that occurred even if he does not need to retell everything.  His telling does often get emotional and rather than detract, I think it adds to the story since you would consider someone an absolute monster who would clinically describe genocide.  He stays mildly objective to give creedence to his arguments but not so much that you feel he is detached. <br /> <br />You do however, like Dallaire, become detached near the end of the book.  Not to say the book is uninteresting but as Dallaire himself becomes sensitized to the killings his writing becomes more clinical. So towards the end you lose a visceral feel for what he describes since he has also.  That and you have read very gruesome descriptions already so hearing about countless bodies has less impact than his account of finding what he thought was an infant that survived the murdering.  <br /> <br />Another problem with the book that I do not think Dallaire intended, is what exactly he is arguing against.  It is rare that anyone would argue for genocide but his story revolves aroundgenocide itself but also the detachment of the developed world form the suffering of the developing one.  This is at least as big a theme of the book as the death itself.  Also, during the civil war and the genocide occurring alongside it in Rwanda, Dallaire is constantly running back and forth to meetings, cabling the UN hq in NY, producing reports and making phone calls.   <br /> <br />I know that Dallaire did all he could through official channels but he constantly says that it was inaction and bureaucracy that aided the killing.  I do not wish to diminish his heroic role but he seems to think that action could only come from \\"others\\" and that he needed permission to act morally and intervene.  It would have been suicidal on his part I admit; the book is about genocide but is more of a case study in UN ineptitude and moral relativism as well as the crushing bureaucracy it has become.  His command and actions are prime examples and he, like any thinking caring person, begins to see this.  This is, as I agree with him, mainly the result of the actions of the permanent members of the security council.  His lesson from all this is not to encourage more participation by individual nations and action, but give more power and support to the UN.  It has shown itself to be nothing more than a pawn of the richest countries so why would more of the same produce a better result. <br /> <br />One part of Dallaire's book that I was surprised at was his political perceptions.  He shows a great deal of insight into the racist/colonial undertones that were present in his mission and its hindrance.  He also talks at length about the \\"Somalia Complex\\" and how nations will tend to do the right thing only if it serves their interests.  The clinical account of the U.S. Army statistician to him on the ratio of Americans killed versus locals murdered to make it worth the U.S.' time, treasure, and blood is one of the many instances Dallaire shows about the West's moral relativism towardslife.  Such was the case in Rwanda, a small land-locked country with no natural resources in the middle of Africa.  Stopping Genocide there would not have served any of the more cynical interests of the 1st world.  His depiction of the Tunisians, Ghanaians, and Ethiopian peacekeepers were touching and inspiring.  hindered by their own domestic problems and lack of wealth they still volunteered to help out those worse-off.  His disgust with Europe and the West was equally emotional.    <br /> <br />I know I gave this book three stars.  This does not mean that I disliked the book but that it has some problems.  I think everyone should read this book.  My gripes were about the execution of the book versus its conception.  Meaning that I saw in this book equal parts diary of hell and insider's critique on the failure of the UN rather than it being one or the other.  He freely admits that he and his mission were failures but that some good can come from studying them.  I agree and hope, as Dallaire does, that the world will live up to the slogan \\"Never again.\\"*  Though his mission proves that the caveat means \\"at least, not until the next time.\\" <br />
0446577383|3.0|I'm a Baldacci fan and have read all his books. The Camel Club involves four seemingly harmless old men who meet every so often to discuss governmental conspiracy theories. One day the witness a murder that puts them smack dab in the middle of a conspiracy. To paraphrase Barbossa from Pirates Of The Caribbean, \\"You better start believing in conspiracy theories. You're in one.\\"  The central theme is a terrorist plot to kidnap the President. The book starts out slow and plods along for the first 300 pages. Baldacci uncharacteristically gets very political and preachy which was a total turnoff. It's clear that the bad guy is the American government and the good guys are the poor mistreated terrorists. These are not your average Al Queda types, but rather simple peaceful muslims who were terrorized by America and were forced to take these actions to protect Islam. They practice a new form of compassionate terrorism where they are willing to sacrifice their lives but go to extremes not to kill a single American. They actually fire tranquilizer darts at the Secret Service rather than real bullets and use incediary bombs to destroy vehicles rather than scrapnel-laced explosives so as to prevent civilian casualties. It's a stupid premise that has no basis in reality and Baldacci spends way too much time spewing his political views of how evil America is. But in all fairness, the book picks up speed in the last 100 pages and is hard to put down. While it is totally unrealistic, it did get entertaining in the end. <br /> <br />
0446310786|5.0|My 13 year old niece was looking for new books to read.  Something challenging.  I sent her all the classics: Steinbeck, Tolstoy, etc.  She called me and said \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" changed her life. <br /> <br />So I had to reread the book.  I now understand why.  We live in California.  And this book struck a chord in my niece which will stay with her always. <br /> <br />Some books are timeless.
0684833395|3.0|I'm probably one of the few who doesn't think this book is outstanding. Don't get me wrong, as literary art \\"Catch-22\\" excels but I judge a book not on artistic merits but simply by how well I enjoyed reading it. \\"Catch-22\\" is laugh out loud funny sometimes but it is rather convoluted and hard to follow. Rather than a flowing narrative, it is simply jumbled military anecdotes that follow no timeline. An event or person that may be mentioned early in the book isn't described until later in the book. But what it comes down to is that I could have stopped at the end of each chapter with no impulse to read further to see what happens next. The wonderful slapstick absurdity that makes the novel special is surrounded by some rather dull sections and while most of the characters are silly and comical almost none are likable. I can see why \\"Catch-22\\" is considered a classic but I found it partly dull and only partly delicious. <br /> <br />
0793542049|5.0|I have been using this book in my teaching practice for the last several years. I have met Ed at a NAMM show and told him I am responsible for the sale of hundreds of these books! I don't use many books, but this one is so well laid out, the chronology of the material is very smart. By the time you get to the end, you should understand how to use all 12 notes for most basic chords. I remind my students that although the reading material is all blues and jazz oriented, this is about note choice. These concepts are applicable to any style of music. Playing a walking line with a different note on every beat is great practice, even some imtermediate players have issues there.  <br /> <br />The book is divided into 2 sections. The Root-5th relationship is established and from there he sticks different approach tones in between. Chromatic, Dominant and Scale for 1 note approaches and a double chromatic approach tossed in. <br />The second half introduces 3rds and 7ths and the diatonic modes, applying them as scale fragments and arpeggios, and even some more advanced harmony - thinking of IIm7-V7 chords as one sound, indirect resolution approaches and longer chromatic tensions. Finally, it has plenty of \\"blank slate\\" standard chord progressions in the appendix to apply each technique as it is learned. It is also a good introduction to reading as all the exercises are quarter note values, except #1 - half notes. <br />All in all, highly recommended if you want to learn to create lines that make sense.
0671027387|4.0|An oft-maligned NASA discovers a meteorite encased in Milne Glacier at the North Pole. Then scientists discover that this meteorite contains a shocking revelation that will send shockwaves through Washington, DC and affect a Presidential election. But soon the scientist are on the run for their lives as they uncover an incredible deception.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced and complex thriller with plenty of twists and turns. It's an easy and exciting read. Brown claims that all the technology in the book really exists but I seriously doubt it. There are a few other instances where the reader must suspend belief but those moments hardly seem to matter. I still found the book highly enjoyable.
B0007OCG56|2.0|Disappointing.  I agree with the professional reviewer on this site who said that Adam Sandler was in over his head in this role.  He does poorly in it.  Why is he played as such a sap?  Why is it that you want to smack him every time he fails to assert himself?<br /><br />I don't buy the multi-cultural nonsense either, the big deal about the Hispanic daughter losing her culture.  What kind of issue is that?  What kind of moron thought that was a big issue?  Oh hell, you don't want to hang out with Anglos, you don't want to go to a prestigious school, you just want to live in the Barrio.  Oh give me a break.  It's idiocy.  A non-issue for dummies.<br /><br />The film is simply a big flop.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Since the Pilot episode until Devil's Trap I have been hooked. Dean (Jensen Ackles) is HOT!!!!! The show has the right amount of thrills, chills, and laughs. I always watch it with the lights off. This show is AWESOME and I can't wait for Season 2 to start and Season 1 to come out on DVD. The music that they play \\"ROCKS\\"!! I have gotten many family members and friends hooked on this show and I hope that you will get hooked too, because this is THE BEST SHOW ON TV!!!    P.S. I LOVE the 67 Chevy Impala, it fits Dean's personality!!
006054094X|2.0|1421 is a wonderful story. It is a rip-roaring tale of how Chinese marines sailed around the world, discovering the Americas before Columbus. They braved terrible weather to bring back goods from all around the world, only returning to China to be betrayed by their own government who burnt their ships and forbade them from journeying out again. Yes, there are even bad guys in this book! <br /> <br />Unfortunately this really IS just a story. The Chinese admiral, Zheng He, did journey around Asia, possibly even to Africa. But Gavin Menzies has not convinced anyone from the professional historical community in saying the Chinese sailors went to the Americas in the 15th century. To date no one with any historical academic credibility has supported his views. The principle \\"authorities\\" he refers to these days is Liu Gang, a Chinese lawyer who is making a lot of money from pretending a fake Chinese map is a copy of one from 1418, and Gunnar Thompson, a man of many talents that has no academic qualifications in History or Cartography. <br /> <br />This contrasts with criticism from individuals such as Dr Geoff Wade (National University of Singapore), Commander José Manuel Malhão Pereira (Portugese Navy), Professor T H Barrett (School of Oriental and African Studies, London), Dr. Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and Robert Finlay. Their comments, and those of others, are crucial in understanding how and why Menzies is so wrong. If you search the internet, you will be surprised to see the severe lack of any credible support for Menzies, only many people rubbishing his work. <br /> <br />The main problem is that the more Menzies is criticised, the wilder his claims become. He now maintains that the Maori people are not a race, merely the children of Chinese concubines, who came over with Chinese miners to Australia, and slaves who rebelled. Doubtless Menzies believes in Goebbels' words that \\"people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it\\". <br /> <br />Some people defend Menzies because they think he's being attacked because historians think he's not \\"one of them\\". But he is no Simon Schama. His casual attitude towards History is damaging the cause of accessible historical works. What is Menzies' argument that there's no real evidence for these trips? That the files were all burnt! Oh, wait, now he's saying they're buried somewhere. No offence to Mr Menzies, but this reminds me of children saying \\"I don't have to prove I'm right - YOU prove I'm wrong\\". And then he ignores people when they challenge his theories. <br /> <br />Buy this book if you want to read some fiction. Don't if you're interested in real History......
B0000931QA|5.0|I will keep this simple since i could write for days about how great this album is.This is a true masterwork. If you are thinking about buying this album stop thinking and do it.This album never gets old,It will pull you in,And leave itself permantly ingrained in your head (Every time I hear a motorized car window the first thing that pops in my head is \\"kill her thats all you have to do \\" )There is no need to even argue what are the best songs on the album , Their all great.Even after 18 years of listening i still stand in awe at how good this album is.But beware if you have an I.Q. lower than room temperature than this one is not for you.
B0001XALTG|5.0|There are few movies which warrant a 5 star rating from me. If I could give Trainspotting 10 stars I would.<br /><br />For me, a movie has to stay with you long after the credits roll. It has to make you think and feel. It has to subject you to a roller coaster ride of emotions. Trainspotting delivers the goods.<br /><br />So many have described the movie and what it's about, I am not going to do that. Suffice it to say that the movie will make you cry, piss-your-pants laugh, think, cheer wildly and discuss it with your friends years after you first saw it. I remember having the nagging feeling that I needed to take a shower after seeing it. THAT, my friends, is the sign of a GREAT movie.<br /><br />Another great feature of Trainspotting is the soundtrack. It features many of my favorites, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, etc. The soundtrack is perfect for this movie. Everytime I hear Lust For Life by Iggy Pop now, I automatically think of Trainspotting. THAT is another sign of a great movie.<br /><br />If only it would get a Criterion release....
B00005JNRY|4.0|I just watched this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised--I mean, I thought it was going to be cute, but nothing special. <br /> <br />And STILL Pixar pulled off another win. <br /> <br />The lack of wall-to-wall advertising worried me--maybe less work had gone into this than into other 3D movies that were currently taking precedent.  After all, THE INCREDIBLES nearly smothered one with advertising, and it turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time!  But, I was proved wrong.  As soon as the first black screen of the movie showed, my doubts and fears were alleviated.  PIXAR still has a whole lot left in them, and will for many, many years.  This movie is clever, interesting, and more and more it seems to be the kind of breather I need to get away from all of the crude humor and cheap, cruel laughs that most movies resort to nowadays. <br /> <br />If you want to see a good movie, just skip Over the Hedge and go watch Cars.  It's refreshing to see an animation studio making good use of animation again.
B000F5FNSE|5.0|My son and I just finished reading \\"The Lightning Thief\\" by Rick Riordan. It's a terrific tale of a modern-day 12-year-old boy who must solve a mystery intertwined with Greek mythology. It's face-paced, well-written and highly engaging. With chapter titles like \\"I Accidentally Vaporize My Pre-Algebra Teacher,\\" what 5th or 6th grader wouldn't be just a little intrigued. <br /> <br />The author is a native Texan who taught junior high for 14 years. Along the way, Riordan wrote mystery novels set in Texas for adults. But he really uses his understanding of the pre-adolescent mind to create characters with whom kids can identify. For instance, the main character has ADHD, and his side-kick has trouble with her blended family. Those elements are not central to the action, but really flesh out the characters. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, teachers might like Riordan's book because he includes a list of discussion questions and activities at the back. <br /> <br />If you child likes fantasy, action, and playful banter, he or she will enjoy The Lightning Thief.
B000F9UE4I|1.0|One of my favorite bands produced one of my least favorite records of all time, this is not the Scream you've grown to love, the songs are poorly written and executed even worse, the guest appearances don't help at all [except Warren Ellis] this is such a poor attempt, it is an embarrassment however the b-sides to Counrty Girl contain the elemants that were promised to be within this record, a few decent tunes on this disc but nothing mind blowing whatsoever, save your money... unless you wanna hear they're attempt at being Jet mixed with the Waterboys(?) [hideous yes, but I think that was the plan] hopefully they will spend more than 10 days in the studio next time just being themselves, maybe even write some real tunes... I really hope anyways cuz I believe they can do much better.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|I was by no means an AFI fan, until this album. It is just pure gold. Every song has its own dynamics and spirit. By far this is one of the best albums I have listened to in a long time. Our music today seems to be in crappy quantity. But AFI gives a sounding declaration of quality to the punk/alt rock scene.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Well...this movie definitely grows on a person!  I loved the characters and the soundtrack is AWESOME...as an 80's girl I thoroughly enjoyed the tunes.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with an offbeat sense of humor and an appreciation for the dysfunctional...  :)
0385510454|1.0|Grisham must be starting to get like S. King - mailing it in for the check.  This book has the same buildup for lame climax as the last 10 King novels.  If you liked The Firm, or any of the other Grisham \\"chase books\\", you'll be disappointed by this one.  Can I have my money back?
B000EOTAM6|5.0|After about 10 minutes into Aeon Flux, I wasn't sure whether I was going to like the film. For the next 20 minutes, you could say \\"I strandled the fence\\" between liking it and turning it off. There were occasional hints that Aeon Flux would fall over to the cheesy side of the fence, but it didn't. By the end of the movie, I was in love with the story, characters, action, and its twists and turns. This is a must see for sci-fi/fantasy fans. Those outside this realm might not care for Aeon Flux. I will buy the DVD for this movie. My lower ratings for \\"must buy\\" reflect the fact that non-sci-fi fans might not care for Aeon Flux.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 64<br /><br />29 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

B00005JP4U|5.0|This should not be a controversial film.  That it is baffles and confuses me.  Sure, the energy industry has disseminates a vast amount of misinformation on the issue, making it seem that global warming is a contestable issue (it is not:  the scientific community is completely unanimous on the issue--the only people who disagree are scientists on corporate payrolls).  But what about fundamental self-interest?  This should be a nonpartisan issue.  If the environmental catastrophe that many have been predicting for several decades and towards which we have been inching year by year takes place, who benefits?  The answer is no one.  Regardless of your political position, a fundamental quality of life is required for any human being to have the luxury of a political position.<br /><br />The documentary is largely a film presentation of a slide show that Al Gore has given over a thousand times over the past couple of decades.  It is one that he has constantly updated and honed and at this point it has been fine tuned to a remarkable degree.  Al Gore is clearly a man without an agenda here, unless you conceive that being passionately and honestly concerned about the fate of the planet an \\"agenda.\\"  But usually when we use \\"agenda\\" we imply that someone is trying to serve their own self-interest by putting something over on others.  Gore's naysayers need to ask:  precisely how does Al Gore benefit if you believe him?  In fact, he doesn't stand to benefit at all.  Some cynically claim that his film is really about a run for the presidency, but he has repeatedly denied that he has any intention of running in 2008 and the timing of the film would seem to be more than a little off for a run in 2012 or 2016.  No, he seems to have done this film simply because it has long been the consuming issue in his life.<br /><br />Person after person has and will continue to ask upon seeing this film:  where was this Al Gore in 2000?  He is charming, funny, warm, human, even--gasp--charismatic.  And for those of us who remember him as somewhat stiff in 1988, 1992, and 2000, he seems amazingly at ease.  I don't think there is any question that had we seen this Al Gore in 2000, he would have been president.<br /><br />Basically all this film tries to do is state as graphically and as clearly as possible the facts concerning global warming.  I won't repeat all the details, but I will say that anyone who has been at all uncertain about what global warming is and how it is caused and what its effects are will be clear on it after seeing this.  In the wake of the release of this film, a number of environmental scientists have spoken out on the film and confirmed its essential accuracy.  Industry \\"scientists\\" have stated otherwise, but it is hard to trust anyone whose paycheck depends on their holding to a particular position.  The charts and graphs that he uses are amazingly clear and aid his presentation.  And the statistical evidence that he assembles is impressive.  The most disturbing part of the presentation, however, is the large amount of photographic evidence.  He shows a number of before and after photos of glaciers from around the world.  They are highly disturbing in showing the dramatic shrinking or disappearance of massive amounts of ice.<br /><br />All in all, this is an amazingly well done popular presentation of the current state of scientific thinking on global warming.  Will it make a difference?  I'm unfortunately doubtful.  I personally think it will take a disaster of unimagined proportions to activate the United States--about the only nation in the world that is refusing to do anything about the problem (as Gore shows in the film, even China has vastly higher emission standards on is cars)--to do anything.  Hurricanes might do it.  Environmental science says that as the oceans continue to warm, hurricanes will continue to gain in strength.  If we have an increasing number of category 4 hurricanes in the next two decades, will people finally come around?  Or will it take a dramatic rise in the ocean's water levels due to the melting of the polar ice caps?  Or will the critics even then insist that this is all a natural, not a human made, phenomena?<br /><br />I recommend this film as highly as possible.  It is not only a fascinating film that makes compulsive viewing, but on what is arguably the most important issue in the world today.  Without a viable environment, nothing else matters.  The only issue ought to be not whether we respond to this impending crisis, but how.ill people finally come around?

0380789035|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't get into it. With so many cliches on the shelves, I was saddened that by page 50 I was bored with American Gods. Give it a try, you might like it. Not my style, though.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I first saw Batman Begins in the theater.  Quite frankly, I was blown away and thought it was easily the best of the Batman movies.  I just got done watching the film again, this time the DVD version, and the experience only served to strengthen my initial assessment.  This is a 5 star movie.  All of the major players are in top form.  Bale and Caine are very natural together, and Oldman was a great choice to play a your Gordon.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the sequel to this movie.  Under Christopher Nolan's deft direction, I am certain the movie will be great.  I always thought that Spiderman II was far superior to Spiderman.  If the sequel to Batman Begins tops this one, we are in for an exceptional treat.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about seeing this movie, or are not sure if you want to watch it; do yourself a favor and rent or buy this DVD, it is a top notch 5 star film.
B0001O3YC6|5.0|Pitch Black is a Sci-Fi film sure to please fans of the genre. While the acting wavers at time, the film is held together by a good storyline, and by the film presense of Vin Diesel. I just finished my second viewing of Pitch Black, and enjoyed it once again.<br /><br />The story is as such (without spoilers): A crew of 40+ crashes on a distant planet after their ship is hit by a meteor shower. Few survive, but those that do must deal with a brutal ex-con (Diesel), and an enemy that loves the dark are attacks during a coming eclipse.<br /><br />My rating of this movie is primarily for fans of sci-fi and action movies. Those who could care less about these genres will probably not like Pitch Black, simply because the acting has occasional glimpses of mediocrity. But alas, Vin Diesel holds the movie together. You love and hate him at the same time.<br /><br />The story is quite unique, and in the end I felt entertained and emotionally involved with the characters. A main character dies at the end, and I was saddened. Also, at the end I am left wanting the story to continue. I am grateful that the Chronicles of Riddick do not end here.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 68<br /><br />40 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

B000BVRWJA|5.0|Large, heavy man's man watch. Gets plenty of looks and the bracelet is just beautiful. Keeps excellent time as most quartz movements do. I use it as an everyday casual watch and have banged it numerous times, the sapphire crystal remains scratchless. Thought about buying another or collecting all three colors.  <br /> <br />This watch could be improved if the night illuminators didn't take so long to charge. Also it lacks a perpetual calendar but the date is easy to change and only has to be done once every two months. <br /> <br />Try this before spending $2000 - $5000 on breitling, tag, omega
0201633612|5.0|There are few books in the software industry that hold up for any length of time. This is one of the exceptions. In my work, I  refer to this book periodically and find that it offers more over time. This book should be on the shelf of most object oriented programmers.
0688172377|1.0|The premise is outstanding.  In reality, this story was like flipping through a magazine on a bus while awaiting to get off at the next stop.  \\"Not fleshed out\\" is how a literary agent would probably put it.  Remarkable, but topical.
0767834739|5.0|I'll admit, when I first saw they were going to be making \\"Resident Evil\\" into a movie I thought it was going to be horrible.  Now that the second installment is out I have to say I am more then just a fan and am eagerly awaiting for the third movie to come out.<br /><br />Apocalypse picks up right where the first one left off.  Racoon City is being sealed off as the virus can't be contained.  Alice and a handful of others must find a high ranking scientist's daughter who didn't make it out of the city.  The ending leaves you wanting more as well.<br /><br />Filled with action, and much more exciting plot (still you must see Resident Evil prior to this one), Apocalypse delievers one wild ride of a movie.  A must own for any fan of the game or great Sci-Fi movies.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|<br />I love this album. Megadeth's 5th full length release. 1990's Rust In Peace put established them as gods of speed metal, Countdowns release in 92 further enhanced there reputation. An must have for any metalhead, with the classics: \\"Symphony Of Destruction\\", \\"Architecture Of Aggression\\",and \\"Skin O' My Teeth\\". Different style of cover art as well. But don't let that fool you. This album is pure driven speed metal at its finest.
B000063DFN|5.0|Rime Of The Ancient Mariner is the greatest Iron Maiden Song To Me.   <br />Losfer Words is one of the most powerful instrumentals i have listen. Aces High is a song that makes me want to go running and do something crazy, Two Minutes to Midnight is simply a masterpiece Powerslave song is completly epic and beautiful with those spectacular solos, Flash Of The Blade, The Duellists and Back In The Village are perfect kickass songs to acompany the other songs of this perfect masterpiece album. Great bass, great guitar duo, great drums and great vocals.QUE VIVA IRON MAIDEN, LOS REYES DEL METAL Y POWERSLAVE, SU MEJOR ALBUM YEAHHHHH!!!!!
B000001EGE|5.0|This is where Elton's legendary string of hits began. \\"Honky Chateau\\" would become the first of 7 straight #1 albums to hit the charts between 1972-1975: a truly dizzying output of music given its overall popularity and quality. And to think, Elton was prepared to hang up his recording career if this album failed... <br /> <br />Davey Johnstone formally joined Dee and Nigel in Elton's band. Jean-Luc Ponty added his string arrangements and Gus Dudgeon acted as producer. They recorded this album in a castle in France named the Chateau d'Herouville. Curiously, the music that emanated from those session had nothing to do with the lofty orchestral arrangements of previous efforts like \\"Madman\\" or \\"Elton John\\". This album was a pure rocker, many of the tracks invested with a Southern rock feel, only more streamlined and radio-friendly. <br /> <br />Elton's piano work on \\"Honky Cat\\" is masterful. \\"I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\\" is both comical and melodramatic as Elton's shifts between the sorrowful lament of the chorus to ragtime and tap-dancing. \\"Salvation\\" comes as close to an anthem as anything Elton's ever written. Then there are tremendous rock songs on here, like \\"Susie\\" and the powerful \\"Hercules\\". The bonus track of \\"Slave\\" invests the original laid-back country recording with pure fire on the piano. <br /> <br />But what most people will no doubt remember most on this album is the classic hit \\"Rocketman\\" and the lesser-known and absolutely beautiful \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\". This album was the emergence of Elton as the greatest singer/songwriter of his day. <br />
B000B5XOSO|4.0|I'm usually one who believes the original is better than the sequel.  This is one of the few exceptions.  \\"Batman Returns\\" has better action sequences, better plotting, and better villains than the original \\"Batman.\\" <br /> <br /> Again, director Tim Burton puts a strong thumb mark on the movie, putting the \\"Goth\\" in \\"Gotham City.\\"  Again, Michael Keaton is Batman.  <br /> <br /> This time, the movie focuses more on plot and fast-paced action than in the first film, which was mostly set-up. <br /> <br /> And this time, the movie's villain is Oswald C. Cobblepot, a.ka. The Penguin.  The Penguin has always been a favorite villain of mine.  Unfortunately, he's not quite done justice here.  In the comic books, Penguin was the most sophisticated of Batman's foes.  Here, Danny DeVito portrays him as the most despicable.  Thanks to DeVito's acting talents, however, this still works relatively well for a movie villain.  The Penguin is now a truly repulsive bad guy, resembling the character from the earlier issues of the comic books more than the one he has evolved into. <br /> <br /> As in the first \\"Batman\\", the special effects make-up also gets a starring role.  The Penguin looks humanoid and bird-like at the same time, making him all the more disgusting.  Especially grotesque are his flesh-colored flippers. <br /> <br /> Michele Pfeiffer plays Catwoman as both an enemy and a love interest for Batman.  Her character now personifies both feminism and femininity.  Her lips and eyes look especially sexy behind a leather mask, and her athletic curves look especially tempting in a full-body leather jumpsuit.  Also, the scenes between her alter ego Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne cleverly reveal the dark sides of both characters.  <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton's portrayal of both Bruce Wayne and Batman is even better than in the first film.  It's a pity this was his final portrayal of the character.  Out of the Batman films he and Burton collaborated on, this is undoubtedly my favorite.  <br />
B000001DQI|5.0|In 1973, Elton and the gang returned once more to the Chateau d'Herouville in France. While the previous sessions for \\"Honky Chateau\\" and \\"Don't Shoot Me...\\" yielded little extra material, these sessions overflowed with material...and all of it good: really, really good. Thus, Dick James took a risk and decided to release the mateiral as a double album. The risk paid off, as many regard this to be the pinnacle of Elton's recording career, and for good reason. <br /> <br />The solemn orchestral \\"Funeral For a Friend\\" may be the best introduction to any album ever. This is followed by the rocker \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\". The first 11 minutes of the album are an exercise in classical composition, drastic shifts in tempo and volume. A true masterpiece. This superb introduction is followed by a string of Top 10 hits: \\"Candle in the Wind\\", \\"Bennie and the Jets\\", and the title track. The listener is almost floored by the unmatched excellence of the album. <br /> <br />The album goes on shaky ground with the off balance \\"Song Has No Title\\", the esoteric \\"Grey Seal\\" and the comically out-of-place \\"Jamaica Jerk Off\\". However, it is all smooth sailing from there on.  <br /> <br />Much like the scenes from a movie alluded to in the climactic \\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\", Elton and Taupin guide the listener to a seaside burdello, then a hotel lobby where a gangster is shot, then a subway station in So-Ho where a lesbian prostitute turns up dead, and off to a bustling dance floor on the boardwalk. The string arrangmenets are beautiful, the rock riffs infective: it is Elton at his most creative. <br /> <br />Closing the album are the hard rocker, \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\" and the nostalgic western song, \\"Roy Rogers\\". \\"Social Disease\\" provides the listener with one final foot stomping gem before the album wraps up in truly majestic form with \\"Harmony\\". <br /> <br />The few snags in the album are greatly outweighed by the sheer power and creativity Elton shows throughout. You need not be an Elton fan to be awed by the sheer magnitude of this recording project. This album sealed Elton's status as the greatest rock star of his day. <br />
B000002J09|5.0|Well what can anyone say about Led Zeppelin? it's the toughest thing anyone can possibly be made to answer. Maybe it's wise to start with the other great human endeavours, the Ancient Greeks, the Pyramids, The European Rennaisance, Beethoven, Einstein. Put these in a melting pot and the end result would stll be vastly inferior to teh worst song by Led Zepplin. In fact it's wrong to think of Zeppelin as having a worst song. How dare I. HOW DARE I.

It's like trying to comprehend the vastness of the Cosmos. Every single man woman and child on the planet must do 60 years of penance for failing to be in the same league as Led Zeplin. Led Zeppelin is far far FAR and away the greatest thing to have EVER happened in history. We are but sinful WORMS in the Almighty prescence of Led Zeppelin.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|First off, let me say that I own Enya's more popular releases, including Watermark, Shepherd Moons, and A Day Without Rain.  That said, I'm not a \\"die-hard\\" fan, and most likely because of this, wasn't expecting or wanting something \\"untapped\\" or \\"different\\" from her.  But, even so, why would I?  It is, after all, Enya; she possesses such an unmistakable and highly unique sound that changing it would only result in dire consequences to both her and her fans in my opinion. <br /> <br />At first listen (as well as extended listening over the last six months), I've never felt for once that it was \\"just like _______,\\" or any of her other CDs.  Yes, it is unmistakably Enya.  But, that's a GOOD thing! <br /> <br />There are differences, contrary to popular belief, however.  This is her most melodic and memorable CD yet:  The music tends to \\"stick\\" in your mind almost immediately, providing melodies and lyrics you'll want to sing yourself many times over.  Personally, if I had a choice, I would choose this CD over the other releases mentioned above. <br /> <br />It is very apparent that a lot of thoughtfulness and HEART went into this CD, unlike so many other releases out there.  There is a high level of feeling and emotion in these songs, and the production, attention to detail, and recording quality is first-rate, also unlike so many other releases out there!  As an avid listener with a huge CD collection, and long-time musician and recording engineer, I have no doubt that Enya put everything she had into this CD. <br /> <br />Some have suggested that the lyrics are second rate, but it all depends on how you interpret them, how they are conveyed (by the artist), and the value you place on them.  Are they sung with emotion, feeling, and sincerity?  This can dramatically change the context and/or interpretation.  Do they compliment the music?  Do they become less important and take a back seat due to other elements in the music?  The answer to all of these questions is yeswhen speaking of this CD. <br /> <br />If, of course, you are expecting or looking for something behind the lyrics, weigh them highly, and are comparing them to other releases, then yes, you may be disappointed.  But why not just listen to the songs for how they were written; with feeling.

B0001IN0DA|5.0|Wrestlemania XX is the biggest and best wwe event of all time. From top to bottom the card is brilliant. It was held in Madison Square Garden which is the best arena in the world! The actaul ppv starts with a very good video package, and ends with one too. <br />WWE United States Championship <br />Big Show (c) Vs John Cena <br />A decent opening match. Served its purpose to get the crowd going for the rest of the event. Good work by both men, especially Big Show. [7.5/10] <br /> <br />World Tag Team Championship <br />Fatal Four way <br />RVD & Booker T (c) Vs Dudley Boyz Vs Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak Vs La Résistance <br />An average match. Still good, but one of the weeker matches of the night. [6/10] <br /> <br />Chris Jericho Vs Christian <br />An excellent match. One of the best of the night. Great work by both men, and has a surprising ending! [8.5/10] <br /> <br />2 on 3 Handicap Tag Team Match <br />Rock 'n' Sock Connection Vs Evolution <br />Another excellant match. Great efforts by all five men. A highlight of the match is when Ric Flair goes for the peoples elbow on the Rock! Real good entertaining match. I was surprised who the winners were though. [8.5/10] <br /> <br />Playboy Evening Gown Match <br />Sable & Torrie Wilson Vs Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie  <br />Ummm, the women were HOT! but as far as actual 'wrestling' goes, it was poor. [3/10] <br /> <br />WWE Cruiserweight Championship open <br />Chavo Guerrero (c) Vs Jamie Noble Vs Funaki Vs Ultimo Dragon Vs Rey Mysterio Vs Nunzio Vs Tajiri Vs Shannon Moore Vs Billy Kidman <br />Loads of high flying stuff as you would expect. Some very good moves! Fast paced match, which could of done with a little bit more time, but still GOOD! One of the best bits of the match was Kidman's shooting star press to the outside of the ring! jus look at that landing, OUCH!!! [7.5/10] <br /> <br />Interpromotional Match <br />Special referee: Stone Cold Steve Austin <br />Goldberg Vs Brock lesnar <br />I was VERY disapointed with this match. It should of been sooo much better! The crowd reactions to both men are something to see though, as they knew both men would be leaving the compnay straight after that match, and neither has been seen since, although i do expect Lesnar to return down the road at some point. The actaul match was ok, not alot happend really, it got off to a slow start too. The ending which features Austin is good though. [6/10] <br /> <br />WWE Tag Team Championship <br />Fatal Four Way <br />Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty (c) Vs APA Vs The Basham Brothers Vs Shelton Benjamen and Charlie Haas <br />Much like the other tag title match, the match was ok, but nothing special and kinda forgetable [5.5/10] <br /> <br />WWE Womens Championship <br />Molly Holly (c) Vs Victoria <br />(if Molly loses she gets her head shaved!!!) <br />Good womens match, great efforts by both women, and watching Molly get her head shaved is hilarious! poor molly, haha! [6.5/10] <br /> <br />WWE Championship <br />Eddie Guerrero (c) Vs Kurt Angle <br />Very good technical wrestling match. Amazing efforts by both men, probaly second match of the night! Respect to both men for such a great match. Has a good ending too. [9.5/10] <br /> <br />Kane Vs The Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer <br />The return of the Undertaker with his 'deadman' gimmick. The match itself was pretty good, but the entrance of the undertaker was amazing, sent a shiver down ur spine, one of the loudest crowd pops ive ever heard! [8/10] <br /> <br />World Heavyweight Championship <br />Triple Threat Match <br />Triple H (c) Vs Chris Benoit Vs Shawn Michaels <br />Probably the best match of the night. Amazing efforts by all three men. The winner of this match truly deserved it. The actual ending was very very good. it is soemthing that wil not be forgotten ever. Very emotional, and a brilliant ending to a brilliant event!!!! <br /> <br />This ppv in my opinion, is THE BEST PPV EVER. So go out and buy it, its worth it! the ppv itself is amazing and the extras are brilliant too!

B00002ND77|5.0|I absolutely love this movie always have since the very first time i saw it. The likeness that Denzel Washington shares with Minister Malcolm is astonishir, the way he speaks, acts and looks is just uncanny to the original man himself. <br />Incase you don't know who Malcolm X or have just heard about him or the movie from a friend then let me give you a bit of a background. Malcolm Little grew up in the streets of Harlem New York with his mother and father and all his brothers, his father was murdered by the Klu Klux Klan but nobody was brought to justice infact it was claimed his fathers death was suicide. Shortly after the death of his father his mother started to break down and become extremely depressed and was admitted into a mental health home. Malcolm and his brothers where split up into foster homes and Malcolm while attending school one day was told by his favourite teacher that he couldn't be a lawyer because he was a \\"Negro\\" which as you can imagine this hurt Malcolm extensively. <br />As a teenager Malcolm turned to a life of Hustling and crime and along with a friend of his \\"Shorty\\" where thrown in prison for 10 years. During his time in prison he was introduced to the Nation of Islam by his brother and was told to write to The Messenger Elijah Muhammed. This religion taught how the black people are constantly pushed down by the white man and how they are degraded and embarassed beyond belief. <br />This education brought out a fury in Malcolm that he had never felt and on his release from prison he immediately became a follower of the Messenger Elijah Muhammed and a preacher for the Nation Of Islam. With his strong words which to some where racist and promoted white hate immediately created a media storm and Malcolm became instantly a world wide political figure admired by some detested by many. <br />During his time in the Nation Of Islam Malcolm became aware that there was corruption around him and that his peers where going behind his back to Elijah complaining that he was bringing bad press to the NOI. <br />I won't tell you what happens next as that will spoil the film for you and i want you to see it because it is amazing and nothing like. 3 hours long but every minute will keep you captivated and your eyes glued to the screen.
B000EULJLU|5.0|While Vicarious and Jambi are two excellent transitional tracks, carrying the listener from Lateralus to 10,000 days, the real substance of the albums kicks in at Wings for Marie/10,000 Days. It's interesting to see that listeners don't have the patience to endure 17 minutes of raw emotion laid over a backdrop of thundering weather effects complimenting the subtle guitar work. Since I see alot of people citing Tool as their \\"Favorite Band\\" or the \\"Best Band Ever\\" I thought the reaction to such an emotional song would be a bit more respectful, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Entering the second half of the disc is The Pot serving as 10,000 days' equivalent of Hooker with a Penis/Ticks and Leeches, another vent of fustration that this time around showcases the progression of Justin Chancellor's bass work. Then the intermission (Lipan Conjuring) gives enough time to get ready for the trip that Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned is going to take you on. The smooth droning sound clears the listener's mind making them vulnerable to the vocal/musical assualt of Rosetta Stoned. The unimaginable alien abduction tale shot at the listener by Maynard is accurately depicted through the crunching guitars and elusive effects that make you wonder where it's taking you. The length and continuation of the song captures the feeling of not being let go that the protagonist feels in the story. After the trip you are dropped off into Intension, a 7 minute precursor to Right in Two in the vein of Disposition from Lateralus. Danny Carey's versatile and precise percussion work shines on this track, sounding almost tribal to electronic.Starting light, Right in Two is a reflection on mankind and evolution with fluctuating levels of emotion and intensity. Rising to a brutal climax reminiscent of Aenema's closer Third Eye, Right in Two lets you down easy to reflect upon the album and more importantly life.
0792839749|5.0|What can I say- I just love this film. I had it on video and almost wore away the tape from repeated watchings! I bought the Collectors Edition DVD set complete with Chitty car and double dvd discs. This is a fantastic journey through an adventure. Crisp picture quality and sound allowed me to see the film through new eyes. The songs are fantastic; my favourite being Doll On A Music Box as its my favourite scene in the whole film because of the sheer brilliance of Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes' convincing portrayal of toys. The childcatcher still scares me everytime he says Come and Get Your Lollipops. I tried to explain this to my class, who have never seen the film. They're in for a treat at the end of term when I put it onto the interactive whiteboard with surround sound. Despite the 1968 style special effects, which were fantastic by those standards, you get sucked into the world of Chitty. I always wanted to be Truly Scrumptious when I was little. Seeing this again has reminded me of fond childhood memories. I've watched it over four times in one week because I've noticed things in the widescreen version that I didn't have on VHS- such as Sally Ann Howes smacking Dick Van DYke into the mirror during the music box scene. I also find the two spies much funnier now. Gert Frobe as Baron Bombhurst adds hilarity and I remember Anna Quayle more for her part as Mrs Monroe in Grange Hill rather than the Baroness in Chitty. Their scene for Chu-chi Face is quite sado-masochistic as an adult watcher of the film. Children would not get the undertones of the darkness of their relationship! All in all, I would have loved to have seen the wedding between Truly and Caractacus but as the film is long enough, the immortal lines \\"Well Mr Potts, now we'll have to get married!\\" will have to do and leave the rest to imagination. Just one gripe- Sally Ann Howes should have been given much more to do- her voice is a stunner. Much as many people have claimed that there wasn't much chemistry between her and Van Dyke- I beg to differ. On widescreen you notice that there is a smouldering chemistry by small facial expressions. The kids were great too! Oh, and I didn't realise that beach was in St Tropez. Better get travelling to see it and run through the surf there as they did in the film!
B000000OQF|5.0|In my opinion, and most would agree, this is the best rock album of the 80's.  <br />Great drumming, guitar riffs and vocals! <br /> <br />Love Paradise City and Sweet Child Of Mine!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />I miss you guys!!
B000022TSW|5.0|I must say that this is without a shout of a doubt the funniest animated film EVER. South Park is the brain child of comedy geniuses Matt Stone & Trey Parker, unlike the series this is 10 times funnier. The subtitle of the film describes it perfectly because it is just a longer episode of South Park but completely uncensored. <br />I think it is fair to not only label this an animated film but to also label it a musical as it does contain some of the catchiest tunes you're ever likely to hear. With every South Park episode this film ends with a moral to the story so you will have to watch the entire movie through to understand the moral. <br />This is nothing short of genius comedy and just a great movie to enjoy but be warned this isnt exactly a kids movie as for every third sentence the F word is used. <br />10/10 = Genuis
B00005JO20|5.0|Peter Jackson is a man who has done some other excellent movies, and this one is definitely not the exception. But I agree with other reviewer here who said that it was too long. I think that too. Probably cutting the beginning a little it would have been about 20 or 30 minutes shorter, but whatever, that's not the most important.<br /><br />To begin with, the main actors are very good, and they play their roles perfectly. Naomi Watts really broke our heart when she saw King Kong while he was attacked, Jack Black also does a great performance, even though at one point I wanted him to be dead (for the story), and Adrien Brody has always been a terrifir actor who can play any character you tell him to. So, the acting: 10/10.<br /><br />The special effects are quite great too, King Kong looks excellent in the movie, and it looks very real, but its face just changes a bit in some scenes. But the effects look real, but in one or two scenes they do look fake too... 8/10.<br /><br />The story is very interesting too, but the beginning is kind of slow, and if they would have edited it a little more, the movie would have been shorter and better. The rest of the movie is great, sometimes you think one thing, and the next minute you think this other thing, so it's not a predictable movie (off the record: and I like that, because I hate predictable movies!!)<br /><br />The thing I didn't like as much as the rest is the ending. It's very sad, and first I thought they would just send King Kong back to the island, but they didn't, and the way the movie ended was sad and upsetting (for me), because finally the people who had captured King Kong are just free and they don't pay anything. I thought King Kong would kill him, but....whatever, I already saw the movie and it didn't happen. So, story and ending: 9/10.<br /><br />Everything else, like music, lightening and other stuff (specially music): 20/10.<br /><br />When this movie came out, a lot of people told me that it was awful, boring and extremely long, and that I shouldn't watch it...Thank God I didn't listen to them, and I don't regret. But I rented this movie on DVD, and I can't deny that if I had been in the movie theatre for three hours, probably this would be a 1-star rating. I have to be honest about that.<br /><br />Well, judge yourselves. I was expecting for something regular, but I got something incredible!hat it was awful, boring and extremely long, and that I shouldn't watch it...Thank God I didn't listen to them, and I don't regret. But I rented this movie on DVD, and I can't deny that if I had been in the movie theatre for three hours, probably this would be a 1-star rating.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|The Banks family is in need of a new nanny for Jane and Michael. Fortunately, one arrives on the wind in the form of Mary Poppins. She's everything the kids want, fun and magical. But while she's taking them to chalk painting countrysides and tea parties on the ceiling, their father is less then happy. Can he be made to see beyond the end of his nose? <br />Ok, so this movie is really little more then an excuse for song and dance numbers. It's still great! The plot is paper thin, and you loose site of it in the middle of some of their fantastic scenes. Of course, part of that is because the movie is based on a book that is really nothing but short stories. Still this movie is more about fun then anything else. And it has that in spades. What kid wouldn't have fun imaging that they get to do all the things that Jane and Michael do in this movie? <br /> <br />It's said that Walt Disney poured everything he had learned into making this film, and it shows. Many of the special effects hold up remarkably well today. There were some I still hadn't figured out until watching this special edition. And the music! Any fan of Disney knows these songs by heart. And you can't help but find yourself humming \\"A Spoonful of Sugar,\\" \\"Jolly Holiday,\\" \\"Let's Go Fly a Kite,\\" or \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\" for days after seeing it. <br /> <br />Those wanting to own a great DVD of this film won't be disappointed in this two-disc set. Disc one features the movie in all its wide screen glory. I can't see how it's ever looked better. The soundtrack has many different options, but the Home Theater mix will blow you away. It's fantastic. There is also a commentary track featuring Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane), and Richard Sherman. Sprinkled in are archive comments from others, including Disney himself. Also included are some pop up facts to read along with while watching the movie. Disc two features a new documentary on the film, a deleted song, and more on the music with Julie, Dick, and the composers. And be sure to check out the animated \\"The Cat That Looked at a King,\\" a tale adapted from one of the later books in the series. <br /> <br />One thing that comes through loud and clear in this set is how much fun everyone had making it and how much they respect Walt Disney. The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testament to his genius. With this set, it'll be enjoyed by generations to come.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|After such a long time of anticipation, when I got to see the theater release, I walked out disappointed. And all because of one 'little' point, <br />How the hell did a blacksmith learn how to fight and defend a city after nothing more than a ten minute swordfighting lesson from his father? <br /> <br />A big fan of knights and crusader myths since I was a boy in the fifties, there were scenes in the film that just sent chills up my spine: the crusaders riding into the village; crusaders going about their business in Messina; the first approach into Jerusalem; the approach of the christian army onto the battlefield with the shining cross and the forest of spears and flags. <br />It was everything I wanted to see in a good crusader movie. <br /> <br />But, \\"How the hell...\\" <br /> <br />The directors cut fixed it. <br /> <br />Now, \\"How the hell could any studio exec have thought that information was superfluous?\\" <br /> <br />The dvd version is now one of the best movies ever, IMHO. <br /> <br />Except for: <br />\\"Overture\\" <br />Beautiful, perfect intro to the movie. I closed my eyes and waited for the start of the film. Then \\"BAM!\\" 20th century fox fanfare and studio logo crap! <br /> <br />Not good. <br /> <br />The young Prince holds his hand over the candle until his skin chars and doesn't feel anything. When he appears next, there is no bandage or evidence of damage or indication that enough time has passed for the damage to heal. Later, the wax drips on his arm and his mother notices he doesn't feel it. That really could have been enough. I think the candle flame scene was inserted in case we were too stupid to get the candle wax implication. <br /> <br />When the wall is breeched at the end of the siege and both armies swarm the opening, the seething mass of fighting men who clog the breech is a perfectly realized moment. A small number of doomed men doing the actual fighting, pressed so close they could hardly wield their weapons (described sometimes as being so closely pressed that the dead could not fall), while the ones in back push forward against each other. I was surprised when the camera pulled up to an overhead shot and saw that both armies were holding back while the breech was contested by smaller contingents. This may have been more to the truth but I really wanted to see it the way the old romatic painters used to portray it: Both armies pushing their way in. <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />The last meeting/duel between Balian and Guy de Lusignan was not satisfying.  <br />In the original release, Guy just disappears. I just figured they killed him. <br />Would it have been better if Balian had killed him? No. The director's cut scene is fitting with Balian's character's motivations, but still, the scene did not satisfy. <br /> <br />Now the only complaint I have about the movie is one that is really a compliment to the director: <br />Godfrey and his knights: I understand that Ridley enjoys the fact that we are surprised that many of them die so soon. But, even in the original version, I walked out wishing that we could see another movie about them and their adventures. As the camera panned over their dead faces, I wanted to know where they had been and what they had done.  <br />I still do. <br />I wish the black muslim had been able to pull his saracen blade during the fight! <br />And the Hospitaler! I want to see another movie with more of him.  <br />I've read that Scott would like to do another movie set in this time and I hope like hell he gets to do it. <br /> <br />One other little thing: <br />The fight on the beach. There are three horses. But only two go to Jerusalem. I didn't see one get killed. Balian gives his horse to the Muslim but rides one away. What happened to the other horse?

B000F0UV0E|5.0|I never would have placed these two together, but they are a fantastic duo.  Their voices compliment each other, and Knopfler's guitar playing is very recognizeable.  The songs vary in tempo, are well written, and blend together beautifully on this album.  I think anybody who likes rock, folk, or country will enjoy this.
0060934913|3.0|When I first started reading this book, I thought Bourdain was a narcissitic jerk.  Just one of those wise guys who think their antics are SO SO  funny.  But he does give an authentic feel for what goes on in restaurant kitchens, so much that my head (if not my stomach) is spinning.  And I don't know whether or not I respect the kitchen crew more or less.  But I did learn a lot and I enjoyed, for the most part, learning it.  It's not often a book is written with such candor and, I presume, honesty. On the other hand, there were some weaknesses.  First of all, I think Bourdain wrote this for his colleagues in the restaurant industry -- there's a lot of inside baseball here.  Secondly, he assumes the reader knows the definition of all the jargon AND the foods AND the utensils, etc.  He doesn't stop and define things -- maybe a glossary in the back would have helped.  Anyhow, it was a good read.  Not sure I'll read his other books -- I think his writing is an acquired taste.  All in all, I'll give it three stars -- and be on my toes whenever I enter a restaurant again.

B00062IVKI|3.0|Liza Minnelli does some great take-offs on Peggy Lee and her mother, Larry Kert gets a rare chance to show real Broadway talent and Robert DeNiro brilliantly improvs a jerk no one could care about. Trouble with this film is twofold: together in their scenes DeNiro treats Minnelli like she was a male boxer he was in the ring with and she doesn't have acting improv chops, so mostly she just withdraws (the one scene she fights back they both ended up in the hospital). Minnelli also looks terrible in the period wigs and costumes (and overweight in the second half), only looking comfortable at the very end. Second, Scorsese tries so hard to create a 50s artificial atmosphere that Minnelli's scenes in front of an audience, where she would be electric in a real concert, the faked reactions take the energy out of the performances. It's his botch. In a strange way, it's a vanity film but for the director. Most embarrassing, he emphatically proves he's no Vincent Minnelli. Good thing about the DVD, you can skip to the good bits and lose the poor chemistry. Like a lot of Hollywood product, a huge waste.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I just discovered Firefly and Serenity and boy, do I wish I had found them earlier.  This movie is a fitting big-screen chapter to the series.  One does not have to have seen the series to enjoy the film, although having some knowledge of the characters might help a bit. <br /> <br />Great acting, funny dialogue, and very touching ending.  Far better than the Star Wars prequels.  I hope they make some sequels to this film -- it deserves it.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Ok Im not going to bore you with a paragraph about this CD. So To Make It Simple:<br /><br />THIS ALBUM IS SIMPLY AMAZING.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, wow, where do I begin? <br /> <br />I am not a sci-fan fan.  Yes, I enjoyed Star Wars, as did everyone else, but that's the extent of my sci-fi exposure.   <br /> <br />Firefly is no ordinary sci-fi show.  In fact, it's not really sci-fi at all.  This is a story of a bunch of regular people who live together on a spaceship called \\"Serenity.\\"  The neat thing is that, unlike traditional sci-fi show, there are no aliens, there is no warp drive or hyperdrive, or anything fanciful like that.  This is a future that is believable, and these are believable characters.  This show is funny, sad, exciting and everything in-between. <br /> <br />You really should check this show out.  I think most everyone will enjoy it.  I have heard that it appeals to a large number of women TV viewers, probably because of the interesting and strong female characters (evidently, this is something that the show's creator, Joss Whedon, is famous for -- see Buffy the Vampire Slayer). <br /> <br />I think it's a real testament to the show's quality that it continues to rank very high in sales here at amazon and that it has averaged a 5 star review after more than 2500 reviews.  Not many shows can show those numbers. <br /> <br />It's a real shame that Fox messed up and cancelled this show.  I know that if it were back on the air, I'd be a loyal viewer. <br /> <br />I do recommend that everyone check this show out.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|It's a short CD (less than 50 minutes), but I found the piano to be haunting and beautiful. THe perfect music to relax after work, nap on a Saturday or tea on Sunday. I just wish each song would last longer. But overall, the CD offers a heavenly trip to romance and relaxation land.
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess wrote his most famous novel, A Clockwork Orange, in 1962.  When Burgess wrote his book, the violent, God forsaken world he wrote about was in the near future (I'm guessing around 1995, since Alex and his droogs at one point go joyriding in a \\"Durango 95\\").  Burgess was apparently a rather keen sociological observer, and most readers will conclude that there was a lot of accurate prediction in what he wrote. <br /> <br />The book is narrated by Alex, an oddly lovable amoral teenage thug.  Alex uses \\"nadsat,\\" a slang derived mostly from Slavic languages, and this language makes Alex's world more real for the reader.  This language is mostly comprehensible from context, and there are several glossaries on the internet.  His language has great comic effect throughout the book, as when Alex reads some propaganda in a government newspaper: <br /> <br />\\"This gazetta I had seemed to be like a Government gazetta, for the only news that was on the front page was about the need for every veck to make sure he put the Government back in again on the next General Election, which seemed to be about two or three weeks off.  There were very boastful slovos about what the Government had done, brothers, in the last year or so, what with increased exports and a real horrorshow foreign policy, and all that cal.\\"  <br /> <br />Or when he describes a bit of refuse on the floor of a milk bar: <br /> <br />\\"I had my glazzies like fixed on a malenky bit of silver paper from a cancer packet that was on the floor, the sweeping-up of this mesto not being all that horrorshow, brothers.\\" <br /> <br />Much of the humor in the book comes from the contrast between the horrible things that Alex does and his unshakable self-esteem.  It never occurs to Alex that the reader's sympathies might not be completely with him as he rapes and murders and plots and schemes.  And Alex is so buoyant and resourceful that it's hard not to root for him. <br /> <br />But Burgess didn't write this booksimply to draw attention to an alarming increase in juvenile delinquency.  The central struggle in the book is between the little man and the soul-stealing bureaucracy.  In one soliloquy, Alex tells us \\"They of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self.  And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines?  I am serious with you, brothers, over this.  But what I do I do because I like to.\\"  The government tries to make Alex good but of course it can't: Alex has to choose to be good, or not. <br /> <br />The 1987 Norton edition restores a final chapter that had been deleted from the original American edition of the novel, and it is here that the reader sees why all men are equal, in God's eyes: everyone has a potential as well as a past, and no man can say what another man will become. <br />
B000BRBA8S|4.0|Wong Kar-Wai's films center on human relationships, rather than the action films of many other Hong Kong directors.  He won a Best Director award from Cannes for \\"Happy Together.\\"  \\"2046\\" is a good film to see some of China's most beautiful actresses.  Gong Li plays the Black Spider and fills each screen moment with passion and depth.  She played in \\"Zhou Yu's Train\\" and recently was the jealous geisha in \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\"  It will be interesting to see her in the American \\"Miami Vice\\" movie.  Tony Leung's character Chow Mo Wan is apparently in love with her, but director Wong Kar-Wai spends a limited amount of screentime with the relationship.  As Bai Ling, the prostitute who lives in room 2046, Zhang Ziyi who starred in \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is one of cinema's most beautiful stars.  Her performance here is stellar as she teases, taunts, and craves Leung.  Faye Wong plays the hotel owner's daughter Wang Jingwen who pines for a Japanese lover that her father will not accept.  She becomes writer Chow Mo Wan's right hand.  The film splinters somewhat as the writer played by Leung constructs a story about a futuristic city where people go to find pleasure and from which they never return.  Takuya Kimura plays the Japanese guy that tries to coax romance from android robots on the train to 2046.  The cinematography in the film is exquisite, as each shot seems like the set up of a painting.  The theme of the picture is open ended, being much more an exploration of modern relationships than the telling of a romantic story.  Leung doesn't seem to ever find true love; and the fact that he's often not a very nice guy seems to predict the outcome.  After watching the film, I felt more as if I had had a cinematic experience rather than I had watched a coherent story.  Maybe life is like that sometimes.  Enjoy!
0385338686|5.0|I am a big fan of the Shopaholic books and was happy to find this one at my local library.  Often throughout the Shopaholic books I became overwhelmed by all the lies Becky told and thought the author used that a bit too much.  I always 'got over it' and ended the book wanting more... When the same theme appeared in this one  I thought... ug.... not again... but I fell in love with the characters and the story and again was left wanting more!!  All in all a good read.  I tore through it in three sittings... not bad considering I have a nine month and had to read during her naps!!

B00005B36H|5.0|Don't listen to the reviewer below me, he's just some 18-year-old metal nut-hugger who thinks he owns the world but in reality has nothing better to do than type asinine, redundant, hostile \\"reviews\\" from his parents' basement.

B0000033TE|5.0|Released in 1973, this album would find ELP at a creative peak and working as a team, rather than simply a vehicle for Keith Emerson's remarkable skills on the Hammond organ/synthesizer.  Following the release of Brain Salad Surgery, ELP would not record another studio album until 1977.<br /><br />The four tracks on the album include a rock adaptation of the much revered British hymn Jerusalem, with lyrics by the English poet William S. Blake.  Ever the pioneer, Keith used a prototype of the Moog Apollo synthesizer on this track, which was one of the first polyphonic synthesizers. The Apollo is used to generate some soaring trumpet-like fanfares, which add quite a lot to the uplifting nature of the piece.  Of course, the churchy sounding Hammond organ really contributes to the hymn-like qualities.<br /><br />Tocatta is an incredible rock adaptation of Argentinean composer Alberto Ginastera's 1st Piano Concerto, Fourth Movement that includes a special electronic/acoustic percussion movement written by excellent drummer Carl Palmer.  To put it plainly, this piece is devastating.  It is also chaotic, thunderous, and unquestionably ELP's best attempt to fuse classical with rock.<br /><br />Still...You Turn Me On is a very nice Greg Lake ballad that provides some much needed relief from the heaviness of Tocatta.  Benny the Bouncer is not such a great piece and really ruins the flow of the album.  It is unfortunate that ELP decided to include this silly song on the album.<br /><br />The centerpiece of the album is the massive, three movement Karn-Evil 9 suite, which is a continuation of the struggle between humans and technology run amok that started with Tarkus (1971).  The feared technology in question on Karn Evil 9 was the computer.  With lyrics by Pete Sinfield and bassist/vocalist Greg Lake, this masterwork is ELP's finest recorded moment and surely stands as one of the finest progressive rock epics out there.<br /><br />This remastered album is pretty good and boasts excellent sound quality along with detailed liner notes.  I do have problems with Rhino's \\"fancy\\" cover however, and ultimately prefer my old vinyl cover, with the fold-out flaps that reveal the sleeping woman (cover artist H.R. Giger's wife).  As an added bonus, there is a 13'36\\" minute interview with Keith, Greg, Carl, and Pete Sinfield that is very interesting.<br /><br />All in all, this is another definitive work of English progressive rock and is very highly recommended along with Tarkus (1971) and Trilogy (1972).etailed liner notes.

B000F6IOC0|3.0|Did you see the first Underworld?  Did you like it?  If the answer is \\"No,\\" then why are reading this in the first place?  Basically all one need know about this sequel to Underworld is that its pretty much more of the same, only on a bit grander scale.  There's action, blood, untold thousands of rounds of ammo expended, werewolves, vampires, hybrids, action, action, action.  Oh, and there's Kate Beckinsale in that skin tight black outfit, so, I'm there.  Underworld Evolution is an affable sequel if you dug the first movie: the action is plentiful, the pacing is fast, the visuals are done well, Kate looks great.  But, like the original, the film offers little else to sink your teeth into.       It's junk food, sure, but who doesn't love a little junk food now and then.
B00005B36H|1.0|Being not only a fan of bands like Pink Floyd and King Crimson but also of bands like Mastodon and Iced Earth I was really expecting to like this album.  But I didn't.  I hated it.  At first I thought I could absorb it but it turns out that Tool is one of those bands that never did it for me.  Not that they're bad, I wouldn't know, I haven't taken that much time to examine them and I doubt I ever will.  To me this album sounds like a bald halfwit stomping in shallow musical waters.  There's nothing groundbreaking or innovative about this record to me.  It's a cheesemonger of the most smelly kind.  I'm sorry, but if you're hoping to hear a panoramic musical masterpiece then I advise you to look elsewhere.  For good prog I advise you to look at the Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Cynic, Opeth, Mr. Bungle and the one that started it, King Crimson.  But avoid this and Dream Theater like the plague.  It's full of trite, repetitive riffs, terrible lyrics that try to be 'spiritual', and pseudo-psychedelic instrumental passages drivel.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Well, I must admit I'd never even heard of Smallville until 3 years ago and didn't even realise it was on in the U.K. Well that soon changed when my friend told me about it, so I thought it'd be worth a look and let's just say I was confused as it was mid 3 season. So I dismissed it until my sister's boyfriend started raving about it and lent me the first season boxset and from that moment on I was hooked, I got through it in about a week and the first attraction was how hot Tom Welling is! I must say I loved every episode even though the acting wasn't great but it was only the first series. I loved the whole progression of his powers and especially found the 'X-ray' one hilarious! I also love Michael Roesnbaum as Lex, he was made for that role and I love his witty remarks and sarcasm! I wasn't too keen on Lana though as she seemed a tad pathetic but as the series progressed I have grew to like her but I honestly perfer Chloe. Pete is wonderful too and I love the fact he's in love with Chloe - I think it's hilarious! I must say though, I do perfer this season to all the rest as it did indeed have simplier plots but I do like the current season 5 as it shows how much Clark has matured and how each character has grown. Also Tom Welling's acting is simply superb and has improved a lot... also is it just me or does he keep getting hotter? He's just soo gorgeous - thankfully not some geek in glasses!!LOL!  I must admit though I did go through quite a few tissues as the pilot upset me - Whitney is soo mean! Also when he comes into contact with the deadly kryptonite, I must admit I had a few tears as I felt soo sorry for him, though conveniently he always manages to save himself somehow! Anyway, I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a refreshing perspective of the life of superman or should I say the teenage years of 'Superboy'! It's a definite must have!
B0000067L2|5.0|Anyone who denies this record less than a 5 or a 4 just isn't made for psychedelic music.  This is a pretty short record, but it's a helluva influential one, and on top of everything, it's fricking enjoyable!  Pretty much every song here bar 'Blue Condition' (and 'Mother's Lament', but that's not really a song) is good, and 'Blue Condition' ain't even that bad!  As I said before, this was a very influential record on psychedelic music in the late 60's that would unfortunately soon be abandoned for the more complex outings of progressive rock.   <br /> <br />So if you're looking to buy just ONE psychedelic album from the 60's...well you can't!  There's three that I consider ABSOLUTELY essential to every music collection.  Those albums are this one, Revolver by The Beatles, and Are You Experienced? by Jimi Hendrix.  Get off your computer and go buy all of these albums right now if you even have a passing interest in psychedelia.

B000FGGE68|1.0|After seeing this movie with a friend, I quickly told all of my friends to go and see it. I did this because if I got swindled out of $9.75 for a movie ticket, then they should too. This movie combines the worst elements from The Matrix, Blade(1-3), and every movie that ever had terrible dialogue. This movie doesn't make the viewer sympathize with the main character, an over-the-top-semi-vampire with some blood disease that makes no sense. The best line in this movie is when the evil Bishop or Arch cardinal or whatever he was says to Violet (the semi-vampire), \\" You got hemo blood on me; It's on!\\" I laughed out loud at that line. The delivery of that and the many other terrible lines in the movie was delivered worse than a speech by a losing canidate in a political race and cheesier than cheese-whiz. If you are in a situation where you only have the choice between watching this and watching C-SPAN, pick the latter, at least you might understand what's going on and why it is, unlike Ultraviolet, the 2nd worst movie ever made.
0688002307|5.0|I am re-reading this jewel of a book for well over <br />the hundreth time and get even more out of it than <br />I ever did before. First, as a writer of three decades, <br />my hat's off to Pirsig: it is monumentally a  <br />work of genius.  <br />    Pirsig forges adventure, philosophy and <br />journey story all into one gripping narrative. The tone <br />grips from the first sentence, the whole book <br />reads like one huge great tone poem. In the <br />tradition of all great works, Pirsig provokes <br />thought on every page. This is a book that will do  <br />what few books, non-fiction or fiction, do: take you <br />deeper into yourself. That alone makes it worth the <br />price. But there are few books that you read, time <br />and again on this journey of life, and enjoy even <br />more as the road rocks on. And this is one of them, <br />a classic. Part Zen, part classic journey story, part <br />adventure, part meditation on father and son, and <br />all welded together by Pirsig's immaculate prose, <br />this is a work of genius by a master prose craftsman. <br />Long life and blue skies to Robert Pirsig. Five Stars. <br /> <br />Mike Tucker <br />Author: THE LONG PATROL, <br />HELL IS OVER, & AMONG WARRIORS IN IRAQ
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Clint Eastwood is awesome in this movie. If you like movies that aren't associated with Disney, National Lampoon or Vincent Gallo, you should love this movie. The cinamatography is great, the acting is superb, and the climax and finale are perfect. The only complaint anyone should have about this movie is that it is a little long and does seem to drag its feet a little. Even if you don't like Eastwood, you really should check this out the pairing of him, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef make this one of the best movies in recent memory.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie is probably the most controversial movie of the year, especially since the society we live in is largely homophobic. No one can guarantee that you will like this film, since with the bias and propaganda we have grown up with, weaker minds may give into those. What I can tell you, however, is that this movie is done with tremendous care, beauty, and if nothing else, the quality of this film is enough to make this the film of the year. If you are open minded, then I can tell you that you will love this movie. In fact, I loved it ever since the first time I seen it, and have recommended everyone I know to watch it ever since.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is an incredible double-CD album.  I have always been a RHCP fan, but this CD has put them in my top 10 artist list.  This album is creative, unique and a showcase of talent.  Flea's greatest performance yet is complemented by a smooth classic guitar sound that preserves the Chili Funk while creating a new melodic groove.  These guys have proven themselves to be an influential band of legendary proportions.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Madonna singing trance???  Well... I don't know.  The songs are pretty good.  All the songs are very consistant with the same beat.  However, the songs get old pretty fast.  I will give the packaging 5 stars.  But overall, this CD is average.
B00006FR47|5.0|In the summer of 1972, I had just finished 6th grade.  Everywhere you went that summer, every party, every event, you could hear this album playing.  My brother, who had just gotten his driver's license, had the 8-track of it, and played it non-stop.  It was part of the soundtrack of the summer of '72, that short \\"feel-good\\" interlude between the anger of the 60s and Watergate.  Counter-culture was going mainstream, gaining acceptance, and Chicago was at their craft writing the music.<br /><br />It was when stoners and \\"bandzies\\" all loved Chicago at the same time, not to mention critics and the record-buying public.<br /><br />Everything good about Chicago comes together on this album.  Only they could protest while making us smile.<br /><br />When \\"A Hit By Varese\\" opens with a Terry Kath Free Form into, you are about to hear The Original Seven at their creative and professional peak.  Another reviewer said it best - this is hard, driving rock-jazz with a vengeance.<br /><br />This timeless album deserves to be in every music-lover's collection.  I love the Rhino reissue with extensive notes and bonus tracks.<br /><br />I give it a 5-star because there are no 6-stars.  There is not a better album by anybody, anywhere.
B00005JKL8|3.0|Take one standard action film involving Americans, add in a new baddie for them to triumph over, and have the baddies act atrociously and brutally, then let the good guys be victorious in the end.<br /><br />That about sums up Behind Enemy Lines.  It has reasonable special effects, a plot that is simple and oh so seen before, and a square jawed handsome hero (although, looking at Wilson's nose, not that handsome).  One thing is certain, though. As long as there is conflict in the world, there will be a Hollywood movie to glorify it and vilify the enemy.  And just who were the enemy? The Bosnians? The Serbs? The Croats? The film didn't seem very certain itself and neither was I, even at the end.<br /><br />As for the movie, the opening scenes are the most rewarding. Once the movie passes into its middle it becomes a bit dull and the ending, as others have observed, is more like a Rambo film and gets quite farcical.<br /><br />Sadly it just paints everyone as the baddies and only looks for the emotion of cheering 'our guys' on rather than feeling anything for the real people or real country. Saviour may be bleak and depressing as a film but my god it is easier to stomach at times than this was. If you want things going bang then it should do you but you'd best try to switch off your brain, morals and heart before you start watching it.
B000F4RHB6|3.0|How can you give anything more than 3 stars that shows ZERO imagination?  I mean, if you really love Huey Lewis & The News, you cannot be happy with this CD. Why?  Because if you've been with Huey and the boys from the outset (as I have), you know that songs like \\"Some Of My Lies Are True\\" and \\"Trouble In Paradise\\" being left off are huge misses...  What this Hall Of Fame-worthy band really needs -- and deserves -- is an Anthology.  It should include things like 1) the new, slower arrangement of \\"Do You Believe In Love\\" the band has been singing in concerts for the last five years; 2) some remixes; and 3) rarities or out-takes devoted fans of the group would really appreciate...  Since I already own all of their albums (their first one from 1980 is best, by the way), including an imported greatest hits CD, there is no need to grab this one.  However, for people who have eclectic musical tastes and merely consider HL&TN one of many bands they like to listen to from time to time, this CD will fill the bill for a Huey fix when they need it.
0684874350|5.0|This memoir is one of the most captivitating stories I have yet to encounter.  In it, Frank tells the story of his childhood in Ireland with an alcoholic father, dying siblings, poverty, and a mother with her own problems.  The degree of hardship will tug on anyone's heart and encourage with Frank's constant hope for something better.<br /><br />However, what I found most refreshing about this memoir was Frank McCourt's earliest memories of his childhood.  He manages to convey these memories exactly how I imagine a child would view them.  It almost seems as if he started writing this at the age of three.  Although I cannot relate to the abject poverty and hardship the author experienced, I find myself relating to the child he portrays.  Mr. McCourt reminds us all of those quirky behaviors and thought patterns that we all experience as a child.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone.
B000F39MAQ|5.0|Anna Netrebko has got to be one of the best opera singers out there. From the first time I heard her on her album called Sempre Libera I was hooked. Anna and Rolando Villazon are amazing together, the recording is phenomenal, and I am sure the DVD experience will be out of this world!!
B000BTJDGC|4.0|this movie is far superior to any EXORCIST connected movie.  the movie is a combo COURT and HORROR show and it works wonderfully.  genuine haunting performance by JENNIFER CARPENTER and this movie definitely kept my attention.  casting for this movie was right for each role and I did not think of them as (ACTING)!  I bought this hook, line and sinker.  eerie sounds, camera movements and shadowing are a real highlight.  special effects was used with restraint.  based on a great TRUE STORY? with performances outstanding and direction top notch you can't help but be sucked in.  I do not get alittle rattled but I have to admit--I need to have the lights on...........for awhile.  ps, just a note:  special pkging at BEST BUY gives you a bonus disc with 3 trailers and a 45 min documentary on THE REAL EXORCISTS.  whether you believe in the possibility of possession-this movie give points in each direction--you will have to see it for yourself.  GOOD SHOW!
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|Rihanna returns with her second album \\"A GIRL LIKE ME\\" only 8 months following her debut \\"MUSIC OF THE SUN.\\"  While there are some highlights on the album there is also alot of low points... <br /> <br />Rihanna seems to be at her best, suprisingly, in her R&B efforts rather than her up-tempo regae/hip hop tracks...She shows great range on her second single \\"UNFAITHFUL\\" and introduces us to the more personal side of her... <br /> <br />Many songs display nice production especially on the slower songs including \\"A MILLION MILES AWAY\\" and \\"UNFAITHFUL\\"... <br /> <br />A couple of notes from the album...Tracks \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\\" \\"Dem Haters,\\" and \\"Selfish Girl,\\" sound nearly identical which becomes quite repetitive...Also the chorus from \\"Dem Haters,\\" sounds like it was bit from Def Jam labelmate Kanye West's song \\"Bring Me Down,\\" <br /> <br />Overall though a nice easy listening album for which a broad  type of music fan can listen to and enjoy... <br /> <br />Top 5 Tracks... <br />1. Unfaithful <br />2. A Million Miles Away <br />3. Final Goodbye <br />4. PS(Im Still Not Over You) <br />5. SOS(Rescue Me) <br /> <br />
B00008BXJF|5.0|This is one of my favorite KC releases, even though it is at the opposite end of the spectrum from \\"In The Court....\\" The music is dissonant, punishing,dizzying because of the precision with which it is performed (which is pretty similar to the debut in it's day.) I love \\"Level Five's\\" brutal rhythm shifts and percussive \\"attacks.\\" The use of modern percussion technology adds a very futuristic touch to this track and helps it to reach huge crescendos formerly unattainable by a simple drum kit (not to say that electronics will ever take the place of TALENT, but I feel the use of them on this particular album is very tasteful.)\\"Eyes Wide Open\\" is a catchy, flowing tune that glides smoothly between the heavier instrumental tracks. I'm not a particular fan of instrumental- only music, but the ones offered here have plenty of shifts and moods to hold the attention and can even have your head moving in a \\"banging\\" fashion if you're not careful! \\"Facts Of Life\\" is a techno- metal version of \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and I like Adrian Belew's Beatlesque melodies on some of the later albums. All- in -all, this is very enjoyable, intense listening.
B00006FDCD|4.0|This movie was awesome, like the others said, the book is even better. As much as I hate clowns, I got to make an exception for this guy. Him and Freddy would be a great team. But there's only one thing I didn't like about this movie. And that was the Ending,. But besides that, this movie was awesome.
B000AP04EW|2.0|I was expecting a lot more out of this film after seeing the previews.It was really a stupid film based on a silly storyline. Special effects with nothing to hold them and most definitely no real bystanders standing by in scenes. There weren't any police or security guards or everyday people standing by when the Smiths were shooting up everything everywhere. It's a romantic dream that only Pitt and Jolie would share. I was impressed with Jolie in Taking Lives & have now went back to my original opinion of her starring in surface movies where the acting is at a minimum. Same with Pitt. The special effects and shoot-em up scenes were continually one after the other and the cute lines fell flat. <br />
B0009UC7TS|5.0|This brilliant movie starts out on an inspiring note, with the destruction of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. And then it just gets funnier and better. The puppets appear quite human so that there's no problem with the \\"suspension of disbelief.\\" The heroes are quite fallible but very likable.<br /><br />There's some spectacular cinematography in the Panama Canal scenes and in Egypt, where the Great Pyramid and the venerable Sphinx suffer the same fate as the Eiffel and the Louvre. The Mount Rushmore scenes, (HQ of Team America) are also impressive.<br /><br />Gary is an actor appearing in a Broadway musical when the Team approaches him for help. One of the most gripping scenes is Gary singing lead in a rendition of the hit song Everyone Has AIDS. The camera catches the emotional audience as some individuals shed an elegant, politically appropriate tear or two. Priceless!<br /><br />Things turn even more hilarious with the appearance of the Film Actors Guild (FAG), led by the silver-tongued Alec Baldwin. His speech, interrupted by rapturous desk-thumping by the assembled FAG-ers that include Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn, Jeanine Garofalo and a particularly DUH Matt Damon, is something to cherish. The media comments by some of these esteemed celebrities are equally hilarious.<br /><br />Then there is of course the intercourse, a passionate scene between two attractive teamsters, giving new meaning to Leonard Cohen's album title Various Positions. This is just a short interlude; I didn't find it particularly shock- or noteworthy. People do get up to these types of trick in the grip of passion.<br /><br />Kim Jong Il is definitely a star of the movie with his cute accent and his banally evil personality. I caught myself entertaining thoughts of sympathy for Kim as he fed Hans Blix to his pet sharks. And the feeding itself reminded one again of the awesome savage power of nature. \\"Brix\\" (as Kim called him) learnt a lesson for trying to impose his silly western cultural norms on the beloved leader of North Korea. What arrogance to attempt such a thing!<br /><br />In the meantime, the porcine propagandist, also known as Michael Moore, has caused great damage at the Mount Rushmore HQ by blowing himself up with a suicide jacket. But when things look bleak, Gary returns as the hero. Kim is entertaining the FAG celebrities plus delegations of dignitaries from around the world. This is to distract them while his minions are preparing to set off 230 major bombs around the world.<br /><br />Just in time Gary frees the team, then he uses all his skills as an actor and orator to deliver an eloquent speech that completely upstages Alec Baldwin, the master of ceremonies. The detonation of the bombs is averted and a fight to the death ensues between the Team and the Hollywood actors. A particularly sleazy looking Sean Penn meets his end at the fangs of a big black kitty cat, Sarandon is sliced in two and the others are shot in riveting gun battles.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I sorely missed Parker and Stone's most lovable characters, the Canadian master comedians Terrance and Phillip, whose movie Asses Of Fire contributed so much to making the South Park Movie so unforgettable. A bit of Terrance and Phillip's flatulence and coprofilia would have made this little gem even funnier.<br /><br />Easily bored, I don't like long movies. I am pleased to report that Team America: World Police is just the right length. No scenes are superfluous or too lengthy, and the action sequences are all in the right places. I think it is going to become a cult movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The best songs are the aforementioned Broadway number and Kim's I'm So Ronery ...<br /><br />Team America: World Police has a progressive and subversive message that ought to please everybody across the political spectrum, from the leftist moonbat to the conservative fruitcake and all people with a sense of humour inbetween. The Gnostic nature of Gary's speechwith which he wins over the audience of worldwide dignitaries, is particularly striking. Underneath all the vulgar references to reproductive and other organs, there is a profound message to people who like to ponder these things.<br /><br />I also strongly recommend Stone and Parker's South Park TV series, the movie South Park: Bigger, Better, Uncut and the CD Chef Aid. This talented duo's talents and wicked sense of humour are quite unmatched in popular culture today.ture of Gary's speech with which he wins over the audience of worldwide dignitaries, is particularly striking.

B00005JO20|3.0|Director Peter Jackson doesn't know when to say \\"cut.\\" His well-intentioned remake of \\"King Kong\\" suffers from its excessive three-hour length. The movie finally catches fire during the halfway mark when Kong and Ann Darrow share a quiet moment amid the CGI overkill. Though visually impressive, the 2005 version lacks the epic grandeur of the RKO classic, which delivered the goods in less than two hours. An objective editor could whittle down Jackson's remake to 105 minutes - thereby eliminating a great deal of needless exposition. Not as bad as the 1976 version, but no match for the original \\"Eighth Wonder of the World.\\"
B0000509C4|2.0|me and a couple of friends wanted to rent a scary movie and somehow  we picked this one. what a mistake. it wasn't one bit scary/creepy, and most of the acting was sub-par. we found ourselves laughing at times, which isn't good. the first story was just plain boring. it's about some indian statue that comes to life. 30 minutes of torture. the 2nd story was the best, but that doesn't say much. its about 4 kids who swim out to a raft and some killer blob chases after them. pretty funny stuff. the last story is called the hitchhiker. some parts were funny, but it dragged on way too long. Overall, creepshow 2 doesn't live up to the first. 2 stars for making us laugh.

6304696566|5.0|John Wayne gives us one of his finest performances as a bitter, non-repentant ex-Confederate soldier, whose hate for Indians is boundless.  Yet his character is able to show good humor as well.      The only weak performance is that of Jeffrey Hunter, the other major character in the movie.  The acting seems made for the stage, a bit over the top for the screen.  However, his character's relationship with a girl provides a good balance to the story.  But his character could have matured a bit more, or perhaps even become a bit more like Ethan (Wayne).    There are a couple of stellar secondary character, most notably the preacher, ex-Captain, who also heads the rangers.  It's good to have someone with as strong a will and leadership to compare and compete with Wayne's.    This DVD also has a few nice \\"making of\\" shorts, which is very unusual for a film this old.  One includes an interview with a young Natalie Wood.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|It is refreshing that acting is getting more emphasis in American films. Although she did not get the Oscar, Felicity Huffman's acting deserved it, hands down. (June Carter Cash has sentimental appeal.) I watched the movie forgetting the lead was played by Felicity, and I was convinced Bree Osbourne was a male actor. I could almost recognize him, and I was racking my mind trying to figure it out. Because Bree is biologically male, it seems obvious the role should be male. However, Bree is convinced she is a woman. The movie supports that idea, and a woman should be played by a woman. Felicity's performance is totally convincing. Even knowing it is Felicity, I cannot reconcile the contrast; I do not see Felicity Huffman in Bree Osbourne at all.  <br /> <br />Bree Osbourne convincingly played by a woman is what makes this movie great (5*). Otherwise its just a warm & fuzzy human interest story (4*) with perverse twists that might make me, a viewer, wonder if I'm perverse to be watching it. Well, this movie is not a peep show; come as yourself. <br /> <br />Casting (Eve Battaglia), costumes (Danny Glicker), music (David Mansfield), and supporting actors are all in-tune. The detailing of this movie is spectacular! <br /> <br />It is wonderful watching Bree Osbourne evolve from an insecure, frightened man trying to convince others (and himself?) he is female to a strong, secure, empowered woman. It is awesome the powerful & positive effect Bree Osbourne the woman has on others, vs. the ineffective, inept social interactions of Bree the man. Bree is affected by every other character of the movie. Likewise, no character is untouched by her. I believe no viewer is untouched either. <br /> <br />I'll bet I end up buying a copy.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|I bought this cd for my girlfriend who knew nothing of The Beatles before we started dating.  Now 3 weeks later this cd has not left her player once!  I agree that for the established Beatles fan this cd is not an essential purchase, but for the people who are new to the band it is a great cross-section of songs spanning their whole career.  Thanks to this cd, hopefully many more people will be introduced to these great songs and will in turn dig deaper and get the whole catalogue.
0385338686|4.0|I received this as a gift, and it's the first of Kinsella's books that I've read. I intend to read them all now as I found her writing very funny, light hearted, and very entertaining.  So much lighter in substance than the past few books I've read,<br /><br />\\"the undomestic goddess\\" is the story of Samantha Sweeting and her downfall after making a grave mistake at her job as a lawyer in a very prestigious law firm in London.  She is mistaken as an interviewee for a housekeeping job after she make a mad dash away from being fired.  After hiding out as 'the undomestic goddess' she figures out what she really wants in life....<br /><br />A fantastic fun read!!! THis is a good one for the beach this summer.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|It can sound like hyperbole when comic fans describe their heroes as the mythology of the modern age, but in the hands of a skilled storyteller, we can see that there is more than a little truth to it.  Director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan and co-screenwriter David Goyer play up the mythic elements of the Batman legend, presenting Bruce Wayne (Christain Bale) as a figure driven to combat the evil that destroyed his childhood and warped his personality.  Along the way, we also get a plausible explanation for just why a young billionaire might be obsessed with bats and how he might come up with a Batmobile, a bat suit,and an array of advanced weaponry.   <br /> <br />The real strength of this film is its emphasis on atmosphere and character, so much so that I didn't mind that Batman didn't appear until roughly an hour into the film.  When he does finally show up, it's great.  Highly recommended.
1400079179|5.0|In the first part of the book, I struggled to get through the chapters.  However, after I got through the rough parts where it was impressive amount of history and information given, I was immediately sucked into the story.  I was captivated the entire way through the until the end.  The book had incredible twists and turns throughout, and I was supremely suprised at the way the book ended, but I was not upset at the ending.  I would recommend this book as one of the books that you HAVE to read.  Exceptional.  My kudos to Dan Brown, but I'm sure mine are just a drop in the ever growing ocean of his supporters and fans.
B0000027RL|5.0|We'll never learn.  For years it has always been, \\"Oooo Nirvana's great but Eddie Vedder sucks!\\" Or, it'll be, \\"Pearl Jam is awesome, but Kurt Cobain doesn't know how to write better songs.\\"    This is what happens what the media lumps bands together under an umbrella label.  In this case, it's grunge.  But frankly, comparing Nirvana and Pearl Jam is like apples and oranges.  Pearl Jam is obviously more influenced by classic and blues oriented rock, listen to the leads on this album.  It sticks out like a sore thumb.  But Nirvana was essentially a punk band.  I'm sure everyone agrees that Cobain's point wasn't to write complex guitar-oriented rock.  He had a very primitive, organic way of playing that was unusually unique.  Cobain was a good writer in his own right, and different from the epic rock sound that Pearl Jam had.  So both bands are very much credible.    Apart from all that, Ten is a GREAT album.  As far as combining simply good songs and accessibility, Pearl Jam didn't get any better than this.  It is not my favorite PJ album, but one can't deny the opening riff of \\"Once.\\"  When you hear it, it's like, \\"Oh God, what's happening??\\"  Evenflow and Alive are simply well-written songs.  Why Go is ferocious and energetic.  Jeremy is a song that nearly anyone could relate to, and there's a haunting beauty to it that totally contradicts its subject matter-that's good writing.  Black and Oceans are simply raises the bar very high, so high there's probably few bands that could match that kind of desire and power.    So in it's own right, Ten could be arguably one of the best albums of the 90s.  True, it sold a ton of copies, but you can't knock an album that everyone just gets into. Just because it has sold 12 million in the US and Rolling Stone calls it one of the best doesn't mean it must suck...some albums are just GOOD.      If you're new to PJ, this is the perfect place to start.
1400079179|4.0|I enjoyed reading the DaVinci Code, just like with Angels and Demons, I had a hard time putting it down.  I did enjoy Angels and Demons a bit more, it was faster paced and felt like less of a history lesson.  It was sometimes hard to sort out all of the information laid out in the story but it was well presented and easy to understand.  Whether or not you believe the premise of the novel does not detract from its entertainment value.  I can't help but wonder about all of the contoversy, it is after all a fictional story based on theories and opinions.  I marvel at the amount of research both The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons must have required.  Dan Brown definately did his homework.
B00005JOSS|5.0|To \\"John Q. Public;\\" <br /> <br />You sir, seem to have various frustrations in your personal life that you are obviously taking out on successful, rich hollywood superstars. You claim Sandra Bullock is an idiot, as is Keanu Reeves. Well, sir, both of these \\"idiots\\" as you call them could literally buy and sell your worthless hide one million times, and pay everyone who knows and or is related to you enough money to pretend they never saw it happen. <br /> <br />Perhaps you are sad because in your own life you have never done anything worth talking about, or filming. Maybe girls have discovered you are not worth dating, let alone spending the rest of their lives with. <br /> <br />So let me give you this piece of advice, Mr. John Q.: your type deserves to continue sitting ALONE in dark theatres watching moron movies about which people of your kind usually find interesting; specifically, those movies that divert their attention from the fact that they will NEVER find love of their own, and will most likely be alone their entire lives and live with their parents.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is Jazz 101, just listen to this creamy relaxing sound.  The very defination of Jazz.  Warm and naked.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong there are a great many great Jazz selections out there, but this production defines the genre.  Will we ever know it's like again?  Non commercial, and as fresh, and timeless today, as the day it was produced.<br /><br />Got a dinner date, turn the lights down low, put on \\"Kind Of Blue\\" for a very memorable evening.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|This concert, is moving. You can see and hear for yourself the total love and emotion all the musicians and audience were givin to the memory and music of George Harrison. I was particulary moved by Eric Clapton playing and singing Something, Paul McCartney singing All Things Must Pass and the late great Billy Preston doing It isnt a Pitty and My Sweet Lord. You can feel Eric Clapton s' playing with absolute emotion and passion on this concert. The songs were all very well chosen but with some strange omitions such as Your Love is Forever or What is Life among many other great George Harrison songs. I recomend you to get the cd and also de DVD.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|All the songs on these cd's are amazing! Each song has its unique style and I love the variety in their songs.  Overall an awesome cd.
B000F48D3C|5.0|If you have the original version of Black Hawk Down, go ahead and give it away, sell it, use it as a coaster, etc.  This version is exactly how a redux is done. <br /> <br />I can go on and on analyzing this movie and giving legitimate reasons why you should go get this movie now -- I should know because I have literally watched the original version about 50 times, give or take a few dozen (I am NOT exaggerating!) -- however, I will save you the time of reading and assure you that this version is BETTER!!  Do not let the seemingly mere 8 minutes of extra footage fool you... it is practically a completely new movie.  The visuals and audio are superbly remastered.  Hands down, hands down [on this one!]!
B00005JNRY|5.0|If Pixar can pull off an excellent movie about talking cars, they can do anything.    When I first heard about Cars, I was a bit underwhelmed.  Talking cars?  Well, Pixar had hit gold with talking fish but...cars?  I personally had doubts about this movie, but when I came out of watching it, I was very satisfied and pleasantly suprised.    Much like Pixar's previous films, Cars is a story diven film.  And with only three real action scenes in the entire film (two at the beginning, one at the end), it depends on it's story to stay afloat and keep the audience interested.  And i'm happy to say that the film kept my interest the entire way through.    Cars follows a hot and fast upcoming racer named Lightning McQueen, a racecar who will stop at nothing to get to the top and become the champion.  However, on his way to a tie-breaker race, he becomes lost in a little route 66 town that's fallen off the map.  Here, high and mighty ego clashes with small town slowness and McQueen undergos a personal journey to find himself and what really matters in his life.    When trying to think of negatives for this movie...I can't think of any. There really is nothing wrong with Cars. There are no weak points that immediatly come to mind. It pulls your emotions in the right directions at the right time and for the right amount of time.  I laughed, chuckled and applauded at all the right moments (especially the farting tractors).  So did everyone else in the theater.  Even side charachters, some of whom have only a few lines, are strong and well played.  I'd say that there are no weak charachters in Cars, something that is all too rare these days.  Even those who don't really contribute to the plot (the surplus military jeep for example) are fun to watch.  This is a great film that anyone can watch and enjoy, though action fans might find themselves a bit bored during most of the movie.  It has a great message (sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself), morals about what's really important in life, and what's worth winning, and so much more.  Heck, even a malfunctioning stoplight is enjoyable to watch.  Everyone in the theater that I attended had a blast and enjoyed watching the movie.    Cars is easily one of the best films of the year, the kind that you can't stop raving about, and is almost certianly going to be the main contender for best animated feature. This is annother winner for Pixar, and is a great film that everyone should watch at least once.     Oh, and be sure to stay for the credits. Trust me on this one.
B000F0UV0E|3.0|I love Emmylou Harris and I like Mark Knopfler. Looking at most of the reviews on Amazon, people seem to either give this cd 5 stars or 2...I think it's in between. The songs are good. Not great, but good - the title track is my favorite - and all are very listenable. The singing is the mixed bag here. Knopfler has said that Don Williams is a a big influence on his singing and it's never been more evident than here, but Williams is a better singer. On the other hand, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better singer in the world than Emmylou Harris and her voice shines on these songs like it always does.<br /><br />\\"All The Roadrunning\\" could have been a stunning album. Instead, it is just good - and way better than most of the dreck flooding the airwaves today.
B00006EXL5|5.0|Let me just first say that personally, I think this CD is 10x better than MCR's second album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Every song from Lady of Sorrows, Skylines and Turnstile, to Vampires Will Never Hurt you are mind blowing songs. The passion that Gerard Way uses in his vocals to the harmonizing melodies of the guitars are nothing like I've ever heard before and every song tells a different story. Of all the CD's I've ever owned this one still remains to be my ulimate favorite.
B00005JCAA|4.0|I watched this movie by accident on tv, nothing much to do so why not...   <br />For me it was for 4 hours long with commercials.  <br />I am not Brad Pitt's fan, as far as I was concerned, he was over-rated(mind you, I am a girl). <br /> <br />Very intriguing movie and actor, I have to admit. <br />Even Death himself can love a woman enough to bring back to her the man she truly loves...  That's touching. <br />I am going to get my own dvd and will enjoy watching it without any interuption. <br />Overall, it was very entertaining. <br />
B00003003R|4.0|This album, with all its mystery (recorded all over the universe-when? where? what line up? ) came well after the fact and first off serves to remind us that this was (is?) one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Every song is top shelf and even as a two disc live set, leaves many of the classic tracks off, in itself a testament to the quality of the material this band produced. <br /> <br />As a live album it serves well the legacy of their performances that were always memorable if not classic. <br /> <br />All in all, an incredible album and a must for any rock fans collection
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I just don't understand why people even bother to put down albums they don't get.  If you don't like it, move on!  I listen to a huge spectrum of styles, and just the word 'pretentious' makes me pissed.  Music is to be enjoyed, not picked apart.  This is a hugely entertaining album, and whether I play it alot or not, doesn't mean it's not good.  It pleases the ears.  Isn't that enough?
0394733932|2.0|I had to find another version after i stupidly bought this.  It was like $1.00 in the new and used section, I am very dissapointed.  I since have gone out and gotten the full version of the 3 kingdoms. Is is well over 1000 pages long and it is STILL A FREAKING ABRIDGED VERSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But the fact that this is just a brief summary(300 pages long), I have to tell you to find the full Moss Roberts version, if there even is one.  I would suggest you find the FULL version that you can find proof of before you buy it, just liek I will be doing.  I have started this book and read it for over 7 hours yesterday.  I already realy want to learn chinese now already to read the full full version and not have to miss out on everything the translation doesn't give us.  So do not buy this and make sure you look long and hard to find the right version, cause i have already bought 2.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I am not a big movie watcher, mainly because there isn't all that much worth watching, but this one certainly is. I even went out and bought the DVD. My whole family loved it. Emma Thompson was especially superb. She can communicate so much in a very subtle expression. It was so nice to see a movie for children that didn't have bad language, inappropriate subject matter or bad behavior that was glorified. Here the participants in the bad behavior were held accountable and suffered the consequences of their actions. I loved the transformation of Nanny McPhee from something hated and ugly to something loved and beautiful. How often in life does our perception of one's outward appearance change as we come to know the person within?
B00000IL67|4.0|If you saw \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" in concert and you remember buy \\"School's Out\\" when it was a new release then you might want to rethink buying this collection. A lot of the song that made Alice Cooper the Alice Cooper we know and love are missing. Even a few of the ol standards are missing. Where's Hallowed Be My Name,\\" \\"Second Coming,\\" \\"Halo of Flies,\\" \\"Luney Tune,\\" \\"My Stars,\\" \\"Cold Turk,\\" \\"Black Widow,\\" \\"Nurse Rozetta\\" \\" and \\"Sick Things\\" just to name a few?<br />For a lot of those with a closet full of vinyl we look at them and say man those would be nice on CD or MP3 so we learn how to transfer them and realize through real eyes that it will take forever get finished before we die. So the bright idea of buying a box set pops into our aging minds. Only to find out that the box set is missing much of what made that group the group there are. That you've been short changed and the real body of the work is just not there.<br />Well anyway, if you are an ol school fan then buy the ablum titles as opposed to the box set, if you are new fan this will be a nice introduction to the world of Cooper. But be advised you are missing a lot of classic work with this collection, to truely understand most of the song and the work you need to hear the entire album. Take \\"Welcome to My Nightmare,\\" and \\"From the Inside\\" they are story albums you just can't pull one chapter out and say you've read the book. It doesn't work. Even \\"Under My Wheels\\" is not the original release is a much later remake.<br />So if you remember when the old stuff was new, buy the old stuff on CD and don't expect to get your fill on this BOX SET it is missing far to many song. If you are the passing listener, the fly-by-fan then this might work for you. It's a nice collection just missing far to many classics and obscure gems. I was going to add a list but it's far to long.<br />I'm giving it 4 stars because it does have a lot of great songs on it, but I'm holding one back because it's missing a lot of others. I'd really give it 3 1/2 if I could. This collection really should have been an 5 or 6 disc, you just can't do justice to 35 years worth of work in 4 disc, in my opinion. Buy it if you must, but I'd rather have the individual title from '65-'80, pretty much most stuff after that is hit and miss at best. As for me I'm getting full disc from he early days, just to much missing here. I good collection that could have been better, the quality is good and selection is nice for those just starting out on Alice, ol schoolers might feel shorted.ally give it 3 1/2 if I could.

B00005JOVN|4.0|Could have gone a bit deeper with characters. Pretty good overall.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|For starters, I couldn't get anyone to watch it with me. Then there was either something wrong my ears, or my sound, cos Jake Gyllenhall & Heath Ledger seemed to mumble all their lines! It got very annoying, and I kept turning the sound up 'til nearly as far as it would go. Then the sex scenes are actually filmed in nearly complete darkness, so it's very difficult to see what actually is going on, but it's also very well done. But then they just seem to be sleeping, and the next thing you know is one is jumping on the other ... you know the rest.<br /><br />I quite liked both Jake & Heath in this, apart from the constant smoking, and the rest of the actors in this are amazing. Michelle Williams, playing a dowdy character for once in her life, is simply amazing as Ennis' on screen wife (and off screen), the scene where she discovers her husband's betrayal will bring a lump to anyone's throat, although it's implied in her previous scenes that she knows. Anne Hathaway takes her first major step away from The Princess Diaries & Ella Enchanted, by playing a bit of a cow, and doing her first blink-and-you'll-miss-it topless scene. Randy Quaid & Anna Faris also appear in this, as unrecognisable characters, I didn't actually realise it was them until reading the cast list.<br /><br />There is no other love story like this out there, and can play itself out without much in the way of dialogue, apart from half way through. Heath & Jake both took a major risk getting involved with this film, but they both pulled it off with little embarrassment. Ang Lee and all actors didn't shy away from the material put in front of them, they got on and did it and pulled out an unforgettable film.<br /><br />The ending is heartbreaking, and unforgettable, but also unpredictable. I did not see this coming. The almost final shots of their shirts together, and a postcard of Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />This is a very hard film to review, second only to United 93. If you've known love, you'll be hit by a ton of bricks watching this film, it's so emotional, and really tugs at the heart strings. It's a film that some people will never see, but should.you'll be hit by a ton of bricks watching this film, it's so emotional, and really tugs at the heart strings.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|I've never seen the classic of King Kong, so I didn't know what to expect. It seemed interesting with everybody saying this movie is very good and long. Well I love those type of movies, especially long ones, so I decided to watch this one. <br /> <br />This movie has a very good story to it and the cast is just perfect. Naomi Watts does a wonderful job in her part, along with the other characters. The special effects were awesome and they did a wonderful job in making the movie seem so realistic. I hate those wildlife bugs, so I had to look away for a second when all these huge insects started coming. This movie actually takes place on a island. This is where King Kong lives, and lives a lonely life. Throughout the movie you'll get to know who King Kong is all about and you'll most likely feel sorry for him at the end of the movie. I know I did. <br /> <br />Overall, I find this movie very good. If you're into long and adventure movies, then I suggest that you pick this DVD up. Even if you're not, at least give it a rent. I'll garauntee you that you won't be disappointed.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|TEDIOUS - I could not finish watching this film. My husband, a former Marine Infantry Officer, rented it.   This movie tried to be an update of Full Metal Jacket with Swofford as the Joker character.  It fails except in its stereotypical portrayal of Marines as a bunch of sexually obsessed, masturbating loosers.  Puhlease.  A decent soundtrack but a waste of time.  Watch Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket instead - a better soundtrack. <br /> <br />Save your money. <br />
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is one of those movies that I've watched over and over again.  I was never a big Guy Ritchie fan until I watched Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  The fact that Brad Pitt was in this one was also a plus.  Brad Pitt is once again a genius.  He plays an Irishish (such a word?) gypsy who is also a bare knuckle boxer.  This movie is a fast moving story which keeps you riveted to the seat as people are shot, fed to pigs, and the two main characters, Turkish and Tommy are hysterical!  The humor in this movie is so dry.  I fully recommend this movie and I don't want to say anymore because I don't want to give away the story.  You MUST see it. <br />
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|You don't have to be political to love V for Vendetta. The artistic themes and fantastic symbolism are what makes this film a masterpiece. It wouldn't have as many critics if people would not think about the political message for one moment, even though that is a large part of it, and look at it instead in a literary sense. The symbolism is amazing, the psychology magnificent, the characters awesome and entertaining. If any of this interests you, so will V for Vendetta.
0515141429|4.0|\\"Who is this Lee Child?\\"  Because of the enormous recent publicity for this author, I asked this of a friend I saw at a party.  He drew back in obvious surprise.  Within an hour I had his whole library of Lee Child.  <br /> I had already started Killing Floor when I learned Lee Child would be appearing at a local bookstore.  So I took a teenaged budding writer with me to hear Child.  I was concerned that perhaps no one would show.  NOT TO WORRY!  More chairs!  More chairs!  <br /> Child is a tall Englishman with a great sense of humor, is quick on the uptake and totally entertains his admirers with a very funny presentation.  After a query about Reacher from a tight-jean female, he seemed baffled of why women were so \\"crazy\\" about this character.  He wonders?  Jack Reacher is the alpha male.  Say what you want about the metro man, the sensitive man, the poetic guy, women love a man of decision and principles, especially an attractive one who is 6'5\\" (despite occasional  heavy-duty grime).  Subsequently, I've sold Child to numerous friends who are enjoying his series immensely, as do I.   <br />Now, who is this Jack Sheldon? <br />
0930289234|5.0|One of my \\"comic book nerd\\" friends kept telling me I should read Watchmen, after about 3 months of putting it off, I finally picked it up one day when I was bored... WOW!  Watchmen was quite possibly the best graphic novel I have read.. EVER.. (Dark Knight Strikes Again is close).  The characters are amazing, the story is amazing, everything is so amazing I wish there were more Watchmen comics!<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who knows anything about comics, or anyone who just wants an amazing book to read!
B0009RCPY8|3.0|I have been a long-time fan of the ghostbuster movies and real ghostbusters tv show (I haven't seen extreme ghostbusters). Regarding the movies though, I've noticed that people have given them mixed reviews. Some prefer the first ghostbusters over ghostbusters II and that's fine. As for me, I think both are equally good. What I can't understand is why some people think that ghostbusters II isn't near as good as the first. Both were well writen, well acted, and had a good mix of comedy and spookiness. Plus, the evil ghost in the painting was creepy, the river of slime was creative, the statue of liberty effects were classic, and the positron slime guns that Ray and Egon created added a nice feature. Honestly, what's not to like about ghostbusters II? Moving on to the DVDs... For the ghostbusters dvd, the picture/sound transfer has been upgraded, there are a good number of features such as ten deleted scenes, making of featurettes from 1984 & 1999, art concepts, storyboards, and a special effects featurette. Ghostbusters received the treatment it deserved. As for the ghostbusters II dvd, the picture/sound transfer has been upgraded as well and the bonus features include two episodes from the real ghostbusters series. This is where the lackluster treatment comes in. Only one of these episodes \\"Citizen Ghost\\" is good in my opinion. It was a great tie-in between the ghostbuster movies. The other episode \\"Partners In Slime\\" is from the later Slimer & the Real Ghostbusters series which by the way was not good and too childish. Aside from having only one good episode as a bonus feature, there are no more bonus features to speak of. This is a real letdown considering that there was 20 minutes worth of deleted scenes occasionally aired on network television over the years. Not only that, but there was a 30 minute Oprah interview back in 1988 which featured almost the entire cast from ghostbusters II. And what about featurettes, storyboards, production notes, showing special effects, and all that other stuff? I simply don't see any reason for ghostbusters II not getting the same dvd treatment as the original ghostbusters. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if a special edition director's cut dvd eventually comes out for ghostbusters II which I seriously would like to happen soon. Now if you own the previous releases of Ghostbusters I & II, keep those because the bonus material for the first ghostbusters is the same and though the the two real ghostbuster episodes aren't on the previous ghostbusters II dvd, the fact that you can view the movie in widescreen is a good enough reason to keep it.
B0000025DV|5.0|... as ELO's masterpiece, up there with the best audio achievements of the pre-digital age.  Thirty years later I still listen through every song on all four sides, and even better don't have to get up and flip the LP stack!  Highly deserving of each of its rated five stars.
B00080ZG10|5.0|This film was long, yes.  But honestly, I didn't know it was three hours long until it was over and I looked at the clock!  Mostly, it is an interesting remake of history, portraying a genius of a man and his love of flying.  The best scene: the crash.  You have to see the crash.  If for no other reason, this scene is the most spectacular scene.  Leonardo DeCaprio did an excellent acting job in this film.   <br /> <br />Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but really, if you don't get it, just step off!!!  I disagree with anyone who says this movie was the least bit dull.  It should have won multiple awards.  Here's a suggestion:  watch it again!!!!
B0006399FS|5.0|HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB IS SO FAR AHEAD OF JOSHUA TREE THAT IT IS IN A DIFFERENT LEAGUE. JT IS GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT.       THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. THERE ARE MAYBE ONE OR TWO SONGS THAT AREN'T GREAT ON HTDAAB. JT HAS AT LEAST 4 OR 5 SONGS THAT ARE PRETTY BORING.    IN MY OPINION, THE FOLLOWING SONGS ARE ALL AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN ANY SONG ON JOSHUA TREE.    MIRACLE DRUG  LOVE & PEACE  CITY OF BLINDING LIGHTS  ALL BECAUSE OF YOU  A MAN AND A WOMAN  CRUMBS FROM YOUR TABLE  ORIGINAL OF THE SPECIES  YAHWEH    VERTIGO IS A GOOD POP ROCK SONG AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN IS PRETTY GOOD.
B000000993|2.0|I just don't understand the appeal of this album. When this debuted, I picked it up on a whim, and hated it immensely, causing me to ignore Tool entirely for the next howevermany years. After finally listening to the excellent Aenima and Lateralus, returning to this actually removes the bias I once had, but that doesn't mean this is any good. Almost totally devoid of their later prog sound, I get bored almost instantly with their 'crash and yell' style of alt rock/metal. Somehow, I sat through this whole mess long enough to pick out a few sunspots. The drumming is decent, not on par with their newer sound, and the song Prison Sex, however obvious, isn't too bad of a song. Otherwise, the spoken portion of Bottom is incredibly stupid, and the meandering Disgustipated makes me want to tear my hair out in blood soaked clumps. I can't believe the praise this album recieves when Tool's future was so much brighter. Even Opiate was slightly better than this.
B00065MDSG|5.0|A very good attempt by King Crimson on this set, using new singer, future Asia singer John Wetton, which is also on bass. Well anyways, this whole album is pretty inspiring with beggining to the end concepts. Starting with the title track which really rocks after the first 3 to 4 minutes of cymbals and xylaphones. Book of Saturday a little soft pretty good as far as sound goes. Exile a little more into the prog. My favorite on this album Easy Money, a lot here sounding as it could have gone on Dark Side of the Moon, as they were working on Money at the time, just a kick a** rocking tune with a kick a** beat to it. Then you get back into prog again with The Talking Drum, and the reprisal of Larks' Tongue in Aspic. Just a really good beginner album for those who never listened King Crimson, but heard of them. I would also prefer Three of a Perfect Pair too, very good and trippy.
B000F48CD8|3.0|Ive been pumped about this release since i first heard Jack White would be teaming with Brenden Benson about a year ago.  Upon hearing it i must say im a little dissapointed, not because this is a bad record, but because my expectations were so high.  The album is short and sweet, which makes for a smooth enjoyable listen, but for as good as song writers as White and Benson are, this album is lacking.  There some bright spots, Broken Boy Solider might be the coolest song White has recorded since White Blood Cells, Steady As She Goes is good too, Intimate Secretary has some cool things going on. There are just too many mediocre songs for such a short album.  Hands is an enjoyable listen, but i cant help but think im listening to Radiohead's The Bends (the song not the album) everytime i hear that opening guitar riff.  Together is another enjoyable listen, but uses a pretty standard chord progression, which from a song writing perspective, seems like taking the easy way out.  The lyrics leave something to be desired as well.  Steady As She Goes and Broken Boy Solider are the only songs that are interesting lyrically.  Im not one to discredit an album do to unintersting lyrics, I usually look at good lyrics as an added bonus to a good song, but Benson, who is a clever lyricist, seems to have gotten lazy with his songs.  Lines like \\"can we call it a day, now would that be okay\\"  or \\"Yellow sun is shining in the afternoon\\" Both just seem like lame ways to start off songs.  It'd be one thing to sneack boring lines like that in the middle of the song where they'd go less noticed, but to open songs like that just says to me that he wasnt giving it his all.   <br /> <br />If your a die hard Jack White and/or Brendon Benson fan, then you probably already have this one, if your a casual White or Benson fan than i would reccomend having one of your die hard White Stripes fan friends burn it for you.
B000002UA0|4.0|This is perhaps the trippiest album for its time, can you imagine listening to this coming off a LSD trip, SCARY huh. Well either way this album is just as important in 1967 as so of Sgt. Pepper, and just as good. It starts with Astronomy Domine, which takes you directly into space rock, and it even speaks of space with Jupiter and Saturn, with the moons and the mumble in the beginning with their manager taking thru a megaphone. Then you got Lucifer Sam, which sounds like it came right out of a 007 movie back in the 60's, this song was named after Roger Waters. And then you get into a Mother Goose form with Matilda Mother, and very English I might say, and also a little of it spilled over into Flaming. Now Pow R. Toc H., that's the sounds they use in that song, but mostly instrumental. The next song Waters wrote and it's got the sarcasm liking of Corporal Clegg from the next album Saucerful of Secrets. Interstellar Overdrive, perhaps the coolest song on this album, which was also use in the soundtack 'Tonite Lets Make Love', just pure trippy. Then you get back into fairy tale mode again with The Gnome, and almost biblical with Chapter 24. The Scarecrow is a clackity clack type song, and Bike is just pure insanity with the jack in the box affect at the end, creepy. Yep Syd Barrett is all over this gem, but as we get to the next album, he tends to fade away, as all Crazy Diamonds do. But this album should be in every Floyd keepsake.
B0000942LT|3.0|This CD was some how misfiled in the metal racks of the music store. A mistake, you'd have to think. The heaviest that 14 Shades of Grey gets is in the first song \\"Price To Play\\" which curiously was the album's commercial single. Maybe that says something in itself - the heavy stuff is (or used to be) what brought the fans in the door for Staind, not the 3 Doors Down-style rock. <br /> <br />Anyway, the album itself isn't a complete disaster. It hangs together with some reasonable melodies, but there's just a certain sameness, and slowness, that puts this release light years away from Staind's very good album, Dysfunction. Sure, bands mature and grow up, but that doesn't mean they have to put on the brown cardigans.
1932907009|5.0|Blake Snyder's \\"Save The Cat\\" is one of the most pleasant surprises I've ever had when it comes to screenwriting how-to books. Not only is it filled with the kind of easy-to-digest, memorable hooks you need to make sure your own are going to get the job done, it's also highly entertaining, the kind of book even those with no interest in the business side of the film business would enjoy. (If only more executives green-lighting pictures would take the time to follow his advice.)  It's easy to see why Mr. Snyder has been such a success himself--his words are funny, smart and spare.  Save the Cat is so smart and on the money in fact, that it should be the bible for every executive in Hollywood.  As a writer actively pursuing the dream, I can say, without question, Save the Cat is the best book on the actual craft of screenwriting I've read since Syd Field's original work, and frankly, I found Mr. Snyder's book a lot more fun to read. I'm already using it to \\"fix\\" several screenplays that I have in the works. I've recommended it to other writers I know, and their responses to it are equally enthusiastic.  Buy this book.  In fact, buy two, because if you're working on a screenplay, I guarantee you will dog-ear the living daylights out of the first one.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I wouldn't go so far as the New York Post in calling this film \\"the 'Star Wars' of animated features,\\" but certainly Princess Mononoke is a vibrant, magical movie that resonates with life in all its facets and the spirit that lies beneath this world we too often take for granted.  It's funny how American animated films are always about - well, nothing at all, really, while Japanimation is about basically everything.  To me, dubbing this film into English, no matter how talented and famous the voice actors are, just feels wrong.  Certainly, it helps attract a Western audience that has still only begun to discover the wonders of anime and makes the story much easier for younger viewers to understand, but anime purists will probably want to watch the film as it was originally intended to be shown - and, fortunately, it is possible to change the setup to play the movie in Japanese with English captioning.  Speaking of younger viewers, the film does deserve its PG-13 rating, as more than a few characters lose their heads - literally - and animals are slaughtered in significant numbers during several scenes of fighting and warfare.<br /><br />Princess Mononoke is not so much the story of the princess herself as it is of young Ashitaki, a young warrior who journeys many miles westward in search of a cure for the demon curse transferred unto him by a giant boar demon he managed to kill when it attacked his village.  The odds of him finding and being healed by the Spirit of the Forest are pretty low, making this as much of a spiritual journey as a physical one with a clear purpose.  He and his noble elk steed do find the place, however, after a brief sojourn in Iron Town.  The humans in this fortified village have been clearing away forest so that they can mine the iron ore that exists within the soil in great abundance.  For her part, Lady Eboshi is working to perfect the guns she will use to defend Iron Town from those casting greedy eyes upon it even as she plots with hunters sent by the emperor to slay the Spirit of the Forest himself.  The animal gods of the forest, seeing the human threat now close to destroying their final peaceful retreat, gird up for battle themselves, particularly the boars and the wolves.  Among the wolves is Princess Mononoke, a human girl raised by wolves; she hates all humans for their greedy, destructive ways - a fact which rather complicates the personal bond she eventually comes to share with Ashitaki.<br /><br />It's a rather complicated story, really, but it all culminates with the seemingly unavoidable armed clash of men, gods, and animals - a war that Ashitaki desperately tried to prevent.  Already dying from the demon curse, Ashitaki, a warrior hero with sympathies for both sides of the fight, risks all in an effort to save both the princess and the Spirit of the Forest himself.  You can never take anything for granted in Japanese anime, particularly in terms of who lives and who dies, and this makes the final moments of the film all the more captivating - not to mention poignant.  In a war that can have no true winners, what of the world will be left for those who manage to survive?<br /><br />The animation (which is from 1997) is not all that breath-taking on the face of things; at first, I really couldn't see why it is praised so highly.  As you get into the story, however, and see the absolute importance of nature, as represented in the animation, you quietly become more and more impressed.  The scenes with the little forest sprites are especially magical - they are most unusual creatures, really quite simple in terms of their animated form, but they prove magical indeed as representatives of the forest and the beauty of nature.  The Spirit of the Forest is equally engaging, and much more impressive and majestic in each of his forms.  All of the characters are quite expressive, in fact, revealing as much through the animation as they do with their voices.  That is one reason the movie works sowell even with English dubbing.<br /><br />If you've yet to experience anime, I can't think of a better introduction than Princess Mononoke.  With the English dubbing, the viewer is free to take in the whole animated experience (something that would take a second viewing for a movie with subtitles) and see just what makes Japanese animation superior to anything you'll ever see come out of Hollywood.  Hayao Miyazaki didn't make a film, he created a vibrant new universe that will transport viewers back to a medieval age when iron was new and animals still ruled the forests.  Not content to merely entertain, the film addresses a number of questions that get right to the heart of human life itself, touching on themes of love, hate, honesty, community, heroism, selflessness, life, death, stewardship of the Earth, etc.  With only a short featurette and a theatrical trailer, the DVD doesn't have much in the way of special features, but the movie alone more than makes Princess Mononoke worth the price of admission, rental, or purchase.  Don't forget: until Titanic squeaked by it, this was the top-grossing film (and still remains the top-grossing domestic film) in Japanese history.dubbing.

B00005S6K6|5.0|I came across this film quite by accident one morning while channel surfing and became totally wrapped up in it.Why this movie didn't click with a larger audience when it was first released, I will never understand. It's a woman's flick. A love story. But also a wonderful showcase for the talents -- and chmistry -- between Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro. Did you love Meryl in Bridges of Madison County with Clint Eastwood? Then you will love this. And I don't think I've ever seen Robert DeNiro more at ease in a love story than he is in this. When you watch this movie, keep observing the body language and facial expressions of the two stars -- most especially in the final  scene of the film. (I don't think Meryl has ever looked more beautiful). If you've never seen this film, you owe it to yourself to rent or buy the dvd.
0684824906|5.0|Well researched.  Guess no more, Lincoln was a great man. Good for him to take advice from all sides.  If only that could happen in our present society.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Alanna Nash needs to take long walk on a short pier.  \\"Underwhelming?\\"  Please.  This is Mark Knopfler's best record since Sailing to Philadelphia at least, if not Neck and Neck.  The songs are perfect jewels with beautiful melodies and great lyrics.  And the interplay of Knopfler's and Harris' voices is sublime.  If you like Mark Knopfler I guarantee you will like this album. <br /> <br />Every time I listen to this record it just sounds better and better.  My only regret is that the tour will not be coming to the northwest of the USA.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|I saw this band first on myspace, in their picture - sitting in the middle of them - was a dog. I had to laugh because here are all these bands on myspace trying to look so serious & cool.. And these 2 guys are focusing more on the dog than themselves.. Funny how marketing can be so effective when done completely differently.  That, combined with the band name which I thought was really cool, 'Band of Horses', I had to give them a chance & check out their music.    I first heard 'Funeral', then 'The Great Salt Lake'... Within 5 minutes of the second song ending, I immediately came here to amazon to purchase the album.  The first thing I noticed was just how amazing of a singer the guy is... He's possibly the best singer since Jeff Buckley himself.. His voice is incredible... How does he sing like that? I had to hear the rest of the album.    When it arrived, I also noticed how cool the cover art was... And into my walkman it went.  From beginning to end, I was very impressed.  Over time, I've come to like this album even more.. The song 'Monsters' especially sticks out & just has such an original rock-irish feel to it.. His voice really shines on this track.    The whole album is enjoyable start to finish, but the 4 main standout tracks are 'The First Song', 'Funeral', 'The Great Salt Lake', & 'Monsters'.    This is the best debut album since the Arcade Fire released 'Funeral' (odd coincidence) in 2004 - These 2 bands I believe will in time replace the Pixies & Dinosaur Jr. as underground indie icons, I strongly suggest getting both.     On a side note.. I picked up the new Tool album aswell as the new RHCP album this year, & I don't think either one is as good as 'Everything All the Time'.    I still think Pearl Jam's new self-titled album is the best album of the year (I know, they're not indie & now you're gonna click \\"no\\" on whether or not the review is helpful) but I would say this album is third behind that & Neil Young's 'Living With War'.      NOTE: For youpeople giving this album 5 stars... Please, get real.  Be more subjective.  This isn't a 5 star album & everyone knows it.  The album is only 36 minutes long! It's not like every song is great or that good.. There's just no real bad songs.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|I got talked into watching a movie that I didn't really want to see. The good thing is that I found it to be more interesting than I would have guessed. Like many others, I felt that is was long. I feel there were at least two or three segments that could have been shortened while still accomplishing what was needed or essential to the movie. In general, I am not too interested in remakes of classics, so I decided to do this review for others that may have a spouse or friend that talks them into it. I think it will be better than you thought. Just make sure you have your popcorn and drinks.

B000AP04FG|1.0|Unless you just like to look at pretty people, this movie has nothing to offer.  It is boring beyond belief.  There is no story line!!  Well, something might develop in the second half because we just walked away.  I couldn't believe that this had as high a rating as it does.  What I saw was meaningless, unrealistic and just plain stupid.
B000F1IQN2|1.0|Wow, after so much hype I was really looking forward to Munich. But Spielberg is at his worst here. For example, at the beginning, the Olympic hostage drama is played out but the viewer is given so little information that it's hard to put everything together.  <br /> <br />I am very familiar with the historic events and I could place the scenes of the movie in perspective. But I watched it with some friends who had no prior knowledge and they were just left guessing at what actually happened. This is just horrible story-telling. <br /> <br />As the movie goes on, Spielberg tries to capture the European atmosphere while furterhing his plot, but it doesn't flow at all. One example are the numerous subtitles during dialogues. Some of them convey important ethical content, but to keep up with the pace of the scene, they are hard to read and disappear too fast - and I'm usually a speed-reader.  <br /> <br />Another example is scene switching between international locations without much warning. One time you're sitting in a German beergarden, the next you're in a shop in Italy without much warning. I have been to most of those European countries and can tell them apart by sight, but it's way too confusing in the movie. <br /> <br />Whatever meaningful story Spielberg was trying to weave together it all breaks apart with his bad story-telling. It's a shame because Spielberg is capable of better , but this one isn't worth watching. Just read a book or surf the web and you'll learn more about the actual events than watching this movie. <br /> <br />
B00025G2K0|3.0|This is a story within a story.  Cal. a Vietnam vet, used the GI bill to obtain his law degree.  His blue collar background, along with his war experiences, turn him into the avenger, the righter of wrongs.  His reputation was founded on the ability to stay objective as he seeks retribution for unlawful activities, and can be hired to avenge any crime, large or small.  After all she'd been through, a victim unknowingly of her own making, she feels the necessity of punishment to those jokers who had made her life a paragon of pain and misery.  All because the one man she had trusted refused involvement.    In a world in which right and wrong has been seemingly forgotten, she decided that it would take a special, dedicated lawyer to obtain justice.  We must not allow this evil group of voyeurs to go unpunished.  They'd read everything she wrote for six years and one of them became jealous enough to try to make her believe he's turned on her.  For some reason, she hadn't questioned that some of the messages were unsigned, others with his first name, the rest with the full name (false, it turned out to be).   How could she have been so deceived for so long, although at times she felt he couldn't possibly have been so curt and hurtful.      When \\"he\\" (the one with no 'superego' a conscience) used all caps to prove his point, she just knew something bad was wrong.  He would never do such a thing to prove a point, never.  But when she heard that what had been going on was impossible, she'd reacted ferociously; something drastic had to be done to stop this thing from ballooning further.  So, she engaged the services of the avenger, whose connections enabled him to discover the facts and find her some satisfaction -- in court.  Case closed, or is it?    Forsyth has written the popular 'Odessa File,' 'The Deceiver' and 'The Devil's Alternative.'  He researches his novels, as did Phyllis Whitney, then writes them in a frenzy in no time at all.  That takes talent!
B000EOTAM6|2.0|It's crazy because Aeon Flux is the first movie I've seen where the beginning feels like the end. When Aeon Flux was released I read reviews saying that if you've never seen the anime series that this is a hard movie not only to understand but also to sit through since you don't really know that much about it's past. This film feels like it's bringing closure to it's fans and all that says is that it's only for fans. Besides the fact that I attempted to watch this movie a little blind somehow it started to get a little boring and it wasn't because of the story. As much as I love Charlize she played this character too stiff. The rest of the cast was very weak especially Trevor (Marton Csokas) and I thought he would play the part pretty good.<br /><br />In the beginning they do their best to let newcomers know what's going on in the films past and present, they do a pretty good job informing and you're not all that in the dark. Aeon Flux's intelligence and cinematography actually start to exceed the actor's talents and it becomes a little hard for them to handle. The camera angles could have been a lot better, a lot of times your missing good fight scenes because the camera is somewhere else other than the action. Overall Aeon Flux could have been done better than this; it's missing a lot of key elements. The story is very appealing but this film missed the potential the live action movie should have. What really makes this movie a little good is the beautiful scenes of the future. The fight scenes were Ok but like I said earlier the camera angles killed them.
B000002GXX|3.0|How contradictory is that The Eagles' first album completely recorded without Glyn Johns is nearly a yawn considering they had quit working with him because supposedly they wanted to get more into rock and roll than he had allowed them to. Also wry is the fact that, while inferior to the underrated On The Border, One of These Nights would be more successful. You can rarely trust the public's opinion.<br /><br />Now with the songs:<br /><br />-One Of These Mights. While having a cool bass/guitar intro, a nice solo and amazing falsetto vocals by Randy Meisner, the song drags on a little and if it were a minute shorter it would gain a lot.<br /><br />-Too Many Hands. The only Meisner/Felder composition ever is actually pretty good. Nice acoustic intro and vocals too, again by the former. The twin guitar solos are effective as well.<br /><br />-Hollywood Waltz. A bit weak and mostly acoustic song. At this point on the cd you start to yearn for some rock and roll, largely absent from it.<br /><br />-Journey Of The Sorcerer. No one else in the group wanted to include it on the album but its writer (Bernie Leadon) yet it's one of the most interesting tracks on it, mainly because of its experimental nature and also the fact that it's instrumental. Something rarely done by The Eagles, if you don't count on the 48 second Doolin-Dalton from Desperado.<br /><br />-Lyin' Eyes. Too long and instrumentally boring. Catchy though.<br /><br />-Take it to the limit. I don't love this one - a too soft ballad. One more time the saving grace is Randy Meisner's vocals.<br /><br />-Visions. The only Felder-sung track on an Eagles album. More rocking than anything else on it so it sounds like belonging to another disc.<br /><br />-After The Thrill Is Gone. Not a lame ballad but how many of them  already on the cd?<br /><br />-I Wish You Peace. One of the worst songs to ever find its way to an Eagles album. Bland and unimaginative - you may fall asleep to it. I like all other Leadon's contributions to The Eagles but if this is the best he had to offer at the time, his departure was good news on the creative side.<br /><br />In a nutshell, you may like this album: a)if you are an Eagles nut, and b)if you love mellow music to death. Though keen on most of what The Eagles put out, this album leaves me yearning for some fire. I even prefer The Long Run. At least the drums sound like they're supposed to and not like cardboard boxes and there's much more rock and roll than in all the One Of These Nights album.
0793518326|5.0|Terrific book.  There are plenty of other of books that dissect their playing which is helpful, but this book has them all with the exception of the early instrumental that George Harrison and John Lennon wrote while recording in Hamburg, Germany for Tony Sheridan - \\"CRY FOR A SHADOW\\".  This Beatle song was left out - what a shame.  But if you have an ear for music it shouldn't be hard to figure.  The Ventures did a great rendition of the song on one of their albums.
B00064MW6K|2.0|I preferred watchin this movie on full screen cos ya know i don't want to see that plunging cleavage in miss halle berry's provocative cat suit. I think she was demeanin' to all woman and cats in the world. <br /> <br />I despise the part where she lifts 'er arm up and sniffs. <br />What does that tell me? Did she not wear her trusty deo 'fore appearin on set? Now halle, no need to be embarassed. Ya didn't win a razzie for nothin but ya did deserve yer other rewards ya done got. <br /> <br />Reason i give this move one more star extra is becuase of the graphics and CGI. Talk about modern! <br /> <br />I'm a country man myself but i enjoys the occasional future inventions once in a while.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Ok, lets start by saying that yes, this movie is VERY weird. It is not going to be everyones cup of tea. In fact, it's probebly one of those movies that you'll either love or hate. I loved it.  <br />The story line is really engaging. I also liked the charactors. The visuals were unusual, but more in an interesting way. <br />I recomend it.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Walk the Line was an amazin movie. <br />I gots myself all warmed up to it before i even gots the chance to watch it. I'm a huge fan of Mr.Johnny Cash's music. Yes sir, i feels at home watchin' it in the comfort of my ol' reliable flat 20\\" Toshiba screen.  <br /> <br />It brought me joy to know that Reese Witherspoon, a southern belle would portray the lovely Ms.June Carter in Walk the Line. She deserved to win the award she did. It made my wife cry every time she said no to Phoenix's proposals as Cash. <br /> <br />The only reason i give this movie one star less was because there wasn't enough songs in my opinion. <br /> <br />The songs was heart-warmin' and i hope that my lil boy will watch it when he grows up.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Serenity is a brilliant film. Moving, funny, and just the right amount of action, it's a genuinely powerful sci-fi film. Problem is, if you haven't seen Firefly, you may well not get it. <br /> <br />Look around, and you'll see that virtually all of the negative reviews come from those who have not seen Firefly. What does this say to you? The fact is, despite having one of the most human stories I've seen, Firefly holds a universe that takes some getting used to. Horses and spaceships, sporadic usage of Chinese, etc. etc. - and yet Firefly explains it all perfectly. It's all gold. See the series, then the movie. Unless you just don't like sci-fi as a rule, you will love it.
B00001SIES|4.0|although Showbiz is an early album by this popular group, there is still quite a bit to sink your teeth into and enjoy here. for those who don't know, Muse combines the epic rock stylings of (most obviously) Radiohead (circa OK Computer), but i hear quite a bit of influence of classic rock greats like Queen. and after hearing Muse belt out one of their trademark bombastic choruses, it would be hard to deny the influence of The Who in their songwriting process. all this is swathed in alternative rock styling and everything has a decidedly upbeat modern edge to it. but the real joy of Muse is feeling the rush in their music that drives straight to the heart of the song and usually, with little room for filler or unnecessary detours. they come straight to the point with razor sharp melodies and big strong hooks. and as tracks like \\"Unintended\\" show, they are not afraid to throw out a sweet ballad here and there also. one bad point: it's a shame about the band photo on the traycard which shows singer/guitarist Matthew Bellamy looking like a member of some sort of glitter glam goth gang and the remaining two members off to the side looking like helpless rejects at a Sum-41 show. haha. but even the goofy band photo can't take away from the genuinely well-produced and strong effort on Sunburn. (by the way...future album sees the band's photo sensabilites coming more into...focus.)
B00005NWM3|5.0|One of several newer post-Grunge albums that receives mass denigration for being a complete copycat, but Silver Side Up stands out among its competitors.  In reality, Nickelback's sophomore effort contains more consistency than most any post-Grunge classic (Sixteen Stone, 14:59, Third Eye Blind), but it still suffers from the same aliments as many quality albums do nowadays; undisciplined listeners simply download the absolute essentials in the major hits `How You Remind Me' and `Too Bad,' and thus leave the other eight tracks for the dogs.  That's ludicrous, considering that these two tracks aren't even SSU's most handsome numbers.  The monster riffs of the `Never Again' and `Just For' tragedies both surpass the singles in quality and memorable-ness, at least in my opinion.  The acoustic opening and the nostalgic, opera-like tales of the closing `Good Times Gone' make the track one of the best of Nickelback's rollercoaster career, a true deep-cut that will be found by diehard fans in the future.  I admit that tracks six through nine sound a little too similar for total praise, but that doesn't mean that the music here drops in quality by any means.  All four songs generously offer something a little different while still carrying  a thematic presence, eliminating filler allegations.  I only hope that Silver Side Up will eventually get the appreciation it deserves; This is Nickelback's best effort, little to no filler, more consistent than both The Long Road and All The Right Reasons, and Chad Kroeger's finest vocal performance.  Maybe I'm a little misguided, but I enjoy this listen more than the likes of Enema Of The State, OK Computer, and even later Oasis (my favorite band!).  My favorite from a strong '01 class (JEW, Morning View, Toxicity, Break The Cycle, Hoobastank, The Green Album).
B00005KFUM|4.0|Origin Of Symmetry finds Muse firing on all cylinders and sparing no prisoners in their pursuit of the alternative rock throne that Radiohead jumped from after the OK Computer album. their influence is a glaring element to Muse that nags a bit at the listener; but thankfully, Muse has the songs to back it up. each track is powerful and laced with dramatic crescendos that soar sky high (along with singer/guitarist Matt Bellamy's vibrato croon) and then come crashing back down in all their thrilling glory. Muse wastes little time in cutting straight to the meat of their songs...the hooks come early and upfront and very little time is spent on detours (although the live setting sees them going a bit overboard in the keyboard intros...but that's okay). the bass is strong and the drums pound along with an unstoppable pounce. the guitars are blazing and strong with no punches pulled. to me, Matt Bellamy's voice could make or break this band for the average listener. some people will not appreciate his breathy voice that drips melodrama with every word and some may simply roll their eyes when he starts to hit those high notes and float around in that Jeff Buckley range...but i like ti and i think it adds a nice prog rock touch to it all. Muse stretches things out and works wonders in their pop songs. they are not afraid to take risks and for that fact, they are a strong band who deserve a listen.
0143036556|4.0|Please don't take the four star rating wrong, this is a fascinating book and you should read it, if anything to get a broader view of cultural anthropological history.  However, this does not nearly have the same cohesive thesis as guns/germs/steel.  Diamond attempts to write a book from the flip side of success - why do some societies fall apart?  He does try to put all of his wonderful stories from around the world and make the argument that it is (mostly) the environment and society's environmental choices that make the most difference, but anecdotal evidence does not fully convince.  It is a step in the right direction and I do look forward to more solid, conclusive evidence one way or the other.  As another positive side note, he does not harshly criticize the environmental movement, oil companies,  or capitalistic society in general - only the choices they sometimes make.
B0000C7GG2|4.0|it's a case of more of the same here from this outstanding band on this album. Absolution solidifies the status of Muse as the natural heirs to the alternative rock throne once occupied by Radiohead. add a bit of Queen's melodrama, some of the bombast from The Who and you've got Muse. the songs are razor-sharp with their hooks, big and beefy in their stride, and pristine in their performance and production. \\"Time Is Running Out,\\" \\"Stockholm Syndrome,\\" \\"Blackout,\\" ...all amazing songs that make this cd worth the price of admission alone. i'm not too crazy about the artwork on this cd...a little hokey, i think...but it doesn't detract from the awe-inspiring epic pop rock that will dive straight into you once this disc starts spinning. Muse started off on a really good foot with the Showbiz album...then they upped the quality with Origin Of Symmetry, now Absolution towers over all three (just by a bit)....it's going to be tough to follow this up. keep your fingers crossed.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Here's a great example of a spectacular show in which the spectacle enhances the story, rather than hides the fact that there isn't one. [Insert name of Andrew Lloyd Webber show here]<br /><br />What I like most about the show is that, unlike many popular musicals, it has ideas, especially those espoused in the Wizard's numbers: that people need a common enemy to pull them together, and that history is written by the victors. Both of those notions are very timely indeed. But the great thing about Wicked is that in works on a populist level as well.<br /><br />The show has some minor flaws: most of Elphaba's numbers end on a reeeeeeaaaaaallllllly looooooong nooooooooooote, which gets a bit much after a while, although the suburban school girls and soccer moms eat it up. And the power ballad in the second act, \\"As Long As You're Mine,\\" is generic and superfluous. But on the whole, Wicked remains a funny, affecting, and satisfying show.
0062502182|5.0|This is an incredible book that leaves one pondering about its many messages long after one is finished reading it. Cohelo's writing style is clear, simple and inspirational. It really is a must read for every person.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This was a very well done cd. I have rarely found albums that I can listen to all the way through and not get tired of any of the songs. And now what you've all been waiting for, a song by song break down of the cd!    1. Introduction-9/10-It is rather amusing, but, it isn't really a song. Just a, radio broadcast of sorts.     2. The Only Difference between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage-9/10-I liked this song, and will dance to it, but it is not my all time favorite. Still, it has a good tempo and fun lyrics. You find your self snapping when he says snap, and tapping when he says tap. The title had me amused for a while, because it is pretty much true.    3. London Beckoned Songs about Money Written by Machines-11/10-Now, seriously, who couldn't hear this and either crack a smile or laugh. I loved this song, despite the fact you can't always understand what he is saying. Good beat, fun lyrics.     4. Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks-16/10-Loved this song to the hilt. Still not sure why, but I think my favorite part has to be st-st-stuttering something profound. Really fun beat, easy to dance to, and catchy lyrics.    5. Camisado-25/10-My ABSOLUTE favorite song on the cd. Really entertaing. I had a blast dancing around the house to it. Can't really describe it, just go listen to it and and sit back and relapse and relax.    6. Time to Dance-13/10-Really great for lifting your spirits. Yes, it isn't a \\"happy\\" song, but listen to it once and I can promise you that your two new favorite words will be shotgun and wedding.    7. Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have without Taking Her Clothes Off-16/10-Um, well, yeah, the title kind of says it all. Still, it is a really great song, fun to dance to, and because of my crazy curiosity, I discovered every possible meaning of the word 'harlaquin.'    8. Intermission-9/10-Same thing as the introduction, it does have some pretty sweet piano in it.    9. But It's Better If You Do-18/10-Excellent song, amazing vocals about a 90 seconds into the song. Really fun to dance around to.    10. I Write Sins Not Tragedies-13/10-First song I ever heard off this cd. Great the first few times you hear it, but gets old after a while.    11. I Constantly Thank God For Esteban-8/10-Sorry, but not one of my favorites, I just can't get into it.    12. There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet-9/10-Not bad, needs some improvement, but overall, very good song.    13. Build God, Then We'll Talk-23/10-VERY, VERY, VERY good song. Really fun and has a beautiful cello in the middle. I love the reference to Sound of Music, 'rain drops on roses', and 'and a few more of your least-favorite things.'    Overall this is a must buy for your cd collection. Excellent for those less enjoyable house chores, such as dusting the house, because anything you are holding instantly becomes a microphone. WARNING: WILL CAUSE YOU TO STOP WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING TO SING ALONG. The most amazing thing about this cd, in my opinion, is the vocal range of Brandon Urie. He can go amazingly high, yet that only adds to the diversity and enchantment of the music.
B000BVD460|5.0|This is a greatest hits cd from eminem that i love. it has mostly the best songs from albums: the slim shady lp, the marshall mathers lp, the eminem show, encore, the 8 mile soundtrack, and 3 new songs as well. a great cd full of good songs as well as what could be perhaps the final bow of eminem.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I followed this show from the very beginning and was always impressed by the high quality of the acting and writing. So many times I was deeply moved by the sincerity of the actors and how honestly the show dealt with universal themes--love, death, friendship, the difficulties of communication, the yearning for family even when you don't get along. Why this show never found a larger audience is anyone's guess. I'm sorry CW cancelled it instead of Seventh Heaven which was long overdue to be gone. I'll miss the characters and setting of Everwood but I hope all the wonderful actors on the show find good parts so we can see them again soon.
B0001US8FI|5.0|If you looking for a good Bruce Lee movie get \\"Enter the Dragon\\". The first time I saw it I loved it. It's in English and it is so sharp. The sound is graet. The other Bruce Lee movies are good but not as good as \\"Enter the dragon\\". The others are dubed in and the pictures are not so good but Enter the dragon is the best!!!!!!
0875428940|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Robin's work and would love to see a coloring book for Pagans made of it all -  <br />That said, this deck is one I bought just because of Robin and I'm glad that I did.  It's beautifully balanced with symbol and art that speaks volumes - the colors are bright and oddly comforting.  This is the deck I use when reading for those who are a bit nervous about their reading.  If you've read for those folks, you'll know the sort I mean.    It's not a bad thing, it's a matter of being gentle with them.  This deck has been a favorite of mine for years, and I suggest it as well for those just starting out in reading Tarot.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you're interested in this show and plan on buying it, WAIT... A group of fans have come together and have created Serenity Day... June 23, we plan to buy copies of Firefly and Serenity, to help boost sales. The TV industry will have to acknowledge us... it's worked for Family Guy and Futurama, hopefully it will work for us too... If you want to help out, just go to [...] Firefly has remained in the top 50 sales for both Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk since its release THREE YEARS AGO... please help us get at least a second season out of this wonderful show
B000E33VWW|3.0|Honestly, I didn't see what was so special about this film.  Cinematography was great, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman did a very good portrayal of Truman Capote.  But this was a simple film with a simple agenda which captured your interest enough to see what happens in the end, but that was about it for me.  If you ask me, the Oscar shoudl ahve gone to the guy who played Perry Smith.  His portrayal was far more intersting.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|It's back to basics for Placebo. They have done a record like their first two, raw and punk, and with the knowledge of having done the second two, which were more electronic and heavily produced. Placebo have been around for ten years, sold millions of records, and have an international following, but are still a curiosity in America, where they have done five major tours. It's not so much that they don't have fans here. They do. It's just that they put out records and do one American tour and then disappear for a few years. Obviously they are focusing on parts of Europe and South America where they have become one of the biggest British bands of recent memory. Plus they have recently released a lot of DVDs that show the band playing shows in France and elsewhere, which are pretty impressive. MEDS might be their most accessible album ever. \\"Meds\\" and \\"Infra-Red\\" are great songs that sure to be big singles. Alison Mosshart of The Kills sings on \\"Meds.\\" The third song \\"Drag\\" reminds me of songs on their second album, Without You I'm Nothing. A departure is \\"Space Monkeys\\" which sounds nothing like they have done before. \\"Follow The Cops Back Home\\" is one of their ballads. One of the best songs is \\"Because I Want You.\\" Michael Stipe sings on \\"Broken Promise.\\" It is a very moving song. Much better than the Bowie collaboration from a few years ago. This is a pretty good record. The last two somehow left you wanting more, but this one is right on. There is also the special edition that includes a documentary about making the album. There are a few live songs. A few demos are included. A very good package.
B0000931QA|5.0|\\"I remember now... <br />I remember how it started... <br />I cant remember yesterday... <br />I just remember doing what they told me... <br />Told me... <br />Told me... <br />Told me...\\" <br /> <br />Hearing these words to this day still gives me the chills, then Anarchy-X just pounds into your brain. Operation Mindcrime is one of the handful of 80's Metal CD's that will never age because of a few things: Great Songs writing, a gripping story, Geoff Tate, and the the amazing Guitar duets. This is a top notch CD. When it came out I was 8 years old, and I was able to see them perform this in concert 2 years late, and it was one of the greatest shows I have ever been to. Now onto this amazing CD. <br /> <br />This is hands down the best CD I own. I don't want to get into the songs to much as it will spoil the story line, all I can say is that every song on this CD blends together well, and requires some use of you brain to figure out this twisting and turning story. <br /> <br />5/5
B000021YQV|5.0|This was no joke the best album ever made by SOAD. Here's the list of songs and my personal ratings.<br /><br />Prison Song - 8/10<br /><br />Needles - 10/10<br /><br />Deer Dance - 10/10<br /><br />Jet Pilot - 6/10<br /><br />X - 9/10<br /><br />Chop Suey - 10/10<br /><br />Bounce - 7/10<br /><br />Forest - 10/10<br /><br />Atwa - 8/10<br /><br />Science - 8/10<br /><br />Shimmy - 10/10<br /><br />Toxicity - 10/10<br /><br />Psycho - 10/10<br /><br />Aerials - 8/10<br /><br />The album is truly worth buying!
B0000714B5|1.0|There is a wonderful movie made about the life of the Buddha.  This is not it.  Oddly enough, it is Little Buddha.  I always said someone should do a movie of Siddhartha.  And someone still should.  This is not it.  The utter lack of conflict or dramatic tension, the monotone acting and flat lifeless script remind me of watching corporate training videos.  There are wonderful movies out there about similar themes, I should have listened to the other reviews.  Luckily it was only one netflix rental I'm out.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Best album since Toxicity. A lot better than Mezmerize. If i could rate it higher, i would. Every song gets a 10/10 for me except for Dreaming and kill Rock'n Roll, which both get 0's. This album is definitely worth buying, so do so immediatly.
B000005Z0G|5.0|The revolution is continued on this album. Still pre \\"gangsta\\" pac, Pac is speaking out for the people. Yes this is an overlooked album because the majority of the people who love pac love the glorified violence pac, not the one that is trying to free the minds of the masses. Stand out tracks on this album are representin' 93, strictly 4 my niggaz, and my all time favorite souljah's revenge. The beats are slightly better than the first album, and the lyrics are just as hot if not hotter.
B000088E6D|5.0|I absolutely go BONKERS over Michael Buble--anything he sings is wonderful at the least!  My favorite song on this album is \\"Sway\\".  I cannot HELP but break out in a huge smile every time I hear him sing this song...and my body moves whether I'm sitting in the car, enjoying his voice in my own home or out in public.   <br /> <br />I grew up in the 50s and 60s and music was a huge part of my life.  My mother, sister and I watched musicals and learned the words to all the songs.  Singing along with Michael Buble's music, and especially all the choices on this album, is better than an anti-depressant medication to lift my spirits and my mood.  You can't help but feel good when you hear him sing!  GO, Michael Buble!!
0679422714|5.0|The book is an enjoyable read, and an exciting expose about Mao and Soviet Russia's criminal hand in funding and training the traitorist Mao and the Communist Chinese. It chronicles the battle for China's future between Mao and Chiang Kai-shek. When the Japanese attacked China, Chiang gave up the fight against Mao, and chose to defend China from the Japanese. Not Mao, Mao fought Chiang. Chiang was a dictator, but he was a nationalist - a better choice for the Chinese (my humble opinion, granted). Mao was merely an opportunist who followed the orders of his Soviet masters for many years - and only to serve Mao's ends. Philosophy and moral principals about human justice and equality? You're kidding! Commies always speak with forked tongues. It's only ever about pirating power; bandits, thiefs, and gangster-thugs. Tony Soprano's got nothing on Mao and Stalin.<br /><br />Great book!
B00006IU73|5.0|I'm glad I got into this band. This is a masterpiece of progressive rock. Steven Wilson is nothing short of a genius. He is an able songwriter, can sing, play guitar, play bass, and play keyboards. It's a shame bands like this are overshadowed by false prog rock like The Mars Volta. Many great tracks will await you, but my personal favorite at the moment is Blackest Eyes. The fact that this band is also affilated with Opeth and Dream Theater makes them even better. Check out all 3 of these bands(as well as the upcoming side project between Mikael Akerfeldt, Steven Wilson, and Mike Portnoy). Don't check out The Mars Volta or Coheed(their song Welcome Home is a big ripoff of Led Zeppelin's Kashmir).
6305692572|5.0|When a Man Loves A Woman starring Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan is sobering look at what addiction can do to a family in crisis. Ryan should have received an Oscar for her riveting and out of the box performance as Alice, a wife and mother of two girls who battles with alcoholism. Her husband (Garcia) is terrified when Alice hits rock bottom and slaps her eldest daughter after a drunken binge. After she recovers, their relationship is put to the ultimate test, can Alice survive without her dependency for booze? You just have to watch this great film and see for yourself. A must-have for die hard Meg Ryan fans.
0802130208|5.0|The funniest book I have read.  \\"Missing Links\\" formerly held this title.  Must read for those looking for some outstanding comic relief...
B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah Carey's Daydream album is her last great record in my opinion. Her songwriting is fantastic and strong here, songs like One Sweet Day, Underneath the Stars, Forever, When I Saw You, and Looking In are songs you will hear over and over again. There's a beautiful cover of the Journey hit, Open Arms. The album closer Looking In is such a haunting and brutually open song, \\"Well here I am for all of them to bleed but they can't take my heart from me, and they can't bring me to my knees, they'll never know the real me.\\" The song I Am Free took me awhile to like it but it has a great message. Hits like Always be my Baby and Fantasy should have you jumping for joy, very catchy and addictive. It's really sad that Mariah doesn't make pop albums anymore, she's too busy churning out pathetic hip-hop albums with her rapper posse doing all the work for her. I highly recommend Daydream, and her previous albums: Mariah Carey, Emotions, MTV Unplugged, Music Box (my personal fave!), and Merry Christmas.
B000E1155E|5.0|I notice there are some people here posting \\"review not helpful\\" to anyone and every one who liked this cd so you guys feel free to do that with my post too. Some of you people really need to learn how to review music. Never compare one band to another. That's like saying 'I like apples but they are alot like pears and pears are sweeter so eat more pears.' Look at the apple and describe the apple kids. Now here is what i think about this group with no comparisons with other groups. <br />I don't know who is writing these songs but if they're written by 19 year old kids i'm impressed. the chord structer and arrangement for Marty Bum is pretty complex and knowing this is one of the newer songs they wrote for this album has me anxiously waiting for there next album. The vocals are fresh and full of energy and refreshing to hear in this age of american idle. The only thing they need to work on is their guitar playing. some of their lead guitar work is rusty but i'm sure it will improve over time. I just hope these guys can hang around for a few more years before they get burnt out. :)  <br />But for the time being they seem to be \\"up to summet\\".
B00003CX96|5.0|I would not classify Breaking Away as a \\"coming-of-age\\" film. It is about characters who have already come of age--they have graduated high school--and do not know what to do next. They are searching for a place in the world, and for a place in their small town. Reminiscent of October Sky, which made science fairs exciting, this movie makes bicycle racing exciting. <br /> <br />I have not talked to anyone who has seen this movie and not thought it was excellent. It would have been difficult to convince me that a movie about bicycle racing, where the climax is a bicycle race, could provoke such intense emotion and involvement in the characters as this movie did for me. I might have thought if someone had tried to describe it to me is that it was a boring, formulaic underdog sports team, but it is not that. At the end of the climactic race, I actually felt the emotion and I think cried just a little.  <br /> <br />Of course, this movie is not only about bicycle racing. Not nearly. The well-crafted character development draws the viewer in. An even rarer occurence than interesting characters is realistic characters. They have very different unique personalities that go beyond the cliches of sports films, comedies, and \\"coming-of-age\\" movies. <br /> <br />The sly humor and warm-heartedness tie the rest together. They give you the feeling of the small midwest town and the earnestness of the four main characters. They slowly cause this movie to slide closer and closer to your heart, until even the most cynical person is entranced and stuck with half of a stupid grin on his face for the rest of the film. <br /> <br />You might not even realize the magic that's taking place before your eyes, but when the credits roll, it will suddenly hit you--holy crap, that was an awesome movie!
B0002IVN9W|1.0|I subscribe to a magazine in the UK called Uncut.  This magazine has introduced me to some really great acts such as Wilco, Drive By Truckers and Richmond Fontaine and opened my eyes to classic artists such as Bob Dylan and Emmylou Harris.  When Uncut voted Arcade Fire's Funeral and Sufjan Stevens' Illinois as albums of the year 2005, I decided it would be worth a try checking out these artists, especially since the magazine's year end CD contained what seemed to be interesting songs by each group.  It also covered Arcade Fire in great length, interestingly enough only that one time that I can recollect.  Despite still loving the magazine, next year I will be more careful.    I must admit, I've never made it through Arcade Fire.  The production is terrible like a 30 year old cassette tape was being used.  What sounded interesting on one track became quickly irritating.  Singing lessons are in order in Montreal because this is closer to whining than actual singing.  Sufjan at least received more patience on my behalf, I managed to listen to it and come to think of it, that album is not entirely bad compared to AF.  This is amateur hour at best bloated with what must be hype of 2005.  Having given Sufjan only one star, I have second thoughts since I can't give Funeral zero stars, Sufjan at least deserved something but this is painful noise.  Avoid!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|The scenery: Brilliant. The songs: Astounding. The costumes: The most gorgrous I've ever seen. The acting: My god. Top Notch!<br /><br />So why don't we get to see any of it for more than .375 seconds at a time? It's almost like trying to watch The Blair Witch Project for pure motion sickness factor!<br /><br />Still, it's a Great Film. Never mind the complete non-believeabily of a singer dying of tuburculosis simultanously on key and on cue. It's amazing. The eye candy factor is over the top, and the musical duet numbers are superb; a blend of modern pop that is so catchy that now, when I hear that songs, I think of them as belonging to Moulin Rouge, not to themselves. There are elements of Fear and Loathing and Naked Lunch in the mix for a feeling of suureal, plus a touch, just a touch, of CGI. A perfect spice for the nearly perfect film.<br /><br />The costumes...oh MY my MY. Anyone who can costume Nicole Kidman to look even more amazingly sexy than normal deserves and Oscar in my book. But not just Nicole Kidman; every single person in the show was done up to perfection, even, and espcially, the Green Fairy.<br /><br />Someone did some homework: the real Moulin Rouge existed in the same time period and was in fact, frequented by the real Toulouse-Latrec (playing the talking sitar), and had a singer much like Satine who was prone to, say, knocking the hat off the Price of Wales with a high kick while the owner shouted \\"Hullo, Prince, is your Mummy paying for the drinks tonight?\\"<br /><br />So yes, huzzah, I LOVE this film, even though sometimes I have to play it at half speed. Baz Luhrmann, where has he been? More! Only...um...a bit slower on the camera angles this time?
B0009OUBNI|5.0|This edition is an imported version of Sight & Sound series which is popular in the UK.  Basically this is a combined version of the Greatest Hits packages that were available a few years back.      The CD has all the main hits (pre Astronaut) plus a few lesser known hits.  Some songs are edited versions so if that is an issue, beware.  This is especially evident on the Rio tracks and Ordinary World.  For most people though these are the versions they know having heard them on the radio for 20+ years.  I could say that such and such song should have been included (OK, Violence of Summer) but can not find any real fault in the selection.  The sound quality is fine which should not be a surprise; the sound quality of DD was always top class.    The DVD has all the songs from the CD in addition to The Chauffeur and Burning the Ground.  The clean version of Girls on Film is included which in my case works well since my 3 year old son watches these videos a lot.  The bulk of the videos have aged well, in particular the early songs and those from the Wedding Album.  The sound quality here, however, is sub-par, with no surround alternatives.  Make sure not to buy another version available with only 12 (I think) videos, far too many good songs are omitted on that one.    Overall this is a fine anthology of DD both Sight & Sound wise and though it is tempting ducking a star due to the lack of surround sound in the DVD format, the budget price, excluding the US, of this set may justify such an absence.
B000020617|5.0|The Foo Fighters certainly had a lot to prove when they released this gem back in 99'.  Avoiding the sophmore slump in a big way, Dave and the gang released one of the top albums of the 90's (and of all time in many rock fan's eyes).  Would \\"There Is Nothing Left to Lose\\" compare to \\"The Colour and the Shape\\", or would it be a dissapointment.  Well, although the album hasn't been heralded over time as TCATS has, it certainly deserves to be.  Every track here is a fantastic blend of pop and rock, from Stacked Actors to M.I.A.  The highlight is of course Aurora, a little love song Dave wrote about his life in Seattle, that just happens to be this Foo Fighter fanatics favorite of all time.  The truth is this isn't the Colour and the Shape.  However TINLTL certainly deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest albums of the 90's, and one of Dave Grohl's most wonderful achievements.
0778321606|5.0|I don't usually read this type of book.  I'm more of a mystery reader and read authors such as David Baldacci, Lee Child & Harlan Coben to name a few.  I was looking for something that delved more into the lives of people and I was not disappointed in this book.  This was my first Debbie Macomber book and it won't be my last.  I read this book in 24 hours because I did not want to put it down.  The characters are so rich that I kept wanting to know what was going to happen to them.  I have already purchased \\"A Good Yarn\\" and I hope that will give me as much reading pleasure as \\"The Shop On Blossom Street\\" did.  You will not be disappointed with this read!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Darn fine movie.  Well conceived and well wrought.  I didn't expect much going in, since I knew the project had a following and a modest budget - neither bodes particularly well.   <br /> <br />I like that the show addressed itself to the question of whether any entity ought to be \\"improving\\" people, will-they nill-they.  Drugging them up with new Ritalins and smothering them in false nicey-niceness, against their wills, under the pretense of \\"helping\\" them.  So the spine upon which the plot was grafted was strong. <br /> <br />The plot was good, the characters and era were colorful and textured, some of that coming from the modified lingo being used - what one apparently challenged reviewer called \\"pseudo-southern.\\"  Would it be more believable or fun if the brigands of the distant future employed perfect Connecticut english?  Don't think so.  There was a good and believable tension among the players, as though they had their individual agendas.  The special effects gave no indication that the production was not based on a huge budget.  (Maybe that means that all you really get with a BIG budget is a BIG-named star - I'd rather not have that.  Personally, I'm looking forward to the day when they're all computer-generated, players can go back to the small stage where they belong, and we'll no longer have to tolerate so many pompous, self-inflated celebrities.  That's just my view.  Where was I?)  The action was good action.  <br /> <br />My only criticism would be the success of the too-subtle mind, the preternatural anticipation Mal had for the next Alliance move.  If you guess that the Alliance has captured Mr. U's planet and so you bring the Reavers with you, you had better be right.   <br /> <br />In all though, the movie was pretty great.  I never saw Firefly, but am thinking about checking it out now.
B000089J0R|5.0|I love these guys.  Recently discovered, I've got all 3 albums.  Valley of the Damned is my favorite, and gets better with each listen.  These guys are so fast it's almost unbelieveable, but don't let that fool you, it's very creative music and very catchy.  If you love speed metal with a medival feel you'll really dig these guys.
B0000640SA|5.0|junto con un \\"WTF!\\" fue lo que dije cuando abri el paquete con los dvd's.. su estuche en particular se parece mucho a una de esas carpetas de informes medicos en donde tanbien trae los informes del paciente... o sea.. que loquera.. eso no fue todo.. al poner el dvd fue lo m&aacute;s frito que habia visto.. o sea.. ver para creer.. estaba mas perdido que quien sabe que.. y el segundo dvd fue peor, es mas complejo todavia.. de igual forma tuve que buscarme unas guias de como ver el dvd y poder todas las cosas que trae.. la pelicula es muy buena.. y la version de la pelicula que trae el segundo dvd tambien es muy curiosa.
0765315246|4.0|This is the kind of story that Azimov, Kornbluth and Bester used to write.  It takes a couple of simple ideas, and then spends a good amount of time exploring their effects on the people involved as well as the society that they live in.   <br /> <br />To summarize, people from overcrowded nations (India, Pakistan, China) can volunteer to go off to space as colonists.  The colonies have a monopoly on space travel, and you can't get off the earth without their help, and permission.  For people from the developed world, Europe and North America, you can agree at 65 to enlist in the CDF (Colonial Defense Force) when you turn 75.  Once you leave you can't come back, so no one on Earth knows what happens after you leave.  Most people figure that they Colonies have found a way to turn back aging.  Why else would they take 75 year olds for their army. <br /> <br />Our hero, John Perry had planned to join with his wife Kathy, but she passed away at 67.  So he goes on his own.  Ok, he joins, gets made younger (won't tell you how), goes off to war; and duh, he becomes a big hero.  It's a little shlocky, but it's good in the sense of \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\"; you let pass some of the corny stuff.   <br /> <br />All in all, a very fun read for those who remember the pulp stories of the old scifi magazines.   No Bat-Rat-Spiders but close.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Demasiado extremadamente buena esta pelicula.<br /><br />Con audio en Japones e ingles (Aunque la quisiera con audio espa&ntilde;ol tambien) y subtitulos en muchos idiomas (en espa&ntilde;ol tambien claro).<br /><br />Mi gran sorpresa fue ver los menus de los dvd en espa&ntilde;ol (que es muy raro porque el es region1) en el 1 y el 2 traen subtitulos en espa&ntilde;ol.. hasta los documentales de como se hizo.. esa fue otra sorpresa.. :-) Fue un momento muy Feliz.. Se lo recomiendo a Todos.. ;-)
0743219619|3.0|First I should admit that I'm not a PD James fan.  In fact this is the first of her books that I've read.  It may be that the darkness of this book gives me the wrong impression as to how she writes.  It does remind me of Agatha Christie's type of stories but it may also be because the singular character of Commander Adam Dalgleish is going through a dark time related to a recent illness.   <br /> <br />The story itself is nothing special, though it may have been in 1975, but now it's kind of dated.  It may also be because I find her style to be a little slow or ponderous and I'm used to the writings of Ian Rankin and James Lee Burke.  No I don't think that there needs to be a shooting or car chase every other page, but it would be nice to read about something other than a description of the scenary. <br /> <br />To be fair about it I am planning on reading one of her later stories in the series, and to catch up on the character by watching some of the episodes on PBS.  Just one man's opinion.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I don't think I could like the stage play near as much, now that I've seen the movie.  I have listened to the Broadway  soundtrack and I think the movie's characters sing much, much better! Sarah Brightman's voice sounds like Minnie Driver's in the movie...

B00005RHGL|3.0|I loved the movie, even have it on Laser Disc, with deleted Scenes. these DVD's do not have this stuff on it... and that is the problem..... what a shame..
B000EHRVP6|4.0|For my two cents the unrated was not as good - the story seemed to be robbed a little bit, a little weakend. The widescreen of course always looks good -
B000EUA6DW|5.0|Amazing! Minor Threat remastered! Great Band! Hardcore to its name! No cuts on the songs either!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Need one say more?? This IS the Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you don't own a RHCP's album then you can safely start here. The RHCP's traditional funk/punk/metal/pop fusion is at it's best. Every song is as good as the one before and disk 2 (\\"Mars\\") may possibly be the stronger of the two. Every instrument is great, Anthony's singing, Flea's bass, John's guitar and Chad's drumming are the best i've ever heard. I'm blown away.
B000002GYI|5.0|I own the vinyl record of this and it is awesome. The synths and beats on this record are so fun! Pocket Calculator is where it is at! I bought the Japanese vinyl record 45 single Detaku (Japanese version on PC) off ebay, very cool! So quit reading this and buy this album! <br /> <br />Check out Man Machine!
B000FGGE68|4.0|Seriously, I dont know why anyone would think this movie was bad. For me it was a visually stimulating, actioned packed movie with at least an interesting plot line and for god's sake it has Milla. I really like her, I think she has an interesting style and she can actually act. <br /> <br />This movie reminded me very much of Equilibrium (Christian Bale and Taye Diggs). The dystopian society is an obvious corrilation. More than that though it was almost like they were directed by the same person. The imagery and sets and fighting style were so similar. UltraViolet was much more colour infused but on the whole I was having major dejavu through the movie. <br /> <br />So, if you like Equilibrium you will like this movie. If your expecting earth shattering, mind blowing commentaries on the nature of society and the human condition your expecting too much. This movie covers pretty much the same gound as others have before. If you want a cool movie to relax and eat popcorn in front of, this is your bag.
0375831002|5.0|Unique style, touching story, engaging characters, important messages-- this book should become a classic.  I would encourage everyone from high school age to adult to read this book.
B00069A5GY|3.0|I must say to begin with, Ragpicker's Dream and Shangri-La are, in my humble opinion, the BEST recordings Mark has ever put out. So the plain ol' CD stereo mix of Shangri-La is excellent! However, as somebody used to the amazing mixes of Elliot Schiener on the Steely Dan DVD-A's, the 5.1 mix of Shangri-La, I must say, is pretty pathetic. I don't think it's the fault of the mixer, however, I mean, how do you expect to stretch the sound across 6 speakers when sometimes, there isn't even 4 instruments playing? 75% of the album is just Mark, his guitar, and a drum machine. So there's a lot of echo... often the back speakers have nothing going on at all. I dont think this album was ever meant to be in surround. HOWEVER, depending on how you have your speakers set up, it can be a lot better. When I first bought the DVD, my set up was the typical LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT in front, REAR LEFT/RIGHT in behind, a sub under my chair... try putting all 5 speakers right in front of you. If you have speaker stands, or a tall desk, put the front speakers about 3 feet above your head, put the rear speakers on the floor. Then play all of your DVD-A's... it gives you a whole new dimension to the music you never would've known was there! AND makes this Shangri-La DVD much worth buying.
0634022296|4.0|Love Beatles songs?  Want to play them and sing along?  This is a complete book of Beatles songs.  Some may be too hard for a new guitarist.  Also, the book is a bit stout to fit on a music stand and stay open without falling off.  Otherwise a nice resource for Beatles music.
B000F48D3C|5.0|The first incursion of Ridley Scott in this genre could not be better. The shocking realism of this picture may be felt from the first shots. Zelaously descriptive with marvelous shot angles, kinetic displacements and superb crudeness.<br /><br />Based on true events, the movie is simply anthological, no matter the sort of considerations you take into account.<br /><br />Another remarkable artistic feat for Ridley Scott.
0679731725|4.0|This is the first novel I have read of Kazuo Ishiguro and I could not resist sighing reading the beautiful prose. The portrayal of the butler, his detached restraint and attempts to be the epitome of \\"dignity\\" throughout his career-- while extraneous circumstances sway his ideals and the gradual overwhelming realization of the barrenness of his tenuous beliefs, marked by the ultimate realization of a life wasted, transform the novel into a mesmerizing psychoanalysis of man's feeble relationship between his self and what he projects. Amidst the ruins of a fading empire and ways of living, hope still persists of a beautiful \\"evening\\" of life. Marvellous.
B000062YB1|5.0|Seasons In The Abyss is Slayer's fifth studio album and is less about Satan and hell and more about evil in general.  It has a almost commercial sound to it; there are few traces of Reign In Blood, the ultimate thrash album.  Only Spirit In Black, Hallowed Point, and Born Of Fire are fast; the rest of the album is mostly midpaced.  Kerry King and Jeff put on their best performance; the solos sound much more professional-sounding than before.  Tom's haunting voice perfectly suits this album.  Oh yeah, Dave Lombardo does some INSANE stuff.  War Ensemble is one of Slayer's most popular songs, and it has a rock feel instead of super-heavy.  Blood Red is a slower Slayer song with lyrics about war, like the previously mentioned song.  Expendable Youth, Dead Skin Mask, and Skeletons Of Society are slower and are about the evils of society; Dead Skin Mask was based on the serial killer Ed Gein.  It has a groove to it and shows a new dimension to Slayer's sound.  The title track has to be my favorite.  It it Slayer's farthest departure from their old sound, and is among Slayer's greatest.  The chorus is EPIC! <br /> <br />If you want to get a Slayer album but dislike the satanic themes on EVERY OTHER SLAYER ALBUM, get this one.  I highly recommend Seasons In The Abyss!
1400079179|3.0|Seriously. I mean, all I did was ask him if he'd read this book because, you know, everybody's talking about it. And I figured, I mean, the guy wears some pretty weird clothes, he's got a crazy accent, what could we really have in common, right? That whole trout-fishing topic was pretty much the original non-starter. Ditto when I asked him if he missed \\"Friends.\\" I mean, that was an awesome show, right? Total blank stare.<br /><br />Well, I waited for, like, six months for this private audience, and I haven't come all the way from the U S of A--where the AC actually works, thank you very much, and you don't have to pay for a coffee refill--to just have him roll his eyes and look at his watch. Totally didn't bother to hide it. I want to pick his brain, and then maybe ask him to pose for a couple photos. But then I just try to break the ice one last time and the vibe gets all weird.<br /><br />And talk about weird, check out the eyes on this guy who's his admin assistant or something. They're just about the reddest things I ever saw. Looks like somebody was hitting the sacramental wine pretty hard last night. Wait a sec...AAAAH! Albino assassins! Save me! I.....
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|Good: <br />Probably the best CGI i have ever seen <br />Some of the best fight seens in existence <br />Japanese voice acting is quite good <br />Sound effects rivaling (if not surpassing) great movies <br />Most of the special features are included in the SE US release <br /> <br />Bad:  <br />Story lacks depth <br />For people who have never played FFVII the story will be confusing <br />English voice acting is HORRIBLE.. not the re-animation we were promised.. instead they just gave us bad voice overs <br />Ugly yellow subtitles <br />What happened to Final Fantasy - Lost Order? Lost in translation?
0307277674|1.0|In short the plot, or the idea behind the plot (the research, etc.) was of more compelling interest to the writer then the actual writing, character development, etc. This is the kind of book that one finds in the library of a rented summer house. It is ideal reading while sunbathing of on a rainy day when there is nothing else to do. If you have seen the movie, it will help with surviving the bad writing.
B00005JKDR|5.0|What if there actually were monsters in the closet, but their goal was to capture your screams to power their world?  While the plot sounds silly, the execution is hilarious.<br /><br />James P. \\"Sulley\\" Sullivan, voiced by John Goodman, and Mike Wazowski, voiced by Billy Crystal, are the leaders in obtaining the highest quantities of screams at the factory.  Life seems to be going well for the buddies.  Mike is in love with Celia, voiced by the sultry Jennifer Tilly.  Sulley is the favorite of boss Henry J. Waternoose III, voiced by classy veteran actor James Coburn in one of his last roles.  Life could hardly be better until co-worker Randall Boggs, voiced by Steve Buscemi, leaves a door in the factory and Sulley steps through it to find Boo, as he names the ultimately charming little girl that follows him through the door.<br /><br />What follows is one of the funniest movies of 2001, animated or otherwise.  Pixar Animation did an outstanding job of animated the monsters throughout this film, and the chase scene through the door factory has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Winner of 11 major awards, including an Oscar, and nominated for 29 other awards, this movie has a visual power that will captivate young and old audiences alike.  The two-disc collector's edition includes hours and hours of extras.  As with most two-disc editions, some of the extras were great, some were good, and many I skipped through because I was uninterested.<br /><br />\\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is a rare family film that is suitable for all but the youngest members of the family.  The animation is superb, the acting is great, and the storyline is creative.  Movies such as these have made Pixar the current leader in animated films.  Enjoy!
B000EOTAM6|4.0|If you're suspicious of a shoot-em-up SF action flick by a female director, don't be. This one is as fast and as furious as any other around. And it's better looking than most, and it makes better use of the female leads.<br /><br />There's some kind of a plot to this movie, if you pay attention to such things: some far future place, the last enclave of mankind. A terrible plague nearly wiped out humanity, and an equally terrible cure nearly finished the job by sterilizing the survivors. Society sustains itself by recycling DNA - cloning people, and maintaining the population by replacement as the old copies die. There may, however, be a cure for the cure, a way to reverse the sterility and restart the genetic Mixmaster. A power struggle ensues, with the tyrants who like being themselves again and again trying to quash the discovery.<br /><br />Enter Aeon, codename for the super-assassin-babe (Charlize Theron). She'll take out an armed and armored platoon bare handed and never muss a single spike of her sabertooth bangs. That's about it, really, lots of running around and go-boom, with pretty women. Pretty women with their clothes on, if it matters to you. One thing that sets it apart from others in its class, like The 'Matrix', is the pace of action. Where 'The Matrix' alternated set-piece action sequences and breathing space, this one sustains the energy level better. Maybe it doesn't peak as high, but it keeps a thundering pace. And, according to the extras, Theron and the other leads did nearly all their own stunts. If there's one thing cooler than a hot babe, it's a hot babe who can do stuff.<br /><br />The locations deserve special mention. They're convincingly futuristic, which makes a pretty disappointing statement about our sense of the future. All those high tech, way cool pieces of architecture actually exist and have mundane use: an animal shelter, an urban water supply, a crematorium, or a wind tunnel dating back half a hundred years. The coolest location, the one I was sure had to be sound-stage carpentry, was an 18th century church. What can I say? The future just isn't what it used to be.<br /><br />It has great action, a great look, and great female leads. If you have a fourteen year old boy anywhere in your spirit, let it see this movie. (And no, you don't have to be male to have a fourteen year old boy somewhere inside.)<br /><br />//wiredweirdt location, the one I was sure had to be sound-stage carpentry, was an 18th century church.

B00003CXTF|1.0|I barely stomached watching ten minutes of this movie.  Who ever wrote it didn't know a damn thing about World War II history, the neutrality act, various performance of the World War II aircraft or nothing.  I found it the biggest waste of time.  Stupid me bought the movie and I turned it off and gave it to someone, I don't even remember who.  What a waste of money and time and effort.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|Several years ago, I was in love with everything that bore even a passing resemblence to Final Fantasy VII. I'm not sure if its that I've grown out of that stuff or if this movie just sucked, but either way, I didn't enjoy it. The way I remember it, FFVII had a convincing story line which, while fantasy oriented, drew the player in and created a thoroughly textured world to operate in. Advent Children, on the other hand, has a story full of holes, and relies on strange occurances which have no background  information to support them. This makes the movie seem like a children's game; it is as if the writers were making up rules as they went along, rather than working in the framework of the world they had already created. The plot twists were so ridiculous, I found myself unable to keep a straight face as they transpired. I've noticed this to be a problem in alot of Japanese anime, so while I was dissapointed by Advent Children, I wasn't entirely surprised. To it's credit, the animation and action sequences are incredible, and everything is very fast paced. I just didn't feel what I felt when I played FFVII... maybe it's just me.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|Named after the World War II term \\"foo fighter,\\" a mysterious aerial phenomena, the Foo Fighters pose another mystery with their history of \\"hit and miss\\" albums; in the Foo Fighter's case, it is more of a \\"miss and hit\\" affair.  Beginning with their self-titled 1995 debut, the band has adopted a \\"miss and hit\\" routine where every other album falls a bit short of potential while the albums in between exude flawlessness, i.e. \\"The Colour And The Shape\\" and \\"One By One.\\"  Continuing this method, \\"In Your Honor\\" contains a few classics but leaves something more to be desired.  The first four tracks of disc one, \\"In Your Honor,\\" \\"No Way Back,\\" \\"Best Of You,\\" and \\"DOA\\" all display the bands potential with a high-energy, guitar-driven effort; these songs clearly belong at the top of the Foo Fighters catalog.  The remaining six songs on disc one display brief highlights here and there but the drum-driven formula (as opposed to vocal or guitar-driven formulas) tends to become a bit monotonous.  The second disc in its entirety is a complete \\"bore-fest\\" as it does not even merit a review. <br /> <br />In Your Honor - 4/5 Good introduction with blaring vocals. <br />No Way Back - 5/5 An obvious Foo Fighter classic. <br />Best Of You - 5/5 Music doesn't get much better than this folks. <br />DOA - 5/5 Yet another solid Foo Fighter classic. <br />Hell - 3/5 Nothing to brag about, seems a bit sporatic. <br />The Last Song - 3/5 Definite potential here but the chorus ruins the effort. <br />Free Me - 2/5 Lacks both musically and lyrically. <br />Resolve - 3/5 Decent song but tends to lean towards boredom. <br />The Deepest Blues Are Black - 3/5 Clever title, the rockin' chorus saves it from bea lower score. <br />End Over End - 3/5 Very strong track but again, it lacks something.
B000002GC2|5.0|I bought this CD at the same time and for pretty much the same reason as I did Quincy Jones' prior album \\"Sounds...\\" (see my review) and I'm equally pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />By the time Q released this one, he'd produced \\"Off The Wall\\" for Michael Jackson, \\"Masterjam\\" for Rufus & Chaka Khan, \\"Light Up The Night\\" for The Brothers Johnson, \\"Give Me The Night\\" for George Benson and I believe he produced Patti Austin's classic \\"Every Home Should Have One\\" round about the same time. He'd been busy and it showed. He had more or less honed his skills to perfection. To me, this album would've marked the musical if not commercial peak of his career but then of course, the following year he topped it all with \\"Thriller\\".<br /><br />This is his best 'solo' output though, smooth as silk and as cool as cucumber. Not a note out of place and everything as clear as crystal, with horns crisp and tight. Patti Austin provides the lead vocals for four out of the nine tracks here: \\"Betcha' Wouldn't Hurt Me\\", \\"Somethin' Special\\", \\"Razzamatazz\\" and \\"Turn On The Action\\". Q's new find James Ingram provides lead vocals for three: \\"The Dude\\", the classic \\"Just Once\\" and \\"One Hundred Ways\\". \\"Velas\\" is a magnificent jazz piece by the harmonica player, \\"Toots\\" Thielemans and the opener, \\"Ai No Corrida\\" is lead by Charles May and someone introduced to us as \\"Dune\\". I wonder if anyone ever heard from HIM again?<br /><br />The ex-Heatwave frontman Rod Temperton wrote three out of the nine and co-wrote one. Stevie Wonder contributed one he co-wrote with Stephanie Andrews and I heard the rest were either brought to Q's attention or he searched through a batch of songs (as producers do), until he had found the exact ones he wanted.<br /><br />All the greats feature here: Stevie Wonder himself, Herbie Hancock, Ernie Watts, Michael Jackson, Steve Lukather, David \\"Hawk\\" Wolinski (he of Rufus and Chaka Khan fame), the legendary percussionist Paulinho DaCosta and Louis Johnson.<br /><br />Great music never grows old and this is one they'll be playing well into the next century. Quincy Jones at his best!e they'll be playing well into the next century. Quincy Jones at his best!
B00005JP4U|5.0|UPDATE:    I've taken 4 more people to the film, 2 of which are steadfast Republican. ALL found the film to be very important. That doesn't mean they all like Al Gore because they don't, but they thought the message was very important. Crediting this movie, another household will be purchasing green power, which is available in our area.    REMARKS:    1. I've read all 15 reviews of 3 or fewer stars, and it was clear that 12 of them didn't see the movie altogether. The other 3? Two seemed to have been expecting an action movie, not a documentary (the reviews were \\"Gore Speaks The 'Truth'!\\" and \\"boring university lecture\\"). One seemed to have phased out after the first 10 minutes (\\"Chill\\"), and ranted on about other things for 75% of the review. Basically, if you actually watch this movie realizing there are no car chases or explosions, 9 out of 10 people will agree this is a 4+ star movie. If you also go in with an open mind, 99 out of 100.    2. President Bush: \\"I believe that greenhouse gases are creating a problem, a long-term problem that we got to deal with. ... There's an interesting confluence now between dependency upon fossil fuels from a national economic security perspective, as well as the consequences of burning fossil fuels for greenhouse gases.\\" He said this in an interview on June 30, 2005. (Find the interview that contains this quotation by searching google with \\"bush global warming quotation\\" and look for the timesonline site). The fact that President Bush acknowledges global warming as a problem caused by humans is important and should have been included in this film. I think this would have reached out to many of those who do not trust the media or Al Gore.    REVIEW:    This film is entertaining, but is best described as engaging.    Seeing this film will make the evidence clear. As polarizing a figure as Gore seems to be, he lays out this evidence in a very clear way, a way that anyone can understand and appreciate. Perhaps the most convincingevidence is the graph that shows the carbon dioxide levels and temperature levels over the last 600,000 years -- they line up pretty much perfectly. Note that the CO2 levels at anytime during those 600,000 years are nowhere near the levels they are at today.    What is to come in the future due to global warming is also discussed. The melting in the Arctic and Antarctic. We expect the ice in the Arctic to completely disappear during (northern hemisphere) summers in less than 50 years. A possible disruption of the main ocean currents, which are in part fed by the cold of the Arctic. Melting ice in Greenland and the Antarctic will cause a rise in ocean levels (consider that much of many major portions of major cities in the U.S. and around the world have elevation <10 feet, and many cities completely under 20 feet, many in hurricane prone regions like Florida).    This film will do what it is set out to do -- convince the people who actually see it that the problem is serious. So, do you believe in global warming already? Do you believe it is a serious problem that we need to deal with now? If not, see the movie. No, see the DOCUMENTARY. If you answered yes to both questions, still see it, but bring someone who doesn't already realize how serious the problem is, otherwise the purpose of this movie is kind of moot.    Be sure to stick around for a bit after the movie \\"ends\\" for some very well designed (written) comments.    WEBSITE:    The movie's website is w w w .climatecrisis. n e t, and it has numerous ways to reduce carbon emission, a topic that was not addressed thoroughly in the movie.    -Updated on July 1st, adding the first and last of the four sections.

B000FFJ85I|3.0|I am a punk and hardcore music fanatic and have been listening to AFI for close to ten years.  With Sing the Sorrow I thought they toned it down a bit, but this pop emo stuff just sucks.  Gimme an F'n break.  Sorry AFI but you have officially sold out.  Your even on MTV countdowns now.  Maybe you can start touring with Jessica Simpson or Brittney Spears.  The only reason I even gave them three stars is the fact that I still love there old stuff and am hoping they can go back to there roots with the next album. (probably not though)
B000ASDFJU|4.0|This show is great and this is so much cheaper than buying each season individually.  I personally like the binder it comes in.  The only thing is at least 3 of the episodes skip a lot and are impossible to watch, and I'm on season three.  Great bargain though, awesome show.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Capturing one's spiritual crisis hardly sounds like the ideal cinematic subject, but master director Fred Zinnemann does an unparalleled job of dramatizing the inner turmoil and the quest for serenity and immaculate devotion in the life of a Belgian novice in the 1930's. This is no small feat as so much of the story has to do with evoking what is essentially a journey of introspection in this 1959 classic. Fortunately, Audrey Hepburn is luminous as the novice, Sister Luke, who begins the movie as Gabrielle (\\"Gaby\\") van der Mal, the daughter of a notable surgeon, who dreams of going to the Congo as a nurse for the natives. Proving she doesn't need Givenchy couture or an adoring leading man to complete her, Hepburn brings her character to shimmering life in a fully dimensional performance. It also helps that Robert Anderson has written an impressive screenplay based on Kathryn Hulme's expansive novel based on a friend who was indeed a Belgian nurse and a former nun.<br /><br />The story has three discrete parts. The first focuses on Gaby's induction into the Catholic order and the exacting transition she makes from postulant to novice. What strikes me most about this part of the movie is not so much the deeper spirituality at the foundation of the training but the near cult-like behavior demanded of the postulants. It's an impressive rite of passage with particularly effective turns by Mildred Dunnock as the humorless Mother of Postulants and especially Edith Evans as the Reverend Mother, a figure concurrently maternal and fearsome. The newly named Sister Luke is assigned to the mental ward of a Belgian asylum where she experiences an episode of terror with a young Colleen Dewhurst as a combative schizophrenic patient.<br /><br />The film's second section has Sister Luke fulfilling her dream to go to the Congo but only to treat the European patients at a white hospital. Still, she makes an impression on the native population as well as Dr. Fortunati, a bellowing atheist and brilliant surgeon who is soon impressed by Sister Luke's medical skills. The two bond, and there is an unspoken feeling of romance, especially during her bout with tuberculosis. However, her skills demand her to go back to Belgium now on the verge of WWII. The third and last part of the movie has Sister Luke back at the convent and struggling with her vows, especially as the Nazis invade and personal tragedy occurs. Zinnemann smartly avoids wartime action shots and lets the nuns recite news headlines as a means of visualizing the carnage surrounding the order. The film ends with an extremely moving, wordless sequence of Sister Luke deciding her fate.<br /><br />As a Belgian who suffered through WWII, Hepburn has an obvious affinity with Gaby/Sister Luke, and even covered head to toe by her habit, she lets her beautiful face express a full range of emotions. Peter Finch plays Dr. Fortunati with convincing swagger, and a gallery of fine character actresses make strong impressions despite the constrictions of their habits. In the Congo sequence, Peggy Ashcroft is a lively presence as Mother Mathilde, and Dorothy Alison makes the optimism of Sister Aurelie palpable and ultimately poignant. Dean Jagger plays the small role of Gaby's father with his requisite paternal appeal. Franz Planer's cinematography is first-rate, especially the National Geographic-like scenes in the Congo, and Franz Waxman does his usual sterling work on the stentorian music score. The new 2006 DVD only offers the original trailer as an extra, a shame since the film is so accomplished in many ways.surgeon who is soon impressed by Sister Luke's medical skills.

Zinnemann smartly avoids wartime action shots and lets the nuns recite news headlines as a means of visualizing the carnage surrounding the order. The film ends with an extremely moving, wordless sequence of Sister Luke deciding her fate.    As a Belgian who suffered through WWII, Hepburn has an obvious affinity with Gaby/Sister Luke, and even covered head to toe by her habit, she lets her beautiful face express a full range of emotions. Peter Finch plays Dr. Fortunati with convincing swagger, and a gallery of fine character actresses make strong impressions despite the constrictions of their habits. In the Congo sequence, Peggy Ashcroft is a lively presence as Mother Mathilde, and Dorothy Alison makes the optimism of Sister Aurelie palpable and ultimately poignant. Dean Jagger plays the small role of Gaby's father with his requisite paternal appeal. Franz Planer's cinematography is first-rate, especially the National Geographic-like scenes in the Congo, and Franz Waxman does his usual sterling work on the stentorian music score. The new 2006 DVD only offers the original trailer as an extra, a shame since the film is so accomplished in many ways.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's a shame that this show only made it 10 episodes on the small screen.  It deserved so much better.  All we really end up with is the initial story arc, and it was setting up for some seriously amazing things.  And Fox, with an eye single to the glory of the Ratings Gods (as usual) decided to cancel it.   <br /> <br />Firefly had many things that set it apart from just about every TV show out there.  It has believable, REAL characters that could be related to.  It had the perfect blend of snappy writing, witty humor, tense action, and deep, unconventional moral overtones not seen in many TV shows here or after.  It had so many things to make it great. <br /> <br />Serenity was a fitting tribute to this soon-to-be-classic TV series.  Don't even hesistate to buy the DVD set.  Just do it.  You won't regret it.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|For its genre, this is a surprisingly well made film.  One has to watch all of the extras on the DVD to fully appreciate the film and to realize it is not just sick gore.  This is MUCH better than horror films like The Ring and Saw because there is vengeance and some sense of justice wrought in the end.  That is the adrenaline rush in this film, not the gore.  The gore is just something to endure like having one's tooth pulled.  It is pretty gruesome, but it is still a great premise and well done, even believable.  It says it is based on true events!  I would not be surprised if somewhere on this planet in a dirty warehouse in the middle of nowhere, there are demented MDs paying big bucks to get some pretty sick kicks...
6304779607|5.0|This movie is so bad that you have to love it, from the opening scene in the super market, to the motorcycle/car chase at the end of the movie.  This movie has got it all.  Sly is the archetype of a stale, tough on the outside, warm on the inside hero.  The one liners are sick.  For instance when the super market is threatened to be blown to pieces Sly says, \\"Go ahead, I don't shop here.\\"<br /><br />As for Brigitte Nielsen, what a wonderful little (or tall) actress she is.  I especially like the part in the parking garage, where she is fighting for her life.  I found it all so believable.  I really think she should have gotten an Oscar in 1986 for this movie.  Why not?  Judi Dench received an academy award for Shakespeare in Love and she was only in it for five minutes.  Here we have eighty-seven minutes of sheer genius.<br /><br />Last but not least, I love the Bounty Hunter from the X-Files as the lead villain.  What a wonderful job he did, because he had to really work outside his acting realm to be in this film.  I also loved the Bounty Hunter's minions, all very upset blue-collar workers who wanted to be loved.  So they joined a serial killer cult!!  I love this movie!  I love the Zombie Squad!  I love the 80's music in this movie! Why can't Cobra just come over my house and have some Famous Amos cookies with me?!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|It is said that between 1964 and 1975, there were no fewer than three hundred Italian-made (though shot in Spain) so-called \\"spaghetti westerns.\\"  Most of them were shot on budgets that wouldn't even begin to cover the cost of catering on most of today's big-budget Hollywood extravaganzas.  And, truth be told, most of them weren't very good, or loaded with sadistic violence.  But director Sergio Leone, though he loathed the term \\"spaghetti western\\", was different.  His trilogy of films, known as the Dollars trilogy, helped establish him internationally as a filmmaker, and also put Clint Eastwood, known up until then only as Rowdy Yates on TV's \\"Rawhide\\", on the map as a worldwide heavyweight actor.  The first two films were 1964's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and 1965's FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, both of which were released in America in 1967.  The final film of this trilogy, made in 1966 but released in the US at the end of 1967, was the mercurial THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY.  Apart from being the best film in this bizarre but fascinating trilogy, it is almost certainly the quintessential movie of the widely misunderstood spaghetti western genre. <br /> <br />Eastwood reprises his role as the Man With No Name, who has come across information from a dying Civil War soldier about a $200,000 fortune located in some deserted cemetery.  The problem is, of course, that Eastwood has only gleaned PART of this information, while a Mexican bandido (Eli Wallach, in a wild extension of his role in the 1960 western masterpiece THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN) has got the other piece of the puzzle.  The two men form an uneasy alliance, and are also joined by the sadistic Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef, in an extension of his role in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE).  Their trek across the badlands of the Southwest involves much mistrust, Civil War violence, and a number of one-liners of the \\"There are two kinds of people in this world\\" variety.  Everything comes to a head in that cemetery, and the result is aspine-tingling face-off between the three men, one of the single greatest of its type ever put on the big screen. <br /> <br />In contrast to the mere $100,000 spent on A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and the $400,000 spent on FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, Leone lavished $1.2 million on THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, and every little red cent shows up on the screen here.  Leone doesn't miss a trick, as he and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli juxtapose wide-open landscapes (albeit landscapes broiling under the heat of the sun and the Civil War) with extreme close-ups, especially in the climactic cemetery sequence.  The contrast between Eastwood's seemingly disinterested Man With No Name, Van Cleef's sadistic bounty hunter, and Wallach's half-crazed bandido is a study in extremes, of course, but one where Leone clearly has firm control in this film's three hour proceedings. <br /> <br />But what really seals the deal on THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is the intense music score of Ennio Morricone, one of the single greatest scores ever composed for any film, western or otherwise.  Its celebrated main theme is undoubtedly known to all who have ever seen the film; and the Ecstasy Of Gold and Trio musical cues at the end are extremely powerful stuff even today.  This partnership of Leone and Morricone, formed in the first two \\"Dollars\\" films, would reach its apex with the magisterial 1969 western epic ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (which is Leone's true masterpice). <br /> <br />Very lengthy, often blackly funny, flamboyant, and undoubtedly violent, THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY remains an important and complex film of a peculiar genre, and one that remains hugely influential almost forty years after it was first released.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|A combonation of metal and blues rock, Burn is another great album from Deep Purple. Songs like the fast-paced title track and the bass-heavy Sail Away are masterpeices. Still not as good as anything I've heard from the Gillian era, but a great album nonetheless.
B000EU1KXC|5.0|I don't know how anyone can reccomend a bootleg recording over this professional job. You can't even hear Charlie Watts' drums on LiveR! This album, on the other hand, is the real deal, and ranks up there with the Who's Live At Leeds as one of the greatest 60's live recordings ever.  Of course it would be better if it were expanded to cover the entire set list of the 69 tour, but until then, we have to make due with what we have, and that is great rockin' performances of early prime stones' material. A killer performance of Sympathy for the Devil, A loose rockin' Midnight Rambler and a High Octane Jumpin' Jack Flash are the highlights here, along with Street Fighting Man.  If you don't mind a crappy recording on a portable tape recorder, the bootleg is not bad, but there are far superior bootlegs from the Taylor era.
B00028491G|5.0|This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.<br /><br />The quality of this two disc DVD is superlative with crystal clear visuals and great sound quality. The letterbox format offers both the theatrical release version and the special edition version from which to choose. The special edition version offers an extra nine minutes of restored footage. The second disc offers a myriad of features, including an interesting thirty minute documentary on the making of the film.

B000EHSVQE|5.0|I have to admit that I am late to the super duper, ulta cool club of people who have this movie. For a long time, I keep hearing people talking about the movie, certain scenes, and laughing until their on the floor about things I didn't know about. Why it took me so long to get on the Napoleon train, I have no idea. But it's now officially over. I have been Napoleoned, and there is no going back. Now I join everyone else, proud of my wisdom in all things Napoleon. It's good to be a member of the club. The film itself?. All I have got to say is that the writer and director of the movie must of been nerds in high school, or at least knew someone who was. Their depiction of Napoleon, and High School in general, is so specific and spot on, that it must of come from both of their lives. That's how good this movie is. Jon Heder plays Napoleon, the biggest geek you ever saw, who lives with his grandmother and older brother Kip(who I swear plays Weigel's serial killer boyfriend on \\"Reno 911\\"). They live in some no name, bodunk Idaho town, that's just as forgettable as the people who live in it. The look of the movie is worth noting as well. The people in the movie are plain, and their environments accompany them. The movie is shot well to go with the people. Whoever scouted this location for the film has a nice eye. But what is the movie really about?. Not sure. There's not so much of a plot going here, just an observance of life. A peek into the life of this nerdy high schooler and the people who populate his existence. But Napoleon does have some missions. Get his new friend, Pedro, elected as class president, and to get a date to the prom. The boys' uncle(played by Jon Gries, wig and all)comes to look over them too. Tina Majorino also appears as the girl who likes Napoleon, and he likewise. She was so real and believeable in her role. The acting and characterizations are done to a T. The movie and people are so real, that you expect to drive to this Idaho town and reallyfind them. That's good praise to the writing and acting of this film. Heder is a marvel. Where did he come from?. He's amazing. He brings this character to life in a way I have never seen a character, nerd or otherwise, achieve. The movie may not be for everyone's taste, but it is worth checking out and sticking it out to the end for. There are so many good scenes, and this has to be the most quoteable movie to come along in a very long time. The film's humor is sometimes odd, sometimes subtle, but always very funny. I am catching new things I didn't notice the first time I saw it. No doubt about it, Napoleon Dynamite is like no other. It's charm, characters, and way of life, is all it's own. This is one film I will be remembering(and quoting)for years to come.
B000065KEW|5.0|This is a raw and powerful movie on the drug trade and its corresponding law enforcement response. It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portrayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial. He ignores all the standard warning signs, until it is nearly too late.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance. He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican general, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego businessman, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold bloodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!<br /><br />There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle. To find out how they do so, watch this well directed and powerful film. It is certainly well worth watching and a welcome addition to one's personal film collection.in jail, awaiting trial.

0743277708|5.0|This is one of the great books of the centrury. Richard Adams has effectively captured a fictional representation of what life for a rabbit could be like. The adventures of Hazel, Bigwig, and company after successfully escaping the destruction of their original warren thanks to the warnings of one of their comrades is a delight for all ages. What I love most about this text is the details with which Adams has presented these animals. He has created a whole world, complete with language and mythology for these animals to draw upon. The pacing is quick and you can't help but plow through it. For me, much of the book was about finding home and what you were willing to do to not only find one, but also defend it (although Adams maintains it has no allegorical significance). I think this is one of those great books you revisit every year, finding new things with every reading. Buy it and enjoy.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I cannot recommend O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? highly enough.     The Coen brothers skillfully revive classical literature (The Odyessy of Homer) in the story of three wanderers trying to find their way home, and recall American history in a beautifully imaginative, archtypal way.    For example, the main characters are three hoboes whose downright stupidity, ineptitude, pathos, and vulnerability are much too exaggerated to be realistic--and that's the point. They're supposed to be emblematic and archetypal, and as such they are a triumph.  They are also hysterically funny.  They are lost, vulnerable, dirty, unlettered but sweet and innocent, hopping freights, trying to keep body and soul together.       George Clooney masterfully portrays one of the bedraggled trio, dumb, dizzy, clueless, but handsome and masterful, with more charm than the law allows--indeed he is consciously recalling the legendary charm of Clark Gable with grace.  I'm sure Gable would be honored.    John Turturro is also clueless, dumb, and vulnerable, with intensity extreme anguish, and confusion added in.  The combination can't help but make you laugh.  He's the one that keeps ending up in deep doo-doo through no fault of his own.  He emits a silent scream that sends his buddies running to rescue him, stumbling all the way.    The third of the team is mild mannered, dumb, confused, innocent, toothless, and incredibly sweet and supportive--up for anything he has to encounter (just like Ulysses).    And the challenges are as daunting.  There is a chilling seen of a Klan meeting: There are hundreds of Klan members dressed in those evil, medieval-looking robes with the pointed hats, marching in a circle with burning torches, evoking the monkey guards of THE WIZARD OF OZ and the depraved monks in THE NAME OF THE ROSE.  They are approaching a huge, burning cross upon which they plan to lynch a black man.  This part is not funny.  But, again, it is even larger than life (if that is possible in the case of the Klan) and seems more of an archetype than an attempt to mimic reality.    The snippets of folk music on the soundtrack throughut the movie are the icing on the cake.    American history and its folkways are clearly close to the Coens' hearts.

To me, the movie just isn't the same without the narrative sound track.
B000301YY8|5.0|This is the first CD that I bought in a long time that I enjoy from beginning to end.  I first caught a glimpse of Mr. Blunt on VH 1 and based on that, I got his CD.  \\"Your Beautiful\\" is great and getting a tremendous amount of airplay right now.  Stick with the CD and listen for \\"Goodbye My Lover\\"--it is wonderful!  The most haunting song is \\"No Bravery\\"--which to me is reflective of his time in the military.  As a parent I was also pleased that there were only a few times when he cursed throughout the CD.  I am by no means a musician, but as an artist/teacher I find his music soulful.  I hope that his next effort is just as good as this one...

0060254920|5.0|I am surprised at some of the reasons some reviewers give for posting a negative score for this book. One reviewer stated that this book had wonderful illustrations but the writing was horrendous with little content. This reason seemed enough for that particular reviewer to give it a feeble one star. Well isn't it a picture book first and foremost? A PICTURE BOOK. Another point brought up by someone was that it set a terrible example to kids that it's ok to be bratty. Well here's a news flash... Every kid goes through tantrums and frustrations. Its all part of learning to understand the grown-up world outside their bedroom door. Sometimes a child's only haven is inside their room, where they are free to sort things out and release their frustrations. Sometimes its very hard for a child to make sense of the world around them. Remember when you were a kid and just didn't understand why you were getting in trouble? It may seem obvious to a parent, but to a two year old, its a whole mess of feelings.  Max was, after all, being punished for his actions. Was he supposed to be a good little boy and be happy that he got in trouble? Every kid goes through those \\"terrible times\\" stage, and It's funny how some parents seem to forget... Sendak never said it was ok to snap at mommy, so I am curious as to where that reviewer assumed that this was the message. It's a story of what goes through the imagination of a young boy when he gets punished, and how he deals with these emotions. We don't become adults at the snap of a finger... <br />I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so I leave it up to you to make yours. My opinion is this: fantastic book, fantastic illustrations, fantastic pace... just right for what it is, a picture book that I loved as a kid and loving reading to the kids as an adult.
0316168815|5.0|I can't say enough about how wonderful this book is. The Lovely Bones is one of those books that when you finish it, you want to take what you've gleaned and put it somewhere special and close to your heart. This book is touching and heartfelt and you can't help but feel sympathy for all of the characters involved. Susie is 14 years old when she is brutally raped and murdered in her small New England town. The effect is devastating for the neighborhood when no suspects can be found, for her family who struggles to pick up the pieces of their loss, and for Susie who looks down on them all from heaven. Sebold's writing drew me in to the point where I was actually had to sit up and turn on the lights in my house because I was beginning to get creeped out. Her characters are vivid and the grief that Susie's family is feeling is palpable. I think it's next to impossible to read this book and not feel something. Sebold's writing is descriptive and her characters are haunting. In fact, it was so good that even though I borrowed it from a coworker and have already read it I'll still buy myself a copy. Also, according to imdb.com the book is being made into a movie to be directed by Peter Jackson. I'm both hopeful and doubtful that the complexities of this book will be translated well on screen.
0439679958|4.0|This novel was a more recent delve into literature that I took. it started off as a break. I wanted to read something lite and not too hard but still enjoyable. After numerous occasions at visiting my school's library(Which boasts a rather large selection of books, but in all truthfulness has actually very little)I came across this book, \\"Raven's Gate\\" By Anthony Horowitz. Book 1 of \\"the Gatekeepers\\" saga. Published by New York Press, NY 2005- I quickly glanced at it. 254 pgs. (Lite enough reading for me!) Next the language.(Not so bad...) Next thing I know I had checked it out and was at my desk opening the first page. <br />   It was wasn't until I realized I sat down at home to finish the  5th Chapter that I realized it was a wonderful book. Easy- Going yet the words provided vivid images as to the situations and characters, not to mention their attitudes and expressions. <br />   The story begins with the main chr. \\"Matt\\" who, due to a plot of bad choices/events, managed to get arrested after a warehouse heist went wrong. Matt, from there, was given two choices- Go to Prison or participate in a program and be send away to live with old, and rather creepy lady in the middle of nowhere, out in the countryside. <br />   Little did Matt know what eventually unfold. Witches, mysticism, and black magic. Events that would eventually lead him to the site of what is known as the Raven's Gate. An age old portal that could summon beasts of unthinkable power and evntually destroy the world as we know it. <br />   This book is a wonderful and great display of the fushion between modern and medevil-type events. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys magic-type reading or any fan of the over popular and ever so neverending story of \\"Harry Potter\\". <br />   This book was fabulous and I will definately be seeking out the sequel to it and reading it as well.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|I just got finished reading a review from T. Nakajima and i became immediately appalled as a 19 year old junior in college and i have deemed myself an honorary rent head. I managed to see the movie and immediatly forced all of my freinds to watch it with me. Within 2 weeks we knew all of the songs and majority of the choreography, especially La Vie Boheme and Take Me Or Leave Me.  <br />But i digress, i beame upset after reading that T.

038551123X|3.0|In \\"Darkly Dream Dexter\\" author Jeff Lindsay introduces us to the protagonist Dexter Morgan, a police criminologist working in Miami.  More specifically, he's a blood splatter analyst who just happens to be revolted by blood because of the mess that it makes.  Oh, and he's also a lifetime serial killer who lives by a code that only allows him to target other criminals.  Some complex guy, this Dexter Morgan, eh?   <br /> <br />As the story unfolds, the reader finds that Dexter himself is the main attraction here instead of the sometimes-flimsy storyline.  He's no avenging vigilante fueled by outrage for a criminal justice system that too often moves too slowly.  Rather, he's relatively blase about what he is - ho hum, this is the hand that I was dealt so I'll just have to go with it.  He's completely self-aware that he's not at all like other people, so he cloaks much of his sharp mind behind a well-polished role as the glib and charming yet completely harmless, boring guy next door.  This also opens up Dexter's vulnerability with other people - since he doesn't see himself as one, he doesn't have any idea why they act the way that they do.  The best he can do is mimic how they act and react to one another;  he's long ago given up on understanding the motivations of the normal people who surround him every day.  This creates some  <br />5b4 <br />funny fish-out-of-water passages in Dexter's own head, particularly the up-and-down romance with his girlfriend (whom he keeps around purely as part of the \\"normal guy\\" act).  His first-person observations on the people around him are smarmy and incisive, a clever ploy by the author to inject content that's somewhere between social commentary and stand-up comedy (an example:  \\"I swear, the way people drive in this town. . . how could they expect me NOT to continue killing them?\\").  Dexter is definitely darkly funny as he maintains his disguise as an everyday citizen, and his dialogue and commentary is the centerpiece of thebook - he's ready-made for a series.   <br /> <br />The story and the supporting cast are a little disappointing by comparison.  Dexter assists his adopted sister (who is also a cop) in the investigation of a series of murders that seem to be mimicking Dexter's own secret methods.  He becomes torn between intrigue and terror at the way that this other perpetrator is almost calling out to him with each new crime.  Would he rather help his sister solve the case that would make her career or find for himself a kindred spirit who shares a similar \\"Dark Passenger\\"?  Or is he possibly being set up - lured out of his routine just enough to be framed for all of these copycat crimes?  Eventually, the story gives up a little too much too soon and the end becomes equal parts predictable and incredible.   <br /> <br /> <br />5b4 <br />Also, the reader will find it difficult to care much about the other characters, especially the erratic sister who clearly is meant to play a big role in Dexter's life.  This may have happened because Lindsay purposefully wrote the actions of others through Dexter's interpretations, making them strange and distant.  More likely, I think he just had so much fun writing as Dexter that the other characters became necessary afterthoughts.   <br /> <br />Part Hannibal Lecter part Monk with a silver tongue that Alan Shore would envy, Dexter Morgan makes for some entertaining reading.  Hopefully future installments will see him bring his sharp wit to some better plots.
B000EPR7NE|3.0|I'm a fan of Hans Zimmer's music, because I like his way of composing, but when I listened to The Da Vinci Code soundtrack, I have to confess that I was disappointed. Hans Zimmer could and should have done better to this soundtrack. Probably, the director Ron Howard, doesn't want the music to be very nice, well, I mean, he wants the movie to be more important than the soundtrack...<br /><br />However, if you ask me that should you buy this album? I shall say you SHOULD. But, don't buy the entire album here. I suggest you buy from iTunes or Rhapsody ordering these following tracks suggested by me.<br /><br />Track 1-Dies Mercurii I Martius.<br /><br />This is a nice track with long lengh. It's worth purchasing because almost all themes in this album features in this track.<br /><br />Track 7-Salvete Virgines<br /><br />This track does not appear in the film, but it is a good track for listening. The chorus was nicely handled, but it uses only one theme, so I don't strongly recommend this track.<br /><br />Track 13-cheValiers de sangreal<br /><br />Although I rated this album only three stars, but this song is very worth purchasing, eventhough it is only about three minutes, but it is a very nice track, the theme is stronger and stronger and it is one of the best tracks on the album.<br /><br />Track 14-Kyrie for The Magdalene<br /><br />I really like this track, actually. It's a very sad song, but it was not composed by Hans Zimmer. However, this track is very beautiful, and you should purchase this track. The soprano was so pure and sad that sometimes even make me cry. and also, the chorus was nicely conducted and ends the album excellently.<br /><br />I hope you'll enjoy the music, but I suggest you to buy from iTunes or Rhapsody still. DON'T BUY THE ENTIRE ALBUM!
0312979479|5.0|Ten people on an island: each getting picked off one by one.<br /><br />If all are dead, who could possibly be the killer?<br /><br />This is the setup to A. Christie's most popular novel.<br /><br />Christie has always been criticized for breaking the codes of mystery writing; and here, she does.<br /><br />The 2 biggest rules in mystery fiction is that the reader should always be able to solve the crime along with the detective; and that there can be no slight of hand to fool the reader. Here, there is no detective and no foolproof way to pick the killer before he/she is revealed. Sure, one can GUESS who the killer is, but there is no way to know for certain. Why? Because there is definitely slight of hand.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer to have the wool pulled over my eyes. Then I can truly be shocked by the denouement.
6304806418|4.0|I first watched Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita when I was about eight years old. I have to confess that I was not so fascinated with the story much. Maybe because I was too young then, but when I watched it again when I was twelve or thirteen, I felt that it was a very good movie. Though I don't like it as much as The Phantom of The Opera, but Webber's composition stood captivated me in Evita. The soundtrack is the combination of Rock, Opera, and Jazz. I could say that this is the modern composition for the movie. When I watched Evita in 2004-2005, I even cried when Madonna sang the song called \\"You must love me\\". And this song had become my favourite track from the soundtrack album, and also, it has become my favourite scene from the movie. IF... you give your attention to this movie, I'm quite sure that you're going to know something more from one woman's heart. Basically, I don't like Madonna much, but in this movie, I have to admit that she was beautiful and her acting was brilliant.
B000001FS3|4.0|You can't help but see a mountain men, desert image when looking at pictures of U2 from the Joshua Tree era. The album cover, as well as some of the songs just put you in this frame of mind. It's certainly a far cry from the image of leather and shades and sexuality that would be adopted years later. <br /> <br />No matter how many people sing the praises of The Joshua Tree, there are some songs that just don't do it for me. One Tree Hill and Mothers of the Disappeared are not really good to me. And I never had an orgasmic experience listening to Where the Streets Have No Name despite it being one of U2's legendary songs. The rest are great; and provide evidence as to why this album has the reputation it does.  <br /> <br />Sidenote: Somebody desperately needs to remaster U2's older albums. The sound quality is terrible.
B000AARKOO|3.0|It's not so interesting as showed in the trailer. Well, I could say that it's a nonsense movie. But, the armies and the way of fighting captivated me. I like it in that point. But, I shall not suggest you to purchase it or not. It depends on your personalities.
B000BVD460|5.0|Eminem is a white man in a country where it is VERY advantageous to be so. Yet, he acts like he had it worse than everybody else. He has failed to stop feeling sorry for himself and count his blessings. He makes me want to grab him by the shoulders and yell, \\"You're a white male in America! What are you complaining about!\\"  <br /> <br />Why is he so miserable? He has taken a black art form and become more famous/infamous and richer than any of his counterparts; yet his mentality is so negative and actions so destructive that it's very hard to like him no matter how talented he is. Most of his music is really good, which is why I rated this collection a 5. But I also fear he treads very closely to being like all of the people he supposedly despises (Vanilla Ice, B. Spears, NSync etc) by being so Pop accessible and making stupid songs and videos like Just Lose It. Jay-Z or Nas couldn't have made a song like that and retained any respect or street cred.  <br /> <br />All of this makes Eminem a hypocrite, of course. That's why it is unwise to have such an anti-establishment, anti-sellout, sanctimonious attitude when it comes to art; because inevitably, you will become apart of that establishment you so vehemently claim to hate. All of the artists who proclaimed they would never sell out, have sold out. And that's all right. The money is too good to say no. I just wish people like Eminem would stop acting like they're so above the fray when they're actually wallowing in it.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|WTF? thats what I said when I saw most of the reviews from this site. I really liked AFI before Decemberunderground. But sorry this album is horrible. It has no replay value at all. Its a weak and sorry to say POP effort by the band. Their sound isnt what it use to be. I think this album is very boring. I still like AFI but this album was a horrible disapointment. All I can do is wait for the next album to get my AFI fix in. <br /> <br />For those that want a honest review my review is the best.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 preaches to the choir. Only those who already hate Bush are going to watch it and like it. And those who support Bush will either avoid it, or hate it. <br /> <br />I hate the job Bush has done as president, but I still think Moore is unfair. His mockumentaries are all alike in one way: they're dishonest. M. Moore doctors, edits, and copy and pastes footage to have people saying things they didn't say, and doing things they didn't do. He makes absurd leaps in logic, and makes connections where there are none. Moore and his kind want the President to be a bumbling idiot, but at the same time, want him to be a diabolical genius capable of orchestrating 9/11, which in itself is as treasonous an accusation as there could be. It's treasonous because these people aren't just raising questions, they're making declarations. <br /> <br />The scary part about Moore's crockumentaries is the fact that everybody will watch them and believe them despite their blatant dishonesty. People assume that documentaries are supposed to be ethical and truthful. And they ARE supposed to be; which is why Michael Moore's can't be qualified as such. <br /> <br />The interesting thing is, if Moore really believed what he stood for was the truth, he wouldn't need to lie and distort to prove his argument. <br /> <br />Whether its Roger and Me, Bowling for Columbine, or 9/11--he's never been fair to his topic. Avoid, avoid, avoid. They're only shockumentaries.

B00003CXB4|5.0|When you see the Lion King unavoidably for the 70th time like I have, you grow really sick of it. From the music to the storyline, it all breeds contempt. But the movie itself shouldn't be punished for its overexposure. It's a good story, even though it is similar to Hamlet. And it's a good movie. I won't venture to say it's the best cartoon ever because there are still other movies like Cinderellla and Snow White in existence; but it is definitely ONE of the best. <br /> <br />The only picky issue I have is with the voices. They have the strong commanding voice of James Earl Jones as the father, which is right on point; yet they have Matthew Broderick as the voice of the son. He sounds like he hasn't yet reached puberty even though he's grown. <br /> <br />Other than this, the film is excellent.
B0000CC61G|5.0|Back on December 1992 a friend who is a die-hard fan of prog as myself invited me to a live performance of a Swedish group I'd never heard before: Anglagard. Living in Mexico City where we never get to see underground groups (let alone PROG underground ones) it was not a hard decision to give it a try. The audience was not more than 150 people, all super prog fans, still I didn't know what to expect. Anglagaard came out to the stage and I could notice how young they all were, especially the drummer. Rightaway they started performing \\"Jordrok\\" and before a minute had passed we all realised that this was not another prog group, but that were in front of a MAJOR act, and best of all, in an almost private performance. We all listened astonished.<br /><br />Enough. The album is definitively one the best symphonic prog attempts in the last 20 years. The influence of 70's music, especially Gabriel's era Genesis is undeniable -I mean, who played a Mellotron in the 90's? - Tomas Jonson, keyboard player, is the perfect mixture of Wakeman and Banks. Still, it was Mattias Olson, at his late teens, the one who already displayed virtuosism on drums. The complex rhythms on every song of Hybris shows a very well achieved influence of icons like Neil Peart or Terry Bozzio. It is his playing that enhances all the compositions of the record, demanding your attention from the beginning to the end. Hybris displays very much a 70's mood, but totally renewed and with much energy and creativity. It is a pity that this group split so soon, as they had everything to be one of the top five prog groups ever. If you love Prog music, this one's for you.
1401307450|4.0|Or monumental excess!. Anthony Kiedis's testimony, as told to Larry Sloman, is less about probing his writing muse than it is a candid recounting of his pharmecutical ingestion over two decades; so candid, the reader wonders how all those names, especially the women he shares his sheets with, gave publishing clearance. Pop gossip, perhaps is more immune than other literary forms. His recall of innumerous cravings and the instances of satisfying them are truly astonishing. The 400+ pages are part of the excess, all party to the performer's self-promotional avarice. When will he pull in the reins for the last time? It's a wearing business. Clearly, Anthony owes heaps to those who've stuck with him and he's genuine and generous in acknowledging them. I put on some Peppers to check the genius status Kiedis accords the group. No. Something must have passed me by. None of the pathological, manic intensity the book alludes to issues from the music. Good but standard rock n roll. Kiedis is sufficiently proud of his achievements though and has no qualms about quoting his favourite songs. Are these the epiphanies, the relevations that he claims? Fans would believe so. But these adolescent burblings are dead on the page, strange pits of emptiness of less interest thamn the 'as told to' prose of Sloman. It is perhaps no surprise that Kiedis, who has been to so many places and met so many people, has so little to impart in the way of empathetic description of these. For all these shortcomings, that this anatomy of addiction is told by a survivor is pretty amazing.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Wow, this movie came out of nowhere.  At a time when Hollywood churns out the same predictable plots and bombards us with flat characters, Napoleon Dynamite delivers.  This is a movie about a nobody who does nothing, and that is why it succeeds to such a great extent.  Napoleon is the perennial loser, an unpopular kid in a small (and sometimes backward) town where nothing ever seems to happen.  This is what makes him such a compelling hero-he's the antithesis of the hard-bodied, perfect smiling hunk from the Hollywood cookie-cutter factory that we're constantly expected to relate to <br /> <br />The biggest complaint I've heard of this movie is that nothing happens.  This is absolutely true-nothing really happens through the course of the film.  There's not much action, nothing blows up, there is no outrageous crime or anything like that.  What there IS is a heartwarming story about a smalltown kid trying to make a small difference in his smalltown world.  The characters are hilarious and very well rounded, and the movie is incredibly funny by simple virtue of its simplicity.  Go into this movie with no expectations and you'll be very pleasantly surprised-go in expecting drama or action and you'll probably be disappointed.
B000E33VWW|4.0|'Capote' captures the peculiar creative process involved in the author's breakthrough literary piece, one that costs him his psychic and physical well-being. As we're given only the four years of the book's gestation we can't be sure if Capote's seduction by Perry, merely instigates, accelerates or caps issues from further back in the writer's life. The film brilliantly discloses Capote's hunting of his quarry and as we familiarize with the murderer, gradually sympathising with him, we are in equal measure disgusted with Capote's mercenary instincts. Both his lover, and his staunch friend, Harper Lee can only gaze in ambient horror at the obsessive depths Capote stoops to to gain literary status. Archetypal Mephistophlean stuff. Seymour Hoffman's acting has been justly rewarded, the first large measure role I've seen him in, though his appearances with Mamet, Altman, Solondz and the Cohens have always been exemplary. It's not a film I'd rush to see again, but a brilliantly realised, sombre work.
0743454529|4.0|\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" was first selected and then rejected, on account of some slightly risque scenes, by my high school English Department for our Honors reading list.  For the week or so that the novel was on the list, my eleventh-grade English teacher dispensed such intriguing teasers that after its removal I decided to read the book anyway.  I regret that I did not have the opportunity to read the book with a group, to debate its ethics and see whether other readers had come to the same conclusions that I did. <br /> <br />As to the novel itself, I often found myself longing for Kate's perspective, which Picoult omits until the very end.  The voice of the victim is therefore almost entirely absent.  I would have also appreciated narrations from the doctor and perhaps an objective character not emotionally involved in the outcome.  But perhaps the objectivity is meant to be supplied by the reader, and with it the verdict on the debate.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Lush, gorgeous, and amazing, this is one of the best MOVIES (forget animation) I have seen. With complexity, excellent role models and very solid messages of environmental awareness and moral character, this movie is among Miyazaki's best...and I love almost everything he has done. Miyazaki is one of the best modern storytellers in any culture and this is a wonderful story. <br /> <br />The dubbing is a bit sluggish at times, but I am just always happy when dubbing WORKS since I saw the original, terrible dubbing of Nausicaa. The dubbing does work in this even if my preference is still subtitled.
B000654Z2I|5.0|\\"Tago Mago\\" begins as the most peaceful of dreams only to gradually descend into a long hellish nightmare. This and the closer are the only songs where the guitar takes the more traditional rock guitar lead as the rest of the album is built around the machine like drumming of Jaki Liebeszeit, giving the group a percussion/groove based sound. \\"Paperhouse\\" floats on gentle guitar chimes and soothing calm vocals only to flutter and crash land into the lurching death dances of \\"Mushroomhead\\" and \\"Oh Yeah.\\"  The former being a nihilistic cry of dillusionment and accpetance in the face of nuclear destruction as Damo chants,\\"I saw Mushroomhead, I was born and I was dead.\\" before erupting into tortured screams during what could sort of be called the chorus.  After the sound of an exploding bomb, \\"Oh Yeah\\" emerges from the rubble as a ghostly hypnotic trance of a groove gradually finding it's way out of the fog and becoming more warm in the process. Making up the entire B side of the first album, the near twenty minute \\"Halleluhwah\\" sounds like an \\"End of the World\\" party.  Based around an addictive funky groove the song jams through a variety of moods with an improvising Damo freely rambling, shouting, and singing all over the place.      The seemingly endless \\"Augmn\\" opens much like \\"Paperhouse\\" but instead of floating in the clouds, eerie and unsettling fractured keyboard melodies, sounds, and vocal chants haunt the listener.  Things inevitably turn violent as drums resembling machine gun and rifle fire are added to the mix while dying screams fill the distance suggesting images of war and possible genocide.  Where as \\"Augmn\\" drones, \\"Peking O\\" is a dynamic blast of ever evolving insanity. The opening vocals sound like some sort of demonic prophet calling from a misty abyss before train like effects carry the song into a beyond creepy passage that resembles an evil reagge nursery ryhme. The dread builds and builds into an eruptive climax of demented keyboards, jackhammerdrums, and crazed hyper active screams of gibberish transform the song into some sort of twisted, freak out cartoon. The song closes with all hell breaking loose while a proto-industrial drum groove dances like a voodo witch dotor on the verge of raising a demon.  The more naive would have a hard time beliving this came from the early 70s. Best described by another reviewer as a hangover the quiently urgent \\"Bring Me...\\" feels like waking up after a long nightmare and struggling to make sense of it.
B000ERU6QC|4.0|I'll admit it - I hadn't heard of these guys until NPR profiled this album a few days ago, alongside Rye Coalition. <br /> <br />I picked it up out of curiosity, cranked it in the car and found myself smiling again and again.  The roots of this music are buried so deep in 1970's New York City that younger listeners will think that they are hearing a completely new sound. <br /> <br />There are some great licks on this album, and if you have a girlfriend who likes to dance and drink screwdrivers out of a sports bottle, she will be singing along with most of these tracks sometime through the second listening.  They have that hard rocking, sexy \\"hookupability\\" and catchy alure that captures both male and female ears. <br /> <br />If the album has a downside, it's that at times it doesn't sound like a rock band so much as it sounds like two guys in a studio; which, (correct me if I'm wrong,) is what it is.  The personality interplay of four musicians that should be here, is sometimes missing.  No insult to the artists, but I would love to hear some of these tracks played by a fully staffed rock band. <br /> <br />That said, there are a number of tracks here that are just f***ing mind-blowing, including \\"Cherry Cola,\\" \\"Keep Your Head Up,\\" and several others.  Some of these songs had me picturing a young, fully-costumed KISS taking a slight detour away from their usual songs - that same naked jutzpah and glammy-slammy drama-queen theater rock sound is here, and that makes for a lot of fun when you play it loud.
B0007OY2P8|4.0|I am quite surprised that most of the the previous commentators thought this adaptation very bad. I found it good enough and I immensely enjoyed parts of it.  <br /> <br />It is true that the actors playing Catherine and Heny appear unattractive at first but as the film progressed, I thought Katharine Schlesinger looked very pretty and innocent and although Peter Firth as Henry Tilney never looked like a heartthrob, he came across quite attractive as a very intelligent and witty men. The supporting cast was very good: I especially liked Googie Withers as Mrs. Allen and Cassie Stewart as the fortune hunter and \\"improper\\" Isabella. <br /> <br />Reading about the watering rooms at Bath in novels, I enjoyed my first view of the way people in 18th century bathed there. The costumes were very frilly and girly and not at all like in the other Jane Austen adaptations but I guess it is because this is her first novel and the story belongs to an earlier era. The make-up reflects the characters very well. Isabella wears too much rouge but Cathy has very little as becomes a sensible and innocent girl. <br /> <br />It has been quite a while since I have read the novel and I am sure they have omitted parts of it because this is only a 1.5 hour film after all. Still I thought the story was told clearly enough. <br /> <br />Considering Northanger Abbey was Jane Austen's parody of Gothic Novels, I think this adaptation made a successful job of retaining the comic feeling. Some people criticise the score. Yes it is funny being so much like a horror film score but I conceived it as part of the aura designed to create Austen's satire. <br /> <br />I must say that the ending was a bit vague and confusing. I am not sure how it was in the novel but it could have been done better.
0670033375|5.0|As with Guns, Germs, and Steel, I wish this kind of book were used for HS history classes.  Whether you agree with the conclusions or not, it provides a framework for turning very subjective date-driven history into a science, with a meaning and a predictive potential.  Incorporation of geography and other sciences into understanding the why of history has made the subject so much better for me. <br /> <br />Even ignoring the broad society-level and important issues, this book made me think about how geography dramatically impacts the food that I eat at every meal.  It's harder to be a vegetarian the farther away you are from the equator.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|It's the Lebron James problem.  The guy can go out and have a 30 point, 10 rebound game and can get picked on for too many turnovers, or for lack of aggression.  Greatness can be a burden, especially if you sustain said greatness for such a long period of time that your critics evaluate you with a whole separate set of criteria.    These poor AFI guys put out three flawless albums in a row, follow it up with a great album, and get nitpicked on for throwing in a few mediocre tracks (37mm and The Interview come to mind).  All AFI has done is go from genre to genre effortlessly reinventing the craft of music.  This time they take on nouveau-80's britpop and arena rock, and somehow make beauty out of them.  Classics like \\"The Missing Frame,\\" \\"Love Like Winter,\\" and \\"Summer Shudder\\" stand up to \\"Bleed Black\\" and \\"This Celluloid Dream\\" in originality in composition, even if they aren't revolutionary like \\"Days of the Phoenix.\\"  (For those that pre-ordered the album and got the two bonus tracks) We are truly seeing a shocking change in AFI when they can take \\"The Smiths\\" Jack the Ripper and create a remake to stand with the original.  DU deals more with an inner turmoil less than it does with a world-gone-wrong.    What's most interesting to me is that the stand-offish uber-gothy radicalism that so distinguished the band from their blander contemporaries has been softened to make room for a much more personal sound.  Is it only me that is touched by the lyrics \\"Will the flood behind me put out the fire inside me?\\"  The album doesn't scream so much as it cries.      If you are a true AFI fan, you know that there is no one AFI sound that DECEMBERUNDERGROUND can betray; AFI is a musical journey that requires us to stick with the band and rethink them with every new release.  If you do it one more time with DU you will not be disappointed, even if it doesn't equal the last few releases.    It's the Lebron James problem.  But wouldn't we all like to be a witness to greatness?
0780626966|5.0|Almost 22 years after the Original's release... and here today, these films still have enough \\"stick\\" to battle the best. I urge anyone to honestly say that these films are \\"outdated\\" in the sense of not packing in all the thrills and chills of any horror movie made today. The first murder must be one of the most disturbing images in cinema history, along with Johnny Depp being swallowed by his bed and then regurgitated in again what must be the goriest bloodbath ever! <br />The story : Child-Killer, Fred Krueger, burned to death by the \\"parents\\" of Elm Street years before, comes back to haunt the children of Elm Street in their dreams. Dressed in a nifty (and now the most recognisable outfit in the Horror Genre) Red and Green Sweater with an old hat, horribly disfigured by the flames years before - he dons a melted face and is armed with long, sharp knives for fingers!  <br />Whatever happens in your dream, happens to you in real-life until you wake up... if you wake up! <br />When one teenage girl realises that all her friends start dreaming the same dream about an elusive killer who stalks them in a boiler room and calls himself \\"Freddy\\"... she tries to explain to the authorities that the murder that has just taken place in Elm Street was in fact the work of the maniac in their dreams... however, she's branded a nut-case and ignored.  <br />As the teens try to stay awake in order to survive... it becomes more and more difficult to in fact do so... and those who sleep get knocked off - horribly!  <br />The girl then realises in order to catch and stop the killer, she needs to sleep, hunt him in her dream and wake up whilst holding onto him - in order to kill him in the real world! Much easier said than done... <br />All in all, a terrific film, Wes Cravens' masterpiece must have been close on being heavily \\"cut\\" 22 years ago. It contains loads of gore, Johnny Depp as a youngster, some incredible special effects (which are still impressive by today's standards) andsome believable acting. <br />All the films are DIGITALLY REMASTERED, even the TRAILERS, and the 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound is very effective. The dvd's all contain a few features (trailers and some music video) and very clever animated menus. The Zone 2 version DOES NOT have the \\"Bonus Material - 8th\\" disc which is dissapointing, however, it does contain the \\"Collectible Booklet\\" which is handy and informative. Nevertheless, a truly impressive collection for the shelf. Be careful though... there is also a \\"5 disc\\" and \\"6 disc\\" set out there, without \\"Freddy's Dead\\" and \\"New Nightmare\\" respectively... so don't get caught out! Make sure you get your hands on the \\"7 Disc\\" set...  <br />And if the name \\"FREDDY KRUEGER\\" doesn't send shivers down your spine, join in and sing... \\"One, Two - Freddy's coming for you, Three, Four - Better lock your door, Five, Six - Grab a crucifex, Seven, Eight - Better stay up late... Nine, Ten - Never Sleep again!\\" <br />
B000FQJAIW|5.0|It was disappointing to hear that the original theactrical versions of the orginal STAR WARS TRILOGY were not going to be released on DVD along with it's 1997 enhanced counterparts. <br /> <br />Now, Lucas has finally taken a lesson from Spielberg, who released E.T. on DVD with both the 1982 and 2002 versions.  STAR WARS could have easily been redeemed sooner, but better late than never.  Both versions of the films are spectacular regardless of their contrasting SPFX. <br /> <br />And in Lucas's defense, TRUE fans of Star Wars would have had the patients of Obi-Wan Kenobi to wait for somthing a little better than the 2005 DVD releases. THIS IS IT, TRUE FANS!!! <br /> <br />P.S. to Lucas <br />Best of luck on the new TV series and transforming the saga into 3-D films.  I look forward to them . . .always.
B000001DQG|5.0|This album came at a time when Elton could seemingly do no wrong. He sold out shows across the world. His albums went to #1 as did his collaborations with John Lennon \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and The Who: \\"Pinball Wizard\\" which appears on this remastered edition in all its piano-pounding glory. However, the strain of success was beginning to take a toll on Elton. His recording sessions in Caribou Studios, Colorado were rushed. Elton refused to sing on a number of occasions. He even considered \\"Don't Let the Sung Go Down on Me\\", the big hit on this album, to be awful and suggested they give it to British pop star Lulu to sing...Credit Gus Dudgeon's producing for salvaging this one. <br /> <br />Throughout many of the tracks you can hear Brian Wilson lending his vocals. Indeed, many of the vocal arrangmenets have a Beach Boys feel. There are superb harmonies on \\"I've Seen the Saucers\\", \\"Pinky\\" and \\"Don't Let the Sun...\\" There are also some classic stadium rockers: \\"The Bitch is Back\\", \\"Stinker\\" and \\"I'm So Static\\". Elton and Taupin still manage to add a rather silly song in the mix, \\"Solar Prestige a Gammon\\", a song about absolutely nothing with words that only sound like words. Still, Elton belts out the song in his cheeriest. <br /> <br />\\"Dixie Lily\\" is a great country tune, showboat whistles and all, while the tragic \\"Ticking\\" has to be one of the best songs Elton and Taupin have ever written. To my mind, as close to a tear-jerker as anything they've ever composed. <br /> <br />The remastered edition also has a great B-Side called \\"Cold Highway\\", a pop song which exploits changing time signatures. Superb horn work on this song. Then there is trhe campy, \\"Step Into Christmas\\", but hey...what holiday song isn't? It's as good a Christmas song as any original Xmas song any rockster has put out. <br /> <br />Despite the strain of writing and touring, Elton still found room for another classic album...and yes, the album cover is awful, but come on...It was 1974!
B000002KIE|5.0|Punk was a movement founded out of the anger and resentment of the young generation--the young generation started punk--it wasn't just one band. The Sex Pistols came on hard and strong, their music is inciendiary. It's heavy, hard hitting and angy, when John Lyndon (a.k.a. Johnny Rotten) sings he sounds so angry and primal. This album is the perfect embodiment of the punk rock movement. Sid Vicious had barely anything to do with this album at all--it was all Glen. Yes, adding Sid was a mistake-but before him the Pistols were  real musicians. As for being a marketing gimmick--the Pistols are less of a marketing gimmick than any band today (Kelly Clarkson, Ashlee/Jessica Simpson, my chemical romance, panic! at the disco, ryan cabrera, the pussycat dolls, young jeezy etc). All music today is formulaic and manufactured and commercialized. Because the Pistols are not nice we tend to reject them--they go against everything we stand for. They are chaotic, subversive and angry. But, they change your life and have a HUGE impact. Read John Lyndon's book Rotten for more insight into both the band and Lydon himself. And buy this cd---it is AMAZING!!!
B0002XVQNU|4.0|Many who denounce this movie I guarantee you did so solely on the basis of Ben Affleck's casting.  I used to be one of them, until I saw it in theaters.  Aside from Changing Lanes this was his only starring role I've ever liked.  Then, of course, this version was released and I've come to like it even MORE. <br /> <br />Those who may have seen the theatrical cut (TC) and didn't like it may wanna check out the DC.  It's darker with longer and more brutal fights, a new subplot to show how Murdock & Nelson really works, more badassery for the Kingpin and less of the forced love story between DD and Elektra.  This is NOT the same movie, despite how familiar scenes look. <br /> <br />Mark Steven Johnson was pressured by the studio to deliver a PG-13 movie, meaning a lot was cut from this R-rated movie to fit that mold.  That only proves that sometimes the directors know a tiny bit more than the studios when it comes to the stories they're crafting.  About the only thing that really plagues this movie is the miscasting of Jennifer Garner as Elektra.  On a personal note, I never liked how Matt and Elektra met in the movie.  I would have preferred a reunion from their college days like in the comics, but that's just me. <br /> <br />The DVD IS a little light on features, but that's because it's meant to COMPLIMENT the other release.  In reality, this was supposed to be included with that release, but they decided to push it to the following year.  However, what it lacks in the features it makes up for in design.  Gone are the cheesy menus of someone walking around an alley with a camcorder poorly edited to resemble DD's shadow world.  No, this time we get an animated menu with a shifting cityscape and images of the stars from promo posters included.  That only further shows the care attributed to this version of the movie. <br /> <br />If you like Daredevil comics, get this version. <br />If you didn't like the Daredevil movie, get this version. <br />If you don't like BenAffleck, get over it and get this version.
0385338082|5.0|As an avid fan of Sophie Kinsella's, I hurried out to the nearest bookstore to get my copy of Can You Keep a Seceret? This book is one of many by Sophie Kinsella. The heroine of this book goes by the name of Emma Corrigan. She is a junior marketing executive who is returning home to London after a business trip. Emma hates to fly and she winds up having a very bumpy flight. She begins to jabber on to the gentleman next to her about just about every subject in the world, and she lets all of her deep secrets out. By the end of the flight she realizes that she probably should not have shared so much personal information with a complete stranger, but she relaxes with the fact that she will never see him again anyway. <br /> The misfortune of Emma's turns out to be that the man who she divulged just about every secret that she ever kept, is the new CEO of the company. This leads to a string of events that are entertaining as most of the events in Kinsella's books are.  <br /> I really enjoyed this novel. I found it highly relatable because everyone has secrets and everyone could imagine if everyone else knew them. The main character in the book reminded me of Becky Bloomwood, form Kinsella's Shopaholic series. The two characters are always getting involved in something that is above their heads, and somehow they always get out of it. <br /> This was a very easy read, and it never ceased to make me laugh. I would recommend this book to any girl who wants a good laugh and a good summertime-by-the-beach book. It is fun and it will keep the reader's interest form start to finish. Bravo to Sophie Kinsella for another great story! <br />
B000AWYOGE|3.0|Pretty damn good.  Not the \\"chick flick\\" that I was expecting.  Very dark and ominous, which I personally like.  You know something bad is going to happen, but it never happens when you expect it.  Plus, JC is at her sexiest since \\"Requiem For A Dream\\".  John Reilly is good, as always.  And the grimy background adds to the creepiness.  Recommended.
0385486804|5.0|I agree Chris McCandless was misguided as to go into the wild so unprepared, but I admire what he sought.  We are only a few months apart in age and I found myself haunted for many days by his story.  It is a riveting book.  The story is just so deep and unlike most.  Chris was a person who actually tried to live 100% his beliefs, and was killed by them.  <br /> <br />This book is an excellent tool in one's own self awareness journey.  It helps us realize we are all actually free to find ourselves, and always have been.  We all just need to make sure our journey to self actualizaton does not kill us, as it did Chris.  What is the use of finding truth if we are not around to enjoy it?
B00006D295|3.0|I gave it 3 stars, but only because I have been made to believe this is a classic.  This film is fun, but a little too \\"Queer Eye\\" for regular viewing.  I like Tim Curry, and fortunately he has risen above this role.  It is painfully obvious that Susan Sarandon has sucked from the earliest stages of her career.  View at your own risk.  Homophobes beware.
4789009637|5.0|In my experience studying Japanse, both in college and self-directed, I've owned around a dozen different \\"course\\" texts.  The Genki series is by far the best I've seen.  Grammar, vocabulary, and kanji are all included in the text.  The pacing is very good and I really appreciated the complete dependence on kana and kanji instead of romaji (a crutch that will only slow you down in the long run).  I also recommend the workbook as a supplement although the main text does contain some good review exercises.      The only downside I found is the ultimate cost of the audio portion (sold seperately).  The \\"student\\" edition, while affordable, only includes the vocabulary from the main text, the dialogues from the main text, and the workbook exercises.  It did not include the exercises from the main text, which seems strange to me.
0783226837|3.0|Another \\"better-than-I-expected\\" movie.  Bacon is okay, Fred Ward is solid (as always), but Michael Gross & ?!Reba McIntyre?! steal this movie!  Worms were never so unpredictable.  A six-pack flick that will make you jump, laugh and pause-while-you-piss.  Recommended.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I have been a Nine inch Nails fan since the very beginning. I can honestly say, that I am never disappointed. I look forward to every release, knowing that it is going to be another powerful installment in the ever changing world of Nine Inch Nails. No matter what the current state of mind, Trent Reznor makes every release powerful and interesting and you can always be sure that he will never sell out, ever. Something most artists, inevitably do at some point. If you purchase a NIN cd, one thing is always certain, it is never going to be some piece of garbage that was thrown together, just to turn out a cd. It is always going to be something Trent Reznor poured his heart and soul into, and is most likely, very proud of. There will always be songs you like more than others. If you happen upon a song you don't particularly care for, give it time, let it soak in, it may be becuase you just don't \\"get it\\" at that given time. And if you find that you still don't like it after it has thoroughly soaked in, then press fast forward ! But please, don't go onto Amazon.com, The Spiral or other fan sites, and try to recruit others for your pathetic bashfest.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and, for that matter, to voice it. But, I have never seen a fan base that has such a large number of people who like to whine, cry, and act like Nine Inch Nails owes them something. Music is a form of art. If you don't like the art you are looking at, don't look at it. If you don't like the art you are listening to, don't listen to it, and move on. As for \\"With Teeth\\", it ROCKS !!! Thank you Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails !! As always, I'll be patiently awaiting your next release. See you on tour !!!
B000B8I8X2|5.0|Either you love or you hate Roadrunner Records. You hate them, because they release \\"Limited Editions\\" of CDs you just bought a month after the original is released (curse you Roadrunner for cheating me out of two 'limited' Killswitch albums! Curse you!!!). You love them because they do cool stuff like this.    If you are familliar with this CD, you know the concept. 57 artists from 45 former/current bands on the label come together to create an album of music. The captains were picked, and the bands were formed together.    The biggest thing happening for this album is that it was actually able to be pulled off. Not only is that a testament to the record label, but to the musicians involved- showing that these guys care about thier craft, and each other. This, in turn, gives the listener 18 high quality tracks.    Any lesser of a label would have had 12 hastily thrown together songs- poorly produced, with song crafting thrown to the wind. Not here folks. Each track works as if the makeshift band playing them actually had been together for eons. They work as a unit (although it's revealed in the included DVD that some sessions were phones in- probably due to time constraints) to craft songs worthy of big name releases. Give this CD to an unknowing listener and tell them with a straight face the concept of this albums. Watch as thier jaw hits the ground.    I also would wish you good luck in trying to convince them.    Back to the album,  another strong point is it's sheer variety of generes it covers. Here, you have metalcore, death metal, acoustic, straight up metal, doom metal, etc. Don't let my overuse of the term 'metal' fool you, as each of these tracks are far from similar. But by all intents and purposes, this is primarily a metal album.    You can hear each artist's influence on each song. \\"Dawn of a Golden Age\\" sounds like a Cradle of Filth track- while the booming \\"Enemy of the State\\" would fit well on a Type O Negative album. The guitar work in \\"No Mas Control\\" makes it sound like Fear Factory with a different singer. \\"The Dagger\\" would make a killer Killswitch track.    In fact, I wish Burton from Fear Factory could have made it on this album, as he is one of my favorite metal vocalists. But that's just me.    Yet again, another highlight of this album is that you might end up digging songs you thought you'd never like. I'm not a death metal fan, but I found myself enjoying \\"Annihilation by the Hands of God\\". Likewise, I'm not a...uh...whatever you would classify \\"No Way Out\\" as fan, but that is a track I enjoy.    Production values are superb- as expected from a Roadrunner release. No special gimmicks here, just straight up instruments recorded without fault and tarnish. Each musician and vocalist come out loud and clear...especially loud.    Let's talk songs, and there are alot to talk about.    The album starts absolutely strong with \\"The Dagger\\". A pickslide and a headbang worth riff immediately sucks you in, teamed by Howard Jone's stunning vocals.    \\"In the Fire\\" is a good power meta-ish song, with some great variants in the riffery.    \\"Dawn of a Golden Age\\", probably on the top three tracks here is an expertly crafted song. It's written with Dani Filth's trademark picturesque lyrics- and it's help along by an excellent structure. The drumming here is absolutely mindblowing- the breakdown at 3:16 is absolutely dizzying. Even if you're not into this type of song, just listen to it for this one part. One of the musical highlights of the albums.    \\"No Way Out\\" is...uh, well I dunno. Funky? Glitzy? Fun? Whatever it is, I love it. It is hands down catchy. This song unfortunately has gotten slammed because it is far from metal (a testament to some of the idiotic fans this label has). I can't put my finger on what makes this song great, maybe the infectious vocals, the riffs, the drumming, bass. I dunno. I just love the track.    \\"Blood and Flames\\" is just godly. This is something you might wanna blast while cruising down the highway. Or maybe have playing while getting involved in a bar fight. A nice bluesy rock song that starts out somber and picks up heavy is what you have here. Think metalcore gone Zeppelin. Oh did I mention that the godlike Jesse Leech sings on this? That's all I have to say (for those not in the know, Jesse has RANGE. He can sing with the best, and can scream with the most brutal).    \\"I Don't Wanna Be (A superhero)\\" is a nice bite sized punk song, but think The Offspring instead of The Misfits.    \\"No Mas Control\\" is great for Christian Machado's vocals (although I haven't heard an Ill Nino song prior to this writing) are great, and he flawlessly switches up between English and Spanish, giving this song a special kind of flair. This sounds like a Fear Factory song, and as eluded to, I am a hige fan of the band- so this song was right up my alley.    Weak tracks? None, really. I have my tracks that I don't like solely because I'm not into that particular kind of song- like \\"Roads\\"...where I'm not too big of an acoustic fan (although I do like other band's acoustic performances on other albums), but none that lessened my enjoyment of this CD at all..    All in all, if you are a metal fan, you need this album. It's a shame no one has thought of this before- but done by another label, could this have been pulled off as flawlessly? It would be awesome if Century Media did something like this. Imagine an Arch Enemy/Children of Bodom/Nevermore/Shadows Fall mix up.    Even if you hate and spit on everything that Roadrunner stands for, you should check this out. This almost...almost makes up for thier \\"Limited Edition\\" knack, although I did nail them by waiting for Nymphetamine's LE. I'm on to you Roadrunner, I'm on to you.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I had bought this album for one reason - I had loved Nine Inch Nails' \\"Hurt\\" by Johnny Cash so much.  But with Johnny Cash, you are not going to get an album with only a few good songs.  American IV has 15 great songs that Johhny sings to perfection.  Despite being 70 years old he sings the songs in a hauntingly beautiful sort of way.  The CD opens with the title track sung (or rather spoken) in a way only Cash can pull off.  Of course, I love the song \\"Hurt\\" and found I also enjoyed \\"Give My Love to Rose,\\" \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water (excellent, excellent until Fiona Apple comes in)\\", \\"First Time I Ever Saw Your Face (cooler than Celine Dion!)\\", \\"In My Life,\\" and \\"Desperado.\\"  The only song I did not care for was \\"Sam Hall.\\"  These songs seem very personal to Johnny Cash and he makes each song his own.  I can't wait until American Recordings V and VI come out as they were the last songs that Cash recorded before he died.  Also, check out this Cash biography - \\"The Man Called CASH : The Life, Love and Faith of an American Legend\\" by Steve Turner.  Very good as well!
B00005MAM2|5.0|I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!  <br /> <br />Now, on to my review of the Akira Special Edition DVD. <br /> <br />VIDEO (A+): It's difficult to find enough superlatives to describe this anamorphic transfer. The film has been completely remastered and it shows. Who knew a hand-drawn animated film (which is fast approaching its 20th anniversary) could look so impossibly amazing? Colors, details, black levels will blow you away. Flawless! <br /> <br />AUDIO: (A+): It has been said that the audio alone underwent a $1 million dollar restoration and I believe it. A perfect and fitting complement to the outstanding visuals. The music of Akira is so important, and thankfully it is featured in all its glory. Even the music and effects during the menu screens are amazing; I listened for quite some time to the music and sounds of Disc 2's menus! The new DD 5.1 mix and the original Japanese Dolby 2.0 track are both impressive. <br /> <br />FILM (A+): I bought this SE DVD back in high school when it was first released, out of curiousity. I was not (nor am I now) a fan of any sort of anime or manga, but I am now entering my senior year of college and this film and DVD set continue to impress me. Yes, the story/plot is obtuse, and you'll probably have to be in your late teens, at least, to understand and appreciate it. That said, I don't take this film as seriously as some people. Its tone is certainly serious and there is virtually no humor to be found, but by not taking it as seriously as some I mean I don't search for its concrete meaning(s). Ultimately, Akira is what you want it to be. Of course there are the obvious cautionary themes of greed, corruption, and abuse of power and nature, but the end is vague and mysterious and lets you draw your own conclusions. Sure, like many people, I thought to myself \\"What the hell?!\\" after watching it, but time and thought have lead me to believe that that reaction is the appropriate one. You don't have to overanalyze the movie to enjoy it. It is a work of art in every sense of the word, and historically important, especially in Japanese cinema and the world of animation in general. I would venture to say that is it the most ambitious, impressive, and beautiful animated film in the history of movie-making. And oh the extra features. This special edition is worth every penny; Pioneer spared no expense in restoring and producing this DVD set...it's a true reference standard which will probably never have an equal.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|I put this review off for a long time because I wanted to re-read the book before offering final judgment on the movie. I have to admit that I cannot add my name to the supposed list of people hailing Alfonso Cuarón as the perfect director for this pivotal film in the Harry Potter series. It is natural that a new director would make changes to redefine the world in his own image, but I think this movie makes far too many changes - I could forgive that, but some of the additions are just, well, silly and wholly unnecessary. J.K. Rowling herself might love the shrunken head on the Knight Bus, but I have no use for it - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is not a comedy, and it does not need the intellectual equivalent of a man doing a pratfall. At Hogwarts, you get ghost horsemen crashing through windows and thumping into the Great Hall. There are a number of similar additions I consider useless at best. Why throw these things in there? It's not like you are starting with a weak story and having to pad the film. Did Cuaron think he needed to add a few silly scenes in order to make the film appeal to children? As if there's a child in Western society who isn't already a rabid Harry Potter fan. And the clothing rubs me the wrong way - rarely do you see the kids in their Hogwarts uniforms in this movie. And speaking of Hogwarts, it looks nothing like it did in the first two films; I kept expecting Julie Andrews to come strolling over one of the hills singing The Sound of Music. All of these needless changes took away from my enjoyment of Rowling's story. The fact that the kids are outgrowing their characters didn't help either - Neville, Malfoy, and, to some degree, Ron hardly resemble themselves from the first two movies. I didn't like the fact that Dumbledore's attire was completely changed (and that little rubber band in the beard thing was - to me - horrible) - in my opinion, all of that added unneeded complications to the transition process from the late Richard Harris to Michael Gambon in this pivotal role.  <br /> <br />I'm not saying Cuarón didn't do some things well, though. The guys and gals who designed Buckbeak (in both model and CGI form) went well beyond the call of duty and should be praised. Aunt Marge, Professor Trelawney, Professor Lupin, and Sirius Black were perfect embodiments of their literary selves. Hogsmeade was an unqualified visual success. The Dementors were brought to life very effectively. Definitely, in many ways this was a very impressive film. Notice I haven't mentioned the story yet.  <br /> <br />Ah, yes, the plot. Obviously, I think the movie left out more than it should have to make room for a lot of unnecessary fluff. What we do have, though, feels somewhat disjointed to me - just a bunch of scenes thrown together. Obviously, I knew when the seasons changed as Cuaron went to the well too often with the soaring seasonal transitions, but I did not get the sense that a school year at Hogwarts had passed by the end of the film. Speaking of the ending, I will declare that it was well done indeed. It could have been confusing for younger viewers (assuming, of course, there might actually be one young viewer out there who hadn't actually read the book before seeing the film), so I was glad to see Cuaron really take the time to concentrate on bringing it off as seamlessly as possible.  <br /> <br />The extras on the bonus DVD are something of a mixed bag. I think I speak for all of us when I thank the studio for not making us go through some kind of infernal maze just to find a deleted scene. The five deleted scenes included here, though, aren't much to talk about. The games and the tours of Honeydukes and Lupin's classroom will appeal to some, but the real meat of the extras comes in the form of the cast interviews (even though they do force us to endure more of that infernal shrunken head), the featurette on the extraordinary animals seen in the film, and the interviews with director Cuaron and author J.K. Rowling.  <br /> <br />I know I've been critical of the film, but that doesn't mean I don't love it. I just think it could have been much better than it was. Many of us take our Harry Potter extremely seriously, and I just would have preferred stricter adherence to Rowling's original story (and, of course, less silly fluff).
