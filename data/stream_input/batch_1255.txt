0757302661|2.0|I used the hypnobirthing method with my daughter, and unfortunately it didn't work for me. I practiced with the CDs my entire pregnancy, and they did help me sleep better and to relax. I slept great almost my whole pregnancy, and I do give credit to the CDs for that. I even hired a doula, who got certified in Hypnobirthing in time for my delivery, but I didn't really feel that it was very helpful once my labor started. When my contractions started, they were painful. The book refers to \\"pressure\\" but I definitely felt pain. I tried listening to the CDs, getting on the birthing ball, and doing some meditation, but nothing made it more comfortable. For me, labor hurt! It went downhill from there. Severe pain in the hospital so I requested an epidural, ended up getting pitocin, and then finally delivered via C-section. Now with my second child, I am considering a VBAC and looking into Hypnobabies, which I hear prepares you much better.

B004INNRFK|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD, and was so quick when I ordered it that I didn't realize it came with a DVD. It was like getting 2 products for the price of one.  The entire project was done very professionally, the quality of both the CD and the DVD is exceptional, I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who either likes David Foster, any of the songs, or any of the artists involved. What I really like about the DVD is that it contains songs that are not on the CD. I was also happy to see/hear my two favorite singers on the same recording: Donna Summer and Lara Fabian.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|It is indeed most unfortunate that AMAZON is now misleading potential customers my using enhanced images of the product and then substituting lesser quality.  I understand that we all need to be environmentally responsible in preserving the planet's resources by not wasting or over indulging however, a product of inferior quality is more wasteful as it does not stand the test of time.  Unfortunately, it seems that the aforementioned \\"business\\" tactics are rampant on a planetary scale thereby creating even greater waste by marketing inferior products that must be replaced multiple times. This is the greatest threat to the planet's survival. Hopefully the \\"powers that be\\" shall eventually come to reason with this and place the future of the planet over immediate monetary gain.

I just got this Blu Ray, and I have to say that it is one of the clearest and dynamic concert blu rays that I have ever seen. From the moment that Britney hits the stage, my jaw dropped open. I felt like I was standing on the stage, and if your stereo has a Live Music setting, it will blow you away. This was a very good purchase, and I reconmend it to anyone who is on the fence about getting it.
0670022950|4.0|Pinker's new book encompasses a prodigious collection of disparate lines of evidence and I would recommend it. However, I just wanted to comment on a technical point about research on the so called \\"Warrior Gene\\", which Pinker mistakenly dismisses (monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). Pinker writes:<br /><br />\\"[A]n association between the gene and aggression has not been found in non-European populations, perhaps because they have evolved other ways of regulating their catecholamine levels. (Genes often act in networks regulated by feedback loops, so in populations in which a particular gene is less effective, other genes may step up their activity to compensate.) For now, the Warrior Gene theory is staggering around with possibly fatal wounds.\\"<br /><br />The mistake Pinker makes is that this is based on a paper by Widom and Brzustowicz which does not control for Gender. As the gene does not seem to affect female behaviour the study isn't helpful for looking at ethnic differences.<br /><br />Pinker is apparently completely unaware that studies have found that MAOA influences aggression in non-europeans (see Weder et al). Kevin Beaver's research on MAOA's effect on gang membership and weapon use also helps support this association.<br /><br />Finally, Pinker repeats a mistaken figure on the representation of MAOA in Chinese populations, stating:<br /><br />\\"[T]he low-activity version of the gene is even more common in Chinese men (77 percent of whom carry it), and the Chinese are neither descended from warriors in their recent history nor particularly prone to social pathology in modern societies.\\"<br /><br />A study by Lu et al found that 42 Taiwanese men, or 55% of their 77-subject control sample, had the 3-repeat allele of MAOA. Lea and Chambers copied the information incorrectly. Then, an editorial against MAOA research by a doctoral student repeated the falsehood. Now, Pinker has repeated it too.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Okay so I'm not a huge nerd in star wars. I really don't notice the little details for the updates they made for this. However when you screw up a very powerful scene by adding voice over &#34;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!&#34;  in return of the jedi then I have a problem. Yeah there are some scenes its noticable, but I don't care that much. But at the scene in Return of the Jedi when vadar grabs his master and tosses him to save his son, its a very powerful scene with just silence from vader and you can tell how he is conflicted but adding him saying no has no value in it and sounds really silly. I'm glad I got the dvds that have the original theatrical release. I'm very surprised that the Blu ray doesn't have them which is a major downer and don't know why they would leave that out. So I would buy it one day, but not this copy. I would hope someone will save this by fixing what lucas has done to my childhood.
0312330529|3.0|I can say that I have enjoyed the book and respect the author's literary undertaking.  But its not the life changing novel that some believe it to be.  It is an over-analysis of every thought and view of both landscape and thought.  I do not for a minute believe that the protagonist/author actually lived this life.  It is likely a grand embellishment, but a good one.  I read somewhere that he began writing this while in prison.  That would make sense in that it reads like the author had lots of time to dive deep into his imagination.  I recommend this if you enjoy long gangster/romance/warfare novels and long prose.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|How companies are getting away with this is beyond me. I paid for a simple reason - to get what was promised in the title. But there are still ads and I didn't get what was advertised and what I paid for. If they were honest the description would say &quot;Angry Birds (Fewer Ads)&quot; but then no one would be tricked into paying for it.  I'm sorry to see so many glowing reviews praising the reduced number of ads as if they got what they paid for.
B001E45XT4|4.0|These are nice gaming headsets the sound is nice and the mic is awesome no adjustments on the pc needed at all. I did not know that the mic stick pulls out further so I kept making adjustments on the pc but after pulling it out it works flawlessly. There is not as much bass as I would like but it's there. In line headset volume is a nice feature as well as the mic mute but I use PTT so haven't really used it. It does hurt my ears after about 3-4 hours of continuous use. Even with the ear padding the speaker set inside pushes against my ears. I still like em. Gives you enough length so that you can hook it up in the back mic input if you don't have front mic input. For the price you cant beat it.

0307593312|1.0|This review is based on the audio book. I have listened to the whole book, though.  I was incredibly disappointed by this book. It was just terrible. This was the first book of this author that I've listened to (to stall off the \\"why did you finish it?\\" questions, let me just say I finish every book I listen to, regardless.)  1Q84 consists of 6 \\"books\\". It was three main characters (the third comes in in book 4 or 5, though he's mentioned earlier.) I've tried to come up with a way to describe this garbage and the best I can come up with is that it's all just telling.  Telling, telling, telling, and telling some more. There is very, very little actual action in this book. One of the characters literally spent a book or two in the same apartment, doing the same things, hashing and rehashing and rerehashing her life... over and over and over again, going out only a couple times.  That's the problem with this book. I've read some of the other reviews (they were what made me purchase this book) say that the Japanese aren't big on \\"action\\" and that would be okay. I didn't mind the first book; I liked it tbh. But, you see, the first book is the rest of the book. Only a couple things actually happen in the book. The few actual action points in the book were good. Unfortunately, the rest of the books is about the characters getting up, making breakfast (in detail), working, making dinner 9again, in detail), thinking about how terrible their lives are, and going to bed.  He doesn't explain anything. He doesn't even try. He recycles the actions of the other characters, which was bizarre. For example, all the characters decided on a \\"ring three times, hang up, then ring again before you pick up\\" and the same with the door. This was the same across the board. However, the characters weren't in contact with each other. He couldn't have come up with varying systems? He also recycles deaths too. Almost every female death, suicide or otherwise, is do to strangling of some sort (be it hanging or strangled with a bathrobe belt -- btw, all the female homicides were carried out with strangling with a bathrobe belt.)  Don't get me started on the two main characters \\"love\\" story (she grabs his hand once, when they were 10.) 47 hours of story before they met up again (the book is 48 hours long.)  There is no resolution to anything in the book. He ties up *no* threads at all and he finishes in the middle of action of several different characters. I realize the rabid fans are going to pounce on me. God forbid someone not liking their favorite author! I'm sorry but I had to say this. The reviews felt like a betrayal. I wanted to like this. I really tried. If I ever want to take up Japanese cooking, I'll write a thank you note to the author...
1423140591|4.0|Although I did like the first book of the series alot better, this book was still good. At first, I thought it started off slow and needed a bit more action, but I still could never put the book down. The only disappointment... I have to wait a whole year for the third one!! What a cliff hanger!! Very bothering, but I am sooo excited for the third to come out already! Hurry up Rick Riordan, your fans are waiting :)
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I don't know why so many people gave negative reviews of this Cover.  I received mine last night.  Just like another reviewer said, the Fire fit perfectly snug in the cover.  No wiggle room at all.  The Fire is still light and easy to carry, but now it has protection.  And the easel like stand is great.  Plus the cover also aids in fixing the one issue I had so far with the Fire, it \\"protects\\" the power button.  Now I don't turn off the Kindle with my tummy when I'm reading.  I highly recommend this cover.  In fact, I am giving my nephew a Kindle Fire for his birthday/Christmas present and I am going to give hime this cover as well.

B000FC1PNE|4.0|Since beginning the Bridgerton series, I was partial to the first 2 novels (Daphne and Anthony's) and not very taken with Benedict's (although the ending in the jail cell was good), so I wasn't sure how I would like this one, since Amazon.com reviews were mixed. I was pleasantly surprised and found this to be my favorite novel. Colin is by far my favorite Bridgerton.  This novel had a lot going for it. I wasn't disappointed at all. The final scene in Daphne and Simon's ballroom was stellar! Colin was a true gentleman and a man who loved his wife, even if she wasn't a favorite of the \\"ton.\\" While I felt like Anthony and Benedict were kind of trying to be people they weren't and then had a miraculous transformation into loving husbands, Colin was always just himself. And that was cool.  Colin was previously portrayed as the funny and charming Bridgerton who had to explore the world before settling down. When this book starts, he is the oldest of the 8 children that haven't married already, and it's not easy on him since his older brothers have found their calling (Anthony is the viscount and Benedict is an accomplished artist. He's back in London for the season and bored out of his mind.  Then there's Penelope Featherington, who was mentioned in all prior novels -- her mother had her \\"come out\\" 1 season too early, before she was ready (she was kind of chubby, nobody wanted to dance with her, and she was a wallflower), she was never dressed in flattering colors (her mother put her in orange and yellow because they were happy colors, and a happy girl was more likely to attract a husband), and now she's 28 years old, and unmarried. She's a spinster! The horror!  Because Penelope is good friends with Colin's younger sister Eloise (who is also unmarried), Penelope and Colin run into each other fairly often and have developed an easy friendship. Also, the Bridgerton's mother, Violet, always makes her sons dance with Penelope at \\"ton\\" events because she was once a wallflower, and doesn't want Penelope to feel left out. Penelope has loved Colin for the better part of 12 years, whereas Colin just sees Penelope as his sister's friend (and in Benedict's story, he swears he will never marry her) until she accidentally reads his travel journals, and then he wonders why he never looked at her before.  This story is better than all the other ones because their relationship had time to build, and Julia Quinn nods to happenings in other books, old characters readers love. We know Colin and we know Penelope. We understand how she feels and why she feels this way. While Colin's declaration of love is somewhat of a surprise, it isn't a surprise, and the scene where he tells off Mrs. Featherington was awesome. Whereas in the other books. his brothers and sister fell in love rather quickly, Colin fell in love because he really knew Penelope -- he knew her since she was a kid.  Another intriguing part of the story is the identity of Lady Whistledown! Can't say too much more because when you find out her identity everything makes sense.  This is a really delightful story. I highly recommend it.

B000N3SSBM|3.0|I still haven't seen this movie because I ordered the HD DVD version thinking it was just a regular dvd with better quality or something.  I was pretty bummed to find out that HD DVD is like an old version of Blu-ray that doesn't work on regular dvd players or Blu-ray players.  If you don't have an HD DVD player DON'T BUY THE HD DVD VERSION.  Other than that I'm sure the movie is great and I'm still looking forward to watching it someday.
1589946901|5.0|This is my first review on Amazon but after reading the only other review for the great game, I figured I should give it a go.<br /><br />First off, I have never played the original miniatures game but this is a pretty good game for my tastes. I have played it a total of 4 times with 2 players and 3 times with 4 players. I prefer the two player set up but it was still a pretty good time with 4 players. From what I have seen of the original this looks like a walk in the park comparatively. It took about 20 minutes of reading the rules and set up and we were ready to play. We missed a few rules but they weren't anything game breaking. I think this is a really fun game and considering I had trouble with Carcassonne when it came out I think this is a pretty easy game to grasp once you get into it. Have fun and don't be afraid of it being too complicated.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Best three dollars I may ever spend. It was a very easy read and motivated me to keep pressing forward.
B005FNVDSA|4.0|A comment below leads me to question my word choice of \\"meager.\\" Perhaps that's too harsh. But relative to other pianists, Pollini's expression here nonetheless seems to me awfully reserved even by his standards, especially in the slow mvt. But these are of course questions of personal taste. As often as not I turn to Brahms 1 for its monumental rhythm, massive onrush of sound, the sensory overload experience, and the irresistible urge to stand up and conduct - that is often what draws one in to the world of Pollini when all else fails: a hypnotic pull on the listener with his unique brand of Pollinian momentum, his inexorable continuity and forward push that no one else seems to ever quite duplicate. This is part of his expressive appartus of course, and in that area he does succeed. At about 45:30, this is representative of the \\"fast camp,\\" as opposed to the more leisurely Brahms 1s (such as theGilels/Jochum version.)<br /><br />But for all this I can't help but ask for more. In places, lyrical passages seem merely banged out (example: the beautiful \\"molto adagio\\" at the end of the 2nd mvt, a tempo directive ignored by almost every pianist I've heard.) In other respects too a lot is left desired. In spots, Thielemann rushes through phrase transitions, and piano & orchestra are not always particularly in sync (OK, it's a so-called live recording.) I don't think the SO Dresden here compares to the Berlin (which accompanies Pollini in his last recording of the work.) As noted by an above reviewer, the sound is somewhat of a mess. Especially the lower bass piano notes often blur together, or otherwise are hard to discern. The disappointingly distant sound is similar to the most recent Pollini recordings from the Munich Herkulessaal, where everything comes at you as a sonic haze, smoothing over whatever coloristic definition might actually have been in there (this could easily be said of countless contemporary piano recordings.) Pollini's heavy breathing is often  in competion with the music, a hallmark of \\"late\\" Pollini. In this \\"live\\" recording there is no spontaneous eruption of applause, but at least you can actually hear an audience.  This contrasts to the fake \\"live\\" Pollini/Abbado/BP Brahms 1 mentioned above, where one can't detect the slightest whisper of audience noise from 1st note to last.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|You know, the original 1982 \\"The Thing\\" didn't get a good review at all when it came out, and the theatrical box office performance of the film was poor. The 1982 version had it's flaws (like a `research station' with no scientists, filled with blue collar rugged men).  We now look back on it however as one of the absolute classic alien horror films.  The 1982 version has gone on to gain a cult following. So the 2011 remake had some pretty big shoes to fill and this is visible in it's reception. Lots of cult fans of the 1982 version call the original `a masterpiece' and moan how the 2011 version can't compare. This is not fair and not true. The quality of the two isn't even that far apart. I liked the hand-shot (unsteady) scenes, the Norwegian language (although Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) speaks Danish), the beautiful arctic scenery and the perfect lineup with the original at the end. If you are young and have never seen the original than this movie will do for you about the same as the original did to me as a kid. I at least thoroughly enjoyed the 2011 version and not many horror movies these days do even that. Most of all I liked the `who is who/what' paranoia all over again. Sure the 1982 version was better, but the 2011 was quite enjoyable and I will definitely get this on Blu ray. Like the Alien franchise, a good idea goes a long way!  Wouldn't even mind a sequel with the snow cat parking in front of a cold war Russian station...
B005VMVUAQ|1.0|Really bad movie!  Whatever the two stars were doing, it wasn't acting.  Nicolas Cage makes another stinker.  Hope this helps fix his much written about financial problems.  It is sad what poor plastic surgery can do to a cute star like Nicole Kidman.  Even with all the makeup, her face is so bad it's hard to look at.  Sorry I rented it, a complete waste of money.
B005POK858|5.0|Ok, for starters, the game is very good. That perfect classic feel. If you are looking to full the void left by, let's say, Final Fantasy... This is only a quick fix. Short as I felt the game was, turned or that it was exactly what I wanted to see. Everything that happens is predictable and to the point. No excessive bantering by characters, battles happen often but can be manipulated with items increasing frequency or eliminating them for short times.<br /><br />I played the game about 12 hours, spending time leveling my characters, and trying to find all the hidden treasure.<br /><br />The game feels like a pocket version of Breath Of Fire. All the elements are there, but the story feels rushed... A lot!<br /><br />The controls are laborless, both styles of control are there, the classic style and tap style. There both in effect at all times, sort of a play how you feel kind of thing.<br /><br />I really liked the games pace, and was hoping that it was going to take me longer to beat the game... :(

0385534639|4.0|This is one polarizing book. You'll either love it (as I did) or loathe it (as several reviewers have). I can't remember the last time I read the first page of a book (and first chapter) and was so hooked.<br /><br />For me, it was magical storytelling that kept me riveted to the page. (I didn't find the pace slow at all. It's not an action thriller or mystery or suspense or sci-fi novel. It's in its own category of self-constructed worlds and it moves in \\"time\\" with that perspective.)<br /><br />I could easily reread it again because there is a lot to ponder beyond the surface.  I only wish I knew others who had read it so we could have a lively discussion about it (so much of how you respond to this book's premise is based on your own interpretations. There's plenty left to your own imagination).<br /><br />You either buy into it and revel in its mysteries and unique world, or you opt out. I read all of the Potter books and found this far more intriguing (possibly because of its adult-based themes). I loved Le Cirque des Reves and would have been thrilled to follow it if it existed off the page.<br /><br />This book enchanted me from page one and drew me into a world I could never have imagined on my own but one I certainly wanted to \\"join\\" even if it wasn't quite clear what I was getting myself into. (Actually, not totally understanding everything made this book more fascinating to me.)<br /><br />As for criticism of the writing, I found this book infinitely more readable and better written than a lot of other \\"best-selling\\" books in the past decade with out-there themes.<br /><br />The visual imagery that Morgenstern creates is so visceral and real that I felt as if I was sharing that space with the characters.<br /><br /> Magical, enchanting and delightful adult tale that is deeper than it seems at first glance.

B004UXUUDA|5.0|The Holocaust is a period in history that should never be forgotten, but, at times, watching current conflicts throughout our planet, we tend to loose faith in the future of our species. That is the reason why powerful and illuminating films like \\"Sarah's Key\\" are so important: we need to be constantly reminded of the evil that we are capable of doing to each other. This film really touched my heart.  The movie starts on July 16, 1942, when Mrs. Starzynski and her two children hear a sudden knocking on the door of their apartment. Once Mrs. Starzynski opens the door, her family's worst nightmare began. Elements of the French government, being servants to the Nazis, kidnapped them, as well as Mr. Starzynski - who was outside the apartment at the time --, in order that they would be sent to the German concentration camps for extermination. But little Sarah Starzynski (Mélusine Mayance, in an electrifying performance), was able to save her little brother, by hiding him inside a closet, locking it, and keeping the key. She was sure that she was going to be able to come back for him.   We are then taken to 2009, when Julia Harmond (Kristin Scott Thomas), her husband Bertrand (Frédéric Pierrot), and their daughter are in the process of moving in to the apartment that was once occupied by the Starzynskis many years ago. However, something sparks Julia's curiosity - she is a journalist, writing about the deportation of Jews in France --, and she begins investigating the apartment's history. Her research, as you can realize, will bring back memories of a sad past, which will affect her in every aspect of her life.  Ably directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner, \\"Sarah's Key\\" is about the sanctity of life, and how events that happened in 1942 still affect our lives. It was during that year that 13,000 French Jews were removed from their homes and neighborhoods - the Rue de Saintonge, where the apartment is located, being one of them --, and transported in 74 trains to Auschwitz as its final destination. In the end, a total of 76,000 Jews were deported by the French - brother against brother. This is a film that puts the Jewish suffering into a new perspective, with an inspiring, yet tragic and touching story. The movie also stars Aidan Quinn and Charlotte Poutrel. The Blu-ray edition includes a making-of documentary. (France, 2010, color, 111 mins plus additional material).  Reviewed on November 21, 2011 exclusively by Eric Gonzalez for The Weinstein Company / Anchor Bay Blu-ray.
0385344325|4.0|I have enjoyed the Reacher novels when I first stumbled across them in the library. Wasn't sure if I was going to like this one since it didn't deal with the present, but the past. It turned out to be one of the better ones in the series.<br /><br />It is 1997 and Reacher is ordered to undercover to investigate a murder that may have been committed by a military man and the powers that be don't want it to blow up in their face. When Reacher goes down to Carter Crossing, Mississippi he is quickly uncovered and but still does his own investigating. What he finds is a lot more than anyone suspected.

B005OLF6BI|5.0|I'm still having trouble finding an album or hers that I don't enjoy. While her vocals are not always great live, I still find this live album to be really good. In most songs, especially her covers, she sounds great live. Her best ones are her covers, in my opinion. Drops of Jupiter was excellent and my favorite one. Bette Davis Eyes and I Want You Back were very good as well. Aside from her covers, Last Kiss is probably the best vocally. The worst vocally is probably Enchanted, although that's one of her best songs from the studio.   I did not go to her tour this year, but I did for the Fearless Tour. It's a shame because this one, by the looks of it, looked even better!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I am very confused by the negative reviews for this case (which I read before I received mine and almost regretted my purchase--until I saw it). It fits the kindle fire perfectly and looks very nice and classy. It doesn't look \\"cheap\\" at all...maybe I would have thought so if I had reviewed it before I got the fire and didn't see how well it fit?  I got the graphite color and it looks great--pretty much like it is part of the kindle. I've only used the front-cover-as-stand feature once on the tray table on a plane. It worked well for watching a movie/tv show; less well when I was touching the screen a lot. Mainly I just fold it back and hold the kindle to view it. I don't agree with reviewers who think it should be $8. I believe the price reflects the perfect fit and the professional construction (although I have to admit the original $39.99 seemed a bit much).
B003XE1DTW|3.0|It's disappointing that Crocs sizes doesn't run accurate across their footwear. I bought crocs several months ago and it was too small, so I had to return it. So this, reading the reviews that it runs a little small, I bought a size up and ordered 10. It fits right and I can tell that had I ordered true to my size, it would have been smaller. But the problem is that the heel strap is too lose. So my feet do sleep out. I've worn them inside the house with socks and it prevents slipping of the heel strap but that's pretty ghetto to go out with socks with my crocs though.

I had grown up in the Bible belt and thought I knew everything I needed to know about God, good, evil, Jesus, and then I read this and realized that I really knew nothing at all... now 36 years later I am a Buddhapalian (practicing buddhist and Episcopalian) with many years of study in both traditions and as I read it for the umpteenth time I still smile at some new gem that comes out of the page at me and nod my head.... No matter where you are on your spiritual journey, pick this book up and read it... and over time I am sure you will agree that it is an immense sacred gift to us all...

B0019N8P2W|5.0|What perfect timing for the Daria series to come out during the late-1990s.  The show begun during an important time when preteen & teen girls who were emboding their 'girl power' thanks to the Spice Girls and flocked to one of tv's greatest heroines in Buffy.  I will admit when this first came on MTV, I didn't have the same level of appreciation for it like I do now.  I love the Daria and Jane characters, because I see a lot of them within myself.  As for the best seasons, hands down the honor goes to Seasons 2 & 4.  Those seasons were clever, very well written and believeable.  As for my least favorite episode of the series that went to 'Depth Takes a Holiday' and best episode 'Write Where It Hurts.'<br /><br />The combo movie editions were great adds to the disc set -- 'Is It Fall Yet' starts to show the growth and maturity of Quinn.  I loved how the writers never forgot episode 1's question from the History course on Daria's first day at Lawndale, \\"Can anyone explain Manifest Destiny?\\" and brought it back to use for Quinn.  Such a smart move by the writers if you ask me!<br /><br />The disc set, does not contain the original music used for each episode.  Though that might be a slight bummer it still shouldn't reframe anyone from purchasing. I will always cherish this series and probably one of the last great things by MTV before they started going reality show crazy.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I loved tune in radio so much I decided to spend a dollar to get pro. I have not been let down yet. there are some great radio stations out there, KOLA top of my list of favorites.  To those that gave poor app rating because of radio broadcasters wanting rebroadcast fees, that's just the nature of the beast. Those radio stations it decided they don't want to sign up too bad. Greed has been running rampant in the broadcast industry lately. Its free radio, they arent paying royalties on the music they play. They have high cost lobbyists trying to keep them from paying, yet they want money from TuneIn?  Ill stick with those broadcasters that are sticking with tunein.   Great app, I love the record function. Used it flawlessly many times.  Thanks for reading, now go spend a dollar!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The album, 21, is written by the famous British singer-songwriter, Adele. This postmodern album goes into great detail about her love she had a short time ago, with very vivid details about her relationship that nearly took over her life. The country and jazz inspired CD consists of 11 songs in all. These upbeat and mesmerizing singles show a great detail of her love she had which highly influenced her life.   The album opens up with her first upbeat single \\"Rolling in The Deep\\". This bluesy tune shows her emotion throughout the whole song. It is sung from the perspective of a contempt lover, who is able to finally see the light, but is drawn back from reconciliation. This song successfully fits its lyrics to its intensifying musical structure. The strong, foot stomping music continues with the second song \\"Rumor Has It\\". This song shows the complexity of multiple love triangles. It is not revolved around lies that the media would assume about her break-up, but instead her friends. Adele's vocals carry such sweetness, but then she manages to carry away with such infection.   However, everything starts to slow down with a piano solo featuring only Adele's fascinating vocals. Following a fight with Adele's ex, \\"Turning Tables\\" was born. Lyrically, it describes the breakdown of a relationship due to her ex lover continuously turning situations in his favor. The slow songs continue with number four on the track \\"Don't You Remember\\". This was actually the last song that the singer had written for the record.  It's about memories she has recalled from the beginning of their relationship when she knew what it was like to love him, and as the song begins to end it shows how their love had drifted away.   The power ballad, and my favorite song \\"Set Fire to The Rain\\", is written in D-minor and contradicts the relationship, and the thought of letting her lover go impossible. This song is said to be the most `catchiest' out of all the singles from 21, making it the main reasonwhy it is my favorite song of Adele's.   The sixth song, \\"He won't Go\\", is based around the reason why she won't go because of her love for the boy, but the boy won't let go of his addiction. They both are throwing a risk, but she stays wondering if he will ever kick his habit or if she is just sitting around wasting both her life and love for him. Still feeling underappreciated, Adele put \\"Take It All\\" as number 7 on her record. While she thought she was doing everything right for her man, and treating him like a King he left her, and the song goes on how she is trying to convince him to reconsider taking her back because she believes she is worth it.   \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" expresses her lost of love, but eventually finds it again after she has moved away and begun her new life. \\"One and Only\\" written by Dan Wilson, Greg Wells, and Adele is inspired by the 1999 romantic comedy Never Been Kissed. This is the one song on her album that is not about her ex, but instead is about one of her friends that she has always loved, and she believes has always loved her but they have both been too scared to admit it.   Originally recorded by the band The Cure, \\"Lovesong\\" Adele had adapted it into her own version, making it the eleventh single on her album. This song ultimately refers to how she misses her ex before he had mistreated her. The last song, but certainly not the least famous song, \\"Someone Like You\\"  is currently sitting number 3 in the charts, this song was written by Adele summarizing her broken relationship. It was written about her current feelings on the past relationship. The man she thought she was going to be marrying, was suddenly engaged to another woman a few months after their break up.   This influential album is beautifully overwhelming. Adele is great-minded for being able to express her love for her ex-boyfriend in way which she did. This album is definitely appropriate for every one of all ages. It has also become the biggest selling digital album in U.S. history. This postmodern album is mesmerizing, and can be a great deal of therapy for anyone going through a hard breakup.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Beautiful film, excellent acting. The story transports you to other worlds to experience the full gamut of emotions. These are real people with real issues, another example of life being stranger than fiction, as portrayed in a film. Hope there's a Part II. :)
0517543052|5.0|I bought this classic book when it was first published in the early '70s. The price was $3.33. Then I had the pleasure to actually meet Ram Dass in person and have him sign my copy. He wrote, \\"Here we are in love, Ram Dass.\\" I wrote all about this experience and much more in my inspirational memoir, [[ASIN:1451587554 Still Singing, Somehow]]. \\"Be Here Now\\" is still a must read for anybody on the spiritual path, even though it was written long ago; it's message is timeless and fun to read, in the cartoon form drawings that make up 90% of the masterpiece. I've always respected Ram Dass very highly. He can speak to anyone, on any level, quite well. We all need to take his advice and develop a daily spiritual practice to remember who we really are- Here, Now!

B004SDSSFY|1.0|Poor decision on Amazon's and Dataviz's part to only allow this app to work when the Amazon App store is installed. I would likely have reinstalled the Amazon app and bought more apps later, but I won't now. I uninstalled the app to save space and Documents to Go stopped working. Very disappointing. Waste of my time today.
B0037VNX44|2.0|I heard abut this movie and about how good it was, so I rented it, and although Tom Hardy does a great job playing a sociopath... I still don't understand why this guy has a movie made about him.  This is nothing to celebrate or applaud.  He stood for nothing and he's spent more of his life in jail than out.  Who cares!  I'm surprised the guards haven't helped him have a fatal accident.  Good acting, but bah-humbug to the movie.
B003VIW8DU|5.0|I was able to attend Bryan Ferry's concert over in Oakland about a month ago, and the concert was every bit as good as any of the BF concerts I've had the privilege go to over the years. I love this man! I ordered this album from Amazon a couple of weeks ago, and I can't stop listening to it. I love every single track, especially the two bonus tracks. I find myself walking down the street with the last track, One Way, going through my head. I am 64, still love my rock and roll as well as my classical music, and I have to say it's been a long time since I've enjoyed a rock album this much.
0062060554|5.0|BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is a novel that explores the intricacies and the deficiencies of memory.  I've read other books that have explored Alzheimer's disease but in this case, Christine's memory has been affected by an accident in her past.  During her waking hours she can cope with daily living but every morning, after falling asleep the night before, she wakes not having any prior memories.<br /><br />I can't imagine anything that could be too much more frightening.  To lose your memories is to lose yourself, the very essence of what makes you an individual.  To not remember your husband or children and have to rebuild your past every day - overwhelming.<br /><br />I thought the book was a little repetitive but it's pretty darn impressive for a first book.  Pathos, mystery, triumph all blended together in a story I will definitely REMEMBER.
0553801473|1.0|With over 1400 other reviews, I don't see much point in being long-winded. If only Martin felt the same. Another 1000 pages and nothing really happens. Too many characters, too little movement, too little resolution, too little action, and I find that I've really stopped caring. I'm actually only 2/3 of the way through the book, and I'm not sure I'll bother finishing.<br /><br />That's sad. The first 3 were so good....
B0015DROBO|5.0|When I first attempted to read this book, I didn't make it first the first couple of chapters.  It was a slow start.  One of my girlfriends encouraged me to give it another try.  I'm so glad I did!  This was such a well-written book!  WOW!  I couldn't put it down.  It's a great mystery!  I finished it in a few days!  I'm getting ready to start the next book in the series.  I can't wait!
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King has returned to top form for his latest book. This is one of the best if not the best book he has published. For a while there his books were just 'okay.' But he come out on top with this one.<br />The plot concerns a man who travels back to 1958 to live in the past try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. I know that does not sound all that great, but the it is all of the things leading up to the fateful day that make this book such a great read! I don't want to give much away (I hate spoilers in reviews), but I will say that this book had me run the gamut of emotions. I was happy, sad, angry, shocked... everything. It has been so long that a book totally took me out of my own world and transported me to the world the author created. I can only imagine how much research King had to do to write this. Thank goodness he didn't write it in 1973 when he first got the idea.<br />11/22/63 is a fast paced book that reads like a dream. The words flow so well. Not once was there a lull. Jake has the chance to go back in time and prevent the Kennedy assassination. His old friend Al has used an anomaly in the storeroom of his restaurant to travel back in time and take copious notes on the goings on of one Lee Harvey Oswald. In that time he finds out that he is dying of cancer and asks Jake to take over where he left off. To prove he is not insane, Al takes Jake to the \\"Rabbit Hole\\" (as they call it) and see for himself. Jake goes through and ends up in Maine in September 1958. He spends some time there and heads back to 2011. Al tells him that no matter how much time he spends in the past, when he returns only 2 minutes will have passed. after an experiment or two, Jake takes on the task that Al started.<br />Jake becomes George Amberson and begins a new life in 1958. What happens then is the meat of the book. I am not going to tell you what happens. All I will say is that Jake/George's journey towards the day in the title is one fo the best adventure/mystery/suspense stories I have ever read.<br />The King Has Returned!ries I have ever read.   The King Has Returned!
1595826971|5.0|This is a great book.  Amazing artwork and interesting concept ideas.  I am very glad that I ordered this book, highly recommended for all Alice or even art fans.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I don't get it...I actually like this product a lot - the plastic backing that surrounds the back, sides, top, and bottom of the device has a slightly rubberized surface and is pretty much what I expected it to be.  The front cover is thin, yes, but it seems to be of decent quality.  Ideally, the front cover will be in one of three configurations - either fully closed (and secured by the elastic band), fully open (and secured by the elastic band), or open and propped up for viewing.  I do agree that if they were to redesign the item, perhaps a marginally thicker (like 1mm thicker) front cover might be more agreeable to people.  In addition, perhaps a deeper \\"slot\\" for the cover to fit into when propped up would be better too.  I can see how it might not stay propped up if accidentally jolted (although I have not had this problem yet).<br /><br />But like the name suggests, it's designed to provide some protection - mostly from scratches and such, while remaining relatively thin and true to the kindle fire's svelte size.<br /><br />All I can say though is that for my particular needs - 80-90% reading ebooks and occasional surfing, it fits my lifestyle perfectly.  I think this folio cover provides good protection for instance if I put the kindle in a backpack or carryon briefcase, or if my wife puts it in her purse.  Of course, I wouldn't mind if the price were perhaps $5-10 cheaper, but I think the item deserves more than just 3 stars...
B005KMX866|2.0|there is only one problem here :  it doesn't sound like the chris issak i know / guess his voice is changing with old age
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I am one of those die-hard type fans, so it would be really hard for me to not like this.  Chris Daughtry once again has not disappointed me.  One thing I will mention, this album doesn't have as many \\"rock\\" songs.  My husband always says he liked the first album best because it has more rock music.  Then on the second album, there were more slow songs, and the third one, I think even more.  I like the rock songs best, but I like anything that Daughtry sings so I can't not like it.  My favorite track on this album is \\"Outta My Head.\\"  Also \\"Crawling Back to You\\", \\"Gone too Soon\\" and \\"Break the Spell\\" stick out to me as the best songs.  Personally, I don't see any way that a person couldn't like this album. =)
B005FVFWOI|5.0|People have gone into why this is so awesome,and I agree with all of 'em, but one thing I wanted to add: the long-version bonus track of \\"Wond'Ring Aloud\\" is probably my favorite Jethro Tull song of all time...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I wish I could give myself amnesia so I could go back and reread this book with a fresh head and enjoy it all over again. I thought it was that good. I was on the edge of my seat while reading, especially at the end. Characters were great, plot was great and very well researched... simply an incredible book. In my opinion, it's his best work yet. Because it's not horror, I hope others who don't typically read that genre and cast King in that light will not be hesitant to check it out. It's a great read.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|product is worth 5 not 6 dollars or maybe 99cents they should have thses at the dollar store. Dont waste ur money buy 6 lottery tickets instead or feed the bums
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The case is exactly as described, I am not a huge fan of leather cases I prefer the rubberized feel that the case has, its similar to the coating on the back of the kindle fire.  The case fits snugly around the device and does not leave any room for play, it does not block any of the buttons or the USB port on the device.  It has a nice wrap around elastic band that holds the cover closed, and the flap gives it more of a \\"book\\" feel. The back of the case is hard plastic with the same rubberized finish, it should protect it from minor drops and \\"oops\\" moments. It does not interfere with the devices touch screen at all, the entire panel is still completely useable. The stand works fairly well, and puts the kindle at just the right angle for viewing netflix movies on a table or desk.  All in all a fine product, nothing spectacular but it does its job exactly as described, I would recommend one any day.
1401324517|5.0|Brand new book that arrived quickly and as described. Amazon's price was the best too!  It definitely beat paying full price at the U.S. Open!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, long books scare me, especially books about politics and conspiracy theories, however, this book's synopsis grabbed my attention and I bought it on a whim. Totally loved it. I couldn't put it down! I read the entire book over the weekend, which for me is a new record!
030746363X|5.0|It is really like an all-encompassing encyclopedia for your mental, physical, and yes, even the bedroom health!  Very easy diet for those who seem stuck, instructional photos for exercises, and yes, some stuff you hadn't thought about but everyone could use!  I highly recommend this book!
B005UT29Z0|2.0|The topic is, of course on everyone's lips and unfortunately, people have no real clue what they are protesting or have any kind of understanding what happens behind the doors of these uber financial firms. The movie won't really progress you any further in your  understanding unless you are an economist. It had the feel of a documentary yet with none of the education or enlightenment of one. That leaves the entire film to the albeit superior acting skills of some of the cast to create interest. It never really happened for me. It was choppy and rushed yet still slow moving and boring if that makes any sense. The drama you are supposed to feel as a viewer is watching the actors stare at a computer screen and some printed reports with all of them acting with disbelief that in one afternoon the firm, the economy and all the world gets f'd over (pardon my vernacular). That should have weight, but again, I just didn't feel it. Give it three stars for the acting and for the darkness of the film. Minus one star for the techno jargon and \\"open\\" ending of the movie. I guess in real life, this story is still unfolding.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is the BEST.  The songs will be stuck in your head for months, and there is an important moral message to consider after you're done laughing.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|And that is saying something.  As someone with a doctorate in psychology who was 7 years old in 1958, this book grabbed me and never let go until I finished.    I don't come here to give book reports but what you get with this one is some winking at the audience in terms of his book \\"IT\\", a wonderful romance and just a little of the creepy SK.  Plus many memories, both good and bad of the \\"good old days\\".    If you are a baby boomer who loves to read, pick this one up and you will be lost for the next 3 days.  My husband is as lost in this book as I was.  Don't miss it!
B005N38GFK|5.0|This is a collection of \\"slow Sco\\", but make no mistake - the band plays with an intensity most cannot match. All I can say is, what a band! Really one of the best ballad records I've heard in a long, long time. Sco's take on Abbey Lincoln's \\"Throw it Away\\" is one of the most beautiful guitar recordings I've ever heard. Sco makes the guitar literally sing. Brian Blade shows that a drummer on a ballads recording can bring it without ever overplaying. Goldings is great as always, on piano and organ. Colley glues it together on bass. Mostly what impresses is that these guys sound like a working band, even though they're not. They should be!  More of this band Sco! Please!
B0034G4ORM|5.0|love this movie! Action packed, great story line....sound effects are great! definitly a hit! at first i didnt have much interest but after viewing! its a keeper......anybody who says this movie is weak doesnt really appeciate war films! its no saving private ryan or we were soldiers but an alternative!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This is a great app for any device.  I have it for the kindle and I can honestly say that I am impressed with the features this has.  The developer continues to update it as well, which is always assuring.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|Many years ago, I had the great privilege to work for Mark when my company Compuserve bought Mark's Dallas venture Microsolutions.  He remains one of the hardest working, smartest working individuals I have ever met.  In his book you will find bold stands, pithy wisdom, and the common sense most business find uncommon. Read it now.
0307474259|5.0|My kids are very aware of obesity, if they notice a child who is overweight or adult for that matter they will comment on it. In our home weight & fitness are a crucial part of health.  As parents it is vitally important for us to create a healthy lifestyle to teach our children the importance of weight and health for your life.  this book bring awareness to this issue which I believe is critical today.  There is absolutely nothing more important than meeting a fit and healthy body and lifestyle esp as we age!  parents must model fitness health and good eating habits for their children or else the culture we are going to have tremendous problems in the future with obesity related illness!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  An up close look at how Mark achieved his success is something all entrepreneurs can benefit from.  Mark provides great advice, hope and direction for all ages.  With a college age son, I especially like how he speaks to this group.  Simple and strait froward.  Thanks Mark!

B003URDKZW|5.0|Graceland represents a brilliant compilation of works by an American Poet laureate. Soaring above the expression of Jewish urban angst, Mr. Simon speaks his truth- an American Truth- with 6-stringed virtuosity and a gifted pen. This is not about us feeling the artist's pain- rather, he understands ours. This is the finest piece of American Art to emerge from the 1980's.    Graceland is nothing short of an American gift to a very confused world- now and for generations to come.
1878424505|5.0|This book is awesome! No matter what religion you practice, it is a reflective and spiritually based work that many can find beneficial.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|it was better than i thought it would be...not for kids, but for adults who like fantasy, the art direction and cast are beautiful, sets atmospheric, acting okay, plot just okay but as long as you are not expecting GREATNESS, nice way to pass a couple of hours...
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|I see all the negative reviews and yes there were parts that aimed for the older crowd like basically every kids movie out there now. My 5 year old daughter loved it though and laughed threw the movie. She knows bad guys and good guys and was able to grasp most of the story but bottom line she liked it and so did I.
B004EPZ07A|5.0|Very pleasant comedy/romance advancing the belief true love happens and will find you, if you let it? Self esteem held the relationship she wanted at bay until the realization she was the hold up? fun and heart warming.
B004SDEP38|1.0|don't download it for kindle fire. its the same thing that you already have. you can look at files but cant edit or create new.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion is a much darker work I would say than some of Jane Austen's earlier works. The heroine, like the author, is a bit older and the story is thus harsher in a variety of ways. Harsher only insofar as it is realistic though.   This film is very, very well made with superb acting by British actors, none of whom was familiar to me personally. It is refreshing to have such a variety of great actors who are not all distracting superstars and supermodels.   My only misgiving is that the Author (Austen) seems in this story to worship the Royal Navy and the life of a naval officer. Although the Royal Navy was undoubtedly more of a meritocracy than many other institutions at that time, one should bear in mind that it wasn't by being a choir boy that naval officers rose to riches and prominence at that time. Still, her bias is understandable (two of her brothers had great success in the Navy) and her portrayal of the contrast between men of inherited wealth and status with those who have attained it through ability is timeless.
B00005JNQS|5.0|The creators of Ice Age has crafted a movie favourite for kids and parents alike. Robots is a computer-animated feature film with an all-star cast that includes Ewan MacGregor(The Pillow Book), Robin Williams(Awakenings), Halle Berry(Catwoman), Drew Carey(The Price is Right), and Mel Brooks(Blazing Saddles). This tale is about a small town robot named Rodney(MacGregor)who comes to the big city to work for Bigweld Industries, and with a help of his new robot friends, Rodney becomes a hero. The special features includes a animated short with Aunt Fanny(Jennifer Collidge), a behind the scenes look of the film, designs of the Robots characters, a sneak peek of Ice Age 2 and many more. Robots is a pefect DVD for family viewing and watching in the car!
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|A lot of people don't really like this movie but I certainly love it so I just had to buy and I came to the right place! Amazon was quick and easy to use. I just received it today and I'm happy with the quality. This movie may not be to many people's liking but I thought that the movie was rather cute, romantic and sad. I was a little skeptical at first because I don't like Family Channel actors and actresses but after watching it for the first time I fell in love. Miley Cyrus did a good job for playing a role other than Hannah Montana even though you can still see a little bit of that Miley tone in her from the show on t.v but overall I thought it was very well done.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|The only issue I had was the app appeared twice on the Kindle Fire.  The fix is to select the star wheel on the lower right hand side of the screen and select advanced options.  Place a check mark next to \\"Hide Premium Key\\".  Reboot Kindle Fire.  You now have one icon for the full app!
B005SZNZAY|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. This is easily worth the purchace, everyone should have it. I can't wait for 2012 spring new soundgarden.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I had no idea when I preordered this that it would not have a \\"real\\" digital copy that I could download to iTunes.  Instead it's a limited three-year streaming copy that requires an account and internet connection. Would never have bought this version, but just the blu-ray, if I had known.  Very disappointed. Will avoid anything with Ultraviolet in the future. What a waste of my money.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Not sure why everybody is complaining. It's a simple black cover which goes the device, thin and nicely fits on fire. Super lightweight. I was a bit skeptical while reading all the reviews, but the product is just as it is describes, not sure what more you need. Very similar to ipad cover.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This album is hard to digest on the first listen because it's so complex, but after you hear it again, it's evident that Prince is at his best here musically and lyrically.<br />This is a concept album that revolves around God and unity and makes a lot of reference to religion but that only makes it more mystical and gives the album more heart. It's not something you can skip track by track and find singles on in my opinion; it's more like something you sit down and listen to as a full body of art that is extremely incredible.<br />Prince sounds like he's passionately putting his all into the amazing guitar work and sings with great conviction; some may not agree with the religious message but the overall message of unity and love among all people should resonate with everyone.<br />There's a narrator with a deep-computerized voice that strings the songs together that may annoy some people but I think it fits with the experimental yet strong approach Prince took here. He made this to please himself and honor his religious beliefs and that is taking the high road in my book.<br /><br />So the bottom line is, if you're a die-hard Prince fan you need to get this one. If you're just getting into Prince, maybe you should get something more accessible before having your mind blown by this one.
B00008G8QV|3.0|The video is fine, but there are only partial riffs , no full songs. Good if that is all you want. I don't use it much.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|This is an extremely enjoyable cd! The music covers many genres with instrumental and vocal tracks. While I wasn't a huge fan of Steve's singing at first, he's definitely improved alot, and this cd shows how well he's progressed in that area. As a guitar player, he's one of the best and his tell tale sound is featured throughout. Roger King's keyboards are also prominent and he's tremendous, as usual! This is a very enjoyable cd! Make sure you get the edition with the bonus disc as it features six new songs along with one of my favorites, \\"re\\"(air)conditioned nightmare! Most excellent and highly recommended!!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, but for The Hunger Games, I'm going to make an exception. While the narrative is certainly meant for Young Adults, the themes of this novel are anything but childish. Deep, exciting prose is the hallmark of The Hunger Games, and its pace makes this an unforgettable book. Top it off with gutwrenching scenes, and you've really got yourself a winner. Hope Lionsgate doesn't screw it up too badly!   Its much cheaper to buy the trilogy on the Kindle of course, but word to the wise, there's a problem with fonts in this version and you'll find yourself changing the fonts every here and there. Its not fatal, and for the amount you saved instead of buying the books, its well worth it. Just wish the publishers would fix it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Discovering clues and unlocking secrets is so much fun as you work your way through the old mansion in this app. The graphics and sound effects were incredible on the Kindle Fire. I would love to see more games like this one! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to solve puzzles.
B005IEF27O|3.0|Mixed bag of reviews. Some people hate this, some find it embarrassing, some praise it.   I find it close to the BROWN ALBUM, in that a lot of the material on here seems like its jam material. The only difference now, is that Ler is not featured in the mix, and he seems to be merely playing supplemental chords and reiterations of Les's chords instead of doing \\"his thing\\".  There are some stand out tracks, but overall the album mix was pretty disturbing, I had no idea Les was going to rely on this \\"lets feed my voice through a really distorted microphone\\" thing very long. I thought that was just a part of ANIMALS SHOULD NOT ACT LIKE PEOPLE, not a strict decision to no longer sing again. Another reviewer has mentioned that this brings up a slowness and counterbalance in the mix that might make it sound like a submerged boombox. The wavelengths DO NOT complement the high frequency threshold. maybe the intention was to make an album for, uh, pipe smokers.   I actually enjoyed this album during the first playback (on the first day it came out) and it got a little better afterward. Only problem is the mix. I love Jay lane's playing, it's the most stand out instrument on this album. Everybody else seems to be buried beneath a swathe of effects and particularly Les' Bass! (maybe he's been hanging with PRINCE? Cause lately he's overprocessed his bass work as well to the point of defunkitude)  Commenters have mentioned that TRAGEDY'S A COMIN is pretty much THE BALLAD OF BODACIOUS (who's gonna ride bodacious?)... c'mon you remember it from high school.   I love Eternal Consumption Engine, Eyes of A Squirrel, Jilly's On Smack, Moron Tv and Hoinfodaman. The rest of the album is good too, just not effing great.   I believe this is the reason some don't wish to view this as a PRIMUS album. LYRICALLY (which is the substance of this album) I think its a very bleak and bitter album (with the exception of LEE VAN CLEEF which is an ODE) and the Return of the Fishermans Chronicles (although it's not referred to as that) THE LAST SALMON MAN  However, I am grateful to have seen them live again. They performed Classics and then the ENTIRE album afterward. It's good to hear Primus again, I hope they maintain.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|Since Google Calendars is not available for the Kindle Fire, it took me quite a while to find a calendar app that had similar functionality and didn't require a continuous Internet connection. I'm very happy to say I found it with this app! It has all the functionality I need and I love the way it is laid out...very user-friendly! Great buy!
B005KWL2IW|5.0|I've been a big fan of Anthrax ever since the release of the video \\"Indians\\" on MTV... and it wasn't long before I had their entire collection.  I've spent the last 20+ years believing \\"Persistence of Time\\" was one of the best metal albums ever released but this release exceeds even that.  All I can say is this is the first metal album with \\"clean\\" vocals I've heard that is technically better than \\"Master of Puppets\\".  It might not score highly on the \\"influences future bands\\" scale but in my opinion it might be the best power metal album that has ever been created.
B005ZV8Q2S|5.0|If you like movies like American Pie, Animal House, Caddyshack, etc. you will love this movie! It is \\"R\\" rated and is available as \\"unrated\\" and is not for kids. This is the whole reason movies are rated is for parents to be enlightened \\"before\\" they bring their kids along to watch.
0439023521|3.0|Unfortunately, The Hunger Games leaves us hungering for a believable story.  Not only is the setup pretty wild -- *spoilers* -- a future society divided into districts and \\"controlled\\" through a barbaric annual ritual involving the random selection of one young person to participate in a sort of gladiatorial combat for the entertainment of television viewers, with the lone survivor's region blessed with abundance and everybody else taught a lesson in power.  I can tell that the author isn't a parent, because she fully lacks an understanding of the parental instinct, i.e., parents would never let their kids be sacrifices for meaningless entertainment venues like this.  So the setup is a hard pill to swallow.  But let's get beyond that and suppose we suspend our disbelief for a bit.  The main character is wholly unlikable.  She is selfish, for the most part, though she does end up making some good choices almost by accident.  She seems to get into the entertainment aspect of the competition, playing the part and acting out for the crowd's pleasure.  I'm highly skeptical that this is what anybody would do in that situation.  In short, the writing is off the mark for science fiction because it lacks a basic understanding of human nature.  That said, I gave it three stars for creativity, if for nothing else.
B00466HN86|5.0|This movie was absolutely amazing. I went and saw it in theaters with my boyfriend and we both cried several times during the movie and left changed for the better. When the movie was over I wanted to watch it again and I had a hard time getting up to go to the car. This movie was so well made and the story line was heart touching I would recommend this movie to EVERYBODY.
B000O98R7A|5.0|Some people might disagree with me but I think this is the second best Pink Floyd album right behind The Wall. I was stoked to find on that was not a remastered reissue of the album. The record sleeve and jacket were in very good condition just like danielle09328 posted. Plus good shipping time. Great record and enjoyed buying from danielle09328.
B0064W639K|1.0|I was quite excited to see a few \\"graphic novels\\" released in time for the Kindle Fire this week. I downloaded the sample for The Long Halloween, and wouldn't you know it... the second page is totally unreadable. The second and third page of this book is merged into a wide panel (likely for a cohesive image), but the maker of this file decided to put \\"widescreen bars\\" over the top and bottom to that the two pages are in tiny eye-squint print that is completely illegible. You cannot tilt this file format to view in widescreen either. That my friends is (in nerdspeak venacular) an Epic Fail. C'mon, it's the second page! Whoever was in charge of testing this file for the Kindle must not have gotten past the first page. I have to give this format a 1-star rating, even though the graphic novel itself is a 5-star read. Sorry, Batman, but Amazon has not done you justice.
B000IZQ9CK|5.0|I have written two other reviews and I don't much else to say this is a great album and I had a great seller experience. You can read my reviews of Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here from danielle09328. This review has to be at least 20 words(stupid right!?) and I think this is enough. Long live Rock n Roll!

B000002H33|5.0|If you're new to Metallica this is the album to get.  I prefer Ride The Lightning, but both are perfect thrash metal albums, both worthy of owning.    This one boasts a different sound from the previous album, as they progress.  The songs are a little longer.  As with their previous effort, the musicianship and vocals are all performed perfectly.  I have to admit, when I first got into the band, self titled was my favorite, and this one took a long itme to grow on me.  I remember where I was when it did, and has since become one of my favorite albums.  Sadly after learning to appreciate it, I grew tired of the band and their antics, lawsuits, crappy newer music, so it ended up collecting dust for a long time, with my collection of their albums.  Thankfully in the last few years I've grown to accept the band who recorded this masterpiece is a totally different band than the one who sues everyone, makes bad pop albums, and garbage demo albums passing them off as new stuff, and is generally considered a joke amongst music fans.  Still this is a great album every metal fan should own.  Battery 10/10 starts with the famous acoustic intro before the electric guitars and the rhythm section kick in to pick the intro up several notches.  Then the song kicks into overdrive as it rivals the fastest of all Metallica songs.  I think Fight Fire With Fire is a little faster, but still.  This is a really fast paced thrasher which should not be missed.  The guitar work rhythm section and vocals all do nice jobs on here.  This is a perfect opener for a perfect album.  Master Of Puppets 10/10 you probably have heard this one several times.  If not then you're missing out.  this one's kind of progressive thrash.  It's fast paced, not as fast as Battery, but still fast, with a clean guitar, eh softer mid section.  Good chorus and great verses.  Overall this might be Metallica's most impressive song ever.  The Thing That Should Not Be 9/10 my boss?  No..  Maybe not.  Anyways, this is a slower song, still relatively heavy.  A lot of drum and bass in the verses with heavy guitars coming in with a nice riff that goes along with the vocals, they're kind of dueling if that makes any sense.  It has a decent chorus as well.  Welcome Home Sanitarium 10/10 is hands down Metallica's best ballad.  Fade to Black is really good, and does rival this, as does One, but htis is their best.  there's a nic clean guitar riff throughout the verses with a solid chorus,, not overly catchy, but it works.  The song gets heavier and faster during the bridge and solo.  Disposable Heroes 9/10 is a faster song.  Great guitar work as always, on the 80's albums anyways.    Leper Messiah 10/10 is a groove laden song with a nice riff.  This one gets me every time and is a joy to listen to.    Damage Inc 9/10 is another fast paced thrasher and a nice closing track.    There's also an instrumental, but I'm not a fan of instrumentals so i won't  rate it, except to say it's played just fine.  Overall this is a great album to start your Metallica collection with.  then get Ride The Lightning then And Justice For All.  After that you're on your own.  Still this is a thrash classic no metal fan should be without in some form or another.
0316017930|5.0|Seriously.  I had a three-hour book signing at an airport bookstore.  The crowds would come, I'd chat and sign. The crowds would leave and I'd read Outliers.  The essays are fascinating, well-written, and compelling.  It's character-driven nonfiction--you'll connect to these stories in the same way that you connect to stories of great fictional characters.  A perfect gift for busy people who don't have the time or focus to read an entire novel and need to take in their books piecemeal.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found this biography to be fascinating. Jobs was a very complex person and this biography seemed to perfectly capture his essence.
0385738773|5.0|James Dashner knows how to torture his characters. He has the skills to make his characters' lives utterly MISERABLE. Whatever it is that his characters NEED, Dashner will take it away and leave them to deal with their loss. If there are two characters who need each other, then Dashner may make one suffer in a way that the other cannot help them. Even with physical torture all around, the emotional toll is even greater. It's like he RIPS THEIR HEARTS OUT and puts them in a blender.  Dashner holds the power to ruin it all for his characters. And he USES that power.  Oh the MIND TRICKS! Just because you could trust someone before doesn't mean you can trust them now. And if you think you have it all figured out, I can GUARANTEE you that you don't. No one and nothing is what it seems. Or maybe it is? Should we trust WICKED or not? It depends who you ask. Mind tricks!  Want some over-the-top violence? It's here! I could smell the smoke after the explosions. If there were a soundtrack to this book, it would be filled with the sounds of war. If you like these sorts of things, then you are going to LOVE how Dashner makes his story completely BLOW UP. He is not shy about the violence. At. All. And don't put it past Dahsner to kill off characters that you are emotionally invested in.  He does things like that, you know.  THIS is why I love James Dashner's writing.    What I walked away with were answers, but not all of them, and the ones I did get were not complete. I am still a little unsure about the what and the why. And I like it that way. The first two books in this series were ramping up for what happens in The Death Cure. Don't worry at all about this series ending flat. The Death Cure ends with the INTENSITY you expect.

Decca steps up to the plate now and hits it out of the park. At first glance the list of titles might look a bit random. But there's a theory operating behind the selection. Instead of trying to create a collection that covers a wide swath of core repetoire, Decca decided to focus on the quality of the recordings instead. They picked just the greatest performances and the best recordings.<br /><br />A seasoned classical collector might already have some of tese recordings, but at this price, one can afford a little overlap. For classical music newbies looking for an inexpensive sampling of what this music has to offer, this is a dream come true,<br /><br />The packaging is great with a nice book (type is big enough to read!), CDs filled out to 65 to 75 minutes, and nice mini LP jackets. All in all, this is a great set for anyone who loves classical music.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I cannot stress how happy I am that I waited to purchase this application. Since I was patient enough, I was able to get it for free.<br /><br />Currently using it flawlessly on my Kindle Fire and I have no complaints. Pinch to zoom, Spreadsheets, Word, PowerPoint...what is there not to like about this free.app????<br /><br />No lag that I can see. App connects directly to your recently worked Google Docs which make for seamless transitions.<br /><br />Hopefully this review helped. Although I downloaded the app for free due to Amazons one day deal, I do believe it is worth the 14.99 price tag. Enjoy!
B0000C8AVE|4.0|Sad to say I bought this disc having read Suze Rotolo's book about her time with the maestro, as I really like the cover photograph, not least because of the battered VW van. While they may appear to be very much in love, Joan Baez was waiting in the wings...... Some iconic songs, 'Blowin' In The Wind', 'Hard Rain' and 'Don't Think Twice, It's Alright'- the latter, however, was recorded by Ms Baez for her In Concert Part 2 collection and, in my view, she nailed it. I still love this album though for all it's rawness.

A place that defies gravity and time itself.<br />Where it can snow in summer and where dreams come true.<br />A place you can jump into the clouds and wish on a tree.<br />A place like no other.<br />Welcome to the Night Circus.<br /><br />I will admit, I really really had fun reading this book.<br />It was mysterious and just plain captivating.<br />It did have a lot of detail but Morgenstern has a way with words that suck you right into the pages and makes you feel like you are there along with the characters feeling what they are feeling and seeing what they are seeing.<br />I completely felt like I was there, as if I had jumped through the pages and landed along side them waiting anxiously to enter into the Night Circus and experience it all for myself. To feel the mystery and magic that is their world.<br />I wanted to know them and be a part of it too.<br />I loved the underlying romance between Celia and Marco. I loved the challenges that they had to face not only with the competition but with each other as well and most of all I love how this ended.<br />There were so many twists and turns and unexpected happenings that I never felt like the story lagged or got old, in fact I craved all the details and stories and people.<br />I admit, I almost didn't read this book because of all the hype and some of the reviews, it seems you love it or you hate it.<br />I am so glad that I did because if I hadn't I would have missed out on so much<br />Morgenstern is truly a master with words and I so look forward to seeing what she comes out with next.

B003VANOFY|1.0|I have had these headphones about a month now, the software was stupid to me, it never wanted to work right. Sound quality was ok at first, but then it was choppy with alot of background noise, one side keeps going out if my music or anything gets loud. I bought these to play games, music and, skype with. I do not think they are worth $130 at all, the most i would pay for these is maybe $40. they are comfortable. The surround is decent when the headphones want to work.

B005I6EU48|5.0|I am at a loss as to why several folks rated this cover as unsuitable for the Fire.  I had originally ordered the more standard cover but it left little material to hold the Fire around the edges and I was constantly putting my thumb on the bottom to hold it up while reading inadvertently hitting the power button (Amazon should have put it on the top - no matter.) This case is perfect.  It is well-made, handsome, and classy. It's very easy to insert the Fire under the elastic straps which hold it snugly, but it's still easy to remove should that ever become necessary. I like the slot for papers, and once the cover has been opened a few times, the leather becomes more flexible and the cover falls nice and flat over the unit.  Very glad I bought it.

B005I6EU48|4.0|I got this for my Kindle Fire, which unfortunately I couldn't keep because of wireless issues. I kept the cover though for my old Kindle and I love it. It is buttery soft leather and you have the definite sense of holding an old leather bound book while you are reading. The cover says that it is made to fit all the Kindles, but I found that it was really tight on the Fire and is also tight on the standard model. A bit of a struggle to get it installed.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|This DVD captures the magic of the Speak Now live convert experience perfectly.  The image quality is superb.  Colors are vibrant, and the details are crisp and well defined, despite the harsh lighting in the concert environment.  The only minor complaint is that colors sometimes tend to favor yellow tones a bit more than ideal.  But again, that's mostly attributed to the non optimal lighting conditions. The videography strikes a nice balance between intimate close ups of Taylor and her various bandmates and wide angle shots that really convey the grand scale of her concert stage and the production value.  And that's the real value of this DVD.  It gives you the kind of close up look at the concert you just can't get from the live thing, no matter how good your seats are.  I was lucky enough to get 7th row seats when I attended her concert. While I was super close to the stage, my head barely rose above the floor of the stage.  So the whole time I was craning my neck to maintain my view of the stage.  At the concert I was so busy keeping my eye on Taylor, I paid almost no heed to her background dancers and other band members.  Now I get a chance to go back and relive the experience and focus on the details that I missed the first time around.  I particularly enjoyed being able to see the expression on her face while she say \\"Dear John\\".  The footage on the DVD is put together from multiple concerts.  Taylor took the best of her performances for each song and stitched everything together seamlessly.  You'd be hard pressed to know it's not from a single concert, if you weren't paying attention to the lyrics written on her arm, which varies from concert to concert.  The audio mix on the DVD is also pretty close to perfect.  The nonstop cheering of the crowd adds just the right amount of ambiance to really bring the concert experience home, without being overpowering, and muddying her vocals.  Sadly, that cannot be said for the audio quality on the accompanying CD.  Forsome of the songs on the CD, the crowd noise completely overshadows the singing, and makes her vocals sound dull.  The worst offenders seems to be Sparks Fly and Mine, which is a shame, as those are two of my favorite tracks.  Personally, I plan to rip the audio track off the DVD and make high bit rate MP3s out of them to solve this problem.    The other minor point to be aware of is that the CD doesn't contain every song that's on the DVD.  Specifically, the following are missing:  1) Our Song  2) Fearless (under the tree)  3) You Belong With Me (under the tree)  4) FIfteen   5) Love Story  Despite these minor flaws, the overall experience is fantastic and absolutely enchanting.  I recommend this to any taylor swift fan without reservation.  From this DVD, it's easy to see why Taylor defines the voice of a generation.
031617615X|1.0|This was just terrible, really, I have never disliked a book so much. In fact, I disliked it so much, it made me hate the series. Now, let me tell you, I actually really really liked it up until that point, HELL, I was in the Philippines when this book came out and did everything I could to get it, in the end, I skipped pages, got bored and when I finished it tossed it away, should have thrown it away because I don't think ANYONE should have read it. It was rushed, poorly thought out and let's be honest was made for the money. I would say she sold out, but her books weren't THAT good enough to say that. First 3 books fine, last one? Skip it, unless you want to hate the series then by all means go for it.
B002V092M4|5.0|I first read this book back in the seventies and recently bought and read it again. I'd forgotten just how good it is.  As a writer myself I can only sit there with my mouth open in complete awe. This book seems to break all modern rules.   It is nearly all exposition with very little action in the present time. But it is done so elegantly, in an almost mesmirising  way. Many people have praised Mister Le Carré as the master of this genre, so I'll just stick to this book. Read it (even if like me  you read it all those years ago), you'll love the experience.

B005LZW9CG|3.0|the Remastering is 4 1/2 stars, BUT! it still cant save this piss poor album by phil, 2 stars kindly = 3 stars total. This album is full of some of phil's weakest material. Its droppy, slow,grating,tedious,and most of all unconvincing. Sure i can tell he's bitter but where's the worthy melody, wheres the normal talent of phil that so often shines through? dont get me wrong i love,LOVE! eccentric pop music (weird semi pop/semi underground) so i dont want any comments on how \\"I dont like it cauz its not radio enough\\" or whatever. Crap is Crap, and unfortunately a great remastering cant save it from that. I could be more descriptive on why i feel this album is full of tripe material BUT im lazy AND grammer is obviously not my best subject BUT AGAIN (:-) great grammer) im sure yall get the common (real common ;-))idea of why i dont think this album deserves much(if any) praise.  Excuse My Poor Grammer (for all you Grammer Nazis ;-) you suck)  -Robert
B005R4255C|5.0|I was completely blown away by the Michael Jackson Immortal CD.. This CD is a masterpiece- and it a showcase that honors -- all the love and dedication that Michael put in his music.  If you think, this is another re-hash of MJ's classic hits. You could not be more wrong. Cirque and Michael Jackson are the perfect combination! And you can hear the LOVE and respect that was put into this CD.  It is hard to pick a favorite but for me -- BEN is a standout. But the addition of a gospel Choir- in \\"They Dont Care about US' has turned what was already masterpiece- to nothing short of brilliant.  This CD is a must for every Michael Jackson fan- but there is something here for the new generation of fans.  This CD is a MASTER Class of what made- Michael Jackson, the Greatest Entertainer that EVER LIVED.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|I live in a Target town (Minneapolis) and a Target family (father-in-law worked for the various iterations of the company his entire career).  Target, like WalMart, is now selling more and more organic food.  Not local food, as they need to be doing, but at least it is a step in the right direction.  I do not like WalMart, or its reasoning for why they are the largest buyer of organic food in the world (it was strictly a business decision, i.e. demand), but at least there is demand and WalMart, however horrible their employment practices and other business impacts, is at least ushering in what I hope will be an organic and local food revolution.    Oh, and everyone from the millionaire to the family on welfare needs to be able to purchase it as well.  Right now we are telling the poor that because they cannot afford the more expensive organic and local food that they are not worthy of the benefits that come with eating that food.  We are setting them up for sickness.  That is not a world in which I want to live.  We can do better.  We must do better.

B001UV4XJ2|3.0|I want to say that I think this movie is probably the best Harry Potter movie... Or at least one of the best.  I'm not going to bore you with the synopsis... If you are interested in purchasing this product, then you probably already know the plot. The effects are good, the plot is fairly faithful to the book.<br />The reason for my negative review is the Ultraviolet digital copy.  It isn't a real digital copy.  It's a temporary license to stream the video.  I have all the other digital copies...  Guess I'm buying this one from itunes.<br />Seriously, don't waste your money on this fake digital copy...  But definitely buy the movie.<br /><br />This movie has the most action and the best drama compared to the other movies in the franchise. Alan Rickman should have been nominated for the Beat Supporting Actor Academy Award. His performance is awesome. Most of the actors have stepped up their acting game in this finale, which picks up where the seventh movie leaves off. The Battle of Hogwarts, which is most of the movie, is epic. The director did a nice job on this one. It is truly a pleasure to watch...<br /><br />But I suggest you spend your money on a bluray without the ultraviolet copy (because that really is a waste of money).
0316172324|4.0|i enjoyed reading this book.  it is a little short on very detailed information but is overall interesting and well written.  it is also a fairly quick read.  basically encourages readers to target attention on specific forms of interactions and to trust your instincts.  helpful approach for better human interactions and salespeople.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I love this book, and now plan to read John's fictional stories as well. Btw,  I totally agree with the reviewer named Hannah. And the few negative reviewers? They speak for themselves. Pretty obvious. It's sad, but they just don't get it and probably never will. There will always be those who listen and never hear. But even so, they serve a purpose and theirs will no doubt be popular among those of like mind. Thanks John..<br /><br />P.S.  This is a practical book and packed full of advice that's been road tested. John convinces you that anyone can do what he did. And what's not to believe?

0307456625|4.0|I would say my favorite genre is modern literature because of the prose, depth and reasons behind the story. The problem, though, is that some of modern literature is depressing or overdone (read: snooty). I enjoyed this book because it has depth but is somehow almost lighthearted. I think it had a lot to do with the main character and her outlook on life. The book deals with death, crime, abuse, etc, but the setting is so peaceful and main character is so down-to-earth that it makes her setting more bearable. This is a quick read but still has a purpose.  The author does a great job dealing with varied perspectives and moving in time while keeping the story consistent. There are several mysteries in here, and they're all enjoyable, but they are really not the point of the book. You need to love the setting and the backstory before you can get into the mysteries. His writing style can lean toward the choppy, but there are poetic bits as well.  I'm excited to have stumbled on this book and look forward to reading the next in the series.

B005TZFYNE|4.0|I got my hands on Rihannas' album 3 1/2 weeks before it was released to the public and I must say that I have LOVED it every since I pressed play! In my opinion, as she progresses in her music, I feel as though she is learning to broaden her horizon....well....at least with experimenting with \\"tunes\\" within the pop genre. Thats the good news. The bad news is this woman is NO LONGER suitable for children....even the \\"edited\\" version! For years, I didnt approve (as a former fan) of the \\"new Rihanna\\" because of her newly found risque image, her dirty lyrics, and the way she changed, BUT.... I have learned that no matter how much you may gripe and complain, you can NEVER  change a celeb--either you support them, or you dont, but it will not change the dollar signs in their bank account! Anywho....I really hope parents do not allow their children to partake in her music for the simple reason Rihanna continuously vocalizes how much she loves sex! Im 23 years old so of course my parents no longer have control over what I can listen to, however, children with impressionable minds should not be allowed to listen to the lyrics that Rihanna sings! Parents, I do understand that you do not want your child to feel sheltered, however, Rihanna pretty much sells her body throughout the entire album! As much as I may enjoy singing along to her raunchy lyrics, I must admit that I would NEVER let my child (if I had one that is) listen to ANYTHING that comes from Rihanna's latest work (but she isnt the only one who falls under that category). Anywho, I have to admit....this is one of the BEST albums that Rihanna has released! The way she remains within the pop genre yet experiments with dub-step (which I KNEW was going to happen with this album and I should have bet a looooooooot of money on it lol) has a nice twist. I do enjoy hearing Rihanna utilize her (progressively powerful) vocals in ways that she hasnt done before. As the number of albums that she releases increases, I am starting to notice she is learning to use different ranges (especially the \\"belting\\" technique)! My personal favorites on this album are:  -You Da One (****)  -Where Have You Been  -We Found Love  -Talk That Talk (********)  -Cockiness (One of my absolute favorites....)  -Birthday Cake (Even though it disappoints you with the length of the song....I cant help but list it as one of my favorites)  -Drunk On Love  -Roc Me Out  -Watch N Learn  -Red Lipstick  -Do Ya Thang  As you can tell, there were only a few songs that did not make it to my favs list...which means the album is exceptionally enjoyable! I do respect the way she always has at least one song on each album that reminds her fans of where she originated (in this album, its Watch N Learn)! I do agree that Rihanna has permanently tarnished her own reputation....sexually, however, as an artist, Rihanna's consistency is very appreciated! Love the album Rihanna! I look forward to your future endeavors!   One more thing....am I the only one who thinks she looks like Beyonce on her album cover? Hmm....maybe its just me.....
B003WTE886|5.0|I did not really like this CD the first few times that I heard it but I do feel as though she is an excellent songwriter and the album is good. My daughter really enjoys her music and it is nice to have a good artist like her for kids.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a joy this book is to any person who grew up in the 50's and 60's.  I agree with a reviewer that the book's best part is in the town of Jodie.  This is not a horror book, but like the author's earlier books it is a one of a kind.
0307276902|5.0|If this were a historical piece on the Civil War, would you not expect an element of creativity or sensationalism to add color to an otherwise bland account?  As a recovered addict, I look back on my own experience with intense regret, remembering some of the darkest times of my life.  From another perspective, that period in my life probably didn't look as extreme as what I was personally experiencing.  This story by James Fray is just that--a story & one deserving of poetic license to convey the tragedy he was experiencing.  The fictitious elements of the story are analogous to the calamity his life became.  Everyone who seems to be so concerned with a ridged, factual retelling of the story: maybe you should start reading Medical Journals instead of criticizing a man trying to share an encouraging story of his path to recovery.
1451627289|5.0|I have enjoyed MOST of Stephen King's books and I'm a big fan.  This one is over the top good.  I could not put this one down - even reading into the wee hours of the morning.  The story:  Jake Eppinger is as English teacher in a small Maine town.  He is friends with a guy that owns a diner.  The friend discovers a portal to the past in the diner and makes many trips back to the past.  Every trip back resets what was done the previous time.  He decides that Lee Harvey Oswald must be stopped before he assassinates President Kennedy on 11/22/1963.  But he is dying from cancer and talks Jake into taking over the task.  Jake tries to fix a few other things along the way.   Jake finds out through his journies that righting one wrong may cause negative consequences somewhere else.
B005HS00XW|5.0|Many fans of Peter Gabriel were disappointed that his current tour is performed entirely with this orchestra, no guitars, no drums, no basses. Those fans should have no doubt of Gabriel's musical genius and the work he has done here with John Metcalfe and Ben Foster. THIS is not a symphony orchestral arrangement. This is a contemporary, timely application of the symphonic orchestra applied to some of the best music and lyrics written the past 20-25 years. If you are skeptical, open yourself to the nuances, textures and power the New Blood brings to this music.
B000059TEQ|4.0|It is hard to figure out what makes Love Story work. The plot is far from complex: boy meets girl, boy loses girl to untimely death. The concept is far from original: Rich boy falls for girl from wrong side of the the track. Like we've never seen that storyline before! But for some reason everything just clicks in this charming tearjerker. It may be the great on screen chemistry between O'Neal and McGraw, it may be the clever dialogue, or the New England backdrop. The end result is that it is simply irresistible. I've watched it dozens of times without ever growing tired of seeing it.
B0017JKEL8|1.0|I purchased season 1-4 of Mad Men for Blu-ray, which we have. Season 1 had 1 incompatable disk, Season 2 had all 3 disks incompatable, Season 3 had all good disks, and Season 4 had 1 incompatable disk. Purchased for a gift for my husband. We really enjoyed the first 2 disks on season 1 and are very disappointed that we can't continue watching in sequence.

B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I downloaded this app - only to find out that this was the older version that LinkedIn initially released when they offered the app to beta testers.

So I used the Astro file browser app to backup the newer LinkedIn app on my Motorola Atrix, copied the .apk file over to my Kindle Fire, installed the new .apk.

B00511PTWM|3.0|I have two cigarette lighter adapters in the front of my Santa Fe, and because it's an older vehicle with no USB port for my iPod, I find myself fighting for manage those slots.  This dual-port, swiveling adapter definitely does make traveling easier for me. The lights on it make me know it's working. I can now plug in a portable DVD player for my son during long trips, and I can have my cell phone charging AND my iPod playing over the radio, all at the same time.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />Even with the swiveling head, this adapter is cumbersome.  It gets in the way and may even be unusable in some cars where the lighter may be directly behind the shifter or even a cup holder.  I can manage it alright in my car and I can still have my iPod stand up and working, but this is the BIG ISSUE; if you bump the adapter just a little, chances are good it will disconnect from its power source.  That's not a big deal when you're just recharging something, but it's happened a few times that the DVD player will go out, and I'll have to replug and restart the player.  If your GPS is plugged into it, then the same thing will happen; the power interuption will cause you to drive off of a cliff and into the swamp of alligators.<br /><br />I suppose I exaggerate the repercussions because so far there's nothing so important a momentary power interuption will cause permanent scars, but it is really annoying.  Aside from those times, and there have been several bumps and power losses, this adapter has worked just fine.  If you think that problem would annoy you, or if the sheer length of the adapter will cause issues, there are many other adapters out there at comparible (inexpensive) prices.

0307891402|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to get this guide at first because I just wanted to enjoy Skyrim without any temptation or spoilers but I'm glad I decided to in the end, I just couldn't pass up on the price. It literally covers every quest in the whole game, when I'm lost (which can happen quite a bit in such a big game)I just look up the quest in the index and it tells me exactly what to do or where to find someone without being too confusing or frustrating, it just gets to the point. it's also nice to see what other quests i might have missed in a city or town. It's also very helpful in teaching you what to do to increase your skills faster. An example is smithing, a very helpful skill that I would have never have tried if it wasn't for this guide. The pages are all in color and there are a ton of pictures in here that help to identify where you're supposed to go and who you're supposed to talk to.  I only have positive things to say about this guide, the only thing is it can be a little confusing at the beginning trying to find the specific quests you're looking for, but trust me, if you wan't an extremely helpful (and very long) handbook to The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, this is it.

B0053O89WY|5.0|In the cult tradition of SPARTACUS, the halls of every science department now echoes: \\"I AM SHELDON\\"!<br /><br />Currently into its fifth season, THE BIG BANG THEORY proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. Even if the show seems to have slowed down form its initial explosive impetus, I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of FRASIER and SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is **consistently** brilliant!<br /><br />Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.<br />His equally super-intelligent (yet sexually confused girlfriend), Amy Farrah Fowler, (which Sheldon finally claimed) received a far more enlarged role this fifth season. However, she was not a very good addition and she unbalances the show. Her character only manages to blur the focus form Sheldon (there is only room for one idiosyncratic genius!), diffuse a number of comically charged situations and gum up the show's flow.<br /><br />Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself (who Sheldon tries to \\"help\\" by steering him towards a teaching career), he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.<br />Leonard tried his hand in a long-distance relationship this season with his friend Raj's sister, Priya, but he seems to be gravitating back towards Penny once more.<br /><br />Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD (and Sheldon will never let him forget it). An engineer (whose crowning achievements were a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle and a liquid waste management solution), he also managed to wreck the Mars Rover in hopes of landing a girl (but he made sure no one can prove anything).<br />The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.<br />Howard used to be the show-stealer. Whenever he entered the scene you just knew he would offer such an outrageous perceptive that would render you speechless. Now, if only Howard's character was allowed to continue in its stellar trajectory. He has been weighted down by his fianc&eacute;e, Bernadette, who is very likeable, but also is cramping his style. Not to mention that she, slowly yet inescapably, is turning into his scary mother.<br /><br />Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the \\"poor Indian\\" defense although his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley. His character, even in the fifth season, remains underdeveloped.<br /><br />Then there is Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.<br />One of the best fifth season moments: slipping in the \\"Who is the greatest?\\" cheer between Sheldon's patented knock of repeated \\"Penny!\\".<br /><br />The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!<br /><br />The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B005JLN9Z8|3.0|Comedy writers dread the Law of Diminishing Comedy Returns, which states that any sketch will get progressively get less funny every time it's done... that's basically the reason Monty Python rarely made the same sketch twice and why most comedy sequels fail miserably.<br />Two years ago, Steel Panther made quite a splash on metal (and even mainstream) circles with their no holds barred hair metal parody masterpiece, Feel the Steel. What made that album so successful was not only that it sounded exactly like a generic 1988 hair metal act who decided to stop beating around the bush and finally dropped the euphemisms, it was also made by extremely accomplished musicians that loved playing the style but most importantly, understood what made it so appealing in the first place. Steel Panther, thus, became something really unique, a laugh out loud comedy act that celebrated the worst of pop metal's excesses while making genuinely great music: had they been recorded in the late 80s, songs like Asian Hooker, Fat Girl, Stripper Girl, Community Property and Death to All but Metal would've been huge radio and MTV hits with just some minor lyrical tweaks.<br />On their second effort, Balls Out, Steel Panther deliver exactly what is expected from them: impeccably recorded hair metal anthems with over the top, extremely sexist and vulgar lyrics. Problem is, this time around, the comedy's not that fresh. You can blame it mostly on the dreaded Law of Diminishing Comedy Returns, since, misogynistic vulgarity can get old after a while, but at the same time, there's an over reliance on current pop culture references which will inevitably lose relevance as time goes by. What's worse, this nods to current events feel grafted and oddly out of place within the songs, and most of the time kill the \\"long lost gem from hair metal's golden era\\" vibe the band works so hard to create in their look, liner notes and especially the artwork, which makes the CD look like some old, beaten down album by a failed hair band that was forgotten on a delete bin decades ago. I mean, I still laugh out loud while singing along to Asian Hooker, Community Property, Fat Girl and Stripper Girl, but I really doubt that I'll be doing the same to Just Like Tiger Woods six months for now...if these contemporary lyrical winks were kept to a minimum, the songs would've no doubt enjoyed a lot more staying power.<br />So, despite the fact that the mighty Panther stood true to its warped artistic vision and delivered a great sounding album, it couldn't avoid the dreaded sophomore slump that plagued most 80s hair metal bands. If this was intentional, I have to tip my hat to the boys, since that would make them the greatest musical parody act in history... maybe their next logical career step should be breaking up in acrimony, becoming a VH1 regular and finally headlining Rocklahoma fifteen years from now... one can only hope.<br /><br />Update 24/04/2013: Almost a year and a half after writing this review, I'm still listening to the band's first album regularly, while this one's just gathering dust on a shelf.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|To me, this book had a very strong beginning, an OK middle and a bit of a dull ending. Where I gobbled up every word at the start of the book for the first few chapters, I started just reading to get to the end in the middle chapters, and then finally even started skimming the paragraphs instead of reading it in the last chapters. That being said, it's a pity, because I do think that Ransom Riggs has got a brilliant writing style, and I found myself highlighting quite a few sentences in this book. Just a pity the story ran a bit dull. (Loved the photos though...thought that was a brilliant idea)

This album reminded me of \\"Rated R\\" because of the blatant honesty Rihanna expressed in her songs. The Barbados beauty isn't afraid to depict her sexual desires, and the fans enjoy listening to them. The album seemed like a hybrid of genres. The first three songs were dance songs, while the rest felt like a mix of R&B with a tinge of island sound. I'd recommend purchasing the Deluxe Edition, the song \\"Red Lipstick\\" has a great dark sound to it.    I didn't give this album 5 stars for a few reasons. The first reason is that I was a bit disappointed with the song featuring Jay-Z. The last time Jay-Z was on a Rihanna album they collaborated on the smash hit \\"Umbrella,\\" so it's only fair that my expectations for their second collaboration would be extremely high, and these expectations weren't met. Secondly, the album seems to fall musically flat after \\"Birthday Cake.\\" The songs are good overall, but the sound seems similar from one song to another.I would have also liked to have heard more dance tracks. All the dance tracks on this album were amazing, especially \\"Where Have You Been,\\" and these tracks were what separated \\"Talk that Talk\\" from sounding like a \\"Loud\\" clone, so my complaint is that she should have added more.    All in all this album was great. I can't wait to see how it does and what songs she'll release as singles. Let's just hope that all the criticism she has received for being so open about her sexuality doesn't hinder her from being such an expressive artist.
B005HS00V4|5.0|I can't really see any Gabriel fan not liking this new twist on his music. A fresh version of many of his classics, plus some new covers(check out how he 'Gabrielizes' Paul Simon's Boy In The Bubble)Well shot,well edited, great sound, a real treat in my humble opinion. My only gripe? Does he have to thank the conductor & arranger half a dozen times or so? Hey Peter, they should be thanking you!
1451629184|4.0|I found this very insightful into the mind of an 11 yr old and the horror she experienced. You wonder how could this happen? Jaycee starts out telling you that she wrote this book and that it is in her own words so don't be expecting anything more. The obsession with animals was a little wearing, but that was a huge part of her life and your viewing her life as she sees it. I liked the journal entries and I really hope she is crossing off her to do list now that she has the freedom to do so. I read this book in one sitting and found myself glad that she was willing to write this book for other victims. I hope we can all be better about putting a stop to child abuse!
0385535139|4.0|It has been a while since i have read one of Grisham's books as I was dissapointed about the last few. But this one was (surprisingly good). Little bit predictable but a good easy read which moved along well.
B005SV9W4Q|4.0|The beauty of the Lady Gaga 'Born This Way The Remixes' is quite simply that it is a departure from the normal dance remix album. Think late hours, club after hour music at its best with highs and lows. The innovative remixes range from slow tempo to high energy, and are arranged so the album works as a whole. Original in its thought process and song placement. Despite several duplicate listings, variations on the songs manage to not derail the album. A pure high energy dance album... No! A dark mood to high energy album... Yes! A remix collection worth the price!
B005NF2UE6|1.0|I will start off saying that I used to be a Nickelback fan.  Nickelback has come out with some great songs and great albums in the past.  However, I'm afraid the downward spiral continues even further with this band.  Remember when rock bands were able to create rock songs that appeased both rock and top 40 fans with hits?  Songs like \\"1979\\" by The Smashing Pumpkins and \\"Better Man\\" by Pearl Jam enjoyed massive appeal for both rock and pop fans.  There are even good songs that have been recently released that can find both success on both genres such as \\"Lost In You\\" by Three Days Grace or \\"Hesitate\\" by Stone Sour.  When Nickelback released their massively successful hit \\"How You Remind Me\\" it became big on both rock and top 40 charts.  They were once able to have crossover potential with past hits like \\"How You Remind Me\\", \\"Rockstar\\", and \\"Saving Me\\".  However, that has now stopped for this band.  I feel that this trend of lets make half our album hard rock songs and the other half poppy songs to please both audiences is annoying and nothing more to retain popularity.  It kind of started with All The Right Reasons but really became even more so with their previous effort Dark Horse and now even more so with this album.  In my opinion, \\"When We Stand Together\\" has got to be the worst song Nickelback has ever created.  It is nothing but a generic twangy-pop song.  Not only that but the melody in the verses sound awfully similar to \\"All or Nothing\\" by Theory Of A Deadman.  I can't help but cringe every time when \\"When We Stand Together\\" comes on the radio knowing that this is the same band that got me into them in the first place with their first hit \\"Leader of Men\\".  Can you honestly say that \\"When We Stand Together\\" is on par with past hits such as \\"Too Bad\\", \\"Never Again\\", \\"Because of You\\", or \\"How You Remind Me\\"?  I don't see how, but anyways, I'm glad when I see bands find success with their music but to start making an album thinking, hey \\"Bottoms Up\\" is a pretty cool rock song for people to rock out to at the bars or strip clubs...but oh wait it won't be good for little kids as well and that we will write \\"When We Stand Together\\" and release them both as singles at the same time is uneven and, dare I say, selling out.  The same happened with their previous effort by writing light adult contemporary songs like \\"Never Gonna Be Alone\\" but writing sexually explicit rockers like \\"Something In Your Mouth\\" that some people may find inappropriate.  Now I am afraid Theory Of A Deadman, a group founded by Kroeger - go figure, is suffering from the same fate with their latest effort as well.  I know a lot of Nickelback fans will be displeased or angered by what I wrote in this review but it's just my opinion.  But going furthermore into the album itself, can you honestly say songs like the sexual rehash of \\"Midnight Queen\\" and the \\"I'd Come For You/Someday\\" sound-alike of \\"Trying Not To Love You\\" are that good?  I hope it's not just me, but it seems as if they want to constantly write about sex and drinking and also reuse older song melodies because they know those songs will make it big.  Nickelback know they could write songs about different topics once in awhile still can't they?  I thought \\"Something In Your Mouth\\" was catchy and good at first because it had a different sound but come on now, do we have to keep rehashing the same subjects in your \\"rock\\" songs.  I'm not offended at all by sexual lyrics but if that's ALL you feel you need to write about in the majority of your songs for the fact to continue to sell records then it does get annoying.  Does anyone remember great rock songs that contained different lyrics with different subject matter they put out in the past like \\"Just For\\" or \\"Where Do I Hide\\"?  Anyways... the only song that I really enjoy from this album is \\"This Means War\\".  \\"Don't Ever Let It End\\" is also a decent slower song.  Other than that, you will get songs like \\"Bottoms Up\\" which sounds like a sped up version of \\"Shakin Hands\\" or a slowed down version of \\"Animal\\".  Or also, how about \\"Midnight Queen\\" which is somewhat a lyrical rehash of \\"Something In Your Mouth\\".  On the plus side, one thing I do give them props though is for the fact that they can actually tune their guitars differently with songs like \\"This Means War\\" and \\"Gotta Get Me Some\\" to actually make them sound different from songs they have done in the past.  However, on an ending note, if you want to hear new material from Nickelback, listen to the samples first before buying the whole album.  I would much rather you save a little money and download the songs you find you'll enjoy listening to.  If you want to purchase a Nickelback album as a whole, I recommend their classics \\"Silver Side Up\\", \\"The State\\", and \\"The Long Road\\" which are great rock albums.  This album is far away from those and is not that good.  It seems these guys like to play it safe rather than take any risks.  Maybe if they experimented with their sound a little more instead of recycling song riffs/melodies it could be a breath of fresh air for these guys.
0071762345|4.0|There are many books about social media marketing that talk about how to maximize the company's reach to customers and frequency of contact by using social media as a tool. Likeable Social Media written by Dave Kerpen is different from those books in the way that it does not simply teach you how to use social media but also talks about theoretical importance of social media in terms of business marketing, with practical techniques and real examples of social media marketing conducted by companies.  First of all, what I like about this book is that each chapter concisely explains what companies/organization should do; and it does not only show what they should work at but also tells how to actually do it. For example, chapter 6 tells you to \\"Respond Quickly to All Bad Comments\\". Kerpen indicates how important it is to \\"communicate\\" with the customers by responding to every bad comment without ignoring it. \\"Respond Quickly to All Bad Comments\\" is indeed what you should aim at, but it is easier to say it than to actually do it. Understanding it, Kerpen gives you a tip to use Klout.com, which enables you to rank people depending on \\"how many friends and followers they have\\", and respond to more influential users on social media. Like this example, the other chapters also teach readers what companies should aim at while understanding marketing situations on social media platforms and providing them with specific tools and techniques that might facilitate them to achieve the aim.  All of the instructions for social media marketing in the book, for example \\"Listen First, and Never Stop Listening\\", \\"Be Honest and Transparent\\", and \\"Share Stories\\", can be summarized in what Kerpen emphasizes in this book, that is, \\"be human\\" in all social media activities - just \\"be likeable\\" as a person. He explains, to be a likable brand on social media you have to act like a person whom other people gather around at a cocktail party. Kerpen states that you treat customers in the way \\"you'd like to be treated\\" and you share contents that you would want to know are most important on social media. It sounds like a matter of course but companies can fail in doing so if they act on social media in the same way they do on traditional mass media. Kerpen points out companies should not \\"advertise\\" or \\"promote\\" in the way they do on traditional media; they should focus on \\"communicating\\" with consumers as one of the social media users. Companies are required to communicate differently on social media from traditional media because each of their activities on social media will be a component of their brand identities. I think his argument can be connected to what Nancy Baym says in her book, Personal Connections in the Digital Age, about users' identities on SNS: \\"very small pieces of information, which were often not intended to be sources of information about the self, can become inordinately influential\\" (Baym 120).When a company engages in social media marketing, they have to think how each of their efforts, such as responding to bad comments or even not responding to them, can contribute to their brand identity that will be constructed via social media.  One thing that I criticize this book for is that it primary focuses on Facebook marketing. All of his instructions introduced in each chapter can be applicable to other SNSs. And Kerpen sometimes talks about Twitter and Likedin too. But it seems that the tools and the techniques, which he explains readers can use, are more applicable to Facebook than the other social media. Baym would say, different kind of social media sites \\"provide different cues\\" which help users construct their identities (108). There might be different tactics that a company should focus on depending on different social media platforms in order to create a likeable identity.

1250004217|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down and it's a good reminder that the horrors of Nazi Germany were not contained within a specific geographic location, nor were they perpetrated only by Germans. We like to sit back smugly and place blame on some kind of monster in an event of this magnitude, assuring ourselves that \\"we\\" would never do what \\"they\\" did but, as this story reminds us, all of us are very capable of creating our own justifications.

1400052173|5.0|This book changed my life.  It makes you think on so many levels.  It is not only well written, (reads like a novel) it imparts so much information about growing cells outside the body and what cell study can be do to make our lives better. It also deals with the rights of patients to their bodies and testing using their body parts.  The author, Rebecca Skloot, has done her homework and put together a fascinating and thoughtful story that has you hooked from page one.  Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, has choosen this book as the book they will study for the entire school year 2011-2012.  \\"One book, One Northwestern\\".  This a book you shouldn't miss.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I tried an earlier version of this app a couple of years ago. I was unimpressed then and I'm even more underwhelmed now. I'm amazed that they've managed to make this app even less intuitive as time has gone by.    First of all, they don't follow app norms.  You may have to acknowledge a license agreement in many apps but it's usually a one click process. This app gives you several screens of read this, then read that, now give us your email address, blah blah.  What's worse is that as you navigate the unintuitive menus you keep running into the \\"Buy more features\\" nags. This will take you out of the program and to their website to buy features that should probably be in the \\"full version\\" already.  The main reason I didn't buy the app way back when is their lack of support for open document standards.  Despite their claims of \\"new improvements,\\" I don't see why they can't devote a small portion of their time to add .rtf/rich text support since there are plenty of open source filters they could use right now.  Now that Google Docs can do rich text format, it leaves no reason to even think of spending 15 bucks on this.
0307891402|2.0|I was expecting a \\"guide\\", instead I got an encyclopedia with almost too much information, as in \\"Spoiler alert!\\".  I purchased this guide along with the game so I wouldn't make a mistake early in the game and then regret it for the rest of the game. Well, it kind of helped.  BUT, there are a great nuber of spelling mistakes. Come on, run it trough a damned spelling checker before you send it to print, or just read the book once! English is not my mother-language so this review may have spelling mistakes, but even I find the spelling mistakes on the guide upsetting.  Then, the images in the book weren't edited in any way to make it easyer to see what's actually relevant on the image, and along with the small size of the images it totally defeats the images purpose. Why put the image of every preset look of every race? And then have a background which is not smooth but has many details in similar colors as the avatars? And in less than one square inch! Who do you think is going to select his avatar appearance based on the images in this guide? The images are usless and purposeless!  Finally, I don't know hwo to explain it clearly, but I only unpacked the book 3 days ago and already the sides of each page are expanding, like absorbing humidity. My house is NOT humid. In fact we have a firewood oven that stays on most of the day, so that can't be the real reason, can it? If I look at the book from a side, I can see waves forming, about half a centimeter wide (peak to peak).  So far, I can't say I'm happy with my purchase. I'd wait for a \\"second edition\\", or \\"the game of the year edition\\", where they correct the spelling and edit the images. It's just that I'm offended that they didn't take the time needed for the this two basic tasks you would expect from a \\"Collector's Edition Official Game Guide\\": clearing spelling mistakes and editing images to highlight their purpose. I actually feel cheated. I will be using uesp.net on a separate notebook as a reference instead ofthis book, since I can't safely <alt>+<tab> between Skyrim and an internet browser like I did with Oblivion.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is great! It fits my new kindle fire perfectly. Once I snapped it in place, I realized its definatly not going anywhere, which is reassuring. I was worried after reading the reviews, but I find it to be very light and compact, and could protect against minor drops and bumps. Additionally, using it as a stand works just fine. It is made to be used on a flat surface though, and probably wouldn't work on a lap. My only small complaint is that the felt covering the inner flap could be a bit higher quality. Overall I'm very happy with this cover :)
B006B31B80|2.0|After Season 1, I had high hopes for this season. Unfortunately, those have been dashed after the writers decided to have the cast settle into little house on the prairie so that they can all work out their emotions.   This season is floundering, and why did they think that basing the entire season around finding a single lost girl would be a good thing? Okay, we get it, you still think she has a chance. Unfortunately I don't think I can say the same thing about me coming back if there's a season 3.

B004EPYZPS|3.0|Just finished watching Super 8. There was a really slow buildup to the action part of the movie. The train wreck was really good and the special effects were amazing. My big problem was with the kids. I am sure they will grow up and be really great actors. They were written really bad parts for this movie. Why was there so much cussing and bad language by the kids. If you want a family movie be aware that the kids have bad language, are rude and nasty to each other,sneak out of home after midnight, and(while underage) steal cars and drive them. The kids came of annoying and in desperate need of discipline. I hate to sound that way but these kids were behaving in bad ways. They are being a bad example to other kids. Kids today are out of control and movies like this show them that it is ok to act this way. While some adults may just laugh at the way these kids acted in this movie, kids today need to be taught proper ways to behave. I was horrified at how these kids were talking to each other and acting out in public. This would have been easier to take if the actors had been in their late teens, but these kids were around 12 years old. In the late 1970's parents would not have allowed their kids to talk this way to other people and to the parents. Trust me I grew up in a small town in Ohio, where this film is supposed to be set. If you want a movie to watch for family night and want to set a good example for your kids and don't want to have to constantly explain that people shouldn't talk like that or do that, don't watch this movie. 12 year old kids shouldn't be cussing, stealing cars, setting explosives, driving the stolen cars, sneaking out of the house at night, and back talking their parents. This is not cute or funny. It is sad. I am really disappointed that Steven Speilberg put his name on this film.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Oh ... My ...  God!!!  I am reeling.  I am a deer in the headlights.  I think, if it were physically possible, I would like to sit here and re-watch this movie again, and again, and again, over and over for ..oh .. I don't know .. maybe ...  A MONTH OR SO.
0156027321|4.0|We are a group of four High School sophomores And we thought this book was fantastic. It was so realistic a couple of us thought this was a true story up until the very end. The beginning was very slow going though, as it set up the background information. The pace of the book started picking on once they boarded the boat to Canada.  As the story develops in was easy to get caught up in the emotions. As the events take place you are kept on your toes waiting for the next stinger.  This book will keep you on your feet Unitl the very end. You will never know what happens next. This is a riveting book with many twists and turns. The end is puzzling and keeps you thinking. We highly recomend this book.
1451627289|5.0|I am a sucker for time travel. I have read most of the \\"must reads\\" for that genre, except the \\"Dark Tower\\" series by King. My son, a Stephen King fan, is enamored with DT, and has told me I \\"have\\" to read it, but he also loves \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" by Anne Rice, and I just couldn't get into that one, so I will just stick to what I know. Having said that I will admit that Stephen King's horror is often a bit much for me. I loved \\"Bag of Bones\\" until the horror kicked in, but I do love \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" and \\"Green Mile\\", and cherish them as favorites. I eagerly anticipated the release of King's latest, a novel exploring time travel and the possibility of changing history on November 22, 1963, and felt that I could overlook the horror to get a dose of my favorite fantasy - time travel. I wasn't disappointed. Like many other reviewers on here, my productivity level dropped to zero while I was hungrily consuming this tale. I kept my Nook (sorry Amazon) with me at all times - in the laundry room, in the kitchen, at work at my desk, in my bed. Could this be harmonics? - my final pages coincided with a special about \\"The Lost Bullet\\", and one man's desire to know who fired that first shot, and what happened to it. As we were watching the re-enactments, John F. Kennedy, the First Lady, and Governor Connelly, were in the motorcade, traveling the streets of Dallas in time to the exact same thing I was reading! My heart was pounding during these final moments of Jake/George's harrowing attempt at changing the face of American history.  This book was long, but that was never a concern. I literally devoured the pages, while at the same time feeling sadness at approaching the end. To say I loved this book is an understatement. I can't wait for my husband to read it so that we can talk about it. I often just tell my husband the stories I read, as he's busy and not as much a reader as I am, but in this case, I want him to experience what I did. If you're on the fence about this book, or feel daunted by it's length, don't worry. Jump in! You will love everything about it - the nostalgia of life in the 50's and 60's, the wonderful characters that take up residence in your heart, and the easy-to-swallow history lesson that comes free!  My review title warns you to watch out for the \\"strings\\", and I can only say that you will understand that statement after you read it!  Enjoy!out this book, or feel daunted by it's length, don't worry. Jump in!

B005I6EU7U|2.0|Although this is a nice cover, it is not what I expected.  The \\"luxurious fabric\\" reminds me of my grandfathers naugahyde recliner.

B005C7SXMS|4.0|Submarine is the type of black comedy that takes you by surprise.   The protagonist, Oliver, played by Craig Roberts from the Being Human spin-off webshow, is not a nice character, nor is he likeable, and yet, the audience continues to watch his progress throughout this film. to say that the protagonist learns something throughout the ideal is to attempt to apply the regular Hollywood formula onto this film. Such a superstition would be a mistake.   This is a movie that doesn't predictably go where you'd expect, but that is not where it's funny bone lies. The humor in this film is that, like in life, one never knows where our paths may lead us.   Due in part to the sensibility of Roberts, as well as the witty dialogue, this film leaves an impression on you.   My favorite scene is when Oliver asks each of his parents who they are more likely to save in a fire - him or the other parent. The answer may surprise you. But what is more surprising is the kind of revelation that leads to about each character, their storyarc, and the viewer.   Go ahead, I dare you to ask that question of your loved ones. The answer may also surprise you.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I bought the Two Towers extended series right when they came out the year after the theater release and it was so exciting for me. To see those extra scenes and learn more about the characters was a lot of fun. Great idea for them to do this because there are so many followers of the books and movies. Expecially with The Hobbit coming out soon, those extra scenes do fill you in on some points that you wouldn't know unless you read the books. Great set!
B004EPYZTE|4.0|I must admit upon seeing the countless teasers and trailers last year I dismissed this as garbage and passed on a theater ticket. Afterall, Without Schwarzenegger, John Milius and the fact that the new Conan would have to cater to a generation of political correctness, it was doomed to fail at the box office. Thank God, I was wrong. Well kinda wrong. The violence is graphic, the battles are earsplittingly adrenalized, and Mr. Mamoa has plenty of muscle to flex and is no sweetheart pansy! Which is good, Conan was a barbarian, not a sweetheart. Maybe that's why it failed at the box office because it was supposed to be created for a generation that would rather 'occupy' than go out and fend for their self. If you are looking for high adventure and a brutally violent revenge tale you could do no better than Conan the Barbarian!
0439023513|4.0|Just finished Mockingjay.  Almost not sure how to react.  Wow.  This review doesn't really contain any big spoilers, but I wouldn't have wanted to read it or any other before I read the book.  Just so I could form an opinion of Collins and the series on my own.  So if you haven't read it yet, I'll say it's worth it, and read it first.  It's been said by other reviewers that those who were disappointed were hoping for a neat little packaged ending.  I won't lie, part of me was as well.  But that's the part of me that started reading the series as just your standard immensely popular young adult fiction.  Adventure, battle, romance, yada yada yada.  Which I think we all enjoy, which is, again, why part of me was hoping for a neat little packaged ending.  Throughout the series Collins reveals elements that are a bit too dark to be just the standard fare, however.  And Mockingjay does almost nothing but make us face the darker side of human nature, especially as Collins plows us through the dredges of the psyche of an emotionally tormented protagonist.  In the end, I was satisfied by the books, both what preceded and this one and its ending.  Collins obviously meant to make the reader deal a bit with what war is often like for those directly involved, and not whisk the suffering away easily with a picture perfect conclusion.  I thought the ending was appropriate and even happy.  In her own words, Collins leaves us with \\"the promise that life ... can be good again,\\" despite the terrors and emotional aftershocks of war.  And it's appropriate that her companion's unfailing love provides this.  The books kept me riveted, engaged, emotionally drawn in.  So 4 stars.  Why not five?  Well, I feel like the plot throughout the entire series, if not especially in the third, moved a bit too quickly for my liking, may not have been as well developed as it should have been, and the language could have been more expressive and meaningful.  But hey, it's young adult fiction.  Very goodfor what it is.
1439192812|2.0|I'm a fan of Dr. Dawkins, but this book is a sorry mish-mash. It strikes me that he (or more likely someone else) wrote it by covering Post-It notes with his favorite invectives against religion, and then printing out various Google searches, and then pasting it all together and calling it a book. It has no structure, it has no development, it has no plot to be sure. Just a laundry list of silly beliefs and lame counters of weak \\"reality.\\" More like reality TV. He never really explains \\"how we know what we know.\\" It just comes off as \\"my claims are better than their claims.\\"<br /><br />There's no new insight here (no insight at all, actually), just a thinly veiled attack on foolish things that believers believe. I agree with Dawkins' scathing opinions of religiosity, but I would have expected more from him than he delivered with this book. It doesn't belong in anyone's collection, believer or non-believer, but with Xmas approaching, my copy will soon belong in someone else's collection.

It's almost like there is a formula for writing a Secret Garden song and there can only be variations on that formula. Each song reminded me of another, older song. The music is still beautiful, but I was expecting something more novel and inspiring.

B005R4255C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy the Immortal remix.  I read that the idea was to highlight Mr. Jackson's voice on the tracks; and that is done very successfully.  The wonderful music is easily recognizable and the patterns and choices for remixes are genius.  Can't wait to see the Cirque show so I can put visuals to the music.  Highly recommend.
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 is a knockout.  Like most of the other reviewers, I've been a fan of Stephen King's books for a long time.  Having read, and enjoyed, most of the 50 titles King has put out, I can unequivocally say that this is the best he's done in years - and possibly ever.    Unlike nearly all of King's previous books, 11/22/63 is true speculative fiction, without any major side trips down horror lane. (BUT - readers familiar with his previous books are still given a nod to his horror past, with the sneaky references to IT and some other works.)  And, while King is mostly known as a horror writer, and a damn good one, sometimes his horror can be a bit weirdly distracting from the overall plot of his books.  This can be particularly true when he's not intentionally writing a horror novel (e.g., The Cell, Under the Dome).  In 11/22/63, however, he manages to impart suspense, humor and intrigue without making it creepy, bizarre or weird.  Which is just the right tone for a book dealing with such a sensitive subject (JFK's assassination).  There are some points where belief will obviously need to be suspended by the reader, but that's typical of any speculative fiction novel. And yes, there are some things that just don't make sense.  But for the most part, King does a nice job of tying together the lose ends.    11/22/63 is long book that's quick, heartfelt and enjoyable to read.  The romance in the book is lovely to witness, and the character development is thorough and deep.  You truly care about the main protagonist by the end of the book, as well as the minor characters.  Given the number of options for how this book could have concluded, King chose a good way to end things - the reader won't be disappointed.  If anything, the reader will be sad that it's over so soon.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I completely love Jillian Michaels, and like everyone else on here, her videos have totally changed my life. Amazing value for time and money, it really is possible to get a 20 minute workout that dramatically changes your body. Hooray!   The Shred is one of a selection Jillian does (and I'd advise you to buy them all and rotate if you can, they all have their own benefits). In between giving up carbs and doing The Shred five days a week in the mornings before work I've already lost a stone and a half (in about two months) and am losing more. She's so motivating, no stupid jokes and crap banter, she just gets on with it, urging you to push yourself harder, and giving you exercises to do that stretch and strain your body in all the right ways. Accept no substitutes, this is honestly the best range of fitness DVDs out there.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Couldn't wait till Christmas to listen to this CD. Have other CDs by Enya and know how beautiful her voice is and the instrumentals were amazing.  Love this CD - bought 2 (one for me, one for a gift)

B004SDSSFY|1.0|What I'm disgusted with is AMAZON themselves.  I installed the app store app, to get this office app and any future apps.  I have to login in, Fine.  Then it still doesn't allow me to download the file cause it wants me to use Mobile 1-Click ordering.  They say it makes it \\"easier\\" for ordering apps.  WHAT FOR?  I just logged in to you app store app.  Why do you want my #?  Does it have to do with the fact that installing your STORE APP requires to read you Phone state and identity?  What for?!?!  It's just an app to get more apps.  Why do you need to know my Phone State?  Doing a little bit of research I came across this  \\"needs to have that access so it can read the IMEI number of the phone for registration/activation purposes. It gets the IMEI from the phone's Telephony Manager API, and use of that API requires the \\"read phone state\\" permission.\\"  Why do you need this at all for activation purposes?  Again,  this is all big brother/sell you info to the marketing list people.<br /><br />I'd rather miss out on all the really good apps if it requires info like this.  It's scam like<br /><br />poor job Amazon.
B002TQ3OBU|5.0|I remember buying this at Progfest 96, based off the recommendations of someone there.  \\"It's like Wish You Were Here, but updated\\".  Is it?  Yes.  Does that suffice?  No.  Think about all the breathing room those fantastic 70s albums have, where you put on the album, lay back, and are transported... This Does That.  From Gilmore-like guitar licks to the overwhelming soundstage (hey, I can see my universe from here), you can see the influences.  But I don't care - PT is their own thing.  Listen to the later albums and you see the changes.  Listen to the prior albums and you see this coming.    But if you like even a little Pink Floyd, or a little bit \\"spacy\\" music, you owe it to yourself.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|Even though I found myself wincing at how many of the little details in Scott McCall's life as a high school werewolf seemed to match the parallel (flashback) stories in my Nick Lupo series of books, I found the so-called update of the 80s movie pretty entertaining. My books are a lot more graphic in every way (not Young Adult at all), but you can see where the series producers would like to break out and pile on the gore. All in all, the first season episodes I watched were engrossing enough to warrant a complete look at the season, though I plan to wait for DVD. If you are on board with the concept of a heroic, good-guy werewolf who doesn't much enjoy his \\"curse,\\" then you're halfway there. The delights in this series are the interactions between Scott and his all-too-well informed sidekick, Styles. Given the acceptable overacting and melodramatic teenage angst moments, the series still provides some pretty effective chills and a fair amount of grue. Also, I think the effects are better and more convincing than some current \\"bigger\\" network fantasy series. I will definitely tune in to season 2 to see what develops. But please, don't use up all the high school-related possibilities -- leave some for me!<br /><br />-W.D. Gagliani, author of WOLF'S EDGE (Samhain Publishing, Oct 2011)
B004EPYZTE|1.0|Just received my copy today and when I opened it the digital copy is for iTunes only, not for Windows Media Player. No where in Amazon's description does it list this. I would have never bought this title if I had known the DC was iTunes only.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of the Harry Potter books. Ms Rowling is a competent, sometimes inspired, story teller, but these books are largely devoid of any \\"literary\\" quality that might appeal to adults. This is understandable; one doesn't expect the quality of Evelyn Waugh or Cormac McCarthy from novels aimed at tweens and young adults. *<br /><br />The first two films, directed by Chris Columbus, are too light in tone (both dramatically and photographically), and (even in Harry's confrontation with Tom Riddle and the basilisk) fail to properly foreshadow the darkness that will descend. The criticism that they're \\"too much like the books\\" is valid.<br /><br />But starting with \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\", the films are better than the books. They show us what Ms Rowling could not (or chose not to) convey in words -- Harry & friends live an a world that doesn't have a guaranteed happily-ever-after ending. Indeed, the generally \\"adult\\" quality of the last six films is a compliment to the producers' good judgement. (Steve Kloves' economical and focused scripts also deserve praise.)<br /><br />The latter films get /so/ dark -- literally -- that a display with good shadow detail is recommended for maximum enjoyment. I don't know how much grain reduction was used (I saw no grain, at any time), but there's plenty of detail, and no visible edge sharpening.<br /><br />* An ex-boss of mine, an ex-English teacher, recommended them as being pretty good. I was disappointed that they were little more than entertaining.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I've purchased a lot of things from amazon.ocm - both directly and from other companies.  You would think buying the new Kindle from their site would be pretty easy and straight forward.  I was on this site this past Saturday...the site said to you want it by \\"Monday\\" then select one day shipping.  I was going to run up to the local Best Buy but decided I could wait until Monday.    1Well - here it is Tuesday and still do not have it.  Shame on you AMAZON.
B005GK6QSO|5.0|Wow, only one review?! Frontier Records needs to spend some money on advertising and get the word out on this album. I mean, this is about as perfect of a CD as you'll ever find. Ever so often, a band will put out a recording where everything just comes together, the songs, the production, and then that CD becomes the standard for which the fans hold the band to. Like: TNT's Tell No Tales, Dokken's Under Lock and Key, Dream Theater's Images and Words, Angra's Rebirth, or Harem Scarem's Mood Swings just to name a few. I know this CD is just a side project for these guys, but it's amazing none the less, and definitely sets a standard. For starters, you have Micheal Eriksen, who is easily one of the best metal singers currently in the biz, belting out the vocals on this CD. He's just one of those singers like Tony Harnell, Ray Alder, Sabastion Bach, Brad Delp or Steve Perry who just slay everything they sing. A real singer's singer if you will. Like I mentioned, this is melodic metal at it's best. Every song on here is killer, each one could be a single. Although this isn't prog metal, I think Circus Maximus fans can still appreciate hearing Micheal Eriksen sing in a more melodic straight forward setting that this CD presents. Don't get me wrong, I'm a prog fan, I love Circus Maximus, but being a product of the 80's, it's nice to hear some really great metal without all the odd time signatures, and all the other things that trademark prog metal. The guitar solos on this CD really deliver as well. It's the perfect combination of melodic choruses and blazing guitar acrobatics. So whether you're into melodic rock like Journey or Foreigner; melodic metal like TNT, Harem Scarem, the Russell/Jorn projects; or prog metal like Dream Theater, Symphony X, Angra, or Circus Maximus (obvisouly), just give it a listen and see why it's properly named The Magnificent
B001TW69J4|4.0|Definitely not a sophomore slump.  While there are no immediately \\"grab you and make you hum along\\" bits, the album is solid, and probably deeper (I'll know in another 50 listens).  The only problem I saw was some overly Meshuggah-ish bits.  \\"But, wait, I thought that was the whole first album!\\".  Yes, it's djent.  But the first album was as much about the shredding as anything Meshuggah did, while this one has a couple of songs (yes, I'm looking at you, \\"To Lead You To An Overwhelming Question\\") that are a bit more blatant about their inspiration.   Overall, a fine addition to the genre, and I like that it's not just AAL part 2.

1451648537|4.0|This book is a fantastic read despite its shortcomings, but purchasers should know what they are getting into.  This book will not tell you who Steve Jobs was as a man.  It will only tell you his story.  \\"Steve Jobs\\" is not an autobiography, it is a factual recitation, and that's a good thing.    Historians benefit from the ability to view events and people a bit more objectively than the contemporary biographer.  They write from a temporal and emotional distance.  That does not mean that they are perfect.  Historical biographers frequently become infatuated with their subjects.  For instance, you can't read \\"Truman\\" without realizing that after years of research David McCullough fell for Harry S. Truman and thus painted some of his flawed decisions in a favorable light.  Nevertheless, his careful and loving biography of Truman humanized the man in a way that Truman's contemporaries could not.  Isaacson did not enjoy McCullough's temporal and emotional distance.  After all, Jobs asked Isaacson to record his life story.  It was best, then, for Isaacson to relate the facts and leave conclusion drawing to others.  His attempt to do so lent the book a great deal of credibility.   Rather than writing from Jobs' perspective, Isaacson presents the book in a journalistic, third-person style.  He lists facts -- first Jobs' memories and then those of the other relevant parties.  When the stories conflict, Isaacson draws his own conclusion as to what really transpired, but he often leaves it to the reader to guess at Jobs' true motivations.  For instance, were the frequent crying bouts attempts at manipulation?  Were they signs of a disturbed mind, reflecting some hidden mental condition?  Both?  Neither?  Isaacson never answers.  He simply lays out the facts so that later generations can offer up a more meaningful analysis of \\"Jobs the man\\" thirty, fifty, or 100 years down the line.    Still, the book had some noticeable flaws.  It certainly would have benefited from a bit more editing.  As some other reviewers note, it feels like it was rushed out after Jobs' death. It is often repetitive and sometimes feels temporally disjointed.  Still, I highly recommend this book to others.  It's a unique opportunity to peak into the otherwise very private life of one of the modern world's most influential men.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I've been looking for an easy way to carry my ipod and this is it.  Very well made product.  I like that you can wear the armband or just clip the case on to your pants. Clear case is easy to assemble and use.  Love this product.

1451627289|5.0|I was a little ambivalent when I first heard Stephen King's latest involved time travel and what would happen if Kennedy had not been assassinated. Well very little has to do with the latter part but what King has done with the 'time travel' concept is commendable.<br /> Jake Epping is one of many great characters. The trip back to Derry brought back a lot of scary memories from previous thrillers. The originality and ideas put into this story is only something one will get from King. How the past can be obturate and does not want to be changed is played out well as the main obstacle to the journeys played out.<br /> Great read from beginning to end.
B005N95JA4|4.0|There's little about \\"Some Girls\\" that hasn't been said already.  Essentially, it's the last great Stones album, although I would argue that \\"Tattoo You\\" should hold that title rightfully.  Nonetheless, \\"Some Girls\\" has been given the \\"Deluxe\\" treatment and it doesn't disappoint.  The remastering is crisp, clean and sounds terrific.  No major revelations here, just a really excellent remaster of a musical masterpiece (IMHO). Yeah, I know, some folks are complaining about the ostensibly inexplicable exclusion of the extended version of \\"Miss You,\\" but I could care less.    The real surprise here is the bonus disc.  I'm a Stones fan of long-standing, but am not obsessed with them ... so, virtually all of the material on the bonus disc is new to me. Much of it is fresh and exhilarating, showing an emphasis on country music influence. Apparently, some of the tunes on the bonus disc were unfinished in '78 as the Stones concentrated more on the final tunes appearing on the main album. So, Mick and company went back into the studio some 30 years on to finish 'em up to make them \\"release ready.\\"  While this may offend some purists, it doesn't bother me at all.  I'm really diggin' the bonus material (despite the freshening up) as it's stuff originating from a time when the Stones were at the top of their game. The synergy between Keith and Ronnie heard on the bonus material, particularly on tunes like \\"Keep Up Blues,\\" is worth the price of admission.    All in all, I like this package a lot.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I was searching for s media player to play movies and photos in my Kindle Fire, by streaming from my desktop computer. This app does exactly what I was looking for.

B00005MCWZ|3.0|Early Hawkwind. Okay if you're of a mind for some classic contemplative Hawkwind dirge-groove but mostly it falls short to my ear. However, the opening track \\"Hurry on Sundown\\" is simply one of their best and for me that alone is worth the price of the CD. There's a bonus version of that same song later in the album but it's only so-so.

B001O54NL2|4.0|Christopher Cross stormed onto the musical scene in 1979 with this debut album, garnering 4 Top 40 hits and 4 big Grammy awards.  After that, he managed only one more smash--the Oscar winning theme from \\"Arthur.\\"<br />SAILING and RIDE LIKE THE WIND are two great songs and have stood the test of time.  The other tracks are good pop tunes and Cross has an A-list of background vocalists including Michael McDonald, Valerie Carter, Don Henley and JD Souther, and quality studio musicians.<br />I enjoy this album but its not a regular on my playlist, but still has merit in the transitional move from disco to melodic music.
0062112430|5.0|Where oh where do I begin! Let me say that based on the description from goodreads I wasn't too excited to read this book. I put it off because I was afraid it was going to be boring and simplistic; boy am I eating my words. This book was completely different than anything I've read and it wasn't just some lame hokey love story. And trust me even though you think you have the story figured out, there's a few plot twists and surprises bound to make you shed a tear or two ;) READ THIS BOOK!
0385738773|5.0|This final book in The Maze Runner trilogy picks up right where The Scorch Trials left off. Thomas is in a white padded room, contemplating something interesting...<br /><br />\\"It was the smell that began to drive Thomas slightly mad. Not being alone for over three weeks. Not the white walls, ceiling and floor.\\"<br /><br />James Dashner definitely brought his A game back when writing The Death Cure. All the minor things that annoyed the heck out of me in The Scorch Trials was smoothed over by the fabulous writing and story-telling in this conclusion. It was an amazingly awesome wrap-up to this exciting and enjoyable series.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, because I know nothing ruins my day more than stumbling across a nasty spoiler that drives me crazy for days on end...but I just have to say that I absolutely adore a writer who is not afraid to kill off main characters if and when it needs to be done. And to do it right! I mean, not just kill them to get a reaction, and not just for a matter of convenience sake, but because this character MUST die for things to be right with the world, and the story (if that even makes sense to you...it does to me...at least in my head...).<br /><br />That comradeship that was built in The Maze Runner comes back into play in The Death Cure and you see, and feel, how important these relationships these characters have built with each other are, and how fragile they can become when push comes to shove. You care about these characters and what can, and does, happen to them. They are almost like family now!<br /><br />The chapters, as always, were kept short, yet involved, which keeps the readers interested and coming back for more. Overall it was an amazing story that I am glad I got the opportunity to read and review. The ending cleared up almost all outstanding issues and I was really impressed with the series as a whole.<br /><br />I recommend this book, and this series, to everyone!
B000026FGW|4.0|A must for the Motörhead library. Solid studio work including some classics from the boys and if you're new to the band this provides a window to an earlier era. And if the title track doesn't bring a tear to your eye you're already dead.

B004132I20|4.0|Sherlock Holmes is such an iconic character in English literature that any attempt to adapt his stories away from a strict duplication of the originals is likely to raise the ire of purists (and there are a lot of purists out there!).  So I have to admire the moxie of the producers, writers, and actors of this series for trying something very new: bringing Holmes into the 21st century, making him younger than you might expect, and altering many of the peripheral characters to make them more interesting and/or believable in a 21st century context.  Naturally, any Holmes series must rely on the actors playing Holmes and Watson. Benedict Cumberbatch is ideally cast as Holmes - he can play manic Holmes when \\"the game is on\\" (not \\"the game is afoot\\" - perhaps an afront to purists, but really, who says \\"afoot\\" these days?).  He can also play bored laconic Holmes, the one who became addicted to drugs out of boredom.  Similarly, Martin Freeman brings a sharper and more realistic edge to Watson - a combat doctor discharged from Afganistan (just like the literature Watson) with post-trauma stress disorder who keeps a blog (the modern updates).  Instead of following Holmes around to ask for explanations he is a little prouder, a little more aggressive, and brings his combat experience to bear on at least one occasion in this first series.  There are updates in the other characters as well - Lestrade is probably more competent, Mycroft Holmes is a member of the government (instead of being the more brilliant but extremely lazy layabout of the books), and Moriarty - well, I hate to spoil the surprise the writers lay out for the viewers so not more will I say about him.  We do get a couple new characters - a girlfriend for Watson (who is married in the later stories, but she's introduced earlier here), and a technician at the morgue who has a crush on Holmes that's obvious to everyone but Sherlock himself.  So, the characterizations are good, but most of the fun of Sherlock Holmes is the setup of the problem and how it is solved using his superior analytical skills.  I thought the writers might have been able to have some fun taking shots at CSI-style investigations (e.g. Lestrade being flummoxed by a case simply because there was no DNA evidence), but then, Holmes himself has always embraced scientific methods.  Luckily, the plots are very engaging.  If there is a failing of the show, it is in the format - Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the stories more-or-less organically, and they ended when Holmes solved the case. In a given network time slot, a couple of the shows needed to be dragged out artificially to fill up the time (we expect Holmes to quickly solve his puzzles, after all).  There was also the slightly disctracting fact that one serial killer's puzzle is identical to a scene from the Princess Bride (I kept expecting the killer to say \\"Inconceivable!\\").    But, all in all, I'd recommend the series to Holmes fans, and I'd further suggest that this is simply good television that most people would enjoy (it's not family-friendly, though).  The Blu-ray has a few extras, the most interesting being the original pilot, which was much-improved upon for the series premier.  It's neat to compare them.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Love this case for my Kindle Fire.  Has a great, classy look too it and protects the Fire well.  It's a bit of a tight fit to get the Fire into the elastic straps but I think that is a good thing so you don't have to worry about it falling out of the case.  Definitely a great case for the Fire.

B005KN5AES|5.0|Immortal Soul is one of the best releases in 2011 in this genre. The original Thundersteel Line-Up seems to have the right recipe to make another killer album. Tony Moores voice is insanely good and he hits the notes without any problems, just like 23 years ago. This album shows that the good old legacy of RIOT is still intact. And that all 5 are fabulous musicians, who have created a fantastic master piece!! Some bands are just meant to be still out there - all others, please step aside!  Difficult to even pick a favourite song - but if I have to... its Still Your Man, and Riot...and Wings Are For Angels...and..well, that's what I mean. Every spin results in another favourite - so I guess - I love them all!   Strong buy for anyone, that loves Metal, Heavy Metal, Power Metal and anything that kicks ass!
0385534639|4.0|In \\"The Night Circus,\\" first-time author Erin Morgenstern tells the story of Celia and Marco, two gifted young magicians, who have been enmeshed into a rivalry from their childhood and the wonderful, dazzling circus that is their backdrop, through the machinations of either their fathers (in Celia's case) or a mysterious benefactor.  The novel follows them through childhood through their early adulthood, when they meet and, inevitably, their magical duel begins.   The narrative structure is intriguing - one of the few books I've read from multiple points-of-view that really engaged me.  The imagery is exquisite, appealing to all of the sense - and the side characters well-developed and interesting.  It is not a novel to be rushed, rather, one to be read slowly and savored.  The pace is slow and deliberate, and, as other readers have mentioned, may seem to drag a bit in the middle.  If I had one criticism, it is that I felt the sense of urgency around the climax was a bit lacking.  One major issue seemed to come a bit out of nowhere, and I felt as though the pace should have sped up a bit.  Also, I would have appreciated a bit more clarity around \\"the big reveal\\" and a bit more backstory surrounding the rivalry.  This is, however, a wonderful book and one I plan to buy.  I will definitely keep my eyes open for future works by the talented Ms. Morgenstern.

0439023521|5.0|This book far exceeded my expectations. Reviews were mostly praise, but I was a little reluctant to start a young adult series, as I am 27. I could not have been more wrong. The series was riveting, exciting, and emotional. The first book particularly was action-packed and fast-paced. Katniss is a well-developed character and the unfolding of events in the arena play out very well. Highly recommend!
B0041KKYGA|1.0|The question of the authorship regarding the \\"first folio\\" is a very valid one.  So when a SFX bonanza director takes camera, crew and cast in hand to create one of the most appalling addresses of the issue, one cannot but wonder what possessed him to even consider making the script in the first place.  The whole thing smacks of a paranoid fantasy gone awry.  As if someone took a syringe of \\"paranoid serum\\" and injected it into the celluloid or hard drive upon which the images were gathered.  It's as if the screenwriter and everyone else on the bandwagon of questioning the authorship decided to get in on the joke and make a farce of a film that plays up to every conspiracy hack's nightmare come true.  The technical merits of the film are fine, but the trouncing of beliefs by the critical thinkers who wonder if William Shakespeare actually penned the plays and poems he did, is taken to new heights of \\"I am an actor, believe in the emotional correctness of my position... therefore I am, and anybody who challenges that, is dead wrong, and unworthy of consideration\\".   I mean, wow.  The idea of wanting a confident persona to play a part for a stage play or film is all well and fine, but when those people substitute critical analysis for emotional hubris, one can't help but be glad that they are not mathematicians, detectives, judges, lawyers, chemists, physicists, engineers of all stripes, and any other career that requires left brain conviction in facts and the mechanisms that churn those facts to present truth.  One truly is glad of that.  But a person wonders, have any of them really considered the arguments, or are they just there trying to garnish yet another set of praises and appeal for the sake of a stroke of ego and dollar signs?  Probably the later.  The research is too long and boring, and challenges the emotional investment they have and that of their friends.  It's a very incestuous relationship being in a theatre troupe, because no one wants to be confronted with the cold hard logic of \\"you're wrong\\".  Because the minute you do that, you tear away at their being.  So it is with this film.  A piece of cinematic trash created to draw out the lunatics of society who believe that Edward De Vere by himself penned all the great literary works of our time.  And that William Shakespeare was nothing more than a whoring buffoon with money on his mind.  The amount of effort that went into this production is phenomenol.  But alas, it is for naught (oops, did I mispell a word?  Naughty me), as the obligatorily and mercifully free from intelligence and analysis thereof, have taken camera, lights, sets, stage and location in hand, and created a visually appealing, but substance-lacking, cinematic experience.  Me, I think I would've preferred to rent \\"Porky's\\" than watch this drivel again.  A real piece of cinematic trash that belongs on the ash pile of history.  Having worked with and known many actors (including some current coworkers) I'd like to think that any person, regardless of their walk of life, their vocation, profession, avenue they've taken, will stand on their own two feet and say \\"You know, I wonder about this subject, and I just don't really know, but here's what I think...\\"  Yet, born and bread to be inserted into a clique and servitude of social popularity, those involved with the film, save one man, will not.  They will don their skills, \\"act\\" as if outraged that the truth has been with held for nearly a millennial, and then smirk to those who believe in them that the \\"crazies\\" have finally had their say with their piece of work.  Could a production team be any more insulting?  Skip this film.  It's trash.
0374532990|5.0|For anyone who has been to the High Line or who plans to visit -- BUY THIS BOOK!  It's an unusually candid account about how this wonderful park came to be.  Robert Hammond and Joshua David provide enormous detail about the who, what, when and why, and the importance of serendipity.  I loved the part about how they met. Their book is as unique and interesting as the place itself.  It's an inspirational story about how \\"ordinary\\" (well... not so ordinary in my mind) citizens, despite enormous hurdles, created a place which has become so important to the neighborhood and the entire city.
B002BWP49C|3.0|After waiting a year to see this film, I think the anticipation caused me to feel a bit let down after finally seeing it.  So I saw it a second time to be fair...same feeling.    There are some good and bad things about this movie.  I am sure I will watch it when it comes out on DVD a hundred times, because I'm a big fan of the series...but eclipse so far was the best movie by far for me.  There are differences from the books, some I liked, most I didn't.  First, the pros..  I like how they handled the birth scene, very tastefully done.  It was actually my favorite scene of the movie, watching Bella's transformation.  Very well done!  I loved the wedding scenes, the setting and gown were gorgeous and appropriate, but they cut the vows down to almost nothing...it was over too soon for me.  And then I had to sit through stupid little reception toasts that were not in the book, and added nothing to the film.  The honeymoon scenes were handled really well...but there was no mention that Edward was also a virgin...in fact they kind of implied he wasn't....and the fact that he is, and that he's never experienced sex, is kinda the whole point of why sex with Bella would be so dangerous for her...he has absolutely no idea what to expect, so he can't know if he'll be able to keep control and not hurt her.  It was really cute when Bella was trying to tease Edward...although inaccurate from how it happened in the book.     The cons...  Well, I already mentioned some because they tainted the good parts... but here are more....  They totally cut out the mercedes scene at the gas station...  And believe me, this movie needed some lightening up that scene would have provided.   Since when does Jacob get to see what Reneesmee is going to look like as an adult, just because he imprinted on her?    Why did Bella look like she was almost in physical pain going down the aisle?  Even when she saw Edward standing there, she still looked like she might run until the actual vows were said.Ok, she was supposed to be nervous, didn't really want the whole wedding thing...but she wanted this guy...this was her future...they took the nervous nellie bit too far in my opinion.  The scene where Jacob breaks from the pack is all done \\"in wolf\\". You hear their human voices, but you just see the wolves...ok, major screw up here because that's not how it was done in the prior movies, so it just didn't sell to have it that way in this movie.  And it came off stupid and silly, totally unbelievable.  The wolves in general were done poorly in this movie...they were far more believable in New Moon and Eclipse.  Watching the wolf scenes for me was like trying to choke down a tough piece of an otherwise edible steak.  The movie kind of dragged for me compared to the others.  I think it's because they dragged out so much of the action to have the movie end with the birth scene.  That was a big mistake in my opinion...cause there is now so much to tell in part 2 that we are going to get jipped on the best parts of the book in part 2.  My favorite part of this book was after Bella becomes a vampire,and outside of her opening her eyes at the end of her transformation, that's all you get of Bella as a vampire in this movie.  It's like they served you the appetizer and forgot the main course! Would it have killed them to end on a pleasant note, say that scene Alice envisioned of them running together in the forest?    And the Avatar eye scene...didn't need it Mr. Director!  This isn't Avatar where shock affect wins you over..this is TWILIGHT and the romance is what wins us over!  And what was the whole end bit with the Volturi about?  Aro may want something the Cullens have, but that's not in the book...and he doesn't even know about the baby until later...so this ending makes no sense at all to me.  This movie is for die hard Twilight fans only...anyone watching this purely for the entertainment value of the movie itself will be very dissapointed.  They only included thefirst third of the book to make this movie...so we got cheated on this one.  And worse, they are now going to have to try and tell the last 2/3rds of the book in part 2...so my hopes are not high for that one either.  Overall, I am disspointed. This was my favorite of the book series.  And my least favorite of the movies.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's been awhile since I've read Stephen King.  Reading this book was like meeting up with an old friend; you are at ease, the voice is familiar, and you can't wait to hear what they've been up to.  Of course, THIS friend keeps you on your toes.    I had to keep slowing myself down to enjoy the writing, because I wanted to rush ahead to see what happened next.  Thank you, Mr. King, for another fascinating world to explore.
B000002HAJ|4.0|No longer an up-and-coming post-punk band pushing its way into the mainstream in 1987 with two hits from a double-release through exposure gained by the heavy rotation of its two hit singles on MTV (\\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\"'s \\"Just Like Heaven \\" and \\"Why Can't I Be You\\"), by the time 1992 arrived, The Cure was arguably one of the most universally recognizable groups within the realm of the alternative music genre, thanks to the massive critical and commercial success spawned by the release of \\"Disintegration\\" in 1989.  Considered their masterpiece, \\"Disintegration\\" integrated massive, overlayered washes of synthesizer with heavily processed, interlocking guitar lines possessing such a level of depth to the production that it remains one of the most sonically lavish recordings I have ever heard, supporting lyrical content that dealt with some of the most universally troubling mindsets and emotions a human being could experience. When the time came to record again, what would the new Cure release sound like? A continuation of \\"Disintegration\\" `s  intense, gloomy, atmospheric sound and depressing lyrical content ? Or would Robert Smith return to the subversively poppy melodies and arrangements embraced on \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\"?   But \\"Wish\\", released in '92, proved to be something of a mutated hybrid between the previous two releases. Sure, the lyrics toy with some of the most universally alienating, wistful, regretful, self-loathing, isolated emotions that he's ever expressed (\\"To Wish Impossible Things\\", \\"From The Edge Of The Deep Green Sea\\", \\"Apart\\", \\"Cut\\" and \\" A Letter To Elise\\") , but some of their most upbeat-sounding tracks are included as well, with \\"Friday I'm In Love\\", \\"Doing The Unstuck\\",  and \\"High\\" carving out a poppy pathway.( \\"A Letter To Elise\\" actually moves along in a buoyant musical direction, but it contains qualitatively depressing lyrical content).   Some critics and fans savaged the band for including cuts as \\"commercial\\" and \\"happy-sounding\\" as \\"Friday I'm In Love\\" on \\"Wish\\", but it's my own personal opinion that the band needed to provide periodic respites from the otherwise relentless onslaught of the more self-indulgent lyrical content and somewhat menacing sound. Another crucial separation point from \\"Disintegration\\" is the aggressive emphasis on a guitar-driven sound, rather than the atmospheric and evocative wash of keyboards that appeared to serve as just as much of a focal point for the band's sound as Smith and Thompson's heavily processed guitar lines; \\"Wish\\" retains a much heavier edge than \\"Disintegration\\" as a result, though there is also real depth to the production values.    Now if you're coming  to \\"Wish\\" expecting an extension and refinement of \\"Disintegration\\", you're probably going to wind up experiencing severe disappointment. I know a number of people who were initially \\"disgusted\\" with the direction that the Cure chose to pursue on \\"Wish\\", but many of them had used \\"Disintegration\\" as their entrance point. \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\" was my first Cure purchase, and though I didn't snag a copy of it until  after \\"Kiss Me...had been out for a couple of months,  I'd heard several singles from \\"Head On The Door\\" in regular rotation on our local college radio station, so \\"Wish\\" wasn't an unpleasant surprise, and in fact, was a minor revelation, and an enjoyable listen. I recently replaced my original copy, and have renewed my appreciation for it, as well as mourning it as the last of the truly strong Cure releases. I would definitely recommend it, but do yourself a favor and purchase it after \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\", \\"Head On The Door\\", and `Disintegration\\".
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I am a high school counselor and hear things like this book all day long, yet this books takes everything I have heard and puts it in one book. *spoiler* First no other guy will date you if you are living in someone else's house. Second, no hormone driven college boy will let you sleep in his bed more than a night without trying something unless he is gay.I find the story hard to believe.  That being said, it is a good story with likable characters, if you are a high school girl dreaming of college. However this is fiction and not real life. For adults who like to read romance skip this one unless you are ready for a romance that can happen only in fiction.

B0054N73EY|2.0|Let me say that I have always been and always will be a HUGE RHCP's fan. I have been since I first heard them in the late 80's early 90's.  There music has been the soundtrack of my life sustaining me like food, uplifting me with the funk, and taking me to a place where weirdness and funky dirty and raw organic rock guitars ooze out from the speakers and the music blazes from the amplifiers in a smoky dark nightclub where the crowd slinks and bounces to the red hot funkiness and sexy ladies dance about in a bacchallian festival around a bonfire in a tribal trance. All the while Flea is jumping around like a madman and layin' down some serious Bass lines, and John is playing psychedelic Hendrix mixed with funkiness, and Anthony is Rappin and rockin like it ain't nobodys business.<br />This is the old RHCP spirit. But this new album makes me feel a little sick to the stomach.  So many catchy, radio-friendly tunes scrunched into one record it will make me vomit. Disco Beats?  Disco Beats!!!!! are you kidding me?<br />Chorus line hooks that are so blatantly obvious that you would think they are trying to catch a whale of a pop fish its ridiculous, We should change the  bands name to match their new sound- instead of RHCP it should be M.S.C.P  ( mildly spicy chilli Peppers).  or Radio Hosts' Chilli Poppers.  Lol. or in my opinion For cryin' out Loud. I hope not too many people buy this record so as not to encourage the boys to continue down this POP path. Yo, Chilli's,  whatcha doin?  I know you lost your Brotha in music Mr. Frusciante, but I hope Y'all throw this record away and do not even tour behind it, Just get back to your roots, man! take a break ,regroup, why dont ya get Dave Navarro back in the band, he was Badass.  Anyhow, I will now go and listen to By the Way or Stadium or better yet Blood Sugar Mellowship fellowship and wait for the Band to get back to the Funk!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Nice display, holds it either vertically or horizontally.  Seems to be made of sturdy material. Nice case for the money!

B004SBBDB2|3.0|It is genuinely hard to find anything to say about this other than, \\"Wow! It's a cable!\\"  My personali experience with it is that it's a cable that allows you to connect your iPod, iPod Touch or iPad to a television. This is exactly what it is and, provided it is made correctly and the connection is implemented correctly at the iPod end and at the TV end, it should work. This means that all you can really say about it is extraneous to any examination of the thing itself. If it doesn't work on your TV, check the cable, then check your TV then check what people in internet forums are saying about Apple (the company that did *something* that made certain aftermarket wall-warts stop working a few years ago) and how well its products fair when connected to what you have.  It took a lot of wrestling to find what to say about this, but at the end of the day, it's a cable to connect an i-device to a television. It replaces an Apple product, it's a nice shiny black instead of that moonsuit white favored by Apple designers and, not only does it replace a moonsuit white Apple product, it does it for ten dollars less than the thing in the really cool packaging.

B000007VCM|5.0|Every rock fan has purchased an album where they like a few songs, but don't care for many of the others.  \\"Love\\" is not one of those albums.  Every song is good enough to listen to without skipping, and if you listen carefully, you can hear musical influence from many different styles of rock.  In fact, you might be reminded of artists like U2, Pink Floyd, The Doors, and others.  The Cult managed to create an iconic sound of their own while still retaining musical influence from other artists.<br /><br />Most people have been drawn to The Cult thanks to radio hits like \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\" or the later hit \\"Fire Woman\\".  But this album is worth owning because every track is great.  A nice surprise on this album is the track \\"Brother Wolf, Sister Moon\\", which is a slower paced song but it remains edgy and mysterious.<br /><br />I could go on forever, so I'll just repeat myself one last time.  If you enjoy the most popular tracks from The Cult, you will not regret owning this album.

1439153663|4.0|This is the December selection for my book group, and I have to say that I found it difficult to put down. It became one of my faster reads, because I became so invested in the story. Were there some things I found frustrating? Yes. There were answers I never really figured out, and the behavior, or lack of it, in some of the characters, including one of the narrators, drove me crazy. But I learned a great deal about the period, and as I said earlier, I became immersed in the story and could not put it down. I would definitely recommend \\"The Kitchen House\\" to anyone with an interest in historical fiction.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I saw this film in theaters and absolutely loved it; I purchased the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy a week ago and was ecstatic to rewatch the film. The video and audio quality is superb and the bonus features (though seemingly fewer due to the eventual Ultimate Edition) add great insight to the film. The Digital Copy in fact does work (even though it apparently expired in September) and I'm downloading it as I type this. \\"Deathly Hallows Part 1\\" is a great installment to the film series and I'm glad I have it in my collection. And at the current price, it's a no brainer to purchase it.
B005POK858|5.0|I just finished the game and I must say that it is awesome. The game allows you to keep playing after the first quest is completed. Unlike other reviewers, I experienced no problems with this game on my Droid X. I am pleased with my experience with this game  and will be looking for other titles from this developer.
B000002GDJ|4.0|\\"Reggatta De Blanc\\" is probably one of the best definitive musical albums for The Police.  Unlike their first album, this one pays more homage to their Carribean musical influences without quite as much punk rock flavor.  That does not mean that the rock sound is gone, but Andy Summmers' guitar sound seems to have a wider range this time.  The island sound is particularly noticeable on the tracks \\"Walking On The Moon\\", \\"Reggatta De Blanc\\", and \\"Bed's Too Big Without You\\".<br /><br />A funny and enjoyable surprise on this album was Stewart Copeland's track \\"On Any Other Day\\", in which he is the lead vocalist, songwriter, and drummer.  Copeland's sense of humor is one of a kind.<br /><br />This album is a must-own for any new Police fan.  They have not created any \\"bad\\" albums, but this is one of the first ones to listen to.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I used to wake up in the middle of the night, toss and turn for at least a couple of hours before I was able to go back to sleep again. Tried sleeping pills, but ended up with a stuffy head the next day. Since I used this app, after I wake up in the middle of the nights, it really helped me relax and clear my mind so I was able to fall back asleep much faster. I have felt great the next day. It has so many sounds to choose from. It is definitely better than a sleeping pill!
0316067598|5.0|This book was simply amazing. While it starts a bit slow, these early stories of humility and training are required to help us better understand why these SEAL's did what they did and thought how they thought.  After reading several reviews for the past 30 minutes or so, it would seem that the biggest issues with the book deal with the \\"blaming\\" of the Liberal Media on the deaths of the SEAL's and rescuing force. While I do agree that it would be tough to actually hold them accountable, it seems almost unimaginable to not take into consideration that they may actually play a role in how these soldiers think and act. It was stated that based of ANY military handbook or training they had received, they should have acted one way; however had seen how the media reacted to such situations for the past 4 or 5 years and had to worry about us, thus greatly affecting their decisions in the end. With knowing what we now know after reading, how could you contradict that in any way? For nearly a decade, we have seen movies such as Fahrenheit 9/11 or The Green Zone or Jarhead and had to deal with these situations that paint our government to look like liars and murderers. That decide to not attack the TERRORISTS and DICTATORS, however attack our own right here. Hey, it's America. Free Press, Free Speech. I get it, believe in it and will defend it forever. So in that case, why is it so terrible to hear it from the other side as well?  The book is not as much about our government and our policies, or how we should have acted in certain situations. While yes, that is brought up, it is clear that the story is more about just a few proud Navy SEAL's with a love for their country, as well as a warming side to the Afgani people. Enough with the political garbage. It's a book about heroism and courage, not about whether we should or should not have been at war in the first place.  Amazing book. An excellent and easy read. I have recommended it to all my friends and lent out my hardcopyand audiobook. I hope you all enjoy the read!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I've just completed reading this fast-paced and devastating book at a time when (Nov. 22, 2011)the subprime mortgage mess has reached a peak with mounting foreclosures, huge government deficits caused by bail outs, and bonus dollars pouring into the laps of the 1%. Lewis has clear explanations for the crisis: rating agencies bought off, regulators misled, the public hornswaggled, and the Wall Street banks running amok, placing confusing labels on poorly understood products without disclosing their enormous risks, and then betting against their own products and their own customers. It's indeed a casino, but one where there are no monitors. As Lewis explains in an endnote, Wall Street disdains regulation in good times but wants a bail out when the going gets tough. It's too bad that the present administration hired on so many Goldman Sachs veterans and didn't simply allow the bankruptcies to pile up.

B0065AMQKG|1.0|I've been a Nickelback fan since 2001 and I can easily say this is by far there worst album yet! This is pretty much the same old Nickelback except on this album all the heavy tracks sound the same and all the soft/radio friendly ones also sound way to similar. I was very disappointed with the lake of creativity with the lyrics on every song, very dull and boring (we get it Chad, you like to sing about oral sex don't need to hear it on every song). Every time I've listened to their albums in the past at least one song will really jump out at me and catch my attention but not on this album. I can honestly say \\"When We Stand Together\\" is the only song I actually like (Bottoms Up is ok nothing special). This album is definitely not what I was hoping for, wanted to hear something like \\"For All the Right Reasons\\" in my opinion there best album from top to bottom.

B003UMW68O|5.0|Good classic children's movie. There are a couple of scenes where young children might be a little scared especially right near the start where there is the \\"room simulator\\" and also back in the simulator when Sully gives a scare demo. My son who is a year and a half really enjoys it, but was a little scared during the scenes I mentioned and seems to dislike Randall instinctively.
B00001ZWTT|2.0|During the 1990's, Will Smith was getting started on his major career as an actor. He was featured in the television sitcom Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. I'll admit, I was never too fond of the show, however any time it came on while flipping through the channels, I would leave it on because of how funny Smith was. Anyway he soon starred in the film Men In Black, which was a big success and is what got him jump-started on his major career.  With all of that in mind, in 1999 he starred in a film known as Wild Wild West. As a kid, I had no clue there was originally an old television show in the 60's called Wild Wild West that the film was loosely based on. I later learned from my parents while at Universal Studios in Hollywood, CA when we were sitting watching one of the attractions, which was a live-action Wild Wild West reenactment, which blew my mind away. (it may have been Knott's Berry Farm, I don't remember)  But anyway, this is about the movie with Will Smith. There isn't really much to say, other than this will probably go down as the ONLY western film Smith will have ever done.  The story and plot is decent, nothing new or spectacular, but good enough for a movie such as this one. Minor sub-plots such as the one concerning Salm Hayeks character seem out of place, but then again it's the \\"Damsel in Distress\\" that it's supposed to be portraying, however executed horribly. The acting is not great. As stated, I've seen Smith in almost every film he's ever been in, and this was probably the worst has been in. Though my guess is he did try with the script he had to work with. Kline was ok, just not the best. And seriously, the only other film I saw Salma Hayek in was Dogma, and she did far better in it than this. Again, I imagine the actors had a massively hard time making this.  What really drives the movies grade down for me however, is the elements. Ok, it's set in the late 1800's in the old west, so there will of course be trains powered by steam. There will be guns, there will be horse-drawn carriages, and of course saloons and cowboy boots. Since when were there motor-powered penny-farthings, giant mechanical spiders and other sorts of machines that either shot giant razors that would home in on a victim or otherwise?  Well it is true most of this movies plot centered around inventors, gadgets and such. But it is blown out of proportion and really taken to extremes.  The special effects were good though. With that, and the story/plot, those are the only things giving this film it's stars, it's like one star for each piece.  So why watch this you might ask, if the acting sucks, elements and overall final product are stupid (not to mention it had nothing to do with the original show despite character name similarities and the being the same name as the original show)? Well, I would say so that you can tell other people, that yes, you were able to sit through this. Otherwise there are FAR BETTER western films. I haven't seen too many though, I would suggest either Dances With Wolves or Back To The Future III ANY DAY before I EVER suggested this one. Actually I would never suggest this one. I would suggest any Clint Eastwood or John Wayne westerns instead.  If you must see this, be it only for the purpose of saying that you saw this film.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been using this app for about 18 months now. It is, by far, the most comprehensive Bible app for reading or in-depth study.  This app offers nearly every version in nearly every language. Most versions are available for download and off-line use; however, due to what I believe are licensing issues, several of the more popular versions (i.e. the 3 NIVs, the AMP and a couple other English versions) are only available via data connection. Occasionally the NIV and AMP become available for download so be sure to allow youversion to email you. None-the-less, the minuscule amount of data used is all but irrelevant, provided you're not using a tablet somewhere without wifi.  Changing text sizes, night mode (black background/white text) and multiple-color, persistent highlights are a few options that I get the most use out of. Occasionally, I listen to the NIV audio Bible option as well.  Those are just tip-of-the-iceberg options.

B001HNE3NO|4.0|A terrible, horrific time in world history, this novel focuses on the true story of the tens of thousands of French Jewish men, women and children who were sent to their deaths during Hitler's reign of terror.  The Paris police acted upon their orders and delivered French Jewish families to camps and ultimately their deaths.  What acts human beings are drawn and compelled to do...without thinking the true and awful fate!  The story focuses on Sarah, a young Jewish girl; and the woman, Julia, who found herself intrinsicly entwined in Sarah's fate decades past, as the commemoration of this event takes place sixty years later.  The novel was enlightening and disturbing at the same time.  It was difficult to assimilate the end of the novel.  Going from a respectful and deep accounting, it veered into an ending that did not seem to hold true to the story told.
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|Erotic thriller drama movie with lots of action and great acting. Recomend it if you like action with a twist.
B003YBNREI|5.0|A first rate album by the Doobie Brothers and a MUST for a true DB fan. I bought this album with some doubt in mind as to whether the DBs still have their mojo, but I was pleasantly surprised. Soon after I went to a live concert and was completely and utterly astonished as to how good they still sound after all these years! Additionally, the songs they played from this album were replicated with finesse. Definitely one of their best albums.
0385534639|5.0|I am not normally a reader, but I try. Normally I get a quarter of the way into a book and I then find something else to occupy my time. This book however, I could not put down!<br /><br />I will admit it starts slow while setting the scenes and the characters motives. After this though it sucks you in with the detail of the scene, taking you to a magical world of a circus (minus the clowns thank goodness).<br /><br />I am very sad to have finished my book, although a great ending, I wish there were more :)

B004XQO90O|3.0|A mind-twisting movie that feels like a 30 minute television show.<br /><br />I thought Jake Gyllenhaal did a good job as a soldier tasked with identifying a terrorist by reliving the last eight minutes of someone's life over and over.<br /><br />This is science fiction mixed with ideas of time & space. The confined space of a commuter train and the machine Gyllenhaal's character sits in helps create some of the atmosphere of tension and deep threat.<br /><br />I thought this movie went very fast. It felt like I was watching an episode of television instead of a feature film simply because of how quick it was over.<br /><br />I didn't connect with the romance forced into the plot nor did I empathize with the whole father-son dynamic either. This film was all about the science behind the plot. Nevermind the characters.<br /><br />This is a movie similar to Pandorum in that you discover answers to the plot along with the characters. In the end, it's a far-fetched idea about combating terrorism with super computers, time/space and physics.
B006B31B80|2.0|Season 1 of this show was beautiful.  Every episode, my stomach was knotted up with the question, \\"Who is going to get eaten?\\"  Nowhere was truly safe, even the camp was eventually overrun, and people died.  It was frightening and I couldn't stop watching.  Season 2 is a snoozefest focused on character development and emotional drama.  \\"Im pregnant dont tell\\" \\"You told\\" \\"I love you\\" \\"I slept with Shane\\" \\"You had me at hello.\\"  Blah blah blah. I care less and less about these characters. We are six episodes in and I dislike them all more with each passing episode.  Without the 'survival tension', the show is just really a soap opera with zombies at the backdrop. Im secretly hoping the walkers escape from the barn, and kill everyone, except for Daryl, he's good peeps.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|After seeing the summary of this book I was incredibly excited to read it.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to my first impression.  I understand how some people could enjoy this book as it describes the setting to the point where you feel as though you are standing in Le Cirque De Reves but that must take up at least a fourth of the book.  I got so tired of the repetitive descriptions that once I was three-fourths of the way into it, I quit reading it.  Gasp!  How could I stop without knowing the ending?  How could I stand not knowing what happened to the characters?  How could I not care about what happened?  Well, it's because there was nothing to care about.  The characters were flat and forgettable, there was no action (at least that I read), and there wasn't a plot either.  I'm serious.  There was no plot.  The whole story revolved around the description of this mysterious circus and if you took away the circus, it would just be a bunch of people wandering around living fairly normal lives.  I feel this wraps up my opinion and if you want to know more about how awful the book is, just look at other one and two star reviews.<br /><br />Before I finish though, I would like to say this: it took me three weeks to read approximately 300 pages of this book.  In a regular scenario, for me, I read 100 pages every day.  Now, you can attribute some of the lagging to miscellaneous issues, but if it were an interesting book, it probably would have taken me less than a week to finish.  Instead I was reading it for three and didn't even finish it, due to the painfulness of the writing.  If you enjoy descriptive writing with a couple of added people wandering around with no purpose and no background, go ahead and enjoy The Night Circus.  If you would like to spare yourself the torture of trying to finish a painfully descriptive book, then turn back now and forget the Night Circus ever existed.

B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I recently got the album in the mail and i was very excited to put it in the CD player, especially because of all the negative reviews we can find here, i wanted to see what all the fuss was about.....I am a huge Lou Reed Fan and have almost all his albums at home. Because of all the comments i've read on here i told myself this one would be very hard to Dig and enjoy but no...... not at all!!! i was literally Blown Away by this record!!! i do understand why its causing such an issue though....lol...<br /><br />First of all, as many other reviewers had wisely mentioned before, This is NOT a Metallica Album...more of a Lou Reed thing with Metallica as a back up band and YES, if you dont know him, it may be kinda hard to fully understand his music and you might even hate it. But you guys MUST know : Lou Reed had changed, structified, re-enforced and influenced the face of Rock And Roll music and many artist (including Metallica) more than once!!!! And that was way before Metallica started to get big! Just take a look at his musical career and legacy on WIKI and you'll see for yourself. He gave us some unforgettable music classics over the past 40 years that helped shape Rock And Roll music and the American culture : THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, HEROIN, STREET HASSLE,THE BLUE MASK, BERLIN, NEW YORK,NEW SENSATION, ECSTASY and many more.....He is considered a God in Rock And Roll music, kinda like the Johnny Cash of Rock And Roll! just a little more darker..lol...So, angry Metallica fans out there should do their own research and/or re-direct their frustration to their own ignorance.<br /><br />As far as the music goes, this stuff is AWESOME!! sometimes Unbelievable!!! Musically, this is exactly where i wanted Lou reed to be . I thought it would've been a very very dark record cause of the reviews and comments but it's not as dark as people say...typical lou reed stuff... and let me tell you, Lou is on fire here!!! this is probably is most intense rock record since the Blue Mask Album in 1982!!! These are also some of the most graphic, violent and explicit lyrics he ever wrote, there should be a parental advisory on here.. He was having fun there and that shows!! And i have to say that Metallica did a hell of a job on this record too!!! bringing out the best in lou with awsome melodies and riffs...sometimes a little dark, its true,not 100% Metallica but also very unique and compelling. There's also some kind of very strong and interesting sexual vibe on this record that you can actually feel sometimes if you listen properly, and not only because of the lyrics, the melodies are sometimes re-enforcing it too (The View,Pumping Blood,Frustration)<br /><br />The opening track, Brandenburg Gate, was a perfect choice to start this record with, very melodic and simple..good from start to end, from the first notes of lou's acoustic guitar to the very last note. yes, the lyrics are simple and a little repetitive but they are sing in such a nice way that it doesnt affect the song's strenght at all. it is sing with passion and honesty.the guitar sound is awesome...typical Lou stuff!!<br /><br />The view, the first single of the album, as a very unique and heavy groove. Awesome music by metallica and Lou delivers here as well with killer vocals!!!. This one almost makes me think of SOUNDGARDEN's earlier groove, they had the same type of feeling to their heavy and lazy groove way back then. Solid Rock!!! The album continues with Pumping Blood and Mistress Dead. Pumping blood as a similar groove to THE VIEW but its a little faster, it has awesome vocals by lou and also have that unique heavy groove to it. Mistress Dead....... at this point, i started to have a huge smile on my face...the music played by metallica is extremely fast but Lou deciced to go \\"cut-time\\" with the beat singing at a lower speed...i smiled at that one because i know it is probably one of the songs on the album that Metallica fans hated especially because of the way it was sing but again....thats Lou Reed for you guys!!! Unique groove!!!<br /><br />Iced Honey is another Jewel on the first side,very simple and groovy beat that bites!!! probably the most accessible one on the whole record!!! i like the guitars on that one too...Lou is showing us is \\"poppy\\" style here, which we dont get very often. truly awesome song.The first sides ends with CHEAT ON ME, another nice song, a little more darker than the previous songs but Lou delivers a fantastic vocal work and nice lyrics.<br /><br />On the 2nd side, FRUSTRATION is definetely my favourite and probably the best song on the whole record...the song actually starts around 1 minute or so, long intro but when it starts, it is pure genius!! That's the Lou Reed from THE BLUE MASK i was missing... this one as the best vocals work of the whole CD, the lyrics and the way they are sing leaves me speechless!!!tthere is no words to express how melodic and powerful the guitars are in this one`s ....a real killer!!!<br /><br />LITTLE DOG and DRAGON are a little more slow, a bit darker but has some very powerful lyrics by lou and a very interesting feel.....JUNIOR DAD is a very nice way to end the CD, very melodic, Metallica are giving us a very nice slow song here with nice chords..makes me think of there song ONE.<br /><br />Overall this is truly a real and unique album , it is a unique collaboration that we have here, performed by 2 legends of Rock music and i never thought it would have been possible but they did it,some people are pissed, some are pleased, some just dont get it....but in the end, true music lovers will dig this and YES, as another reviewer as mentionned before, this one will be considered a classic in a few years, its a grower...not for everyone, only REAL music Lovers and of course...Lou Reed Fans......<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!!! Unique groove!!!

B0048LPRCS|3.0|Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental, and as such, cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film itself.  Bound to appeal to only a small subset of film buffs (though to them it should have an intense appeal), 'Enter the Void' is an exploration of the split seconds between life and death, and an experimental trip through method and technique of film-making.  Gaspar Noe, the director of 'Irreversible', is the real star here, as this is above all the vision of the helmsman rather than a vehicle for its actors.  In fact, several of the key players were first-time unprofessionals, although that made little difference if any toward the film's overall effectiveness.  To me, success or failure for this particular sort of film is better measured by how well it communicates its ideas rather than by more traditional yardsticks - but having said that, it's also important to note that a reliance on unusual camera-work, disjointed narrative, and uncommon acting styles is probably going to turn many viewers away from the film before they give the ideas a chance to resonate.  A orphaned young man and his sister, both Westerners, are struggling to get by in Tokyo as a drug dealer and a stripper, respectively.  In the early going of the film, the young man, Oscar, is set up for a sting by one of his buyers, and is shot by the police.  For the next two hours or so, directer Gaspar Noe envisions the moments prior to death, borrowing heavily on flashback, the effects of the drug DMT, and THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD.  Shot entirely from Oscar's point of view (the only time he appears on-screen is if he catches his reflection, or when he lifts out of his body after being shot), the camera zooms around the hyper-kinetic nightscape of Tokyo, as Oscar's spirit - or Oscar's imagination - zips back and forth between city streets and alleyways, between past and present, and - perhaps - between one state of existence and another.  Visually, this film is unlike any other I've seen, with its striking crane shots and laboriously complex style.  Although I thought it captivating for the first half, the effect wore off soon and lost its freshness.  Still, based only on the look of the film, I'd still recommend it to those who are intrigued by inventive camera work and idiosyncratic methods.  I'm positive they would walk away with several technical insights and a sincere appreciation for the effort that went into making it.  Yet that's too small a group of film enthusiasts to reach for; there must be more to a film than the way it looks, so we are back to story.  I feel as though I misinterpreted the film as I watched it - it was only after reading some of Mr. Noe's comments about his work, and discussing the movie with someone else that I feel I got the intent behind it all.  Without those insights, I feel as though most viewers would have the same first impression that I had - that this was really a rather simple tale about death and reincarnation.  Reading the director's comments put a different spin on the story, but, unfortunately, did not add any depth to it - instead it then became a roundabout story of death and nihilism.  I don't have any objection to either interpretation, but the unavoidable fact is that the film could have made either point in half the time.  Two hours and forty-one minutes of swooping around Tokyo from a bird's-eye vantage point becomes repetitive rather than unique at around the hour-and-a-half mark, and the entire process loses the edge that made it worthwhile in the first place.  Despite these flaws, there are certain film lovers to whom I would recommend the movie - especially those who are always looking for something out of the mainstream.  It may not satisfy completely, but there is no doubt that 'Enter the Void' is reaching for something other than safe and sound storytelling.  The story may not be as profound as the effort behind it intimates, and the length of the film may indicate self-indulgence from the director, but it is unique.  That alone is valuable in an industry that seldom challenges its audience.  One last trivial note: This film has the most fantastic title sequence I've ever seen.  It's almost as if it were designed to induce a sensual stimulation that replicates a drug high or an epileptic seizure.  Kudos to the design team behind a most unusual introduction.
B005JLN9ZI|1.0|I see all these 5 star reviews. I don't hear it. No I am not trying to hate on Drake. I want very much for him to succeed. But Hip-Hop and R&B really has lost its soul. This CD is boring. But I guess when we have all these mediocre artist on the charts people are desparate for something to shine. Rick Ross last CD was good. But the only original CD I have listened to in the last 10 years is still Speakerboxx/Love Below by Outkast. I'm serious, listen to it. The damn thing still holds up. Hell Jay-Z is in his 40's and still banging them out. All these new rapper/singers especially the males sound like they are still going through puberty. Please for God's sake step out the box and stop doing these \\"safe\\" tracks. How many times do we have to hear \\"N-----rs\\" and \\"B---h\\" through a song. The shock value is gone.......................lonnnnnnnnnggggggggg gone. Write a song with meaning behind it. Damnit Adele and Taylat Swift are doing it. Black music used to have so much substance with style. Now we have style and no substance. I am grading this a D for damn boring as hell.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|It really is terrifying to me how good this show is.  A head and shoulders above how it started, and it looks as if the only way to go is up.  It's really coming into it's own here in the third season for sure.  The reason it terrifies me is the people behind it.  Lost was such a disappointment in that last season.  I think that fringe will be different simply because of it's story up to date (the story is more honest with the viewers if that makes sense), and because hopefully a lesson has been learned from Lost.  Greed just terrifies me when it comes to television, some exec may decide that if they milk the story they can earn some more money, instead of giving the story an ending.  All stories deserve an ending.  Anyways if you have tv SUPPORT THIS SHOW.  And if you don't, SUPPORT THIS SHOW.  And if you have the time write to the show telling them to dignify Fringe with the ending it deserves when the time comes.
0736699406|2.0|OK... I don't know exactly why Amazon chose to combine the reviews of the printed book with its audio version, but it certainly  makes it harder to find relevant reviews for someone looking for the audio book. This is a review for the audio book.<br />For starters, the narrator makes every character sound like they came out of a pirate novel. To make matters worse, they sound a lot alike, both female or male ...and last, many impersonations are plainly annoying, like Patchface, the fool at Dragonstone, who sounds like an elderly Irish drunkard. To be honest, the narrator did a really poor job.<br />Curiously enough, this is the description at the Audio CD page: \\"Roy Dotrice rises to the challenge, providing each character with his or her own unique voice. Dotrice's range of vocal tones, from gravelly and commanding to silkenly dangerous, creates a mood of insistence that holds the listener captive throughout the epic story\\" - is this a joke?! They all sound the same, and his vocal range and interpretation are very limited.<br />Alright, the narrator lacks interest, but what about the plot? Well, that doesn't help much either. Too much description and quarrel, adding little to the plot, and making the whole story tiresome. Even the wittiest characters, like Tyrion and Varys, are dull and gray. I don' know if it is my disliking of the narrator, but it seems like they are reciting lines, without intonation. Long descriptions of lineages, banners and scenery make the plot drag - we wan't action! It seems like the author is just droning, to fill more pages than the last book.<br />I hope another version of the audio book is produced, with the narrator of the first book. I certainly would buy it again, just  to have a better rendition of the text.
B001675YQ6|3.0|\\"Love and other Disasters\\" was a difficult call for me.  I enjoyed some parts of it but ultimately, there was just too much of it which did not ring true and which I simply could not believe.  To be fair, the movie sets up its own premise for why the plot might be unbelievable, and while that is clever (and, in fact, some of the more interesting parts of tghe movie involved this minor subterfuge) in the end it just served to confuse things and ultimately, doesn't really excuse a poor script even if it explains it.  The premise I spoke of is that one of the characters is a wannabe screenwriter and various elements in the movie raise the question of whether we are watching the exploits of this screenwriter and his friends or whether we are actually watching the movie he scripted based on those exploits.  There are a number of jokes about movie cliches which, of course, show up in the screenplay.  These were some of my favorite parts of the movie but like I said, this sort of campiness, in the end, was more of a weakness than a strength.  The movie had likeable characters and frankly, I normally find Murphy's charm hard to resist (so sad that she died so young) but it was pretty easy to resist here.  The movie could have been interesting with a better script, but it truly was full of cliches and weak plot points which had me groaning.  For instance, one of the principal plot elements involves a man who is interested in Brittany Murphy's character but she believes him to be homosexual, based on some pretty specious reasoning, and so she decides to try to set him up with her homosexual roommate.  He, on the other hand, presumes that she is romantically involved with her roommate -- and of course, they both miss several clues which could have put an end to the whole misunderstanding instantly but we are supposed to believe that what is obvious to the audience is somehow invisible to the characters.  How many times have you seen that basic setup before, in sitcoms, other movies, etc.?  (in modern shows, the homosexual angle is common -- in older ones it was usually married vs. single or simply a mutual presumption that the other is interested in someone else).  Then there's Murphy's character herself -- another cliche: in her circle of friends she is the \\"glue\\" who holds them all together, solves their problems, talks them through their heartbreaks, etc., but has no insight at all into herself.  While cliched, that part is at least believable, but there are a couple or three places in the movie where an issue requires action and, without missing a beat (or stopping, even for a moment, to consider the situation) she just starts barking out orders to her friends like a platoon sergeant taking a hill.  So, apparently she is so bright that her friends routinely look to her for guidance, she can assess a situation in an instant and immediately decide on a course of action involving multiple steps and people and which she commits to without a moment's hesitation, but she can't figure out that a straight guy with an obvious interest in her isn't a homosexual looking to hook up with her roommate.    I can't recommend this -- the movie within a movie could have been a fun twist if the rest of the script had been strong enough to support it (and if the writer hadn't chose to blur the lines between reality and writer's creation).  To be sure it is no worse than many of the other movies and sitcoms which have used these same overworn cliches, which is hardly a recommendation in my book, but if that doesn't bother you, perhaps you'd enjoy the movie.
0307943194|4.0|I use to enjoy the earlier novels by John Grisham and then for some reason, I lost track of what's been published in the last few years. When I saw his latest book was available in audio, I felt it would be a perfect selection for my work commute, especially since the reader was Dennis Boutsikaris one of my favorite readers.<br /><br />In this novel, the law firm of Finley & Figg, has been in business for 20+ years, but it would be hard to categorize this firm as successful.  The partners are Oscar Finley and Wally Figg, a couple of ambulance chasers who specialize in fast divorces and auto accidents for the most part.  Their run down office is located in a seedy area of Chicago next to a massage parlor. Oscar is unhappily married and waiting until he can retire from this small time operation. Wally is a recovering alcoholic, married and divorced numerous times. He recoups in fees in other ways when his female clients are low on cash. Needless to say Oscar and Wally's firm is unlikely to win any prestigious awards or high profile cases, but they do manage to create some wild and crazy situations for themselves.<br /><br />Then one day it seems like their luck is about to change.  David Zinc, is a young 30-something, Harvard Grad. A high profile attorney from a huge hot-shot firm, David is fed up with the pressure of the fast track corporate life.  One day he has a panic attack at work and up and leaves. He heads for a downtown bar, spends the day and night drinking and ends up passed out in front of Finley and Figg. When he realizes what he's done and finds himself without a job, he convinces Oscar and Wally that he can help them out.  Before long the threesome sees that a class action lawsuit filed by an out of state law firm, against a huge pharmaceutical company called Varrick Labs may be the big break they've been waiting for.  The drug Krayoxx, a cholesterol drug, may have caused heart attacks and even death for some who have taken the drug.  All is not as easy as it appears on the surface, especially for some bumbling lawyers who have never argued a case in Federal court.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed listening to the audio book a lot. It's a story that held my interest, I didn't need to hang on their every word and still was able to follow and more importantly, enjoy the story. I loved when a story like this can make me chuckle. It's certainly a lighter story than what I've read recently, but was fun all the same.

Instead, I'd like to share that I was almost embarrassed to give the book to my friend because it did not appear to be new. As well as having a crease on the binding where the book had clearly been heavily browsed, there was a long black mark along the underside of the book, from a thick marker. Finally, there was a large Amazon.com sticker on the rear of the book. I've never experienced this before when buying a new book from Amazon, and I will reconsider doing so again in the future.

B0000024SI|5.0|Bob Dylan/ Highway 61 Revisited (24kt gold-plated edition):  A Masterpiece!  This is one of the rare occasions when five stars aren't enough.  Here is where the word-artist creates flexibly profound lyrics in the best folk/rock tradition. This is one of the series of Masterpiece albums Dylan has created during this time.  Don't claim to have a music collection if you have not collected this one yet (no, it does not have to be a Gold disk, just a decent edition).

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I had recently bought this boxset for myself for an incredibly amazing price, although my mom wanted to get this for me as a xmas present, but i went ahead & bought it ahead of time so i wouldn't have to worry...(although I guess I spoiled it in a way) but oh well....can't help it.<br />Now, I have to say, this is truly a wonderful piece & is a must have for any MJ fan!!<br />The best part are the unreleased songs on the entire set as well as the usual stuff that i already know... so don't get me wrong on that part.<br />My personal fave songs on the set are as follows:<br /><br />DISC 1<br />---------<br />ABC(Jackson 5)<br />Ben<br />Sunset Driver<br /><br />Disc 2<br />---------<br />Someone in the Dark<br />State of Shock(featuring Mick Jagger)(I like this better than Freddie Mercury)<br />Scared of the Moon(Demo)<br />We Are Here To Change The World<br /><br />Disc 3<br />---------<br />Cheater(Demo)<br />Someone Put Your Hand Out(Demo)<br /><br />Disc 4<br />---------<br />Beautiful Girl(Demo)<br />We've Had Enough<br /><br />And of course, the last disc on the set is the Dangerous Tour Live in Bucharest Concert DVD which is truly amazing... as soon as i watched it, Michael literally blew my socks off w/ it.<br />I just might get the individual title for my MJ collection as well since I don't mind doing so. :)<br /><br />Anyway, I just want to say & I said it before but i'll say it again, this is something that every MJ fan should have in their collection.<br />The boxset is amazingly beautiful & it also comes w/ a truly beautiful 60 page booklet which has so much information including a timeline starting in 1969 all the way through to 2001, plus a LONG piece of information about Michael the singer, the writer & arranger...which i have to admit took me a long time to read, but it was well worth it.<br /><br />So to finish this off, I highly suggest that any fans who don't have this in their collection...PLEASE get it! You certainly won't regret it..That's something I can guarantee for sure.
B006B31B80|4.0|I have enjoyed this season so far. Who wouldn't want to stay on that farm for awhile, after all they've been through? haha  I imagine they will get \\"on the road\\" again at some point. In the meantime, it's nice to have the encounters with walkers be more of a surprise than a regular feature. And it just makes me wonder what it IS going to take to get them moving again. And whether they'll lose any more people in that process.   I agree with some of the criticisms by other reviewers regarding \\"soap opera\\" story lines, but I'm giving the writers the benefit of the doubt that they will keep things interesting. They have surprised me before. And again, I am enjoying the \\"breathing room\\" in the action to allow for some consideration of various moral issues and some character development. Regarding the use of gender stereotypes, I'm also willing to suspend judgment and  see how it plays out as the story goes on.   It's been a fun ride so far!
B004KO8036|5.0|Like others have noted, it's both useful and easy to compare Red Fang to other bands, because they're so diverse from song to song.  It is difficult to describe their \\"sound\\" because while it's all hard rock, the nuances therein vary considerably among the tracks.  They've got two lead singers and obviously are in mastery of several song writing styles.  I was only familiar with the songs Prehistoric Dog and Wires from the videos, but picked up this record and the self titled debut after being totally blown away by Red Fang's live show opening up for Mastodon.  Murder the Mountains contains an obvious influence from Queens of the Stone Age, Melvins, Alice in Chains, Kyuss, Nirvana and their tour mates Mastodon (several of these bands, QOTSA, Mastodon, and Melvins in particular, have made careers of deploying many styles and branching out into any genre they choose while retaining a core sound, so the comparison works on multiple levels).  The first track Malverde, with its plodding percussion and quirky sludge riffs is the closest thing I've heard to vintage Stoner Witch/Stag era Melvins...perhaps ever (guitarist/vocalist Maurice Giles has got the King Buzzo voice completely nailed).  And that's quite a compliment.  The next song, Wires (with an astonishingly great music video, btw), sounds like it could be a different band - it's a catchy hard rock number with vivid lyrics and a spooky instrumental riff section that immediately brings to mind Lullabies to Paralyze era QOTSA (might I also add that this band is the best I've ever heard at aping Josh Homme's signature repetitive \\"robot rock\\" riffs...check out the verses to songs like Wires and Prehistoric Dog and Number Thirteen to see what I mean).  Two songs in and the record already sounds like a mix tape from heavy metal heaven.  And on and on it continues from there, tackling everything from doom to hardcore punk, and all of it featuring catchy riffs and catchier choruses.  After a few days of listening I can honestly say I'm in love with this record.  So few bands mix it up stylistically like this because so few bands have the confidence, vision, and talent to do so.  Red Fang is the rare band that can pull it off.  I didn't think the records could possibly live up to their amazing videos, but I'm happy to report that they do.  The debut record is great, and Murder The Mountains, 2011's offering, is one of the absolute best of the year.  Highest possible recommendation.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I hated the protaganist from the very beginning, but strangely enough I enjoyed the film itself immensely.<br />The lead male, with whom we are supposed to sympathise, was obviously told to do his very best Woody Allen impersonation, ...which he does, ...much to my irritation. We get the usual constant New York over-analytical voice-overed babble that made Allen and his many neuroses such a self-caricature in the end. The actor even dresses in ill-fitting oversize clothing, as did Allen. It's as though Allen really wanted to play the lead himself, but he was too old so he just hired an impersonator.<br /><br />That aside, ....the film opens with a lingering homage to Paris, ...the \\"tourist\\" Paris, ...which is probably the one we all want to see anyway. For some inexplicable reason known only to Allen it's all shot through a deep orange gel. I can only suggest it was meant to symbolise \\"warm memories\\"?<br />If indeed this is the case then those memories must have been viewed through one of those Tandoori Chicken spray-tans we see on women nowadays.<br /><br />The story itself has been well documented here. It requires you to suspend disbelief and ignore holes in the plot large enough to run the Metro through, but it's one of those movies where you can thoroughly enjoy sitting back and just letting it all wash over you. The strongest performances are all from bit players, ....Kathy Bates is a standout as Gertrude Stein.<br />The bride-to-be's parents are truly obnoxious American snobs, ....sadly not all that hard to find in today's Paris, although the mother does get some of the best lines.<br />Wait for \\"And cheap is cheap I say!\\" Perfect!<br /><br />The bride herself is just SO vapid, shallow and self-obsessed that you cannot believe even the Woody Allen impersonator could ever have fallen for her in the first place, much less made it right through engagement and onto the impending marriage situation.<br /><br />It's not giving anything away when I say that you too will know in about the first 15 minutes that she will be found out as having it off with the \\"know-it-all\\".<br /><br />What is interesting about this movie is that the \\"real\\" people are just character \\"types\\", ......one dimensional and very stereotyped, while the fantasy characters have much more depth and end up stealing the show, ...along with the romantic City of Paris, which is probably the real star.<br />A case of imagination being stronger than reality perhaps?<br /><br />I must confess that I have a fascination with Paris, ( I live there for six or so months each year), and the characters we see in the periods revisited during the course of this movie, so the historical re-creations of both people and places held the most interest for me.<br /><br />You'll all know where this movie is going, but the journey is a very pleasant and picturesque one if you are able to just go along with it all. It's a fantasy, and whether any of it is meant to be actuality or it all takes place in the lead's over-active imagination doesn't really matter.<br />(No, he doesn't seem to drink absinthe at any stage.....)<br /><br />Personally I'd have dreamed up some serious injuries indeed to get out of marrying the air-head and becoming part of her profoundly irritating family. That's injury for them, .....not me.<br />I kept hoping he'd throw her off the troisieme etage of the Eiffel Tower and push Mom & Dad under a speeding Metro!<br /><br />The know-it-all gets EXACTLY what he deserves in the end,(hurrah!) ......although I thought the VERY attractive, well mannered and bright guide at the Musee Rodin a far better prospect than the teenager from the flea markets for Mr. Allen.....sorry, I must remember it was Owen Wilson!<br />But then Mr. Allen always had that penchant for VERY YOUNG girls didn't he!<br />Probably goes a long way towards explaining the ending.......<br /><br />Trivial Footnote: I wonder why the poster specifically references Van Gogh's night sky over Paris whenthat particular artist is never mentioned at all in the film?
B003Q6D282|2.0|The Finale, I can't say I didn't enjoy it. And any fan who has a love for the traps, won't be disappointed by the ones the main character/group has to go through.  For those who like Saw for it's perfectly un-flawed linear storyline. This movie might get under your skin. Only one scene really picks at the linear timeline, but if you can work yourself to get over it, or even find a way for it to make sense in your head, then there's nothing to worry about.  Saw: The Final Chapter, a decent ending to the incredible franchise that originally started with a vision that James Wan & Leigh Whannell had all those years ago.  EDIT (3/17/2015) - Changed from 4 Stars &#62; 2 Stars. I wish James & Leigh would claim this film and it's story 'un-canon'. That's how much I despise this film, and what it 'did' to the series overall.  As mentioned though, if that sort of thing doesn't bother you, and you love the brutality of the traps, you'll probably enjoy it.

1594744769|5.0|I eagerly awaited Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children since I first saw the buzz about it, the cover is just fascinating. Then I read the synopsis and was drawn in. Once it was released, I kept trying to avoid reviews so nothing would get spoiled for me. I finally caved and bought it. When it came my mom and I flipped through it and squealed over the pictures. From looks alone this book is one of those few you know is going to be a winner. The text didn't disappoint, at all.  The first part of the book was emotionally tolling. Jacob didn't believe the stories his grandfather were telling him, even with picture proof. Jacob's grandfather, Abe, had been through so much. The story in the first part is very tension-filled and upset me quite a bit, actually. I was unaware the story relied so heavily on World War 2 history. When circumstances led Jacob to the Welsh island, I was very eager to see what would happen next and was a bit happy that the tension, while still there was a bit less. Once Jacob encounters the children, things got much more interesting. Each character had such personality. I especially liked Wyn and her attitude.  Miss Peregrine's while mysterious, I must mention it's not scary. So many people I've seen have complained, because it's not scary. The only thing that a was frightening to me were some of the marvelous pictures! I've been googling and researching mysterious old vintage pictures such as these since finishing the book. The story is fresh and unique, but I especially love how he incorporated these stunning photographs. The writing style is haunting and beautiful. I'm very surprised this is Ransom Riggs' first novel, but cannot wait to read more from him.  I received my copy from the publisher, in exchange for my honest opinion.
B005ORVMCY|5.0|I bought all three sets and for the most part the packages are fantastic. Good value and great surround mixes, however, there may be a problem with the A Farewell to the Kings DVD. I have well over a thousand dvd/cd/sacd/blu-ray/dvd audio discs and have rarely had a problem playing anything on my Oppo BDP83, but this disc would lock up when I pressed any song. Faulty disc...maybe? I then put it in a 5 year old LG dvd player and it played perfectly. I then tried it in a cheap Sanyo player and it played , but with no lyrics. I then played around with the settings on my Oppo.  DVD audio setting switched to DVD video and the disc played, but again with no lyrics. Very weird. Not sure whether to return or not. Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing problems. Surround sound mixes are more agressive on these releases than Moving Pictures 5.1 mix. Xanadu is sublime in surround. I hope it's a faulty disc  * update * I returned the first set and have the same problem with the second set. Again, some players seem to be okay with this disc, but I have never had an issue like this before, and the other 2 dvds work fine.  ** problem solved. A big thanks to Scott!

1607053551|5.0|I've been creating textile surface designs for 20 years for both the garment industry and my own quilting fabric manufacturing business and I am amazed at how well this book puts all my years of knowledge into a nice little package. It's clear, well laid out and easy to comprehend. From repeat layout to color to how to build a collection of prints; from introduction to various printing methods to copyright concerns to base cloth options and beyond, this book touches upon so many invaluable points. It's a topnotch resource. I highly recommend this book to beginners especially. It is very well-written and concepts are well-illustrated. The textile examples depicted and the perspectives of contributing designers are inspiring. It is the book I wish I had when I first started in the business.

B005WFUZTE|5.0|Although the thrash revival has really only hit within the last year or two with the Big Four, Anthrax's return and Metallica's comeback (which they then ruined, but that's another story) Megadeth has been on their way back to glory for almost a decade now. Since The System Has Failed Dave Mustaine has turned this band away from the radio friendly rock that he'd settled them into with his search for a number one album and back towards what they were good at. Now they're back in the spotlight more than ever and in my opinion they might be the strongest of the Big Four at the moment. Thirteen is an amazing album, best in almost twenty years. Johnny K's production lends so much to this band as does having Marty Friedman back. There's not a bad song in here, a feat that only two other albums can claim this year. I wish the Metallica/Megadeth feud was still going just so 80's era Mustaine could truly milk this moment for all it was worth but I'll have to settle for the triumph that it is.
B004ZN9UZO|2.0|As with so many bands before them and so many bands to come, as soon as one person in the band gets a successful idea that propels the band to more stellar heights their ego inflates to staggering proportions and they begin to believe that they are the band. This is the first album where Roger Waters' giant planet sized ego becomes publicly apparent. They had been struggling internally since Dark Side apparently. Waters takes all the credit except for one song. This is hard to believe as Wright has always been a major writer and contributer to the music of Pink Floyd and it's difficult to believe that Roger alone came up with all these keyboard parts and arrangements. They are just too beyond his scope as a musician. Most likely he bought out Wrights credits. Gilmour too is just given the one credit and removed from all the rest. A very unlikely reality from this fans perspective. Except for the little acoustic bits that open and close the album the rest is very dense and unaccessable. The lyric are pedantic and dreary (the sheep learn karate and beat up the dogs! Indeed!) The music does grow on you over time but lyrically it fails drastically. Using Orwell's Animal Farm as a backdrop to display his juvenile understanding of politics and the ways of the world, Waters succeeds in sticking his head right up his own arse where it has apparently been dwelling ever since. Not a bad album for the music but if you're into the concept and the lyrical content you'll be disappointed if you're looking for something intelligent. I guess the others were fed up arguing with Waters about his greatness ( a real leg end in his own tiny mind)
B005D9B26E|1.0|All the pretty packaging is fine but what I want it incredible sound. And that's not going to happen until they start releasing more music on SACD.<br />CDs are low-fi crap.

B0000019PA|5.0|Yeah, first listen I wasn't too excited about this. The singing sounded whiny and unpolished, the recording quality subpar (even worse than I would except from a standard low-fi album), and the frequent use of heavily distorted bass and guitar lines was extremely annoying and I almost gave up. But yeah, I love it now.
B000WZB944|1.0|I just don't understand why record companies release CD after CD calling them new and improved. All the fancy packaging and additional music will never change that fact that it's still low-resolution, old, 16 bit/44.1kHz technology. Even if it's remaster in DSD, what comes from your player is STILL low-resolution 16 bit/44.1kHz.<br /><br />CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to it or WHO does the mastering/mixing.<br />I don't see why they don't release a TRUE \\"Deluxe Edition\\" and give us an SACD as they did with the release of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery, or Rush's Moving Pictures (on Blu-Ray and also DVD-Audio). They're phenomenal and a TRUE \\"Deluxe Editions\\".<br /><br />Until the music companies get onboard and learn about audio, this is what we will see more of, trash recordings dressed up in fancy packaging then laughingly called \\"Deluxe Editions\\".

Sure maybe it's \\"digitally remastered\\" in DSD but the music coming from the CD is STILL 16 BIT/44.1 kHz when you play it!!<br />Blu-Ray, SACD, and DVD-Audio are \\"Deluxe Editions\\".

0062011847|5.0|[[ASIN:B00563M11M Snuff (Discworld Novels)]]<br /><br />Sam Vimes is back, but this time he is struggling with having to leave the city to go on a long overdue holiday with his wife and young Sam. Fortunately (?) for him, he finds a murder to solve and a new group of oppressed creatures to help.<br /><br />I'll read anything Sir Pratchett writes, but I don't love everything he writes.<br />However, while I don't love everything Sir Pratchett writes, I don't dislike anything from him that I have read.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I am a bit confused by the new use of cussing. There isn't a LOT in this book, but I don't recall any cussing in his other books. I am probably wrong, but if it was there, it was minimal and placed perfectly within the text so as not to distract. I am not opposed to it in a general sense. After all, there is a time and place for everything, (and it's college) but somehow, it felt out of place and was distracting to me. Especially when he used it during the narrative. (I've never understood why authors do that.) For me, it was just out of place.<br /><br />That being said, I really enjoy reading Sir Pratchett and Snuff was no exception. The story doesn't take any wild turns from the oppressed species theme that seems to drive The Watch books of late, but I don't mind it too much. (More on that later.) Wrapping up all that serious commentary on life, right, and wrong and tying it all together, there is a bow of brilliant characters, (over the years Willikins has shaped up to be one of my favorites) and sharp, witty, dialog as usual.<br /><br />This book has themes that are a continuation of [[ASIN:0060815310 Thud!]] and I really like the idea of the Summoning Dark, it's characterization, and Vimes' relationship with it. We get to revisit that idea in Snuff and learn a little more about it's power.<br /><br />Personally, I do kind of hope the next Vimes book moves away from the oppressed species. I love a book that explores right and wrong and the blurred lines between them. I love exploring how people justify wrong \\"for the greater good.\\" Moral questioning is great, but I feel like we have been there and done that with Sir Pratchett and there wasn't really anything new in the storyline with this book. We did, however, get a lot of great new quotes and great new footnotes.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book, but would say, don't read it yet if you are not familiar with the Discworld and it's inhabitants.

1451627289|5.0|Is it one of those harmonics that I finished this book on 11/22/11, 48 years to the day of the Kennedy Assassination? It wasn't intentional, just the luck of opportunity to finish it today. I didn't even realize it until after I was done.  WOW! Just WOW. That's how I felt about this book from the first page to the last. I have a confession to make. I have never before read a Stephen King book. Now stop looking at me that way! It is a genra...horror, creepy, scary, etc. that just has never appealed to me. But I saw this book mentioned on some website...NPR I think, and when I read what it was about it really resonated with me. Why? Well I was 18 and a freshman in college when JFK was assassinated so that day is still clear and vivid. That day in 1963 was one of the major defining moments in my life, the day when I realized that really bad things could happen. The other reason was that I spent the better part of the late 80s and 90s in Dallas, Texas. I pre-ordered it and waited impatiently for it to arrive. In a funny kind of way, I knew before I read the first page that I was going to like this book.  Like is faint praise for this book. I loved this book, probably more than I've loved any book for a long time. Towards then end I was reluctant to finish it because I was afraid the ending would disappoint (it didn't) and because I didn't want it to end. I had lived and breathed this book for almost two weeks, what was I going to do with myself when I was done? By the time I finished it this morning I was so stressed out I had a headache. This book was such a roller-coaster ride!  Stephen King is a good writer and story teller. I didn't know that about him. I am pretty sure that anybody who has read a lot of King picked up on Easter eggs within the book that a non-King reader wouldn't. But there was a special treat for me too. Apparently John D. MacDonald was a writer that King liked because there were several references to his writing and his books. I liked that because I spent the better part of the 70s reading all of JDM's books and still have the very raggedy first edition Fawcett paperbacks (priced at about 65 cents, thankyouverymuch) of almost all of his books stored away in a box. They are part of my past that I just can't bare to part with. In a couple of places King mentions &#34;the girl, the gold watch and everything&#34;, one of JDMs sillier books that had to do with the ability to stop time. I like that, it was like finding a treasure within the book.  I'm not going to rehash the plot, I'll just say that the plot had just enough sinister ominous undertone that it pretty much creeped me out without scaring me half to death. I liked the characters, I really liked the way they were written. The dialogue, I though was really true to the character, I liked the gentle humor and the asides. The thing about this book was that it wasn't just about time-travel or history it was also one of the sweetest love stories I've read in a really long time. Jake and Sadie's love affair brought me to tears more than once.  There were a few nitpicky things that bothered me slightly, for example I don't think people said &#34;put a sock in it&#34; in 1958. I was there and I don't remember that expression until the 90s. There were a couple of other instances of discontinuity (is that a word?) with phrases that I thought didn't belong in the 50s and 60s but that is piddly and doesn't take away from the book one bit.  The ending. I liked the ending. I know there will be people who don't like the way it ended, but given everything that happened, I thought is was the most logical and realistic way to end the book even if it made me cry. I think in the Afterward SK mentions something about his son convincing him to change the ending. I'd love to know what the original ending was. Also it was interesting that King thought about writing this way back in 1972. I'm so glad he didn't. The Kennedy assassination was still much too raw back then and thisbook would probably have not been received very well.  I will read this one again in a few months. There is so much complexity to it. Some things that I just couldn't quite wrap my head around, on the next go-round I'll get some the more complicated time-travel things figured out I hope. I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. It was wonderful!

B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I wrote the below review and gave this disc one star prior to contacting WB customer service.  I submitted a ticket to support.ultraviolet.flixster.com and received a response within minutes that contained a code to download the movie in iTunes.

0525423281|4.0|Life is great for almost seventeen year old, Lola.  She has two, wonderful, loving and protective fathers, a terrific best friend, Lindsey and a handsome, rocker boyfriend, Max.  Yep, things are good, the sun is shining and she and Max managed to survive another Sunday brunch with her dads ( a standing requirement in order to go out with Max). All that remains between her and an afternoon date, is walking the dog, Heavens to Betsy.  After a quick stroll around the neighborhood, the sparkling Lola turns back down her street to head home.  Her heart catches, a moving van is parked in front of the house next door.  It can't be...no that white couch couldn't belong to them.  Relieved she enters the kitchen eager to grab Max and head out; but first the dishes.  Hurriedly, she scrubs the plates, smiling, until she hears the dreaded words: the Bell family is moving back into their house next door.  A jumble of emotions hits her like a ton of bricks.  The plates she is holding tremble and clatter to the floor, crashing and splintering.  No! Not him, not Cricket Bell, the boy she hopelessly adored and crushed on since their first and only kiss when she was five.  A swift peck that tasted like the dusted blue sugar cookies they devoured earlier.  As quick as the fledgling romance started it was squelched by Calliope, Cricket's jealous twin sister; until two years ago when the two began \\"accidentally\\" running into each other everyday.  All those long nights conversing with the moon and wishing on the stars for Cricket to be hers are on the verge of coming true, then the unthinkable happens and suddenly the boy next door is gone and Lola is left to mend a shattered heart.  Now, he is back but that shouldn't matter to Lola, she has the perfect boyfriend in Max, doesn't she?<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />*Stephanie Perkins is a master at creating the giddy, walking on sunshine feelings that go hand in hand with the blossoming of that all important, first love.  She captures just the right emotions, bubbling joy, the shy stumbling and aching longing.  Whether you are a  teenager newly entangled in the bliss of your first romance or an adult fondly recalling the memories of your youth, this book will speak to you.  It has everything you adore and expect to find in a book that depicts falling in love and the raw emotions of heartbreak.<br />*The characters that populate a Stephanie Perkins novel are always genuine.  Lola, is not your typical teenager.  She is a fashionista, dressed in sparkles, glitter and wigs in shades of the rainbow.  Lola is talented, creative and she designs all of her eccentric wardrobe, that is drama and color.  One day she is Cleopatra or on another, Marie Antoinette. Her look is a constant design evolution, since she vows to never wear the same ensemble twice.  How I wished this book had pictures of Lola and her whimsical closet!  As her story unfolded, I questioned whether her array of costumes was just her unique signature of self expression or were they an attempt to mask her emotions and protect her heart?  Lola is caught in that span of time in a teenager's life where she stands on the brink of adulthood, her foot planted shakily and uncertain on the threshold.  Part of her eagerly moves into the adult world, while the other clings to the treasured memories of childhood.  She is a little girl struggling to make an adult relationship fit, since Max is twenty two.  As a result tiny, white lies and self defensive words drip from her lips.  Her dramatic, teenage commentary, often in all capitals, will elicit a few chuckles.<br />*Cricket is in many ways Lola's opposite.  He is nice, respectful and patient, as he resides constantly in the shadow of his champion, figure skating, twin Calliope.  He is so painfully shy and endearing; you can't help but to love him.  Not to mention, handsome, tall and he has his own signature style that includes slightly short, pinstriped pants and wrists adorned with colored bracelets and rubber bands. Cricket is a tinkering inventor with a habit of using his hand as a notepad for reminders.  He smells like clean soap and mechanical oil.  His heart has always been in Lola's pocket whether she knows it or not. A boy willing to chase the girl he loves forever, if that is what it takes.  There is no doubt that Cricket will snag the hearts of many readers.<br />*I appreciated that Lola lived in a non-traditional family; she is reared by two gay men.  Ms. Perkins gives a peek at what it is like to live with two dads and it is a refreshing experience.  They are loving and supportive fathers, completely concerned with Lola's happiness.  Thank you Stephanie Perkins for allowing us a quiet glimpse into daily life in their home.  I hope it will help tear down some barriers.<br />*Fans of Anna and the French Kiss will be delighted to see Anna and Etienne in Lola's world.  The couple is  decidedly, head over heels in love.  I found myself smiling at the progression of their relationship into simple, blissful happiness.  Lola and the Boy Next Door, is a companion novel, you can read it without having delved into the pages of Anna and Etienne but it will enrich your experience with Lola's story if you do.  I love the idea of companion novels.<br /><br />And The Not So Much:<br />*Ms. Perkins has a habit of labeling her books with dead giveaway titles, so you know going into the story that Lola is inevitably going to end up in a relationship with the boy next door.  Part of me liked having this information and the other side wished that I was caught up in the anxiety of not knowing.<br />*Max, at first, I liked his character even though I knew he was wrong for Lola.  As events transpire, he becomes jealous and possessive.  When the relationship moves into rocky terrain I was disheartened by the ugly note left behind.<br />*While I loved that Lola had two fathers, I felt that only one of the dads was well developed.  I met Andy and learned that he is a pie maker extraordinaire.  He is patient, especially when it comes to his drug addict, problem prone sister, Nora, who is  Lola's birth mother.  He is well rounded and the only thing \\"gay thing\\" about him is his  love of figure skating.  Nathan, on the other hand remains a mystery, he is older, busy and lacks patience and that is all I know.  He is in the background and I wanted him to step forward so I could see him better.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door, is a novel you will want to read when you need a pick me up.  It is a warm, tender, deliciously, sweet story about a girl who whispers to the moon and a boy who wishes on the stars.  A book for anyone who dares to dream of true love.  It is an adorable, love story that will plaster a big smile on your face and leave you beaming.  I highly recommend you read both Stephanie Perkins books, Anna and the French Kiss and Lola and the Boy Next Door, they are a delightful experience.  Look for the final companion novel, Isla and the Happily Ever After, due out 2012.  I hope that I will see the return of Lola, Cricket, Anna and Etienne as I read Isla's story.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is currently listed as a nominee for Best Young Adult Fiction in the Goodreads choice awards.<br /><br />Favorite Quotations:<br />\\"I don't believe in fashion. I believe in costume.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|Love it! Great songs, great rythm...I can't stop listening to it.  On Melancholly Hill is beautiful, and Some Kind of Nature and Rhinestone Eyes are perfect.   This is my favourite band and album. All the songs are just great.
B000024KBK|5.0|\\"Our Frank\\" is one of Morrissey's best singles and \\"Sing Your Life\\" is a wonderful anthem that was perfect for his new band of rockabilly hooligans.  Who couldn't love \\"There is a Place in Hell for Me and My Friends\\"?  A great album with wonderful cover art.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|this is a great challenging puzzle game. it is also a good time waster, good for 5-20 minutes at a time.
B000001EC1|5.0|I could not find this album in stores so I ordered it on amazon received a few days later very happy with my purchase.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Great item, love it, great purchase thru amazon. my daughter loves this item.Would highly recommend.Nice buying thru amazon, fast shipping
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed's second studio album, Human Clay, is one of those records that is nostalgic, promising, and overall excellent. With Arms Wide Open is one of the songs that defined the early 2000's as a better period of time than now. This kind of music makes me miss the old days, and wish for them to come back.<br /><br />You all know who Creed is. The only way you don't know this group is if you've been hibernating under a rock for years. Some people may hate this album due to it sounding the same, but this flaw doesn't really make an album bad- at least to me. The songs featured on here are easier to remember than My Own Prison. There's not a single rotten egg on this album. That, and the lyrics are extremely positive, something that is VERY hard to find in the secular world of rock music. Even the most positive sounding song from a band like Seether doesn't compare to Creed. I could rank this CD next to 12 Stones in terms of positive messages.<br /><br />The reason I love this album so much is because, once again, the songs are set at a nostalgic tone, the vocals from Stapp are powerful, and the music is hard-hitting and powerful. Go and buy this album, and become one of the 11 million people with a copy.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars

B005SZNZAY|5.0|I'll keep this simple..  With Chris Cornell's previous solo albums through the years, I was always left feeling a little bit let down and underwhelmed, due to the over production. That feeling had nothing to due with the songwriting, mainly that his voice was buried with over instrumentation, and slick production. Chris's voice is natural, and should be placed in a musically natural setting, i.e. acoustic instruments, or the raw grunge sounds of early Soundgarden (one of the best band names ever, btw).   So, finally here we have a live acoustic album, and man! does it work wonders. We get to hear what we've always known, that this man does not need studio assistance or auto tuning, to blow minds with his vocal chords. Whether he is singing low and graciously, or letting loose and breaking glass windows with powerful high notes, he sounds great on \\"Songbook\\".   The album also does a great job of covering all the bases of Cornell's career, Soundgarden, Audioslave, Temple of the Dog, and his solo stuff, are all represented here. And, surprisingly all transfer over very well to the acoustic format.  Anyway if you are checking this album out, I'm sure the reason is, to hear a solo acoustic show by Chris Cornell, because that sounds great! Well, don't worry, thankfully, there hasn't been anything done to this album to take away from the voice and an acoustic guitar, what you pay for is what you get. Plain and simple, and it's worth every penny.
B005DOKK7Q|3.0|I have had my case for a week. The terrible smell it had when I first opened the package is almost gone. I do like it but for the amount of money you pay it is flimsy. I bought the lime green one. I was at Target looking at Fire covers and they are just as expensive there, a few even more money.   I do like it though.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I had always been a fan of the Harry Potter series and I was excited to buy this movie on Blu-Ray. I had purchased this product on sale for under $20, and it was worth every penny. The Blu-Ray disc provides excellent quality that makes watching the movie extremely entertaining! I would highly recommend this product!
B001EAWMGA|4.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable monster movie.  Because it is serious scif (if that isn't an oxymoron), the story was believable enough to capture my imagination.  A space voyager crashes to Earth in 709 CE, with mysterious though comprehensible technologies - he connects his brain to the computer, getting a download of the local Norse dialect and basic information about their world view and state of civilization.  A lone survivor, he is charismatic and tough, ready to take on a challenge alone, some idea of which we get from his exploration of a devastated village.  What he doesn't quite plan for is the skill and ferocity of the Vikings, one of whom captures him and brings him back to camp.<br /><br />There are many vivid and very well acted characters.  The alien, it seems, has walked into a volatile situation of incessant war between rival chiefdoms.  He explains to them that he is hunting a dragon, which they find laughable until the creature attacks in the night.  This makes the alien a comrade and guide in the hunt.  He befriends a claimant to the throne, whose betrothed is a strong, not-too-enamoured woman.  The fight is brutally graphic, has a wonderfully believable adversary with many surprises in store, and moves quickly.  The atmospherics are also lushly Nordic, in a hunter-gatherer waste with inferior iron and crude implements.<br /><br />This is riveting entertainment with enough subtlety that it can be viewed many times for enjoyment.  Recommended.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Of all the six great albums Van Halen put out with David Lee Roth, Women And Children First could well be the finest. Combining extreme creativity with a rawness only found on their early releases, Van Halen entered the studio early in 1980, stayed for two and a half weeks and came out with a defining collection of songs. All of them bearing a distinctive VH stamp and sounding very much like nothing else at the time. Things like And The Cradle Will Rock..., Everybody Wants Some!!, Could This Be Magic?, and the remaining six tracks are definitive examples of a band plugging in and simply having the best time.     Also, Edward Van Halen was around this time at the very top of his impact, his playing flowing free in a still rather unheard fashion, more influential than ever before.   I've always thought VH's original line up was the only one that really mattered, the one which brought something fresh and the one which was fun to listen to. That said, it's no wonder I wouldn't care reviewing '5150'... In 1980, along with Rush's Permanent Waves and AC/DC's Back In Black, Van Halen's Women And Children First marked a promising beginning for a new decade of music, something which sadly wasn't to be.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The adults in the movie look and act more like James's  (the kid in the movie) grandparents.  They  look to be in their 60's and seem much    more aloof  and weary than his parents might behave.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have been using this for several weeks now and I am very happy with it. It is much more powerful than the built-in unit and makes it great when your at indoor parties. I don't have to worry about getting within 10-12 feet of my subjects to get a good picture. I can easily get good photos at ranges of up to 40 feet. The only criticism I might have would be the battery life. The two AA Alkaline batteries start loosing their oomph after about 30 pictures and when that happens it forces you to wait longer between shots.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|My whole family loved this movie.  Of course, being it is a family classic, we watched this prior to watching the new Alice in Wonderland written by Tim Burton.  My kids were amazed at the difference.
B004LWZW8I|1.0|Tarsem Singh makes pretty movies. This one happens to be pretty bad as well with atrocious, leaden dialog and a barely existent plot. The visual style of the movie is so thoroughly artificial looking that the settings lose any impact. The costumes and the bodies they adorn are pretty nice, though.  Definitely see Tarsem Singh's [[ASIN:B001BPJJ9G The Fall]] though, to see why Immortals is such a disappointment.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|My kids, 12 and 4, liked this movie and thought it was very entertaining.  I, on the other hand, lost interest very quickly.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Margin Call does a commendable job showing the humanity - often very flawed humanity, like the rest of us - behind the sub-prime mortgage meltdown. Some of the people are more sympathetic than others just as some are more responsible, and more deliberately responsible, for what happened in the real world while others were swept along trying to stay alive - or at least solvent. The movie also touches briefly on some of the major background issues; the financial attractiveness of these financial analyst jobs to people who would otherwise be contributing their genius to invention, creation, and betterment of technology instead of playing games with money, and the way government regulations contributed to creating the rules that encouraged these risky money games and then toppled the money towers created as a result to devastating effect. The movie builds palpable tension as the crisis comes to a head and we even end up caring about and sympathizing with some of the people who have otherwise been portrayed as monstrous, cackling villains.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I loved this movie.  However, you probably need to be a Jude Law and Robert Downie Jr. fan.  I love their charismatic personalities and characteristics they portray on the big screen!

B005TZFZJC|5.0|I loved this new album. Some people's reviews crack me up--many people have recommended Rihanna take two years off from producing to write something new, but do they have the talent to do what she's doing? Rihanna has created something unique to her. The music she's making is selling. It's what people want! 6 albums in 6 years is freakin outstanding. I don't like a lot of the \\"raunch\\" to be honest, but I can appreciate her music, her talent, and her boldness at being who she is and not apologizing for it. I love her music-I can dance to it, I can sing along with it, I can work out to it...that's what music is all about! I loved We Found Love, You Da One, Where Have You Been, Roc Me Out, I loved them all. They're great standalone, and an awesome compilation. I honestly liked this album better than Loud, with the exception of that album's singles. If you're already a Rihanna fan, you'll love it.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I saw this movie in 3D in theaters and I was blown away by the visuals. While the story follows a familiar formula (\\"Dances with Wolves\\" + \\"FernGully\\") and many of the characters so far (it is a trilogy) are pretty one-dimensional, it makes up for this with great performances using groundbreaking motion capture technology. It was very easy to get immersed in the world of Pandora and suspend disbelief. The acting is great, and despite a story that has been done before (\\"white hero goes native and saves the day\\") I found myself genuinely moved by several scenes. The extended collector's cut is a much better film than the original release, it gives more context for why things happen the way they do and it starts out much better.<br /><br />As for the DVD set, you get 3 versions of the film. You get the original theatrical release, the special edition re-release with 8 minutes of additional footage, and the collector's extended cut with 16 minutes of additional footage. You also get a fascinating making of documentary, 45 minutes of deleted scenes in various states of completion, and the option of a 'family audio track' with the naughty words removed.<br /><br />I have an issue with how they split up each version of the film across 3 DVDs. It works like this: you insert disc 1, choose which version of the movie you want to watch, watch it until it tells you to insert disc 2, then same thing insert disc 3. It's clear they did this to avoid having to produce 4 DVDs instead of 3, but it really breaks up the experience of watching the movie and takes you out of it, exactly what you don't want when watching a movie like this. I would have been willing to pay a little more for 4 DVDs where they put each film on it's own DVD and put the extras on DVD 4. I'm sure most other fans of the film would as well. Alternately, they could have done away completely with the special edition re-release and just included the original release and the collector's cut. That's my only complaint about it.

B004WR125O|3.0|I bought it because I thought I needed it for my Onkyo S7400 to stream the internet sites like Pandora.  My stereo is in the basement but I still get a good wireless connection with my PS3 there so I thought this device would do the trick. It plugs in easy and the stereo read it right off but the best I could do signal strength is 30%.  Plus I have yet to be able to connect to Pandora because of connection issues.  If you are more than a room away from your access point I would consider another option.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Beautiful Disaster was definitely an enjoyable read for me. Obviously the title gave a tip-off that this romance was going to be a bit dysfunctional, so there was no surprise that it was. I loved the intense connection that our hero immediately felt. Spoiler: The only thing that really bothered me about this story was the fire...there was no way that would not have come without major repercussions. But,it's fiction, so I can accept that and enjoy the story for what it was.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|THE best new album I've heard in a long time!  Some of her songs stick in my mind all day.  I chose this as a Christmas gift for a group of friends.  Everyone should experience Adele 21. Adele 19 is just as creative.

1439102813|5.0|I am a nursing student and this book really affected how I viewed Alzheimer's and other dementia patients.  Any medical student or person who knows someone with dementia should read this book!  It humanizes the disease and helps us as caregivers to remember they probably understand way more than we realize.  We rush everything in our lives and sometimes these patients need a little longer (to speak, eat, etc.).  This book makes me even more thankful for what I have and want a cure for this disease that is on the rise.  So take the time, read the book, and appreciate all of life's gifts.
B0054N73EY|1.0|The album opens up with an amazing track, \\"Monarchy Of Roses\\" and I thought: \\"Hey, I might've been wrong all along! While I have no interest in seeing them on this tour, I might actually buy the physical copy!\\" ...<br /><br />...but after that, everything else is mediocre and forgettable. It's only marketing that keeps the band going after they'd lost the most important ingredient to their music and songwriting, John Frusciante. The songs' structure confuses me. There's a way to merge different melodies and make them fit together, but on this album, it's just not happening, the changes happen in a way that makes it almost uncomfortable to listen. For example, the song \\"Ethiopia\\" starts out perfectly, solely to lose itself once the chorus kicks in.<br /><br />I understand that these people are great musicians, I am completely familiar with the work of youngish Josh Klinghoffer through his numerous collaborations and I appreciate his talents, but I'm With You is like a music class at the conservatory where everyone is doing what they want to, trying to appear best ever and what you're hearing depends on where you're sitting in the audience.<br /><br />As for the mix: vocals are literally uncontrollable, the drums sound like drum machines on many of the songs, guitars are barely audible the only good thing is bass. When hipsters do this, it's cute and it has the DIY charm. When one of the biggest rock bands of our times does it, it's pass&eacute;.<br /><br />For this listener, it's either the classic line-up or this band realising that it's over. If this way any decade other than the 2010s, they wouldn't have made it. It's only the Internet and their target audience of teenagers and moms that keep them going. Sorry, but I'm not with you.

B000OJFV3S|4.0|After having heard great things from multiple people, I finally decided to sit down and start watching the series.  I now understand what all the fuss was about!<br /><br />First of all, the casting is fantastic.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Sam Neill are so compelling, and Natalie Dormer captures the seductiveness and conniving nature of Anne Boleyn that we all imagine.  Also worth mentioning are Maria Doyle Kennedy as Catherine of Aragon and James Frain as Thomas Cromwell.<br /><br />The bulk of the plot revolves around King Henry VIII's desire to leave his wife, Catherine of Aragon, to wed Anne Boleyn.  Catherine has been unable to produce any living male heirs, and Henry (whose string of mistresses never ends) has quite obviously grown tired of her.  However, since England still answers to the Pope, he has to get permission from Rome to have his marriage annulled -- which isn't very likely.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Anne's motives for seducing the king are somewhat less than noble.  Her father and uncle want nothing more than to bring about the demise of the king's chancellor, Catholic Cardinal Wolsey, and know that if Henry is under Anne's spell, then she will be able to persuade him to dismiss Wolsey from court.  Much of this revolves around the rise of Lutheranism and the beginning of the Protestant Reformation.  There is a growing faction in England that wants the country to split from the Catholic Church.  Not only can Anne hold some influence over the king, but he can't be free to marry her as long as the Church has dominion over England since divorce is disallowed.  Drama!  Dun, dun, dun...<br /><br />Of course, there are other fish to fry for the king as well as he flip flops from alliance to alliance.  Does he align himself with France or does he align himself with Spain?  Which of these two countries supports the Pope?  And which of these two countries is betraying him?  More importantly, who in the king's court is secretly working for France or Spain?<br /><br />When it comes to entertainment value, this series will never fail to impress.  It's fast-paced, political, sexy, and dramatic.  Just keep in mind that it IS a series from a premium channel; thus, nudity, semi-graphic sexual content, and language are taken to a much higher level than other shows.  Not for the kiddos.<br /><br />My one beef with the series is that it does fail in the certain areas of historical accuracy.  Some of them aren't really that important, but there are several biggies that did get under my skin.  Just take everything with a grain of salt, and make sure to double-check your facts before including any of this information in a history paper.  Some of the dramatic highlights are actually fiction.br />When it comes to entertainment value, this series will never fail to impress.  It's fast-paced, political, sexy, and dramatic.

B004TSXUWY|4.0|I bought this book with an open mind after reading one positive review and was blown away! In fact, I had to finish it before I went to sleep: could not put it down. The story line is quite unusual. Christine Wheeler has lost +- 20 years of her life, following a head injury, to amnesia. She awakens every morning with no memory of the past 20 years. Every day she has to try and reconstruct the past events in her life but will not remember them when she wakes up the next day. There were two revelations for me in this story: 1)that much of how we define ourselves and our lives, and how we interact with others, is determined by our memories; 2)that in times when we are helpless we are SO dependent on the integrity of the people who care for us. You will enjoy this book: at the very least, it is gripping.
1416550550|5.0|This is an awesome book.  You don't want to put it down until you unravel the mystery.  Although it is long, it is worth the time you spend to read it.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|The product was received in working order. One day latter it died, since it was working on receipt I threw away the packaging - my bad. So, now I am stuck with an expensive paper weight.  Edit: The problem has been resolved to my satisfaction. The company proved to be highly responsive to my problem and the situation was fixed by downloading a new driver from their website.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a fantastic book! I couldn't put it down once I started reading, I could barely tear myself away to eat! The characters are so well developed that you can't help but get engrossed in the novel straight away.  I cannot wait to read the next two in the series. Suzanne Collins is truly remarkable!

B005FITIGO|5.0|Margin Call is among the best films I have seen this year, and has a message that is as current as the front page.  It is a well-written, taut thriller that has excellent performances all around.  Kevin Spacey turns in an outstanding performance as Sam Rogers, a company man who gradually lets go of all his illusions of being decent for money.  Zachary Quinto is excellent as Peter Sullivan who picks up where Stanly Tucci's character (Eric Dale) left off when he was a victim of downsizing.  Sullivan is more of an idealist and plays off his money-obsessed friend Seth Bregman (played by Penn Badgley) nicely.  Bregman knows the big bucks that the higher ups in the company and making and constantly astonishes Sullivan with what he knows.    As news of the company's mortgage backed security problems grows, people higher up in the company make an appearance, some flying in by helicopter. Jeremy Irons is excellent as John Tuld, the companies CEO, as he admits that he needs the problem explained to him in plain English but controls the situation coolly. Paul Bettany is excellent as Will Emerson, a somewhat burned out salesman who doesn't seem to care about the money but rises to the occasion to unload worthless investments on the unwary.  Demi Moore has a good part as a Risk Management officer - the lone female officer - who is in trouble following the revelation about the company's position. Her character coolly accepts what is going on and as the only woman; she knows that she is not one of the \\"players.\\"  Simon Baker's character (Jared Cohen) is definitely a player and he presents a ruthless exterior perfectly.   Sullivan and Dale show an interesting side of their characters as opposed to the others in that they came from other backgrounds into finance.  Sullivan is a rocket scientist and Dale has a long monologue about how he built a bridge and save the local residents thousands of hours by shortening their daily commute.    Margin call is a film that grabs your interestfrom the start and doesn't let go. It provides an interesting commentary on the financial meltdown.  Of all the excellent performances in this film, Kevin Spacey remains for me a standout as his character faces a moral decision to let the company he has worked for fail or unload worthless financial products. In the end, the choice his character makes is the one the one that Wall Street made and would make again; save yourself and let someone else clean up the mess.
1451627289|3.0|The first half of the book was great.  When he was in awe of the past.  When he sees what we've lost and develops an appreciation for it.  I would have rather just read a book about a person who is sent through time and can't return.  How they try to make a new life and fit in.  That would have been great.  So much of the first half of the book was just great.  Then we go to Texas and it just becomes a mean spirited book.  I'll sum it up for you.  Texas was a hate filled gutter(historically inaccurate), Everything SINCE 1958 was Bush's fault(it's really gotten tiresome hasn't it?), and you should always vote Democrat.    Ugh.
1451648537|5.0|I am not commenting on Steve's life or Steve Jobs himself. the book did an awesome job detailing the life of the man that put a dent in the universe. These are exceptional individuals that, unfortunately, this great country will not experience again.    The book is very well written, Isaacson Style keeps you hooked to read more. I was worried about the 600 pages but found myself reluctant to put the book down.   I wish Isaacson developed the book more around JOBS way of thinking, management style and his views about the world, how he dealt with the family.  Mainly more of the last part of the book where you start reading about the Man instead of about the legend.   i am definitely buying his Einstein book.
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|The Trailer Was The Best Part of the Film!<br /><br />This trailer looked so interesting. However, when i went to see the film, it was just awful. My levl of excitement dropped a 100% and i was actually dreading every minute of it. This film tried to be lovey dovey. It was just painful to watch. The film didn't even know what it wanted to be. It wasn't sure if it wanted to a be a comedy or a drama and it didn't have what it takes to be a dramedy. The funny thing is, the cast was amazing and yet they just couldn't deliver. I don't know if it was the script, or the chemistry, but it was painful to watch such brilliant actors participate in such a horrific film.<br /><br />I am the hugest Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore fan and i know Steve can do drama. Anyways, skip this film and watch something else.

B004EPZ06Q|1.0|Review is NOT about the movie........  Movie was funny, ULTRAVIOLET is an INSULT to the consumer..... Hence the 1 star........  I will NEVER buy an ULTRAVIOLET so-called \\"Digital Copy\\" EVER!  This is about the studios giving the consumer what the studios \\"deign\\" give the consumer.......  NOT what the consumer wants and is ready to pay for - hence we have piracy.....  I had this same issue w/ the final Harry Potter movie - I purchased on Amazon UK which had a region-free disc and an iTunes \\"Digital Copy\\"....... now I can't find the region-free disc on Amazon UK for this movie......!  AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH!  When will the studios finally understand that penalizing the people that actually BUY their Blu-Ray/Combo Pack by forcing the consumer into ULTRAVIOLET is counterproductive!  WHY would I BUY a so-called \\"Digital Copy\\" when I do not own it, even WITH it's crappy DRM?  Why penalize the people that actually PAY for their content by giving us something we don't want?  The supposed PLUS of BUYING a Blu-Ray Combo-Pack is supposedly the \\"Digital Copy\\".........  So when they force us into their horrible ULTRAVIOLET format, what is left for the consumer to do?  YES - rip the DVD or the Blu-Ray into a format you can use!  I will NEVER purchase an ULTRAVIOLET \\"Digital Copy\\" because that is NOT the format I want it in.........  Sorry guys.......  Apple has stolen another step on you and anyone with a very small brain can just rip your precious \\"content\\" for free.......  Thanks to you for penalizing those of us who are perfectly content to pay for content so long as it is in a usable format.........  And the studios have the temerity to complain about piracy............  THIS is what the studios get when they force a format on consumers that they hate - more piracy.........  They reap what they sow...........  NO TO ULTRAVIOLET - have you gotten the message yet Hollywood?  We don't want this sort of crap - your content is available for free in other ways, why do you want to penalize people that actually pay for it?    Again...... I will NEVER purchase an ULTRAVIOLET \\"Digital Copy\\" of ANYTHING!  Die! Die! Die! Die!....... weren't your royalties from iTunes high enough?  Oh...... by the way, Apple puts their own DRM on movies to prevent piracy...... but the studios wanted to cut Apple out of their cut of the distribution rights with ULTRAVIOLET......... good luck with THAT........  Die! ULTRAVIOLET, DIE!  I hate you, I won't buy ANYTHING with your crap attached.....
B000002P2V|5.0|English rockers The Who released its eighth studio album Who Are You in August of 1978.<br />Following The Who by Numbers Tour concluding in 1976, the members of The Who went off and did different things. Lead singer Roger Daltrey issued his third solo effort One Of the Boys plus had a bit role in the 1978 British horror film The Legacy (with Sam Elliott and Katharine Ross), guitarist Pete Townshend recorded an album with the late Ronnie Lane called Rough Mix, bass player John Entwistle started putting together the soundtracks to The Who's biopic The Kids Are Alright and Quadrophenia and drummer Keith Moon was still partying heavily and his health began to suffer for it. Then in mid-1977, the band began filming their bio-pic The Kids Are Alright when not focusing on other projects. However Keith had drastically changed his appearance in the year since his bandmates last saw him due to alcohol and drug addictions (while the band stayed in England, Moon moved to California but moved back to London for Who Are You's recording). The recording for Who Are You would be at the band's Ramport Studios from Fall 1977 to Spring 1978 with orchestral overdubs at Olympic Studios with longtime producer Glyn Johns (who quit halfway through due to a scrap with Daltrey) and Jon Astley (who has supervised the reissue of The Who's back catalog as of 1994) producing and Jon's father Ted doing orchestrations. When Who Are You emerged in late August 1978, would The Who deliver at a time of Grease, Saturday Night Fever, A Taste of Honey and other disco drek. Read ahead and find out (as I did when I first got the cassette in January of 1989 and then CD in June, 1994 then remixed CD in November, 1996).<br />We kick off with a superb pick slide turn power chord from Pete on the rocker \\"New Song\\" which rocks. Next is one of the few John Entwistle tunes that got significant US album rock radio play out of \\"Had Enough\\". This rocker has fiery vocals from Roger, Moonie's thundering drumming, synthesizers and rumbling bass and brass solo (which was muted from the 1996 mix) from The Ox and Pete's power chords. This track features strings and the strings aren't lushy. Who can forget its use on WKRP when Les Nessman and his pilot buddy took an old war bi-plane into the sky for Veterans Day. Next is another Ox number out of the sci-fi rocker \\"905\\". The Ox steps out on lead vocal and this piece just rocks. Next is Pete's anti-disco rocker called \\"Sister Disco\\" which spoke against the Saturday Night Fever, Grease and bad disco drek heisting music by then. Then we end the first side with \\"Music Must Change\\" which was in 6/8 and Pete tackling percussion (in addition to his jazzy guitar work and synthesizers, there's alternate guitar on the 1996 remix) as Moonie's drug problems prevented him from playing drums. The Ox plays bass and brass and Roger does another great vocal where he displays all of the range of his vocals.<br />The album's second side begins with \\"Trick of the Light\\" which was The Ox's rocker about a hapless fellow who meets a hooker. Daltrey sings with passion here and The Ox plays lead 8-string bass guitar. On the remix, the track is speed corrected and has a longer outro with Pete playing ending guitar solos. \\"Guitar and Pen\\" is next and is one of Townshend's odes to songwriting and Roger sings very passionately here. The original mix has the track in A flat, the remix slows to G and has extra backing vocals and also extra percussion at the end. The ballad \\"Love is Coming Down\\" is next and features Pete on piano and acoustic (which is all but mute on remix), Moonie on drums, Roger's hauntingly beautiful vocal, The Ox's superb ass playing (his solo along with the orchestra before the second verse was beautiful). The album's title cut ends the album in a grand way. This track (which was a US Top 20 hit for The Who in 1978) is one of Townshend's best rockers and the album version (complete with F bombs is the only version you need, to Hell with the politically correct politicians who censor art). Roger's vocals on the original were processed while on the remix is just echoed and sounding crisper and cleaner than original version.<br />The Who Are You album saw that The Who was back. However, an eerie coincidence occured at the time of album's release. During the photo shoot for the album cover, Keith Moon's weight gain was visible in that foxhunter outfit he had on so he had to sit in a chair which ironically said \\"NOT TO BE TAKEN AWAY\\". Ironically, two weeks after Who Are You was released, Keith Moon passed away on 7 September 1978 from an accidental overdose on pills he was taking to combat his alcoholism. With the sad news, Who Are You jumped to #2 in the US (only the soundtrack to that other big John Travolta movie Grease kept Who Are You out of #1).<br />In 1996, the album was re-released in a remixed and remastered version. First is Pete's demo \\"No Road Romance\\" which was not recorded by The Who. Then it's Pete's original version of \\"Empty Glass\\" with Pete on lead vocals and guitars, John Entwistle on bass and Keith Moon on drums. The song was worked for the album but scrapped and would be reworked for his classic sophomore solo album in 1980. The final three bonus tracks are all alternate versions of earlier songs on the album with tiny alterations/extensions: \\"Guitar And Pen\\" (with more aggressive guitar playing), \\"Love Is Coming Down\\" (different piano track and Roger's quiet guide vocal) and the title cut with an alternate second verse. I love the original mix but the remix is just as good (the drums weren't compressed nor any of what Genesis did with their catalog overhaul) and Bob Ludwig's remastering on the 1996 version is excellent.<br />RECOMMENDED!rect politicians who censor art).

B004J4WKTW|5.0|In 2006 Edward Norton starred in a movie called, \\"The Illusionist\\" about a magician in turn of the century Vienna. In one sequence he makes an orange tree magically grow and bear fruit. That scene kept replaying in my mind while reading 'The NIght Circus' because it would have felt right at home under Morgenstern's big top. Two magicians are raised knowing one day they will meet their rival and be put to a test to see who is the more accomplished. What they don't anticipate is their playing ground is one of their own making; A massive, immersive, and beyond magical circus that suddenly appears from no where, and only opens at nightfall. To give away what the author has created under the various tents would spoil the fun of discovery, but she has offered a bounty for the imagination. And what the magicians, or their mentors really don't foresee is that the rivals will fall desperately in love. For me this book did what any good entertainment should: It swept me up in this mysterious, romantic, and fantastical world and made me regret having to leave it.

B004SDSSFY|5.0|Quick Office or Documents To Go? Both allow you to view and edit Word, Excel, and Powerpoint documents. Both support most, but not all features available in those documents.  Quick Office has the slicker interface. It's definitely prettier. Documents To Go isn't ugly, though.  Neither program handles Excel pivot tables properly. If you're an advanced Excel user, that bites.  Quick Office makes Word documents look nicer on your screen, but makes it a pain to do simple things, like insert page breaks or comments. Documents To Go lets you truly edit Word files, and, like another review mentioned, it handles the Table of Contents feature better.  Working with styles and advanced formatting, and newer features like SmartArt, is a total no-go in both programs beyond common formatting tasks.  I ultimately went with Documents To Go as my Android office app of choice because it handles Office 2007/2010 files better. More to the point, comments in documents just don't seem to show up in Quick Office. Documents To Go handles them perfectly.  Why 5 stars and not 4? Honestly, I don't think any Android office app will get 100% MS Office compatability without paying Microsoft a hefty fee. Or if Microsoft makes its own. I doubt either is realistic at this juncture.

0446573019|1.0|If you are a Baldacci fan who enjoyed \\"Absolute Power\\" and the Camel Club series, wait for another book. This one was a huge disappointment. The main character, Puller, is a thinly disguised imitation of Lee Child's hero, Jack Reacher. The dialogue is cliched and unrealistic. The plot is predictable and boring. A few times, the author slipped from the POV of the main character to that of a supporting character, Cole, the local female sheriff. I sensed within the first few pages that this was going to be a miss, but I'd paid 12 bucks (the kindle version) and tried valiantly to get my money's worth.   The book adds weight to a conspiracy theory that someone else is ghost-writing Baldacci's work. Try comparing the writing of \\"Absolute Power\\" or one of the Camel Club books with this one or \\"Simple Genius\\", another flop, and you'll see what I mean. Or better yet, spend your hard-earned bucks on Lee Child's latest and get your money's worth.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|When I first opened the box, I thought to myself....How much did I overpay for this?  This, in my opinion, is overpriced but it does the job of protecting the screen very well.  The felt lined cover protects the screen from scratches and also includes a strap to hold it in place.  It's very lightweight and fits the Kindle nice and snug, snug enough that it's a bit difficult to get it back out if needed.  I like the fact that it can be converted into a stand in landscape mode, but the back cover groove could be deeper to ensure a more secure fit, but it does the job.    Overall, it's very light, fits the Fire very well, but a bit overpriced.  Take $20 off the top and it's a great deal.
1451627289|5.0|Like many reviewers, I came of age with Stephen King. My first prom coincided with Carrie's, although mine was slightly less bloody. As much as I enjoyed his earlier novels, I stopped, for no particular reason, at the Dark Tower series. I also love time-travel books, especially Jack Finney's magical From Time to Time as well as Time and Again. I enjoyed Richard Matheson's Bid Time Return, as well of several of Ray Bradbury's novels in this genre. Finally, my earliest memory is of the Kennedy assassination. I was three years old, and remember being baffled by both of my parents crying simultaneously while viewing something on the TV screen.<br /><br />It is with this background that I obtained 11/22/63 in its first week of publication. I'll read a couple of chapters a day, I thought to myself.  Wrong. I could not put this book down. Productivity in every other area of my life? Zero.<br /><br />Stephen King still has \\"it\\" in him: He can mesmerize the reader into turning the pages, regardless of what horrors await. For fans of It, King revisits Derry, Maine, and reintroduces readers to a few of its main characters. For those who crave King's famously gory details, they will be somewhat sated. For anyone who wants a thought-provoking ride through history, they will gobble up this novel like a 1950s soda made with Coca Cola syrup.<br /><br />King's protagonist, Jake Epping, is convinced by a terminally ill friend to travel back in time by way of a portal in his friend's old diner. King's descriptions of 1958 Maine are vivid, alternately charming and sinister. He does not wax nostalgic about the good old days, as his 1958 Maine is filled with gritty characters, air pollution and obsessive smokers. Finney's From Time to Time truly captures the magic and wonder of what it would be like to return to a long-gone day.<br /><br />Dallas is not a pretty place either, yet Jake's life takes a turn for the better when he meets the lyrically beautiful Sadie. Traveling as George Amberson, Jake and Sadie progress toward their goal of killing alleged Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald before Oswald has a chance to kill the president.<br /><br />Although one of the novel's themes is \\"what might have been,\\" another theme is \\"the past is obdurate.\\" The past does not take kindly to visitors from 2011. Jake learns this lesson the hard way, on a road paved with speed bumps ranging from diarrhea to gangsters.<br /><br />Can Jake's actions impact one of America's darkest days?  And can a different outcome influence America's future for the better?  Don't bet on it. Will you put this book down after reading a few pages?

B0060V1WJ6|1.0|I cannot believe the positive reviews for this movie.  I rented it based on the number of five stars it received here.  It was disgusting.  I'm surprised that these otherwise great actors thought this script was a good idea.  This movie is messed up.  I'm sorry, but the babysitter/son/husband plot made me sick to my stomach.  This is what passes for quality entertainment these days?  Crazy and stupid indeed.

All I can say is, it was a well written suspenseful novel with that Stephen King flair that makes him the amazing author he is. I had a hard time putting this one down! It has a likable main character, your \\"everyman\\" type that is put in an extraordinary situation and has to cope with both the successes and failures that come along with it. I would definitely recommend this one, and I think its one of the better ones of his in recent years too.

B005K8QIS0|5.0|These mysteries explore survival, how we hold ourselves together despite terrible circumstances. The lead character is haunted by the death of his sister, many years ago. Jason Isaacs, of Lord Malfoy fame in Harry Potter, is superb as Jackson Brodie. Edinburgh, Scotland, is another rich character in this collection of three mysteries, based on Kay Atkinson's books. Isaacs is pitch-perfect, every nuance evoked with subtley. You totally believe his character. The young Millie Innes, who plays Jason Brodie's daughter, is a rare talent. Much is explored about the depth of love between Brodie and his daughter. The last mystery is excellent, with Gwyneth Keyworth as an articulate, remarkable teenage girl with secrets of her own. Keyworth deserves a long career in British film and TV. All three mysteries delve into how past and present merge, how one copes with traumatic memories. The stories have rich narrative landscape and first-class acting. The stormy acting of Brian McCardie (the only bright spot in the last \\"Murphy's Law\\") is another treat. The short interviews with the actors (especially Isaacs), the writer, and producer are worth watching as well, for their articulate intelligence.<br /><br />Thanks to a kind comment on another of my reviews, I tracked down this mysterious offering, as it didn't arise under a search for \\"Scottish mystery\\" in DVDs. You also may enjoy Brenda Blethyn, marvelous as [[ASIN:B0050N0US4 Vera]], rumpled and caustic, in Northumbrian mysteries set in landscapes as filled with light as Vermeer's paintings.

B005KMX866|5.0|If you are a Chris Isaak fan, you will find his new album \\"Beyond the Sun\\" a  real treasure! He is one of the most underrated and unappreciated artists of all times, like many artists we know.<br /><br />As many of his fans know, his musical artistic ability is beyond anything I ever heard next to our favorite icons such as Presley. All previous albums of Isaak entails more of his own song writing; melting and cleverly mixing rockabilly, rock and roll, surf rock, and roots rock. His musical range is so vast that I am still unveiling its meaning in some songs; immersed in his world of beach meets blues especially as a laid back beach girl.<br /><br />Being one of his younger fans, I didn't expect to love his music as much I do. I grew up in the 80s as a teenager and listened to a lot of Pop music, r&b, rap music and well known artists like Madonna, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey and so on etc... I was totally clueless to the world of Rockabilly and Blues because I feel that it was before my time.<br /><br />But Isaak puts a modern twist to his songs. Then all of a sudden with his album release of \\"Beyond the Sun\\", I was actually surprised. His music is written, produced, and played perfect in every way. He sings classics like \\"Pretty Women\\", \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\", and \\"Its Now or Never\\" which shows how versatile his voice can be and sings them as beautiful as the originals. The other tracks are so fun to listen to. You just want to put on a gingham dress, curl your hair, and put on some red lipstick and dance the night away with someone special.<br /><br />If you haven't had the chance to go to one of his concerts, then you are missing out! I was surprised to hear that his voice is exactly the same in person if not better, its sooo magical. Many artists of this generation with voices and lyrics filtered and computer generated, its refreshing to hear the band and his legendary voice.With any record you desire with Isaak, you won't be sorry. It will be hard to turn back, you will become a fan for life!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I have been using Documents to Go for a long time and thought I would give this a try after reading the reviews and it coming up for free.  It seems to be a great app; however, for my needs, which are mainly for Word documents viewing and editing as well as PDF viewing,  it is lacking.  Documents to Go shows a graphics place holder for inserted pictures that you can tap to see the pic.  This app shows a placeholder but will not show the pic when you tap it.  That killed it for me.

B004LROUNG|4.0|If you're a John Griisham fan, as I am, you'll probably be surprised at how many chuckles and guffaws his latest novel forces out of you. The Litigators, on one level a legal procedural like so many other Grisham works, is also a comedy. Even the title is a joke, as you'll learn once you've made your way into the meat of this book.<br /><br />Grisham's protagonist is 31-year-old David Zinc, a Harvard Law graduate who has slaved away for five years as an associate in one of the country's largest and most sought-after law firms. He makes $300K per year, but still: for 90 hours a week writing bonds to make rich people richer, that's not a fortune. David finally snaps one day and, in a drunken stupor, makes his way to the misbegotten firm of Finley & Figg, a couple of ambulance-chasers (and worse) whose office is next door to a massage parlor. There, he demands that they hire him -- which they proceed to do, on terms entirely favorable to themselves, of course.<br /><br />Working as an associate with Wally Figg and Oscar Finley, David somehow finds himself embroiled in their personal lives as well as in the extraordinary complexity of a mass tort case that Wally has impulsively joined. The main plot that ensues engages this threesome -- none of whom has ever before set foot in a Federal courtroom -- in a massive lawsuit against the third largest pharmaceutical company in the world over a drug called Krayoxx.<br /><br />Grisham's pronounced social conscience comes through clearly in his treatment of the drug's alleged victims, of the company that manufactures it, and of the expensive law firm it has hired: David's ex-employer.<br /><br />The Litigators is a joy to read from start to finish. It's another example of Grisham's fluid writing and solid characterization, and an introduction to the sense of humor that is hidden is most of his previous work.<br />[...]
B0000CD5FN|5.0|One of the best cd's of all time by one of the greatest singer/song writers of all time! A must buy, wont you let down!
B006B31B80|3.0|*spoilers*   Comparing what we have seen so far to the first season, something is missing and this season definitely does not measure up. Where is all the bleakness, horror and urgency that was so dominant in the first season? The desperation of the existential kind? The terror? The interpersonal struggles and drama that never got trite? The first season had a kind of sinister undertone to it. This one feels like a handful of sunshine as it is filled with episodes full of sappiness and sentimentalities and I still cannot get that touchy/feely soap opera style out of my head. This whole thing of drawing out the announcement of the pregnancy to Rick and the \\"who is the father\\" story line are just about two of the most tired clichees out there. They really should not be employing it in a series that set the stage for the zombie apocalypse quite beautifully. It just diminishes its quality.   Yes it is great that the question of \\"should we have a child in this zombie ridden world\\" is posed, but that is also where it should end, rather than turning into melodrama and venturing off into soap territory with that love triangle stuck on top of that. If this had been the same show in caliber and intensity as the first season, Lori would have kept those abortion pills in, instead of throwing them up, resulting in a miscarriage and a sad but \\"this is reality\\" fall out afterwards; like we saw when Amy died. This would have allowed the story to shift from the trite cliche it is now to a story line more appropriate and in better alignment with the mood this show is to convey.   Season 1 was all about survival and getting out of town, being scared all the time that a herd may pass by or a freak might attack you in the most unlikely moment; having to be on constant alert, always in panic mode and  scared of the darkness that was the unknown. It was about pure thrill and moving through this desert of the undead. Now they are all stuck on this farm succumbing to gossip, heart-ache andtheir personal feelings. Dont they have anything else, more urgent, to focus on, like  - I dont know -  survival and finding out what is going on in the world, rather than stick around on this farm and wonder who did whom and how Glenn feels about this girl and how her father feels about them? Blah Blah Blah...  Which brings me to my next point: are they ever going to leave this darn place? Halfway through Season 2 and it has all taken place on this farm under the ruse of looking for a little girl who is probably dead. In fact, looking for this girl seems like a very improbable and rather artificial plot element thrown in from the writers to justify staying on location for this long because there is no way that they would just stick around in one place when there are so many unanswered questions. Remember it has only been about a week since Rick woke up in that hospital. All this has caused the show to become stagnant and invoke even more of that soap opera, boring snoozefest feeling that's been gnawing on my mind. Right now the focus is shifted toward the characters' personal melodrama and the minutiae of their lives.   Moving along is very important here as it adds genuinely new elements and possibly characters to the show, ultimately enriching the experience, rather than making it feel tiresome and slow moving. Being stuck on this farm, doing an exposé on their feelings leaves them with too much time on their hands to start looking around and picking on each other; the ugliness of some personalities begin to seep through, creating drama. Being stuck on that farm is worse than working their way through the land it seems.   On a good note, I like how the writers made the only people in here who are religious fanatics of some sort (is there any other kind) also be the exact same ones who think that zombies are just misunderstood and that medical treatment would make them human again. This juxtaposition of irrationality, first with religion and then with believing that zombies are good, is pretty interesting. It is no coincidence that the same people who, contrary to evidence, think that zombies are misunderstood are also the same ones who, again contrary to evidence, are highly religious and continue to hold on to their backwards religious beliefs in a world taken down by the living dead. The analogy here is striking. I also like the level of depravity we get to see in Shane as his role manifests.   However, I think they seriously need to move on now because something else besides everyone finding out about the walkers in the barn, discussions on babies and puppy love and a showdown between the Herschels and the group has to be the highlight. I think all this is supposed to have taken place on a 3 day period, but it feels like weeks have passed; it is too slow and soapy.   I miss the freakish grimness of the beginning, the terrifying desolation as they pass through empty landscapes and roads selectively populated by zombies, the desperation of days gone by. Now all that seems replaced by old, tired stereotypes, cheesy dialogues and characters you increasingly start to dislike.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Can't tell you how much I loved book 1 and 2 in the series and hated book 3. Without spoiling the ending -- the main characters that I loved throughout the series turned flat and unlikeable. They became two dimensional, pedantic with their views and predictable. I fear the author became more interested in proving her point about violence being bad and stuffing it down everyone's throats than in wanting to end the story with depth and staying true to the amazing characters that she developed throughout the series. Ending felt unfinished and very rushed. Sad to see things end this way.
0765348276|4.0|I have seen other reviews comparing this book to Forever War and I think that there are some very close similarities, however it does have enough originality to make it stand on its own merits.   When Joe Haldeman wrote his book back in the '70s, technology had not advanced to the level that Scalzi had the advantage of exploiting.   This is my first Scalzi read, and based on this one I will certainly read more from this author.
B002OSY2T6|1.0|My son likes to spin this toy while he sits up. He walks now but had it before he could crawl and when he started to crawl. And never pushed it or was interested in pushing it. The biggest problem I have with this toy is that its annoying. The motion senor in it is very sensitive and if you walk to close to it the snail sings, in a high pitch voice. The ratio of my song enjoying it, it benig educational to it being annoying is overwhelming more annoying. Theres better toys out there for your dollar.
B004LROUNG|5.0|The real John Grisham is back. Loved the Rainmaker and this is reminiscent. The characters are fun and charming, though at times dubious. Love the against the big guys angle. So happy!
B006B31B80|5.0|As a huge fan of the comic book, I can definitely say that the television adaption is fantastic. Incredible cast, perfect pacing, and easily one of the best television dramas ever produced.   Coming at it from the perspective of the comic, my interests are entirely in the characters and the writing. I'm super happy that it hasn't turned into an action driven zombie gore fest. Quite frankly, zombie attacks week after week would make it lose any impact and the show would quickly degrade into writers focusing on new ways to split a zombie open. If you want that, there are dozens of zombie films you can see.  Thankfully, The Walking Dead is focusing on what it does best in its comic counterpart and that's character development and exploring what and who you/they would become in a post apocalyptic-like world. Would it be all about yourself, would you risk everything to save a little girl you only just met, would you kill yourself, would you panic and freeze up, would you become a leader, would you become a follower. Putting characters through every emotional wringer and challenge you can dream up is what makes the best story telling and in my opinion The Walking Dead is scoring super high marks.   I am also quite happy that they are letting the characters develop in unique ways that differ from the comics. The story so far is following core plot points from the comic, but as we have seen with more than one character's life and others deaths, it's not following the same fates that the printed characters have and I'm extremely thankful for that. It's successfully recapturing the joy I get from reading the comic and not knowing what is coming next and always being surprised.   Robert Kirkman is a truly one of today's best comic writers and if you are a fan of this show for the characters then do yourself a favor and buy all of the The Walking Dead comics. Then pick up Astounding Wolf-Man and Invincible both by Robert Kirkman as well. And then pick up some Alan Moore and some Brian K. Vaughan and some Garth Ennis and some Jeff Lemire, etc.
0670022411|3.0|It was a really fun read until about 3/4 of the way through. I think the struggle Diana has to embrace her true power is something everyone can probably relate to on some level.  The last part of the book seems like an afterthought and overkill. Although I like the premise of the next book, I'm not sure if I'll read it. Some stories are more powerful in one book.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|As other reviewers have written, this album is amazing and you should just buy it. I bought the 2-CD import and love every track.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|This is the worst sounding album I think I have ever heard.  Me and my band mates in high school made better music sitting around while drunk.  Anyone who pays money for this simply because the name Metallica is on it is a fool.  I am glad to see after a successful Death Magnetic this is how they waste their time instead of recording another quality album.

1451648537|5.0|I have finished this book, and can say after thinking about it for a little while, that of all the people in the world I have known and learned about, that Steve Jobs ranks in the top ten people I admire and am in awe of. Despite learning negative things about him, of which came as no surprise to me, I still hold my impression of him I have always had. That impression is he is a leader, innovator, motivator and one of my lifetime's most influential person. I have always loved Apple, but I have always felt connected to that company despite not knowing anyone there. That connection is due to Mr. Jobs, and his products. Thank you Steve Jobs for all you did, and I hope he had some peace in his life. Great book, with many details and stories that do not hold back anything about this man. Truly an honest biography was written.
0439023521|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this book at first because usually top hit books are not that good (in my opinion) but I was way off with this book. It was amazing! And very hard to put down :) I was very addicted that I read this book before any of the others and found myself thinking of it constantly when I was working. Lol, couldn't wait to go on breaks, lunches, and just get home so I could read more. A definate book to read and a great addition to your book shelf at home.<br /><br />All in all this was a fantastic book and I can't wait to read the next one! Hope you love it as much as I did! Enjoy!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]
1932907009|5.0|I had heard great things about this book and invested in it.  First, I am not a screen writer.  But I am a marketing copywriter that must create stories that engage the mind.  This was one of the best books I had read on this subject. Thorough and a step-by-step plan for writers who want to make an impact with their writing.  I highly recommend this for every writer!

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|this is a cool app for the fact that its a word processor and their aren't that many out there. this app however wont let me printer (unless theirs a magic button I'm missing) I have this app on the kindle fire (which is cool but has some draw backs)  and I thought since itbwas Winfield I could connect to a Sufi printer but alas no. there is no easy way to copy either..
0143038419|1.0|I thought this book would be good because it was made into a movie.  That is not the case. I could not even finish this book it was so bad. I usually can read any type of books. I even gave it to a friend to read and she could not get through it either. I didn't even bother with the sequel to it. Not worth the money.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I pre-ordered the album on Itunes, and got it in on Monday night, and I haven't stopped listening to it since.  It really is the best album so far. It feels a lot more authentic Daughtry and less influenced by other bands. Chris Daughtry was absolutely my favorite American Idol of all time, and I feel like was the kind of stuff he did on the idol stage, which made me fall in love with his voice and creativity!   This album also got me appreciating the whole band a lot more. Chris has always been the star for me, but in this album, I really started appreciating and loving everyone else's, especially the amazing job done on the drums by Robin Diaz.  My absolute favorite song is \\"Losing My Mind\\", which shows off Chris's amazing vocal range better than I've ever heard it. Other favorites include \\"Gone too soon\\" which had me in tears the first three times I heard it, \\"Break the Spell\\", and the lyrics of \\"Crazy\\" just tell such a great story. I hope for any of these great hits to be their next single! And \\"Lullaby\\" is such a tender, beautiful ballad to his children, it really gave it such a personal touch!!  Overall, I am giving this album a 5, only because a 10 isn't available! Like I said, it's just the most personal, most pure sound I've ever heard from Daughtry. I'm so impressed, not surprised at all though, at the growth they have gained in such a short time since debuting.  Thanks for the amazing music!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Really like this album from the great rockers PEARL JAM!!!!All the songs are great, with gems like WORLD WIDE SUICIDE, COMATOSE, SEVERED HAND and MARKER IN THE SAND!!!! WELL DONE, PEARL JAM!!!!!
B004FOA84A|3.0|Good puzzles, and even my 4-year-old enjoyed it.  However it's too short, and too big.  Fun while it lasted, but uninstalled.
B000002BYD|5.0|Yield is a great rock album from PEARL JAM...i think is their best album since after the masterpieces TEN and VS , and i really enjoy all the songs with some classics like GIVEN TO FLY, DO THE EVOLUTION and WISHLIST...This is one of the best from PEARL JAM!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
B006B35C80|5.0|I really admire Peter Florek's gambit in this show.  He suspects that Will Gardner is as morally bankrupt as he is.  He is setting up a prosecution of Will for some very dicey dealings he had with  judges and gambling. But I suspect he is doing it to show that Will has no more loyalty to Alicia than he did. He suspects, as do I, that Will Will dump Alicia in order to save himself. And what I expect to see happen is for Alicia to runright over to Michael J. Fox's law firm and take him up on his job offer from last season. And that will upset everyone's apple cart in this show.<br /><br />I am equally fascinated by Peter's mother, who seems to be living in a time warp.  She snoops through Alicia's things,including her computer, to get evidence to use against her to get sole custody for Peter. Peter is surely unaware of this as the last thing he wants is a controversial child custody hearing airing their further dirty laundry. Eli, in fact, would hit the ceiling if he learned of it. The reason Jackie is living in a time warp is challenging the custody of two teenagers, one close to college age, borders on the laughable. Jackie is living back in the fifties or sixties and Eli has already warned her about that.<br /><br />Special mention must be made of Christine Baranski as the other senior law partner.  She is doing a knockout job in her role as Diane Lockheart.
B000002BFZ|5.0|NO CODE is great! Like VITALOGY, you got to listen a few times to grow on you, but when you listen to gems like RED MOSQUITO, HABIT, SMILE, HAIL, HAIL, WHO YOU ARE and LUKIN you see this is another PEARL JAM MASTERPIECE!!!! GREAT GREAT NO CODE!!!!
B005NF2UE6|3.0|I'm a big Nickelback fan and pre-ordered this because I wanted it as soon as possible.  I love to play this type of music loud in my car as I'm heading out to the clubs. There are some good songs on this CD but the vocals are lost in the mix on most of them. The bass line overwhelms everything else at high volumes.  I'm sure I'll get a lot of replay out of this disc but it certainly won't be one of the \\"must have\\" cds that I keep in my car like some of the older Nickelback stuff.
B00005LAGO|5.0|This compilation of SURFER ROSA and COME ON PILGRIM is wonderful! The songs on Pilgrim are absolutely Pixies high lights, mixed with the magic Surfer Rosa creates a perfect collection of Pixies begginings! Wonderful album!
0062060554|5.0|Great book highly recommend to those who like face pace stories. Its one of those books you just cant put down and it keeps you in suspense the whole time. Great ending I just wished it could have been a little longer and more into detail of what happened afterwards...Other then that I would have to say this is one of my favorite mystery books of the year.
B000003TA4|4.0|Nirvana was one of my favorite bands when i was a teenager, and Nevermind got ALL TIME classics like Smells like teen spirit, Come as you are and Polly...By the time nirvana became a Huge band, there´s many other bands that are WAY WAY WAY better, like Alice in Chains, Faith No More, Pantera and Soundgarden...but nevermind got some real classics, and deserves its space on the all time classic albuns...
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I bought this item to protect my iPhone 4 (my first smartphone!). It is pretty minimalistic, but does a good job of protecting the phone, especially from screen-down drops due to the raised edges around the screen. This seemingly insignificant feature has saved my life (and wallet) a few times. The only downfall is the relative difficulty in removing it. Some may argue I'm being nit-picky but sometimes you feel like you're going to snap it trying to get it off. I've had to fix that stupid SIM card issue a few times, thus prompting the need to remove it. Overall, it's pretty difficult to get buyer's regret from such an inexpensive, yet effective item.
B0000035E7|4.0|BLEACH is a great album, and one real raw one! Before the Masterpiece NEVERMIND, Nirvana was real punk with some heavy metal feeling! I really like BLEACH...It's raw, dirt, a real Grunge album!!!!!!
B0043URV5U|5.0|This is a great two cd set of Bob Segers ultimate hits. I bought it at Best Buy for only $6.99. My favorite songs are Turn The Page, Old Time Rock And Roll, Mainstreet, and Against The Wind.
B000002H72|5.0|I really enjoy all the stuff Pixies create, and the songs of the classic DOOLITTLE are all high points in Pixies career! All the songs are great, with the classics GOUGE AWAY, TAME, WAVE OF MUTILATION, DEBASER and MONKEY GONE TO HEAVEN!!!! If you like Nirvana, you got to check DOOLITTLE!!!!!!
0525423281|3.0|I hate contemporary romance novels and fell in love with \\"Anna and the French Kiss.\\" I didn't love this book. I thought the first half was dreadful. By the second half the story got WAY better. But Stephanie Perkins forgot about one other character in the book--the location. In \\"Anna and the French Kiss,\\" Stephanie Perkins makes you fall in love with Paris, and it's not just because it's Paris the city of love, but because she made it sound so spectacular. Paris was a whole other character in itself. I was looking forward to that in this book and fall in love with San Francisco. But sadly that didn't happen and the story just fell into the category of all the other cliche love stories.  It also bothered me that Lola was a liar. She lies to her parents, her boyfriend, and even herself. It would help if she had built character as more trustworthy throughout the book, but it happened all at one moment. Not to mention her 22 year old boyfriend. Ugh! I know Stephanie was probably trying to give a message to teens saying, \\"sometimes we see what we want to see and not what's real when it comes to relationship.\\" But it still creeps me out.  I also would have liked to see Lola and her mother's relationship progress more. There semi-makeup felt forced.   Overall I thought it was okay, not great, but okay. If Stephanie keeps the location as one of her characters she will go far. I hope \\"Isla's Happily Ever After,\\" will be better.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|This is the most refreshing and inspiring music I've heard in years, and I'm an old guy.  I first heard Bon Iver on an NPR mini concert, live at a college, I think.  It was ragged, but full of life, and drew me to the CD, fantastic, and then backwards, to \\"For Emma,\\" the under-produced, alone-in-the-woods, bare-bones rendering of the beautifully polished \\"Bon Iver\\" album.  Buy them both and compare, Bon Iver and For Emma.
B005LCECU6|3.0|This recording is absolutely ruined by an over enthusiastic sound engineer somewhere along the line, by malicious use of the stereo pan on the guitar during the recording (or broadcast).   I know it was 1974 and stereo was relatively new then, but this really spoils the listening experience for me.   My fellow reviewer \\"Rushead 2112-Hemispheres\\" is absolutely right in what he / she says, the band are on great form, and playing brilliantly as we know Rush always do! Even the sound quality and mix are exceptional for a recording of this vintage.   I suppose panning the guitar from left to right and back with the beat or with certain phrases and riffs during the performance (or broadcast) was quite exciting on the night, unfortunately it has been captured forever!   Alex's riffs and particularly the solos are flung around the stereo spectrum with wild abandon, some songs are hardly affected but others are just plain annoying to listen to. My advice, listen in mono.  I'm glad I heard this, I'm a massive fan, but I wont be listening to it again.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Songbook is the new live acoustic album from Chris Cornell showcasing his awesome vocals and songwriting ability as performed along his very successful recent solo tour. Chris Cornell is a true survivor of rock having had success with Soundgarden, Audioslave, and three solo albums prior to this amazing collection of acoustic tunes. There was a little taste of what this album contains with the hidden track at the end of his previous solo album but Songbook is definitely what fans of this iconic voice wanted to hear. Highlights include the amazing Temple Of The Dog classic \\"Call Me A Dog\\", the brilliant version of the Audioslave track \\"I Am The Highway\\", the dark sound of Soundgarden's classic track \\"Fell On Black Days\\", and the memorable melodies of the Audioslave hit \\"Like A Stone\\". It is amazing how he can turn relatively simple chord progressions into memorable songs with his powerful voice and interesting lyrics. I saw Chris Cornell perform these songs at The Sydney Opera House recently and I can tell you it was a stunning show and Songbook is a great memento of his tour. What more can be said about Chris Cornell and his decision to please his fans with a gift like this - essential listening!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I don't think I've ever written a review on amazon despite buying literally thousands upon thousands of dollars on this site(You can click on my user id.  As you can see, I really haven't ever written a review), but this is the first one I will write because I truly am moved by this story and movie.  I bought this on the initial day it was released as I had heard about it, and was just dying to see the movie.  I went to best buy, and the guy I asked about it had no idea what I was even talking about.  My wife and I came cuddled up on the couch, and initially we were going to watch the movie, and then go out for a nice night afterwards..... Needless to say, after watching this move, we were in no shape to go out afterwards.  Being a dog owner myself, I could only sit there and look at her throughout the movie, and just think what her life is like from her point of view, and how she feels every day we leave or go out the door, and her level of excitement when we come home everyday.  This is truly a story of unconditional and eternal love, devotion and loyalty.  Something that only dogs and very can truly experience in my opinion.  It's so sad this never had a theatrical release, as it is an amazing movie, and EVERY single person I have ever referenced this movie to, also is amazed by what a touching story it is.  I cried for over 45 minutes of the 90 minute movie.  Heck, I even cried when I watched the two minute trailer.  After I saw the trailer, I knew I had to buy the movie.  I initially thought I was a total weakling, but after showing some of my friends the trailer, they were bawling by the end too.  If you do not cry in this film, I'm convinced you have a heart of stone.  I think the reviews speak for themselves.  5 stars on amazon is no small feat by any stretch of the imagination.  Very few movies/tv shows are able to earn such a prestigious rating.  Just buy the movie.  You will not be disappointed.  Can't believe it took me so many years to write a review, but I was saving it for something truly special.... and this movie is it.    Go play fetch with your dog for a bit after you watch this, and give him/her a hug and treat.
1451648537|4.0|I am and always have been a huge Apple and Jobs fan.  My first computer as a child was an Apple 2E.<br /><br />This Biography was detailed, 570+ pages.  It is thorough, although left me with some questions.  I wonder if Isaacson left them out, or couldn't tease out the very minimal details.  The books is FANTASTIC for about the first half.  The details and story telling to show me how this multi-layed guy was, was great.  The books hits ALL angles.  It's not Steve Jobs propaganda, Jobs only had input on the cover.<br /><br />After the first half it got a little more tedious, but still very cool to see the nitty gritty of his later success, and how he thought.  If you aren't to into Jobs or his story, I would read the first half or borrow it.  If you are riveted by his story, life and career you can't not read it.  I was left wanting more, but was still very satisfied.  Well written (ran into my dictionary a few times) and seemingly unbiased.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|My undergrad students seem to universally admire Mark Cuban, but I suspect for most of them they see him as the enthusiastic NBA owner who they wish owned their favorite team.  This book combines an appealing messenger with a general message that is powerful and spot on: the educational value of those first jobs and the importance of doing one's homework and studying one's profession and the edge that gives you.  Just those two things are valuable messages that students often fail to grasp when they envision their potential careers and this book delivers much more.  Cuban uses matter-of-fact logic to explain how a $20 book or a $7 trade journal or magazine more than pays for itself by generating ideas that might land one more customer.  This ebook is going for $2.99 and I am certain it is a difference maker for some young people who haven't grasped the value of the reading,thinking, and study necessary to be successful.  It might be one of the best value for the money deals I have seen in years.
0439023521|5.0|In \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins tells the story of a brave girl from the seam in district 12, who already had trouble keeping her family going and putting food on the table, when she volunteers for the 74th hunger games so her little sister Prim, who was chosen at the reaping, would not have to fight in the arena. Katniss Everdeen not only has trouble finding who she is herself, but also has trouble finding out who the people close to her really are. In the arena Katniss does not only have to fight the other tributes, but she has to fight the arena along with them, having the arena always throwing new tricks her way and driving her towards the other tributes. Will Katniss make it out and back to her family or will \\"the games\\" take another victim?  We are a group of guys and girls and we are all sophmores in highschool. We read this book for a book club in our language class and all of us really enjoyed it and would give it 5 stars. We all like how it was fast-paced and there are very few dull moments throughout the book, and also how there were many climaxes and excitement that really keeps you reading and makes you never want to put it down. One thing we didn't enjoy about this book was that it did not explain how they got to the place they are living in now very well and would have liked to have a little more of a back story to get caught up on the times that the characters in the book are experiencing. We would recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting book to read or just a good read because we really enjoyed it and think you will too.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I waited in line with another friend to see the midnight show of this and it was worth freezing my butt off for.  =)  I was very happy to see they followed the book so well. There was added detail that we didn't see in the other movies regarding the telepathic connection between the wolves. They did an excellent computer job with making Bella look emaciated when pregnant with Renessmee as well.    There really weren't any bothersome issues with it. My only complaint, and that of my friend, was that they added WAY too much vocal music in areas of the film where orchestra music would've been more appropriate. Picture a musical movie, the guy is having a great chat with a girl and then he ruins it by starting to sing...UGH!  That's the basic gist.  The only other area was when they had the wolves in telepathic mode...the voice over should've been LOUDER and the music background MUCH lower. It was hard to understand what they were saying.  Other than that, the movie was pretty much perfect.   I'm really happy they decided to make two parts out of the book. They ended it in the perfect, albeit predictable spot, which is great b/c it's ending one chapter and starting another.  A must see if you're a fan of the series/saga.
B005TZFYNE|1.0|LOUD WAS SO MUCH BETTER. ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT ON THIS ALBUM IS SEX. I HATE IT. I WANT MY MONEY BACK PLEASE
B005D51II0|5.0|I'm actually not a big fan of box sets containing a potpourri of \\"famous\\" recordings. The two Deutsche Grammophon 111 boxes did not manage to convince me - of course they contain many good and even fantastic recordings by truly great artists, but there are also some strange choices. Moreover, one can hardly call the recent recordings by Lang Lang, Yuja Wang, Alice Sara Ott, Rolando Villazon, Gustavo Dudamel and so on \\"legendary\\". Including these names was obviously a commercial move. The same can be said about Sony's box called \\"25 legendary recordings\\". The \\"RCA Living Stereo\\" box is great, but it contains a lot of mainstream repertoire.  This box is different. There is only one disc which doesn't really belong here (#38, the three tenors) and which has obviously been included for commercial reasons. But oh man, what a great series of discs this is, and for what a ridiculous price. Many of these recording truly deserve the label \\"legendary\\", and some of the choices made by Decca are really interesting and courageous - because a good number of these discs contain \\"difficult\\" music, non-standard repertoire or feature legendary performers which are much less well-known nowadays. This is not just a medley of well-known compositions performed by famous musicians, not at all.   And oh right, this is all about The Decca Sound, right? Obviously the sound quality is *fantastic*.  Some personal highlights:  *Ansermet's recording of \\"El sombrero de tres picos\\"  *Argenta's fantastic LP \\"Espana\\"  *Britten conducting his own \\"War Requiem\\"  *Chailly and the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Messiaen's \\"Turangalila\\" symphony  *Curzon in Mozart's piano concerti KV466 and KV595 (with Britten conducting)  *Dorati in a wonderful Firebird and an even more astonishing Sacre Du Printemps  *Hogwood's version of Purcell's \\"Dido and Aeneas\\"  *Karajan's recording of \\"The Planets\\"  *Kertesz in Dvorak's symphonies 8 and 9  *the wonderful Alicia De Larrocha in Granados and De Falla  *Maag conducting Mendelssohn  *Mackerras in Janacek  *the fantastic Pierre Monteux in \\"Daphnis et Chloé\\"  *my favourite recording of the Goldberg Variations, by Andras Schiff  *Solti's fireworks in Glinka, Mussorgsky and Borodin  *and so on...  Some very courageous and non-standard choices:  *Mehta conducting in works by Varèse and Ives  *Litton conducting Walton's \\"Belshazzar's Feast\\" etc  *the New London Consort in Susato's \\"Dansereye 1551\\"  *the revolutionary recording of Puccini's \\"La fanciulla del West\\"  *the inclusion of Ataulfo Argenta (what a fantastic choice)  *...  What are you waiting for?

1932907009|1.0|I'm a film student in college and I wanted to broaden my screenwriting knowledge. Buying this piece of crap was the worst mistake I've ever made.<br /><br />The only way you are going to write successful screenplays is by writing screenplays and reading screenplays. Then having your screenplays read and criticized. Then you go back to the drawing board.<br /><br />This book explains the basics, it's pretty much \\"screenwriting for dummies\\". This book insults film as an artistic medium and was written to teach you how to sell the script. If you want your name on a film that did as poorly as Blake Snyder's \\"Blank Check\\" then follow this advice.<br /><br />The book does offer some good advice, but don't follow it entirely.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, go read the screenplays of movies like \\"Fargo\\" and \\"Memento\\" which are both extremely outstanding films. Neither of them follow this books \\"advice\\".<br /><br />Also, look at all the other reviews for this book. They are all oddly giving this book 5 star ratings.... I wonder why.<br /><br />Please, please and please! Don't read this book.
B000002W4V|5.0|The best cover art anyway. This is from the period of Transformer,Berlin,Sally Can't Dance, Coney Island Baby and true to form it's totally different from its predecessors. The major selling point is Steve Hunter's intro and the song Sweet Jane. It rocks! The closing cut of Rock n Roll is exceptional,10 minutes long. Lou's vocals fit amazingly. This must have been at the time he was dating the Twins. Oh! to be a fly on the wall back then.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I wish this would have been longer but it was fun and I hope to see more from this developer!
0393339882|5.0|I love this book because the author uses such wonderfully simplistic description of science and experiments that I can follow him most of the time and most importantly, can feel the tension between Einstein, Bohr, Boern, Schrodinger and others over the entangle debate on the meaning of life, the universe and reality. Adding more depth to my entertainment in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe and encouraging me to dig up a text that was hugely popular when I graduated high school: In Search of Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat: Quantum Physics and Reality.<br /><br />This book was fascinating and fun! I do hope they bring Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat to audible.com soon.
B003UYUP58|4.0|I purchased the Hard-copy and kindle version of this amazing book. This book is a very comprehensive and eye opening account on the history and present state of Cancer. The language can get very technical and there are pages that seem to ramble with scientific jargon but overall the book is very readable. I learned so much about this disease that I had never known before. I was left in awe by the enormous power of Cancer and the enormous efforts we have made in fighting this disease. I am personally fascinated by germs and disease and this book satisfied my curiousness as to the complexities. So many of us are affected by Cancer either with a personal battle or one involving loved ones. This book answers so many questions and provides so much insight. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the disease of our generation.   Good: Super informative and interesting, fairly easy to read and understand, very comprehensive    Bad: Medical/scientific terms can be heavy at times
0312576463|2.0|Could have been mildly entertaining at 200 pages. At 600+, it was dull and politically preachy, not challenging or insightful as the hype had suggested. Its lack of editing read as self-indulgent. Only finished it hoping the ending would save it. No such luck.

1451648537|4.0|A fascinating life, portraited in its happy and less happier choices, that made a great man. One who managed to live as he really wanted to, without conforming to stereotypes; listening, instead, to his inner self. Insights. Intuitions. Emotions. The book is interesting because of this strong appeal. It opens up to a different world and diverse attitudes towards life. THINK DIFFERENT!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I first saw this film on a flight bag from Shanghai and was amazed!  Not only are the musicians truly incredible at what they do and have done over their careers but the documentary is pulled together in a way that brings together three very different personalities and musical styles.  If you like guitar, deep soulful music and some really cool back stories you have to check this out!
B004FOA84A|1.0|The graphics are good but I gave up trying to figure out the story line after three hours of going around in circles.  Similar games provide hints to direct you if you get lost in the game but no type of help was provided.  I usually can figure games out eventually but this one was so frustrating I don't even want to open it again.  Save your money and try something else.
B005HSG3U6|2.0|I must admit that when I bought this product, I was expecting an Otter Box type shell that I would feel comfortable if I accidentally dropped my Kindle Fire. This \\"protective\\" cover is a piece of plastic that is highly over priced and had me banging myself on the head with a hammer wishing I had came up with the idea of using less than $0.20 worth of product and turn it in to over 1000% mark-up! Ah, oh well I would return it, but I have a feeling they are all like this flimsy piece! I just hope my Kindle Fire isn't as disappointing as receiving this was. ENJOY!!!
B00007KWHG|4.0|This CD gave me something to compare my Jersey Boy CD to----I like them very much.  Gives me a nice relaxed way to start or end the day in my car.
B00006FDCD|2.0|(There may be minor spoilers herein)<br /><br />The book 'It' is one of Stephen King's most enduring classics even if it is 500 pages too long. He establishes strong characters, strong scenarios, and frightening attacks over 1138 well-developed pages. The book is massive and gets silly at times, like most of King's work, but it still has the strength and power to outlast any minor issue.<br /><br />The movie, on the other hand, is not so good. Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, John Carpenter's close friend (editing Halloween and The Fog amongst other credits), the film lacks the power and depth that the book contained due to it's strange array of actors and overacting children with wooden dialog.<br /><br />There are good parts of the story however. Most of the 'Stand By Me'-esque story is done fairly well, considering. But where the story really seems strong is with the adults; most of the time. The ending is a bastardization of King's original story, making me cringe and wonder why there was ever a 30 year wait to try and destroy THAT evil.<br /><br />But the best part of this film adaptation is Pennywise the Dancing Clown as portrayed by Tim Curry, who plays the murdering vampiric clown with evil glee. He is most definitely the best part of the movie which makes it upsetting when he shows up sporadically. But when he does show up, he most certainly steals the scene.<br /><br />Since this is the only adaptation of 'It' out there, its definitely not the worst thing in the world, like I said, there are good parts. But it doesn't live up to the story and themes in the book. Themes that are as poignant as ever, no matter where and when you grew up. Themes of childhood, adulthood, and corruption. Themes of a dark town that hides it's evil secrets in a blurred past. The movie misses this, even at it's extended length. I can see how the film is loved; it's a nostalgic viewing for many. But for those of us who wish to remove those rose-tinted glasses, we see how flawed the film truly is.
0316017930|4.0|I decided to purchase Outliers based off of several recommendations that I had heard. I had heard great things about Gladwell, and how there are some crazy trends and great analysis to go with it. I had heard about the hockey players being born in the early parts of the year from friends (something Gladwell points out in one of the first chapters) and after hearing how neat it sounded I decided to pick up the book for myself.    My overall feeling after reading this book, was that his analysis was very good, but not exactly \\"great\\". I feel as though Gladwell begins with some analysis that is mind-boggling. In the chapter, The Matthew Effect Gladwell explains how the best Canadian hockey players are almost all born in January. Strangely enough this does seem to be the case, and his analysis why is very interesting. Asserting that the cut-off date is December 31st, being born in January gives more time for development compared to those born later in the year, which don't have those extra few months, which clearly does make a big difference. I felt like the second chapter, The 10,000 Hour Rule also dealt with some good analysis. Gladwell's message was simple in this chapter, in order to be the best at something you need to put in the work. This is backed up with some examples of some of the world's richest people, and the band the Beatles talking about how success was not just given to them; it had to be earned through some hard work and dedication.    The middle of this book lacked a lot of what made the first two chapters so interesting, which were some unique ideas. The next chapter, The Trouble with geniuses talks about how having a high IQ does not always mean success, and being born into a wealthy family generally translates to success later in life. This analysis was nothing new to me. Those with more money are often afforded better opportunities to succeed meaning that they often will succeed because they are \\"set up\\" for this success. The next chapter, listing lessons from Joe Flom essentially summed up the previous two chapters without adding anything new. This chapter was essentially fluff and the chapter after that also seemed to lack the unique analysis that the first two chapters clearly displayed.     This book made yet another turn-around in the Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes. In this chapter it was discussed how in the late 1990's the Korean airline companies were seeing many more plane crashes than normal. Gladwell does some analysis into this and determines that these crashes deal with the culture of the Korean people. In the culture of the Korean people the person of higher authority should not be questioned. In this case the co-pilot would not directly let the pilot know of a problem, but rather insinuate it. This often led to more crashes due to the lack of a system of checks. I found this to be some very interesting analysis by Gladwell. The final two chapters of the book are also pretty well written. In the second to last chapter of the book entitled Rice Paddies and Math Tests Gladwell addresses the stereotype that Asians are good at math. I found it mind blowing once again with his analysis about why they are so strong in the field. The first reason being that they pay very close attention to details and have great discipline due to taking care of rice paddies, and the second is because unlike English they do not exceptions and irregularities when it comes to numbers. While this analysis may seem a little strange and farfetched, it does make some sense and is very interesting analysis. The final chapter in this book is called Marita's Bargains. In this chapter the regression of material remember during summer break is discussed (with regards to school aged children). In lower and middle class families, this is even more the case than in the upper class. The reason Gladwell gives for this is that the upper class children are afforded more opportunities to in a respect \\"exercise\\" their brains over the summer by taking part in classes such as computer classes and other intellectually stimulating activities. This analysis is very unique, but does seem very true. When worked out the brain increases in knowledge and is \\"warmed-up\\". When the brain is functioning the entire summer it is easier to get back into the swing of things when fall roles back around and school starts back up.    Overall this book turned out to be rather dazzling and loaded with interesting analysis. The middle of the book lacked analysis that was mind-boggling, however the amount in the beginning and the end of Gladwell's work was superb. Many of the topics addressed included analysis that seems logical, but does not usually come to mind at first thought. Gladwell dazzles readers with this book, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning about why certain things in the world are the way they are.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These headphones are a great deal- strong but not overpowering bass (unless EQ'd), very responsive mids and sparkly highs. But the thing that matters most for me is that you get excellent separation and clarity with a pair of midrange cost headphones. I listen to everything from Bach to Minor Threat and these, along with a new non-apple music player, have provided excellent sound. I've actually noticed things in songs I love that I'd not been able to hear before. These headphones are also very comfortable and surprisingly light for their size. I am now an AKG fan.
1936850028|5.0|Beyond Birkie Fever was one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read!!!  And I do not do the Birkie!!  But I am one of the Birkie's biggest fans, and most loyal cheerleader.  But this book is not just for skiers.....it is inspiration, laugh out loud humor, and remembering when you did anything to do your favorite thing.  It just so happens that the favorite thing in this book is skiing.  The crazy adventures that go hand in hand with a great friends, and the fun of life with these great friends, brings back wonderful memories of your own.  It starts you thinking of favorite things that you might want to pursue once again.  Beyond Birkie Fever takes you around the world as one young man finds adventure, true sportsmanship, friendships, and family.  It ultimately brings you back to your roots, which is the source for all real happiness.  A great Christmas gift to yourself, and others!!  p.s.  I look forward to more books by Walter Rhein!!

B000002J03|5.0|I listen to a lot of classic rock and over the years and I have discovered that nearly every album made by any great artist has at least (if not a few) one song that isn't so great. So far there is not one song that I hate/dislike in this entire album. This is a must by for anyone who is a fan of classic/hard rock.<br /><br />It is truly sad that today's music still can't compare (or even come close) to the great music of such artists from back in the day. Anyone who doesn't appreciate this kind of music has not heard it or is very ignorant.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|A full version of this review with pictures included is located at Gaming Bus.  999 is a text-heavy puzzle adventure game. Those who go into it expected mostly puzzles and little text will be greatly surprised to find the ratio radically opposite. This is by no means a bad thing because the game is strongly plot-driven--so much so, in fact, the player is compelled to keep going for hours in order to answer the questions that arise in this enthralling story.  The amount of text in this game is enormous: if you don't enjoy reading, no matter how good the plot is, this isn't the game for you. However, if you don't mind spending a lot of time reading the text, then read on--you're in for a treat.  999 starts by throwing you into a puzzle: You're locked in a room on a ship. You have no idea how you got there, but the window cracks and your room starts flooding--you must seek a way out! This immediately gets you acquainted with the puzzle gameplay. The game does a good job of telling you how the mechanics work, and this first puzzle gives you more hints than the later ones. Since I never open instruction manuals except to look at art, I initially found this very useful--but I've played puzzles games before, so I quickly adapted and then found the continued instruction useless. It doesn't quite tell you how to solve the puzzle, but it tells you how each puzzle presented in the room works. Thankfully, this only occurs in the first puzzles; later ones give you some hints but don't walk you through them. Still, this extra instruction may have been necessary for beginners who have never played a puzzle game like this before.  The puzzles in the game are challenging, but not so difficult as to make you spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure them out. I heartily enjoyed solving these the first time, but since the game requires at least two playthroughs to get the true ending, I really wish there were a way to skip through the puzzles. Often, they require a number code that I can't recall off-hand despite knowing how to solve the rest of the puzzle. This usually means I have to sit for a minute and do some basic calculations to get the code again (simple math is a recurring theme in the game), and then proceed to move on.  The fact that the game requires two playthroughs may sound ridiculous, tedious, and suspiciously like a stupid attempt at gaining replay value. It's not! I thought it was going to be a pain when I started the game, but after your first playthrough, the game introduces a mechanic that allows you to speed through the enormous amounts of text you've already seen at an incredibly fast rate. Additionally, the game will automatically stop your text-skipping at dialogue you haven't seen before, which prevents you from accidentally missing things you want to read. This does not allow you to skip through the puzzles, but once you've done a puzzle the first time, it becomes relatively trivial to complete it a second time. It's also guaranteed that you'll experience different puzzles each time if you do only the two playthroughs required to get the true ending.  There's also a practical reason to get all of the endings: the plot. There is a lot of dialogue and character development that doesn't occur unless you take certain routes. In order to get the most out of the game, the best method would be to achieve all the \\"bad\\" endings, then the required ending, and then the true ending. The true ending also justifies the bad endings, although to avoid spoilers, I can't elaborate on this. At the end of the day, the bad endings are just as amazing as the true ending and well worth the minimal amount of time it takes to achieve them all. If you've already played through the game once, achieving the three \\"bad\\" endings takes about four hours.  The plot in this game is phenomenal. As mentioned before, the game is heavily plot-driven and text-heavy, but it will consistently leave you desiring more. It's relatively easy to lose track of time--if I had nothing else to do, I'd find myself playing for six hours or more before realizing how much time had passed. Thankfully, you can save at literally any point in the game, even in the puzzles, so when you're pressed for time this is still a viable game to pick up. The character development is strong, but the game really shines in hitting you with unexpected twists and tying everything together. After completing the true ending, I had only a couple unanswered questions. Thankfully, Aksys Games posted an interview with the developer that tied up these loose ends, leaving me with high hopes for another game. Chunsoft is delivering on this premise, but a release date in Japan or elsewhere remains to be seen.  Overall, the best way to describe this game would be visual novel meets mystery puzzle adventure. It's a collaboration of several genres and executed almost flawlessly. The gameplay is fun, the puzzles are challenging, the music is great, and the plot is utterly fantastic; you will be on the edge of your seat constantly waiting for the next plot twist. The only way this game could've been any better would have been if some of the cutscenes were voiced or fully animated, be it CGI or not. Aside from this, others may find issue with the fact that the puzzles are somewhat sparse in comparison to the text, but given the basis of the storyline, this is a bit justified. In the end, this was easily the best game I've played in a long time.  PROS  * Phenomenal storyline  * Good character development  * Challenging puzzles  * Good soundtrack  * Good replay value  CONS  * Text-heavy: May discourage some gamers  * Puzzles somewhat sparse in comparison to text  FINAL SCORE: A
B005NKIQ26|4.0|Justin Bieber's voice has changed since the last time I heard one of his songs. I'm 20 years old and purchased this CD. My boyfriend made fun of me and asked if I was 12. Honestly though, I like it a lot. His duet with Mariah Carey is kind of corny, other than that I like the CD.
B005ORVMT2|4.0|First off I would like to say, being an ardent RUSH fan for over 30 years, and have collected every version of cd and vinyl releases, this set is by far the best quality it has ever sounded, it is clear and superb sounding, very crystal,no hiss, and the best . My problem lies in my cd copy of FLY BY NIGHT !and if any of you have the same problem PLEASE point it out! On the tracks of ANTHEM, FLY BY NIGHT, RIVENDELL ,and IN THE END, there are glitches on the songs, and I can't tell if it's a disc defect or a manufactuer defect, so if anyone else has the same problem , please speak up, before I take this back for exchange.  Other than that, this set does deserve a five star rating, this is by far the best and the DVD AUDIO of FLY BY NIGHT sounds fantastic even on my old style tv.I do wish they would have added the rare long awaiting first single NOT FADE AWAY/YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT\\".( yes I know it was not a MERCURY release) , but nevertheless, it would have been a gem to add that on this set.  I will now listen to Sectors 2 & 3 and give my review there, To all RUSH fans , BUY THESE SETS.!!!
B0055S348W|1.0|Showing v6.0.5 but when installed it's actually only v5.8.5.  Clearly they aren't being honest.  They seem to update their product in the Android Market though, just not here.  So if you purchased it from Amazon,  you're really getting short changed on updates... as with what many developers are doing.  Note to developers, be honest and spend the extra couple minutes to support your product here.
B005ORVMCY|5.0|just finished listening to Sector 2, and like Sector 1, the sound is the cleanest, crisp, mastering ever for any Rush catalog to be placed on cd, ( Finally) Never has A Farewell to Kings , Hemespheres, and Permanent Waves sounded so fantastic. As For Moving Pictures, well this is the same version ,that was just released a few months back in a special deluxe edition, so for those who already have that one, well then you know that it is already superb. listening to Signals on sectore 3, but I'll save that for the S# review.
B004G600A4|5.0|I would definetly order from here again,price was great recieved it in a very appropriate amount of time,I love amazon I have bought here before and will again
B003IMMEKG|4.0|Let's get this straight. Amazon is selling this item for $28 when it is available for $14 on Amazon UK's site (plus $3 shipping to the US). (Prices as off the date of this review)<br />I guess that is not as bad as the $37 that Amazon US is charging for the other Schwarzenegger Blu-ray \\"Raw Deal\\" which is also available for $14 on Amazon's UK site (plus a nominal shipping fee to the US).<br />People who don't bother checking Amazon's UK site before shopping for these import Blu-rays only have themselves to blame.<br />The movie here is a true guilty pleasure. The main attraction - let's be honest is seeing Brigitte Nielson in her first leading role. The entire vehicle is there simply as a vehicle to show of her amazing physique.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I'm a huge Star Wars fan... the whole conventions, toy collecting and watching the movies 200+ times each thing. To be totally honest the thing I really wanted to see the most on the blu-rays were the extras... with special interest in the deleated scenes. I thought that the secenes where going to be more \\"completed\\". They all look bad with the exception of the one where Luke is building the lightsaber.  For the movies themselves the sound and video are amazing! But if I had known that the deleted scenes were so badly transfered I would have only bought the Original Trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI).
B005HSG3TC|5.0|i had this case for a few weeks now and i have no complaints. Works great and made of great quality.
0679882820|5.0|My daughter loves loves loves this book.  Every night, before her 8 o'clock bed time we pull out the basket o' books as we call it, and my 13 month old always pulls out this book.  I emphasize the sounds and rhymes so she absolutely loves it.  I love reading this book to her too.  I think it's become my favorite also. Now, I recite the pages without even looking at the words as I turn the pages, and point to the pictures describing each object.  I read it so much I know the entire book by heart.  I even use the book as a learning tool when we are out, since I know the book by heart.  Pointing to real objects in the world that resemble the objects in the book. So when I recite the words without the book she gets really excited, and looks at me like \\"Mom, how did you do that\\" LOL  Great book.  I highly recommend it.
0062103377|5.0|After last week's episode, I really wanted to read this book to see if there might be some hint as to what's going to happen with Bobby since I heard this author works for the tv show.  I know the books stray some from the series but David Reed definitely captured Bobby's voice.  It was a fun and quick read and it just made me love Bobby more than ever.  I hope that he's going to be okay!  Either way, I definitely recommend this book if you are a fan of the show and, especially, if you love the relationship the boys have with Bobby.  If they kill Bobby off, you're gonna need all the Bobby you can get!
B000002JSR|4.0|This is for fans only maybe.  It's a release of leftovers and b sides.  Ignore the twits who put this down as it's not supposed to be a REGULAR release.  These type of releases are for fans who want the unreleased material. I would RATHER HAVE that then it sit in a vault rotting away. TWITS please go away. You get some great to decent led zep songs here and fans will awnt this as part of their collection. Non fans might skip this one and buy a greatest hits package. But for fans in 1982 this was a welcome number of songs to hear. And technically this band was started in 1963 when it was called the YARDBIRDS, they changed their name to become this band. IF you don't collect that band then you don't have the whole picture.  In fact songs like 'white summer'were recorded by the earlier version of zep. (yardbirds), So if you are a zep collector then you'll enjoy this one.  Casual fans may not though as this is NOT a regular release but a COLLECTION of outtakes and such. BUt the sound quality is excellent.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I don't even have my old radio alarm clock plugged in. This thing is the bomb-diggity! Seriously, what I love about it is...well, everything. But especially doing math to snooze or dismiss. The problem with traditional alarm clocks is all you have to do to snooze is roll over and fumble for the button. This old fashioned fumbling and button pressing does not require you to actually start to wake up. If I have to do math to snooze or dismiss, then I have to open my eyes (or at least one) and THINK...that starts the wake up process.<br /><br />Love the almost silent to extremely loud progression of the alarm, as well. I will note that one time I tried \\"hard\\" for the math and actually had to get up and find pen and paper to answer the particular math problem that cropped up on the phone. (they're not all equally challenging) That actually made me laugh! Anyway, I love this app - LOVE IT! It's free and awesome and I'd even pay for it if it didn't do everything I want it to now! (it does have ads, but I never notice them)<br /><br />One note, make sure your alarms are off if you are going somewhere you don't want to have to do math to turn the alarms off! Accidentally had one on the other day during an insurance class, had to leave the room, that was embarrassing! :P
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The price is amazing at $48 - which makes it $6/dvd! There aren't any extra features, but I got this for the movies. I don't watch special features or extended versions, so it fit the bill. I knew I should get this since WB will no longer be producing the movies after December this year, which will put the cost through the roof! My hubby will be very happy to get these for Christmas! Shipping time was excellent, I got it about 4 days after ordering with free standard shipping.
B005QBKXOQ|4.0|While I followed Chris Daughtry (like everyone else) from Idol days, the band itself continues to play it safe.  Not under estimating that this isn't a good release, it's just that it follows in line with the tunes of his second album and sometimes, at least, for me, I am wanting something more and something big.  What I liked about some of the debut release was the rock element.  These next two albums are very polished and very commercial (radio) friendly.  Not that it's a bad thing, but I believe Daughtry and band mates could deliver an awesome \\"rock\\" album if they wanted to.  But, with the record industry the way it is, regardless if the band is writing the songs or not, Daughtry might not have much say in the matter especially after the sales of his sophomore effort.  Compared to his debut, they were dismal and that says something right there.  Bottom line though is, if you're a fan of Daughtry's voice and the architecture of the songs he creates, there's really nothing that you won't like with the release of his third album.

If you like to read laying down you can only hold the fire 1 or 2 ways. I just had to find a different holding position to read. Other than that it's great for protection.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|There are four missing scenes that need to be added to the movie.  1.when deckard went to see holden the first time in the hospital.  2.Leon standing in front of the asian symbol before he meet Roy.  3.The hot love scene of deckard and Rachel which was cut from the original print.  4.And of course the the scene of deckard and rachel driving through the mountains  and forrest.  You would then have the greatest movie of all time!
0307891402|5.0|This guide sets a new standard for game guides. It's answered every question I've had without a single inaccuracy. Every quest is covered, every beast, every ingredient, every skill book location, not to mention dungeon maps, gear tables, character builds, etc.  The author has managed to document every little detail of the game (as far as I can tell) and get it right. Bethesda ought to hire this guy and make him the head of quality assurance, because he's clearly an OCD perfectionist detail-freak of rare order. Which isn't to say the guide is just a cold hard list of facts: the tone is engaging and even humorous at times. It's actually a pleasure to read.  Oh, and it has a good index, which makes it much easier to find what you're looking for.  This guide is a must buy for anyone who wants to dig into the depths of this game, if you don't mind getting a little help along the way.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|Totally unbelievable! Who wrote this junk? I had to force myself to keep reading. So many contradictions. I think the author was drunk. He even seemed to forget what he wrote, sometimes repeating the same story several times.
1400069181|5.0|This book is revolutionary.  If you are planning on starting a business or non-profit, this book will inspire you.  The section on overcoming fear and suggestions for starting a non-profit are especially helpful.  I want to start a non-profit, but was hesitant because I couldn't figure how to ensure 100% contributors money went straight to charitable work and not administrative costs. This book solved it brilliantly by using the example of charity:water. If you want  an inspiring read or a road map on starting a business or non-profit of your own. This book is a must read!
0439023521|5.0|This is the best trilogy I have ever read. So depressing as it goes, with only a little here and there, a litany of trials and horror that reflect the horrors that war inflicts on people. I've never read a better peace entreaty, or incentive to not get into that government situation in the first place.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Program seems ok. But key process is a pain. Tried several times to install on Droid X2, but ads still came up. Finally installed & tried again, and it worked. After key install, purchase box remains prominent. Not sure this sets itself apart from other similar products.  And of course, it installs two icons to the All Programs menu as well. Needs some re engineering.

B005JU5JTI|1.0|Wow. This movie is awful. I don't know if the people that made this movie expected the audience to sympathize with the main character, but it is impossible. She is a horrible person. Now, in other movies this type of character could be likable if they are at least funny, but that was not the case with this movie. Everything she did was horrible and selfish and SHE GOT AWAY WITH everything. Drugging and blackmailing a superintendent, cheating on standardized tests, not teaching her class anything for a whole school year, stealing someone else's boyfriend, stealing money from the school; she gets away with all that and more. Ugh what a disgrace of a movie. Definitely skip this one. I think the whole point of the movie was for Cameron Diaz to show off her body.
B004SBBDB2|4.0|This cable is great for showing videos from my IPad 2.  It took me quite a while to get it hooked up correctly.  It could be that I am just not very electronically minded.  I thought it would show all my pictures from the Ipad but it doesn't....only the videos.  Maybe I have it hooked up incorrectly & will keep working with it.  As for the videos , it does a fantastic job.  It is great for a crowd to view.  I look forward to showing holiday videos to the whole family from the TV.  A great product for video viewing and maybe I can learn to do more with it.
B005WY8YZW|5.0|AWESOME album. Big change from previous 2 albums. SUPER GREAT production, especially since it was done in a wince cellar! Do yourself a favor a pick this up, I swear you won'r be disappointed!

0439023513|2.0|I have to say that The Hunger Games books were probably the best thing I have read this year...until Mockingjay. I wish I haven't read the third book at all. It was so depressing and I cried for an hour over the mutilated characters that were once so lovely and nice and funny. I seriously recommend you to avoid Mockingjay, because it destroyed the whole series for me, and I don't think I'll be able to touch them again.  *SPOILER*  How to get started. The first part of the book was okay-ish. I understood that Katniss was depressed because of Peeta and all. Oh I so anxiously waited for the return of Peeta. But I wonder why she didn't try to jump into the action and tried to save him the minute the Capitol captured him. And how no one even tried to save Peeta, and then jumped head-first when their little mockingjay stopped singing. And why oh why did Gale volunteered? He owes the boy nothing.    And then Peeta returns and Katniss is all happy and he tries to strangle her. Helluva twist there. I was fine with hijacking. I thought Peeta might be himself over a while. At least a shade of himself. But he was never the light boy that made the first books wonderfull, and shed a light on Katniss.      The ending blew hard. First we get the ''Real or Not Real'' and dandelion blah blah, Peeta can give me a good life yadda yadda. And BAM epilogue! Katniss and Peeta will never be happy again. Peeta made her  to give birth to nameless boy 1 and nameless girl 2. Gale gone, mother gone, Haymitch gone, Johanna gone. Prim dead on the most retarded reason ever.  I like to imagine a ghost writer writing the epilogue and moppy Katniss and bad writing and twisted plot, and Suzanne the rest.     I think I'd rather have them killed on one of the unimaginative pads in Capitol, rather be shells of themselves. Because I loved them, I did. And I died along with their personalities.  Don't read the books I say. If you need to finish them, and can't stop at first, consider yourself warned. You will regret it. It will make you depressed and dull. And the awesomeness of the first book does not redeem the butchered last book.

B006B31B80|4.0|This was a great episode. It had sufficient amounts of drama and interpersonal conflict. Also, people who love to see zombie-head-explosion, got a fine dose of that.<br /><br />I have trouble with the silly gender politics on the show. So, Andrea shoots like a girl. Then she has sex with Shane after he teaches her to be tough.<br /><br />Also, even though the morning after pill is not an \\"abortion pill,\\" that's what one character describes it as. Plus, Rick and his wife view the medicine with disgust (she vomits it kneeling in the dirt; he blows a gasket). If you cannot have an abortion while dodging homicidal zombies - when can you?<br /><br />I am very disturbed about the prospect of a pregnant Lori. Imagine the unnecessary male heroics that will center around protecting a pregnant white woman. It's already bad enough having 5 episodes dedicated to searching for a missing white girl.  A pregnant Lori will send male paternalism into high orbit.<br /><br />Also, the women on the show are behaving like stereotypes. They are all neurotic. One minute Shane has angered Andrea to the point that she runs from him. Within a few minutes, she's grabbing his crotch ready for sex. Lori wants the morning after pill so badly, that she asks Glenn to go and fetch them. Next, she is throwing them up and crying to Rick.  Glenn's sudden girlfriend goes with him to fetch the meds and then has a complete breakdown and slams the \\"abortion pills\\" on the table. She also goes crazy from the prospect of losing Glenn (whom she only recently met).  Glenn is trying to have a serious discussion with her and she suddenly starts kissing him passionately. Huh?<br /><br />Oh, and now the old guy is jealous because he apparently could smell sex all over Shane and Andrea. Women as property. Boring.<br /><br />I still give it a 4. If these elements continue to dominate, I am going to get bored very quickly.
0374532990|5.0|Improbable yet true, the story of the High Line's making is among the greatest urban dramas of our time.  In easy, conversational style, in the authentic voices of co-founders Robert Hammond and Joshua David, this book provides an uncommonly candid look at what it takes to turn an unloved liability into one of the most vibrant city parks on the planet. It's a compelling read, and I literally could not put it down until finished. Beautifully illustrated and told with humor and generous spirit, it is a story of vision, of leadership, of inspired collaboration. For anyone who loves New York, it provides a richly detailed glimpse into the dynamics of this often unfathomably dynamic city. For anyone anywhere who values parks and other public landscapes and wishes there were more of them, it is an extraordinary tale of hope and possibility. For those working to bring a bit of the High Line's magic to their home towns, this book is essential reading.
B0050XFY4O|3.0|Some of the other reviewers are disgusted by this film. I think their disgust is unwarranted. I watched the movie thinking their comments were overly dramatic. I still do, but I am not impressed by this movie.<br /><br />The topic of adult incest is very explosive -- even though one could persuasively argue that consensual and nonexploitative sex between two adults is their own business. All of the biological opposition to adult incest vanishes in the gay context - there is no risk that the partners will transmit genetic defects to their offspring. So, this is basically a moral question. And general notions of morality have done a lot of harm in society - especially to gays and lesbians.<br /><br />Rather than exploring this topic with a sufficient amount of depth, the film falls very flat. We don't really get much in terms of character development. Everyone is loving and close -- the brothers, parents, maid, swim coach, and even strangers met in a nightclub. We know that the kids were very intimate as they grew up, but there is no discussion of why they became sexual as adults. It literally - just happens. There isn't much discussion of their relationship before or after they consummate their desire.<br /><br />The sex scenes are very tender, and much more \\"progressive\\" than what you see in American films. So, I applaud the director for this. But that's about the best stuff in the movie. Really good, tender and romantic sex: this is the stuff of a Harlequin romance. More discussion about the subject of sexual morality, however, would have resulted in a better product.<br /><br />Also, it seems that the men were addicted to one another. This doesn't look like the healthiest of relationships. I don't want to say too much about this, but once they start having sex, everyone and everything (other than the brothers) become irrelevant. Finally, the ending was predictable and simplistic. It is also proof of love addiction, not healthy love.<br /><br />If you want to see gorgeous men love each other tenderly on screen, this movie will satisfy this craving. If you want a smart exploration of the morality surrounding adult incest -- this movie will not impress you.his movie will satisfy this craving. If you want a smart exploration of the morality surrounding adult incest -- this movie will not impress you.
B0065SQ960|4.0|This is definitely disappointing as a whole, because there are only 5-6 tracks that weren't released on previous remix/single packages. The new songs are remixes of MTN, Electric Chapel (brilliant remix), Bloody Mary, Scheisse, Black Jesus, and Americano. The other 8 tracks probably are already downloaded and in your library. I was not happy about the selection of the You and I remixes, but that's not really important.  As a whole, this remix album is to keep us interested in this album because Gaga's said she's only half way through the album and she's just now releasing Marry the Night. I've also seen some speculation that the songs featured on here may be her future singles. Also, to be completely void of any true credibility, Gaga did mention that Black Jesus was Justin Timberlake's favorite song off the album, so there's a very slight chance of a collaboration there. Personally, I think that the songs remixed here are a great representation of the album and would make great singles.  As a product, however, more could have been done. She should have at least called it Born This Way The Remix pt 1... Especially, if she's truly only halfway through the album.
B000000OEI|4.0|I have not seen the movie, but heard the soundtrack on the local classical music station and was especially taken by the track \\"Little Ducks\\". I listened to the rest of the music and decided to but the CD.   This is pretty amazing music. It starts out quiet, builds up, then quiets down again, but then builds up again and again to a thundering peak! This is a VERY dynamic recording and can go from low to moderate listening levels to very loud, powerful, thundering dynamics quickly at times. I have to be careful how I have the volume set when I start the CD. It's quiet and mostly calm at first, but it builds over time and reaches nearly movie theatre volume levels at the peaks.   The music has kind of a spooky and ominous undertone throughout much of the CD.  Very introspective, and yet just when you've really wrapped up in the peaceful parts of the music, it suddenly just thunders and blasts you out of your listening chair!  Some have said it is kind of repetitious at times, but I prefer to think of it as themes that are referenced in various ways throughout the music. I don't find it repetitious at all, although I have heard soundtracks that are terribly so.   It seems very well-recorded and has tremendous dynamic range, plenty of detail in the music, powerful bass when called fot, and is very spacious sounding. Most music released these days is highly compressed and can be flat sounding, but not this. This is great  listen to when you have the time to sit and listen to it from beginning to end. Listening to one track or another without the rest of the music just won't do it for me.
B001HN6922|2.0|I'll keep this to a few main points that really bother me about this movie, since it appears I may be beating a dead horse with some of this.  Cars 2 retains none of the charm of the original Cars.  Last I checked, the target audience for this series was kids.  If that is still the case, then the utterly ridiculous \\"British Spy Movie\\" theme that the Disney people decided to go with is probably completely lost on their target audience.  Unless children have completely oblivious and irresponsible parents, then there is no way that any kid seeing this movie should know anything about James Bond.    Next, the over-the-top environmental messages that the audience is bombarded throughout the duration of this are nonsensical and have no place in what is supposedly a light-hearted kids movie.  I don't appreciate Disney trying to indoctrinate my kids with the idea that \\"gasoline is EVIL!!\\" and we should all be trying to use \\"alternative fuels\\" to power our cars.    Lastly, what in the h*ll is with all the guns, explosions, and violence?  Disney, have you forgot that you are a (thinly disguised)left-wing organization?  Have you forgot that left-wing people HATE guns?  Especially when it comes to guns and kids?  Yet somehow, it's perfectly acceptable for a supposed KIDS MOVIE to be FILLED with guns and violence.  Don't get me wrong, I love guns.  I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.  But, there is a time and place for guns.  A \\"G\\"-rated kids movie is neither the time nor the place.  Really Disney??  Mater with two gatling guns strapped to him blasting away at a room full of cars??  Unbelievable.  I give it a 2 star rating only because, as usual with Pixar films, the animation is stellar.  The story line sucks, the message sucks, the violence is appalling, and it is absolutely NOTHING like the original Cars.

B005PTQPU0|2.0|Never in a million years did I think I'd be calling a Kate Bush album \\"bland\\", and yet 50 Words for Snow is exactly that.  Listening to this album is like waiting in an elevator without a stop.  There are very few moments to make your ears perk up.  Almost all of the songs sound the same and they're all over six minutes long.  Only with \\"Wild Man\\" and the Elton John duet \\"Snowed In at Wheeler Street\\" does the album pick up a little bit, and the title track is by far the best.  \\"Misty\\" is intriguing for the lyrics, which depict Kate making love to a snowman, but at a length of nearly fourteen minutes very much overstays its welcome.  \\"Among Angels\\" is a decent piano ballad that shows off Kate's voice, but it's no \\"This Woman's Work\\".  Like the rest of the album, it's too leisurely for its own good.  Kate fans will want this for \\"50 Words for Snow\\" and \\"Snowed In\\", but it is her worst effort, even worse than the uninspired Director's Cut.  It hurts me to say this, because she is one of my all-time favorite artists, but Kate should go back to taking four years to record an album.  I can wait.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Just like in Travis's last film, \\"That's it, That's all\\", the graphics and camera angles are amazing! Seriously you have to see it on Blu Ray (purchase comes with both reg. DVD and BluRay). Not to mention the crazy halks the boys do... Gotta see it.
B006470HZ6|4.0|I still love this series. I have since the first. I was so afraid it would get canceled, like so many of my other favorite shows, and have been happy that is hasn't.  Reading some of the other reviews, some people seem to be very disappointed. The gist of the disappointment seems to be that there isn't enough zombies, not enough action, that its turning into a soap opera.  To that, I say, did you honestly expect there to be a whole series that is nothing but zombie chase after zombie chase? Entire episodes of killing zombies? There has to be a human element, a human dynamic, or in my opinion you don't have a TV show but a video game. The relationships and the developments of the little group only add to the involvement. I can feel for these people, understand them, experience what they are experiencing better with a little character development, otherwise, its just a shot em up xbox game that I have to watch and don't get to play.  We've seen great development of Lori and Derril, and Shane even. I feel the exact opposite of the negative reviews. I am more engaged now than ever.  HOWEVER, I will agree that the whole scene in the well was just plain stupid. On so many levels, its just totally implausible. Minus one star for that.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Let me start by saying I love the Harry Potter books. I have read them many times through and they are some of my favorite books of all time. In no way do I expect the wonder and magic of those books to be translated perfectly to the silver-screen. It just can't be done and I readily accept that. The successes of the movies have been very hit or miss to me and this final movie could not have missed by a wider margin. The visuals are lukewarm and underwhelming. The wand battles are a joke. And, some of the scenes chosen to be included in the movie baffle me while they left other pivotal points fall by the way side.<br /><br />While I would have loved for these things to be better, these are all mistakes that could have been forgiven if the movie had good acting. The acting is the biggest thing marring the success of this film. It is, in spots, laughably bad. I realize it is hard to gauge talent when you are picking 10 year olds to star in your decade-spanning movie saga, but there has to be a point where you cut your losses. If they just can't act, you gotta let 'em go. Continuity be damned.<br /><br />Overall this was the worst movie I saw all summer and I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Even die hard fans of the movies. It is a great disappointment and a serious letdown to a movie series that could have benefited from a spectacular ending.<br /><br />And yes, this movie is even worse than Cowboys & Aliens. At least that looked cool.

B005HI7NP0|4.0|This project is drenched with soul. I have always been a fan of Betty Wright but OMG this collaboration is off the chain. I received it yesterday and played it over and over for about 5 hours. I have been a fan of The Roots since the callobo \\"Wake Up Everybody\\" with John Legend and this project is just as good. The days of the use of real instruments in recordings are not gone thanks to The Roots. The song writing on this project is stellar. Joss Stone's contribution is incredible, Lil Wayne a beast, Snoop Dog fierce. This project is a perfect example of a blend of old school R&B meets neo soul. As a 53 year old male that loves music this cd is fresh and feels sooo good!

That being said I wasn't expecting a lot from a sticker book, even if it was by DK. I probably won't have ordered it but my son picked it up with his mother at a school book fair. However this one is much more book in the true sense vs. some of the cheaper coloring book types that I usually associate with stickers and having had a chance to read it with him I am happy to give it a thumbs up.  It is of heavy stock and the stickers are high quality. There are many of the individual Lego brands featured. My 7 year old son knows about most (OK all) of them through the lego website, trips down the toy aisle, and Lego magazine he gets. It all depends on the day as far as what his favorite actually is. This book does have a lot of parts he actually gets to read that talk about the sets and characters, which is important to me. He loves to read the sections on each character and we can spend 10-15 minutes at a time working on his reading without him figuring out that is what we are doing. He will also take this out on his own and read with out direction, pausing ocasionally to run over and tell me some fact about the figures. Once the stickers are put in (they have spots they should go) this remains a book you can read and will hold up like a normal book.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|Not impressive but its not a huge disappointment either. I think this app would work best for students. It does a pretty good job as a word processor so you can take notes and write papers easily enough with it. It doesn't display power point images correctly all the time (I'd say like 75% success rate) so it may be a problem for the student.  Excel isn't bad but isn't powerful. For the working professional, look elsewhere. You need something that's always going to work and this isn't it. If you use excel odds are this isn't capable of half of what you need it to do. If you want it to create and present presentations this doesn't display them correctly, doesn't display all the images, and has no presentation mode. This is the tablet and phone version rolled into one which is good (and the way it should be) and is cheaper than Quickoffice and about average to more than the few others. The app performs like Quickoffice for the phone but Quickoffice HD (tablet version) is marginally better. Quickoffice HD also likes to crash so there's a trade off. I think both are way overpriced and if I was buying an Office app I'd probably go with OfficeSuite 5, tho it lacks Dropbox sync, because its way cheaper, is phone + tablet, has a few more features, and is stable.

0393064476|5.0|In a Latin class at Duke U. in 1951 we read de rerum natura.  With only four students in the class, the professor feared for his job, and his insecurity made his attachment to Lucretius all the more poignant.  Of Lucretian atoms whirling, touching, separating, prof told us \\"that's what people do.\\"<br />A lesson not meant to sadden us, but it did.<br />I just bought my first kindle and my first kindle book, The Swerve, from Amazon.  Lo, after all these years (count them) Lucretius is alive and well, joyfully so, thanks to Stephen Greenblatt.<br />Because, you see, that's what people do.
0756405890|3.0|Firstly I must say I love how Patrick R. writes. In regards to this novel, however, he doesn't do it justice by how the story is told. Since there are already tons of reviews for this novel I won't go into too much detail (edited, I guess I did write a long review)  The good:  1. Writing style is good imo. Keeps me glued.  2. Initially good plot (more on this below)  3. Interesting characters although rather weak in background info  The bad:  1. Pace is great at beginning but suffers horrendously from extremely slow story-telling from 1/4 of the way in to the end. I can't stress this enough. Half of the book (half!) is about the university. The remaining is split between his early childhood past in the beginning and the other half an entirely different story which in itself is a crime/detective story. The later has no \\"adventure\\" or \\"fantansy\\" to it except for the draccus. Utterly disappointing to me.  The exciting beginning the reader was treated to with the spiders and all is gone as quickly as it came. If you think the novel is going to build more on this fantasy setting you are dead wrong. It immediately jumps to the University and never goes back to it. The Chandrian? What? The death of his troupe? What? Any type of vengence/revenge? What? I understand what Mr. Rothfuss is trying to do with the character and stressed how hard of a life his has to endure, even at the University, but getting the reader all excited and then giving us the remaining novel that is all about schooling (not even Arcanist imo) and ending it with a detective story? I just can't believe it.  2. Even though half of the book is devoted to his time in the University, it doesn't do him any type of justice because there are few examples to show how the main character becomes what he has been known to be. Mr. Rothfuss simply outlines over and over that his is exceptionally smart. The reason this is so disappointing is because the University is known for producing Arcanist, which means meddlingwith tons of great things! You can't have half a book dedicated to Arcanum and not have great examples. Sure the lamp is nice but over and over? :/  3. Mr. Rothfuss also does a very poor job of keeping the various scenarios and characters in tact when he does jump from one to the other. This I'm sure many of the readers would not have noticed. For example, on his detective spree in another town we are dealt chapters upon chapters of this story and then suddenly after coming back to the University everything and everyone is all well and happy. Sure he mentions that people are worry but that those are usually a few sentence long with very little explanation or detail. Other characters such as Auri are given no attention at all during his prolong absence. Think about it, especially with Auri. Even his hated rival, Ambrose, is nowhere to be seen and only spoken of when the main character thinks it's his doing. This I think is unforgivable being his hated rival and all and the fact that Mr. Rothfuss goes all all during scenes with him.  The problem with this is that Mr. Rothfuss is trying to write a smart, clever and off-beat type of fantasy story (as he regularly pokes fun of your typical fantasy type setting and fairy stories), but ends not completely writing one himself. As I stated before the ending of the novel is more of a detective novel than a fantasy one. The whole half is about school but with little details to his Arcanum achievements other than \\"he pass with flying colors.\\"  4. The plot or rather the main character's driven purpose is really lost once he gets into the University and Mr. Rothfuss goes wild with everything but the details. At many points along the way you're left wondering why he wanted to be in the University in the first place. It's not until YEARS later during the detective, and ending, portion of the novel that you realize oh yea..that's why. By then your several hundred pages from when he first made his vow to become the best Arcanist theschool has ever seen, of which with few examples and details leaves me laughing my butt off; meaning it was practically a meaningless boast.  5. The main character's poor-man state becomes ludicrous after several experiences detailing why even though there are more than enough reasons why he shouldn't be \\"that poor.\\" You would figure a smart person like him would be able to play and earn enough money to get items he needs for his projects (what project you ask? why Mr. Rothfuss doesn't elaborate on them so I can't tell you specifically), decent clothing and shoes, food for himself-Auri-Denna-etc. This even after he has earned the title of best musician to play at the Inn WHENEVER he wanted to, in addition to the Inn he is staying at. And he can't make a jolt? It is extremely hard to believe especially when I, myself, know very well about being penniless with nothing to your name...of which Mr. Rothfuss repeats over and over again as if to instill into the reader that he can't do anything about his condition. Again, I can understand how how it is to be that poor and in that state, I know personally, but the main character is an extremely bright person as written. Extremely bright and talented!!!  Well, it looks like I went ahead and gave it a review even though I hadn't meant it. Keep in mind the novel kept me glue but it also kept me heavily disappointed on every chapter. The writing style is a joy but the story telling is horrible for a fantasy novel. I'm sure Mr. Rothfuss wanted to divert from your typical fantasy type stories but I'm afraid a novel about Schooling/bullying and an ending of Sherlock Holmes is not what I wanted to read about.  I understand why many would like the novel but I urge those that already read to be a lot more critical in the details I've outlined above. We are talking about a fantasy type novel here not a \\"save by the bell\\" novel or Sherlock Holmes detective story. I appreciate the effort but it should not encompass more than half the novel. That is blasphemy!
B005HI7NP0|5.0|This is a strong collection of new, old-school-type soul songs by the great Betty Wright, who is ably assisted here by the Roots. This is the type of music that I grew up with and would have been the perfect soundtrack for spades and wist games, backyard bbq, or house cleaning on Saturdays. The album takes me back but it also sounds of today. \\"BW: The Movie \\"- is really a master class in classic era soul styling for the current generation who may not be use to the simple, uncluttered joy of great soul music. Ms. B., who has been serving as a mentor to many neo artists in recent years, has come back to the forefront to show us how's it really done. While there is more of a huskiness in her voice these days, her instrument is still in fine shape and is as limber as she wants it to be. It sounds like she actually has increased her singing range from a husky contralto to 3 or four octave soprano. She is truly a wonder. Every track has merit and something to enjoy in it - be it the musical arrangement, the heartfelt singing or the world-wise messages. This should be put up for a grammy for best comtemporary soul album. Welcome back.

I was concerned that the book would be filled with patterns that I've already bought or considered buying, but it was not the case.  Sue's patterns are easy to follow with clear, concise directions.  The patterns are stylish and modern, and will work with so many different fabrics.  If you enjoy sewing bags, or are interested in learning about the process, this is a great book to pick up.

0071762345|4.0|Dave Kerpen's book acts as practical guide to utilizing social media - not just in marketing, but in all customer-facing aspects of a business.  Kerpen's book is non-patronizing and makes the assumption that readers are already internet and social media fluent.  He provides numerous methods and examples of how to incite interaction between customer and business - and interestingly, the idea of businesses adapting a transparent but brand-identity driven social media persona.  Essentially, Kerpen's guide shows us how to generate an interactive dialogue in which both parties - producers and consumers - can now benefit.  Importantly, Kerpen claims that `like is the new link' - and that the `like' feature of Facebook is the ideal way to generate an online community.  As in face-to-face communication, the author reminds us that communication is 50% listening and 50% talking.  He encourages us to pay attention to demographic information now available to us - including free data provided by Facebook, and Google alerts - and really understand one's audience.  (The author lists additional resources for listening to consumers.)  Kerpen encourages us to \\"think and act like a consumer,\\" and provide incentives, like discounts, promotions, updates, and exclusive content.  This helps to generate interactivity and feedback.  Listening helps businesses provide what consumers want - it becomes a more tailored custom fit in which everyone benefits - reminding us of the increasingly fine-tuned symbiosis between product-producer and consumer.  After reminding businesses to view communication as a two way street - not just from the top down to a passive audience - the idea of media persona is explored.  An honest and transparent identity is key - as well as a professional and respectful demeanor.  Kerpen explains the need to respond to all bad comments quickly, and that it is necessary not just to apologize but to correct problems - 5% discounts are insulting.  What did not occur to me until reading the book was the idea that Social Media is just not marketing too for a business, and should work across all customer-facing departments:  advertising, marketing, public relations, customer service, operations, sales, research and development, senior management/CEO, information technology etc.  Ultimately, Kerpen demystifies the approach businesses should adapt for Social Media.

B005NA3B8U|2.0|R-Type looks very good and sounds quite similar to the arcade original.  Sadly, the control scheme rather spoils the experience for me.  You have the option of a \\"touch\\" implementation (where the ship is positioned by swiping the screen with your finger) or an \\"arcade\\" option where you use a D-pad style control in the lower left corner.  In either case, the fire/force buttons are available on the right side of the screen.<br /><br />The problem with either implementation is that R-type is well known for its high degree of difficulty (the game's enemies are not at all shy about trying to shoot you from behind) and obscuring a large portion of the screen with your thumbs makes an already \\"hard\\" game really, *really* tough.  The fire buttons on the right are less of an issue since you tend to hang out farther on the left side of the screen to give yourself more time to react and shoot as the level scrolls by, but the D-pad on the left seems perpetually 'in the way' as I play.  (I'm playing on an HTC Sensation 4G with a 4.3\\" display with pretty high resolution.)<br /><br />Rather than stretching the screen to fill the wider ~16:9 ratio display on modern phones, I would have preferred to keep the game in the original 4:3 aspect ratio and center it on the display (leaving black bars on the left and rigt) thus allowing the D-pad and buttons to be as far *off* the 'game' screen area as possible.  As it stands, I'd say 90% of my ships are lost either *in* the bottom left corner of the screen or due to something coming *from* that corner that simply would not have been an issue had the screen not been covered by my thumb.<br /><br />All in all, it's an OK effort given what we have to work with on smart phones as far as inputs go, but I don't think I'll be playing it much.  Since it was on sale for just a buck though, I can't really complain too much.
B0002K6YZI|5.0|Everyone of us already knows this is a truly timeless masterpiece in pop/rock music history so there's nothing new or revelatory to add  but it's nice to see that every now and then they release such an item in a novelty format or package, just to make sure its legacy can go on forth and new accolades and fans of good music can be attracted to its magic. This Spiegel Edition features a replica of an old red CBS label vinyl LP where you can even find actual grooves on the black surface of the disc. Nothing new on the remastering side. This is not the 2011 remaster you can find in the 40th Anniversary Edition but the 2001 remaster from the \\"Columbia Studio Recordings\\" box-set.

0060873027|5.0|While the range of horrific antagonists ranges from person to person, I'm freaked out by a very subtle and insidious threat: nanotechnology. That is, I'm freaked out by a microscopic bug designed by some mad scientist to crawl into my ear and change my gray matter. Forget snakes on a plane, I'm freaked out by bugs in my brain.<br /><br />The same sentiment must have struck Crichton before he died because his posthumous \\"Micro\\" takes that same technology among other threats. Not only are readers faced with insidious microorganisms but also very maturely present Honey-I-Shrunk-the-Kids-esque miniatures. In the violent and adult storyline, our band of scientists work to defend humanity from a scientist-gone-wild in a quest for power and money.<br /><br />I wasn't completely in love or interested with any of the characters (very Crichton-esque) but the premise and plot are compelling (also very Crichton-esque). In this way, Preston, the co-author was great at making the book a unified package. Better than the last two titles with Crichton's name on it, \\"Micro\\" makes for an excellent read. I also recommend--along the same lines--the intriguing medical/economic thriller [[ASIN:1600200516 Chaos and Kingdom]], which Crichton enthusiasts will love.

B0056NYMXC|5.0|After Ms. Rowland's last album, I wondered what she would do next, and after much careful planning, she gave us \\"Here I Am\\", and we are finally glad to see her, this album was much better than its predecessor \\"Miss Kelly\\", instead of announcing over and over again that she is grown, she proves it on this album.  There were so many great songs to choose from, the opening song \\"I'm Dat Chick\\" gets the listener prepared for what is to come, and she stays strong throughout the whole album.  I am already looking forward to what Ms. Rowland will release next, great job, keep up the good work!  The Standout tracks:  Lay It On Me (feat Big Sean)  I'm Dat Chick  Feeling Me Right Now  Turn It Up (should seriously be a single)  Heaven And Earth  Each Other (I know Kevin Simmons didn't give this song a good review, but for some reason it resonated with me as soon as I heard, the beat is sick!)
B000JCETDS|4.0|Some months ago I saw this special edt.box with guitar pick, tarrotcards & poster in a store. Ofcourse I'm familiar with the movie and the music played in it.

For everyone who saw the movie and liked it, this is an recommendable purchase. The cards are all original aswell as the guitar pick. The pick however is just for looking at and not really useable.

Last notes if you have an older model blu ray player you might need to update your firmware because the special edition is dual layer and has a lot of extras that may not play correctly with older model disk players, just something to keep in mind. I hope my review was helpful.
0738212415|5.0|If you are a novice and want to have some fun learning to draw, then this book is the perfect book.  I am middle aged and never thought I could draw. I bought this book (and a few others) to teach myself a new skill.  The other books were more technical and I learned plenty from them, but this book just made it...fun.  My kids would sit and do a \\"lesson\\" with me since the book is organized as 30 lessons. So they could pick up at any place where I was in the book. It flows very well and teaches the basic concepts for true beginners. If you have any drawing education, then this book might be too basic for you, though you still might find it fun.  Now, I wish the author would do a sequel for the next 30 days of drawing projects.

0062011847|5.0|I've read all his books, Discworld and otherwise, and continue to be amazed how his craft continues strong and true with each new book.  I am appalled that some people have elected to rate the book as a 1-star because of Kindle-edition errors. A poor Kindle-version has nothing to do with the quality of the written (or in this case, dictated) word of this story. People look at these reviews to see if they will enjoy it. First off, the Kindle version has been fixed. Secondly, the story is still great. Vimes, Willikins, Sybil and Young Sam all get some nice character development (as well developed as Sam Vimes is, he continues to evolve) and what Pratchett does with the goblins and their culture is a bittersweet reflection of various cultures that are being expunged in our modern world.  If you ever enjoyed any of his work, read it. If the Kindle scared you off, go get a hard copy. One of my favorite reads from him to date.
014241722X|1.0|As a middle school English teacher I read a great deal of quality books that are targeted at this age group.  This book though was a major disappointment.  The main character was an anachronism, I felt at any time he would pull out a pipe and start smoking.  He seemed 13 going on 40......the plot was weak, and the characters shallow and one dimensional.    Though I have read a couple of Grisham's other books, I feel he was trying to hard to connect with this age group and missed badly.  The conversations are unrealistic and evoke no feeling for real middle school life, the traumas and the tribulations.  Sad to say I do not think he actually researched or knows what 11-14 year old kids are like.  If you are looking for quality please read Jennifer Allison, Alane Ferguson, or Carl Hiaasen their books are wonderfully written for the intended audience.
1451627289|4.0|By now, you probably know this book is about a man who travels back in time to attempt to stop Lee Harvey Oswald, ultimately changing history for us in the present by changing an event in the past. Being 850 pages long, surprisingly, stopping Oswald is actually the last thing this book is about by the end.<br /><br />Those who appreciate conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination or alternative history thrillers, like me, will be pleased. King has certainly put the \\"horror\\" on hold to write a time travel story that is indeed a good read and is well developed when it comes to the characters, but it doesn't contain much time travel. Instead, it becomes about the \\"what if's\\" of changing things after traveling through time.<br /><br />Jake Epping, a divorced teacher from 2011, learns from the owner of a diner he frequents that there's a portal in the diner's pantry that will transport you back to September 1958. If you go through and then come back, and then go through again, each time is a reset no matter what you changed in the past. So, his intention is to go through - stop Oswald - and return for good. But sure, there could be repercussions because as he learns, \\"the past does not want to be changed.\\"<br /><br />King grabs the reader right from the start. I was completely hooked just ten pages in. He doesn't spend any time exploring what caused the time travel portal, why it's there, where it came from, nothing. It's not important. Epping even tests it out and goes through to stay a few months to attempt to stop a horrific event that had happened to one of his students when they were a child. What makes King's time travel story unique is that no matter how long Epping stays in the 50s, when he returns to the present he's only been gone 2 minutes.<br /><br />Ready for the challenge, Epping goes through again and is ready to stay the 5 years he'll have to wait out to get to that day in '63, and this is where the novel starts to lose steam. Epping takes on the persona of George Amberson, fakes his references, gets a mail order degree, and takes up residence in smalltown Jodie, Texas. He accepts a teaching position at the local high school, directs the annual school play, and becomes well liked by students and fellow staff members. He even falls in love with the new librarian named Sadie.<br /><br />Here, the book begins to take on a lot of the same characteristics of King's Bag of Bones from 1998 where there's a mystery at hand, but our protagonist falls in love with a local who has an estranged spouse. Both our lead character and the reader's attention is diverted to small town life and relationships, that while an interesting little \\"Our Town\\" drama, it's as if the author lost focus too. Or King discovered that making Epping wait five years was a mistake, but he didn't want to change it so he chose to fill the pages somehow. Right down to the threat and return of the dangerous spouse, he practically copied the plot structure of Bag of Bones verbatim, just changed the time and the place and the mystery at hand.<br /><br />Or maybe King discovered that while researching Oswald's real life, he really wasn't a complex character in our history. Besides going around preaching pro-Cuba, beating his wife, and working odd dead end jobs, there really isn't much depth to Oswald in the years prior to what he did on the 22nd of November. This is apparent when George follows Oswald around, rents the apartment next door and also right below him, bugs their apartment, etc. In fact, I realized I still had just 200 pages to read and we were still several months from it even being November 1963 and Oswald had not made an appearance in over thirty pages.<br /><br />My point is King really strings you along with everyday minute details of small town America because the specific details to the main plot at hand are often just not as interesting. The JFK big picture is magnificent and makes you eager to dissect it, but when you start tearing away the layers, there really isn't much substance. So, our attention is diverted elsewhere. That being said, King does capture the late 50s perfectly by focusing on details like music, dance, hair style, language, cars, TV shows, party lines, and the fact that everyone smokes! You really get an appreciation of time and place which does lend to giving the novel its essence.<br /><br />At 850 pages, now the biggest book I've certainly ever read, despite the faults I've pointed out I was never bored. As I have already said, it's a very satisfying read that history buffs or King fans will appreciate for years to come.

That being said, King does capture the late 50s perfectly by focusing on details like music, dance, hair style, language, cars, TV shows, party lines, and the fact that everyone smokes! You really get an appreciation of time and place which does lend to giving the novel its essence.   At 850 pages, now the biggest book I've certainly ever read, despite the faults I've pointed out I was never bored.

1451648537|2.0|OK so I went ahead and pre-ordered Steve Jobs biography figuring that it would provide some insight and ideas on his experiences, how they shaped his life and some insight on perhaps the most creative business life over the past 50 years.  While Isaacson can write, even good writing cannot cover up an essentially repetitious an unrevealing book.  This is particularly disappointing given that Jobs and his contemporaries were alive and accessible to Isaacson.<br /><br />Here is<br /><br />Be demanding, very demanding, persistent and do not take no for an answer.<br />Your first reaction to anything new is that it is sh t and that you can do better.<br />Repeat the prior step, until it meets your standards<br />Apply the same principles to your diet.<br />Control everything because that is the only way you can ensure that things are done to your satisfaction.<br />Believe that is all ok, because the end result is great and the ends justify the means right?<br /><br />Believe it or not I am a fan of Steve Jobs, I love the Apple products and I value someone who is willing to create a little discomfort to have people do more than what they think is possible.<br /><br />The problem I have with the book is that it just repeats this same pattern, over and over again.  In some cases it repeats the same text almost verbatim, Job's opinion of Obama, the discussions of open vs. closed systems and several others.<br /><br />Isaacson admits in several places that Jobs really did not learn or develop much as a person throughout this life, the changes that did happen as he became a father, etc. were subtle and even in the midst of a life changing illness when people thought he might change, it was just repeat the cycle above.<br /><br />That is a weak analysis of an undeniably rich life.  And while I did not mind reading the book, I found the articles in Time, the Economist, Bloomberg and other places far superior to the book.<br /><br />Job's impact is undeniable as I write this on a MacBook Pro, read the book on an iPad and have my iPhone at my side.  Such a life deserves more introspective approach and analysis rather than a calendar based chronology of the same process mentioned above as a child, college student, early inventor, company founder, company failure, and company reborn.<br /><br />Job said that he supported Isaacson to the extent that he wanted his children to know him.  It's a statement that harks back to Randy Pausch and the last lecture; the only point was that Pausch's children were too young at the time to know what was going on, so Pausch poured himself out in the lecture to show his children who he really was.  I only wish Jobs and done the same, or that came through in this book.<br /><br />I am a Jobs fan so I purchased and read the book without looking at the reviews, and if you are fan you will discount this review as well.<br /><br />However, if you are interested in this life, its meaning, values, critical moments and impact, thdeserves more introspective approach and analysis rather than a calendar based chronology of the same process mentioned above as a child, college student, early inventor, company founder, company failure, and company reborn.

B00000IMTH|4.0|This album was the swansong of RJD leaving the band to join Black Sabbath. I don't know why Ronnie left because he certainly became a household name after the fabulous RISING. I believe that this album is every bit as good as RISING. While it doesn't offer any really long songs, it is a tour-de-force in it's own right. There are several tracks on this album that really rock, such as the title song, Kill the King, and The Shed(Subtle). The centerpiece (for me) is The Gates of Babylon, a pre-curser to Richie's solo project Blackmore's Night. Blackers always played with excellent musicians, and there is no lack of monster players here. I have always loved Bob Daisely, he has such a fluid style that fits Blackmore like a glove. Even though I love Toney Carey on 'Boards you hardly miss him because David Stone is more than adequate and alot of his work on this album is subtle. but there are moments when he shines. Cozy (R.I.P) is his regular drum maniac self, banging away with some very tough time changes. Of Course, Richie continues to be a virtuoso level guitarist.  and with Ronnie fronting the band in fine style they have the total package. It's a shame that ronnie left because I think that this line-up could have put out a lot more material...but then we wouldn't have Heaven & Hell or Holy Diver etc...
B000HC2LI0|2.0|I just received the complete series and really enjoy the West Wing.I have watched the first 52 episodes. But the quality of the DVDS is very bad. Despite my best efforts at cleaning the disks I have missed 9 episodes so far. My DVD player will not play them. At this rate when I am finished I will miss about 26 episodes. So you may want to think twice before buying this series.
068483605X|5.0|This has been one of my favorite books for years.  It's fairly impressive how the author was able to make talking rabbits keep so many of their \\"rabbit-like\\" characteristics and oddities.  His ability to make the seemingly simple world of rabbits seem so dark is also one of the things that makes me love this book.  Overall, it's an impressive piece of work.  This item in particular seems to be of good quality.  The book and its dust jacket came with no defects that I've noticed, and the construction also seems to be quality.
B005JLN9ZI|1.0|As I write this review I am listening to my Tribe Called Quest Anthalogy and I attempted to to listen to Drake . After he started singing like Luther Vandross on track 2 , I could not take it. Call it hatin if you like. I guess for some of old heads who grew up listening to the like Public Enemy , DMC, KRS -ONE , Big Daddy Kane , A Tribe Called Quest , etc we see nothing in Drake that says Hip Hop. I see Hop Pop because he is doing mostly singing to me. I am sure females love his looks but Drake will not be in any battle rapper contest EVER. Track 3 he singin They Know, They Know like Ralph Tresvant. Then track 10 I wrote down a rap lyric. You ready? \\"I love when your hair still wet cause you just took a shower\\" \\"Sound so smart like you went to college\\" and then he singing it Pavoroati . Adding profanity to his songs is simply an attempt to hide his wackness. The reviews of this album are proof that the dumbing down of hip hop has worked  . Download this album for free and save your money .  I am going to listen to my Guru and 9th Wonder to get this trash out of my ears .

B004WJRF6C|4.0|Original album: 4.5 stars; Bonus CD: 3.5 stars; Packaging: 4 stars<br /><br />As a life-long fan of McCartney, you can't help but treasure certain of his solo or Wings albums more than others. The debut album is one of them for me, no question about it. I had bought the 2CD/1DVD deluxe reissue of \\"Band on the Run\\" last year, which I thought was a delight from start to finish, so I was looking forward to the reissue of this one.<br /><br />Starting with the original/remastered \\"McCartney\\" album (13 tracks; 35 min.), it stil resonates 40+ years later for me. This album is really not intended for a mass audience, as it feels like home-recordings (which they were of course) intended for Paul and Linda's private consumption. Glad that McCartney thought enough of them to release them. Highlights for me include \\"Every Night\\", \\"Junk\\", the instrumental \\"Momma Miss America\\" (perhaps my favorite track on here), \\"Teddy Boy\\" and the closer \\"Kreen-Akrore\\" (sorry, I've heard \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" a few times too many in my lifetime). As to the bonus CD (7 tracks; 25 min.), it's quite a mixed bag, to be honest. The demo outtakes are a curiosity at best: \\"Suicide\\" is a short cabaret-style song, \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" is the instrumental version of \\"Oo You\\", and \\"Women Kind\\" is another short (and low-fi) idea for a song. More interesting are the live tracks, in particular \\"Hot As Sun\\" and \\"Every Night\\" from the 1979 Glasgow show. This release gets served with a nice bonus of lots of previously unreleased pictures from Macca (shot by Linda of course) in those early solo days.<br /><br />Speaking of \\"Every Night\\", I had the good fortune of hearing Paul play it at the hour-long soundcheck he did when he came to perform here in Cincinnati (at the Reds' stadium) a few months ago in August. That free soundcheck was almost as delightful as the actual concert later that evening, playing a bunch of obscure covers and rarely performed tracks (such as C Moon). I read somewhere that this Archive Collection series next will tackle \\"Ram\\", which I really can't wait to hear how that's going to come out. ALso anxiously hoping for a reissued and expanded version of \\"Wings Wild Life\\" (I know, an oddity in Paul's catalog, and not a favorite of many Macca fans but I personally LOVE that album).m\\", which I really can't wait to hear how that's going to come out.

B005TZFZJC|1.0|i do not like this album. The songs are not something revolutionary. I love her first album. What happened to the real rihanna? i wish she would have songs like unfaithful. Birthday cake sounds like video phone mixed with calling all the monsters from disney channel.  :/
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|I'm no fan of American Idol, but I was a fan of Scotty McCreary when I heard him sing the first time. That boy has got some lungs on him. It was great to see a young man with such strong convictions and desire elevated to the height of national acceptance by winning AI.  That said, his first album could have been a bust as many other AI alum albums have been. Not so here.  Scotty's deep bass voice (how can he only have been 17?) shines through all the songs and there are some really GREAT songs on it. My personal favorite is \\"Water Tower Town,\\" because it speaks to me, but there's not a bad song among them.  What I hope to see down the road is Scotty writing most of his own music and seeing what can happen there.  This is one of the best albums I've heard in years (and since I'm not a big country fan, that's saying something)!

1416550550|1.0|Do you believe that circa 1900, little girls from wealthy families were allowed to wander London alone, where tricksters removed their fancy frocks in broad daylight? Do you think curators of the world's major museums rummage for treasure, by appointment, in the detritus of the middle class -- now or ever?   If so, you just might be able to swallow the rest of claptrap that comprises The Forgotten Garden. It will help if you, like Kate Morton, also divide the world into convention-bound villains and lively free spirits.  The mystery at the book's heart is enticing, but not enough to get me much more than a third through. The implausibilities are too thick to bear.

B004132HZS|5.0|This series is based off of the classic work Sherlock Holmes series. There are lots of adaptations in the episodes to bring the series into the modern age such as cellphones, cars, bombs, snipers. The series ended with a cliff hanger and should be back sometime in 2012. I can't wait and you won't be able to either. You will watch these episodes one by one and think, \\"Brilliant!\\"
B005CM9DX6|5.0|One of the two best albums of the year, along with Steven Wilson's Grace For Drowning, Heritage is a daring, welcome departure from the growling vocals that dominated their earlier, excellent works. While I was never a huge fan of those vocals, the musical compositions were so masterful that it was easy for me to deal with. Heritage has everything great about Opeth, just driven by MA's normal, astounding vocals. If you are truly just a fan of death metal vocals, then I can see you having doubts about this record. But if you admire a band that steps out of it's comfort zone, while still producing a masterpiece, then Heritage will not disappoint.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|The premise of this movie is that regular guys can become superheroes. Unfortunately, the regular guy isn't all that great and never really does become a superheroes (yes, he does help fight some of the villians, but really? he ends up messing up more than helping.) That being said, the movie is still intertaining to watch and for a comic book action movie it is also very pretty to watch (if you don't mind violence). The screen shots and colors are very dramatic to match the comic book theme. One of the best scenes of this movie is the action scene with Hit Girl at the end. The movie is worth watching just for that scene. I wouldn't recommend this for a family movie with young children or preteens.

0545265355|5.0|When I read this book, I was surprised it was a children's book. It is very well written, very dark and every bit of a page turner. I got my brother who hates to read books to read it on a trip. By the end of the trip he had finished the series. While this is a children's book and it is written for kids, understand that the Hunger Games is a 'game' in which the government has kids ranging from like 10 to 18 killing eachother while it is viewed on national TV. The Hunger Games are in both the first and the second book. The third book is a violent revolution against the corrupt government. Parents might not want their kids to read these books. If a child is older and can understand what the moral of the story is, I would recommend the book. Personally to me, the first book is the best out of the triology and the worst is the last one, but all of them are good books. You won't be able to put the books down.

B005R4255C|3.0|When it has came down to Michael Jackson, he has been one of the most influential and driven entertainers of all time. When he died in 2009, it became one of the biggest shocks that ever hit the world like a massive lead balloon. It wasn't until then that everyone was reminded of how important and influental he was to so many artists and dynamic to so many fans. His catalog went wild in sales, because of the impact of his death while prepping for what was suppose top be his This Is It tour. Sadly, his drug abuse and all the years of heartbreak lead to his unamicable demise. But, there have been so many ways to celebrate his legacy, and Cirque de Soleil has chose to make one of their own, by remixing Michael's classic songs to a whole new show.<br /><br />Michael Jackson: Immortal is a soundtrack to the tour by Cirque Se Soleil. The collection of songs includes remixes and reworkings of Michael's legendary catalog. While the idea of his catalog might be a die hard idea, it falls short of how his legacy is now celebrated. Unlike what Cirque had done brilliantly with The Beatles: Love in 2006, which showcased The Beatles well, here it falls absolutely short of what they could've made of Michael Jackson. While the ballads are remixed well like Childhood, and Man In The Mirror, his dance songs though do lose a lot of shine from what they were. The dance songs like the driven Smooth Criminal, and his 1995 hard-hitting controversial They Don't Care About Us feels like they were short-changed and lost a bit of their luster to Michael's legacy, especially to his hard core fans all over the world.<br /><br />Overall, Immortal featuring Michael Jackson's music isn't really as strong as what Michael Jackson had brought to the world. I definitely wasn't all that impressed at the album, and it just didn't shine like The King Of Pop had done. Is it a good buy, well not really. If you love Cirque, possibly. But if you're new to Michael Jackson's music, I would definitely pass this one up, and just choose one of Michael's classics' like Bad or the definitive Thriller. As for Immortal, it didn't feel like it is eternal as it could've been.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C<br /><br />Price: C-<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: Cose one of Michael's classics' like Bad or the definitive Thriller.

B005TQAI6G|3.0|I saw the show back on June 28 in Portland, and I LOVED IT. However, this DVD is Britney's worst. Her dancers upstage her, and that's not right. I don't like the job Epix has done with the audio, visual, and whatnot. Britney Spears is BRITNEY SPEARS. Come on? You would expect more out of her... I bought this because I am a true fan and love all her work. You decide to buy it or not. A plus is the menu. It's basic, but it's nice. It plays the instumental to her hit I Wanna Go and shows small video clips throughout the show. I don't think you would be wrong to buy this but understand you get what you pay for and Epix sucks.   Dear Britney, next time you film one of your shows DO NOT let them dub your live vocals and stick to the pros [Shotime, HBO, and others. NEVER EPIX.]
B005L38QK2|4.0|First of all, this is a GAMING mouse.  If you are using it for something other than gaming, then it isn't optimized for you.  For example, there is no side scrolling and the mouse is corded.  Corded is a good thing for games, because there is lower latency, no need to change batteries (having to change a battery in the middle of a game could be absolutely disastrous!) and you don't have to worry about interference if you are at a LAN party.  If you are working in the office or surfing the net, cordless is nice because you get the obvious benefits of being tether-free and the disadvantages are insignificant--you don't care about 100ms latency and if you have to change the batteries at some point, the spread sheet will be perfectly happy to wait for you while you do so.  So, having said that, let's look at this as a gaming mouse.  There are the normal left and right buttons and a clickable scroll wheel (as previously noted--no side scroll if your game would benefit from that).  There are also two buttons by your thumb whether you use the mouse left- or right-handed... which means there are also 2 buttons by your ring finger... which I've got to tell you... I can not find a comfortable way to use those buttons.  I see they are going for ambidextrous, and that's cool, but for all intents and purposes, those 2 buttons are going to be pretty unused.  Finally, there is another button just below (closer to your palm) the scroll wheel.  After you go online and download the SteelSeries Engine (the product does NOT come with a CD), you can assign actions to each button--these can be either recorded Macros, or you can specify an application to launch.  The macro engine seems pretty complete to me--you can record keys, mouse clicks and combinations thereof (like CTRL+SHIFT+Left Click).  You also have the option to include time delays.  It looks like there should be a way to make modifications to this without having to re-record your macro, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet. No big deal... either way.  Since you can record rather complex macros, you could assign an unusual and difficult Macro to the ring-finger keys and then maybe get some mileage out of it, but they better not require the pointer to hold still because using those keys, I ALWAYS move the mouse at least a little, even if I'm trying not to... very unnatural...  The scroll wheel and the \\"Diablo\\" logo on the back of the mouse pulsate red.  The engine allows you to control how fast that happens (or disable it completely).  The engine does NOT allow you to change the pointer speed.  You can change the polling rate between 125 and 1000 Hz, but the speed seems to stay pretty constant for me.  That's not a big deal, though-- you can use the Windows mouse controls for that.  The mouse uses a laser tracking system and seems to work flawlessly, even on my glossy wood desk.  Personally, I prefer a mouse with a little more heft to it, but this one is perfectly usable.  Even though it is lighter than my other mouse, it still feels solid.  So why only 4 stars?  Several times while I was messing around in the engine, my left mouse click would quit working and I had to unplug my mouse and plug it back in in order to keep using it.  This only seems to occur when I'm playing around in the engine--not during normal use (at least not yet).  In fairness to the mouse, I have drivers for several other mice on this computer and they may be interfering with each other, but all the same, I don't have these problems with any others and the left mouse click is kind of a big deal.  If it did it outside of the engine, I would have to drop this down to 1 star since losing that functionality during a game (remember, this IS a gaming mouse) would only be slightly better than having the batteries die on you.  So far, though, it is just a quirk that will only contribute to the loss of a single star (along with the awkward button placement).  ===== UPDATE 12/2/2011 ======  A friend of mine was invited to use the Diablo III Beta and has been playing it for some time now.  He has beaten it using all but one of the rolls.  I let him use this mouse for a couple days.  At first he wasn't sure how he felt about it because the button by your pinky finger is (by default) tied to you potions.  As I noted above, this button is really in a poor place--hard to use and easy to click accidentally.  He accidentally used several potions without meaning to during the first day he played with it.  Once he got used to the mouse, however, he said it was a great improvement over his other gaming mouse ([[ASIN:B004AM5RAM Razer Naga Epic Gaming Mouse]]) because this one was better optimized for this particular game.  Now that he's been using it for about a week, I'm pretty sure that when I ask for it back, he's going to run out and buy one for himself.  NOTE: I asked him if he has ever had the quirk I mentioned above with the left button not working and he said it has not happened to him once.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|It's easy to poke fun at Taylor's less-than-spectacular live vocals, cheesy lyrics but as i watched a segment on her on 60 Minutes, her manager made a specacular point- If Taylor wasn't pretty, blond, young, and appealing to young girls and their moms, he lyrical compositions would be praised and looked at a higher level than she is. Instead, she was classified as a pop/country bubblegum singer with no depth.  When I first heard of Taylor Swift, my initial reaction was repulsion. I wasn't a country fan, and her association with the genre never really allowed me to give her a chance. Then, being forced to listen to her, as I have 4-10yo nieces, her catchy tunes actually had feeling, innocence, and truth to them. She describes her own music as being autobiographical; writing about famous ex boyfriends (Joe Jonas and John Mayer) and the tabloids who launch you into stardom, only to try to tear you down (\\"Mean\\"). This girl is level-headed, smart, and knows how to put on a production.  You can see what a hard worker she is. If you watched [[ASIN:B005FNJL4I Taylor Swift: Journey To Fearless]], you can see that she is involved in every aspect of her spectacle: Lighting, dancer auditions, staging, projection, video montages, etc. The Speak Now World Tour, which sold out venues almost instantly, was wonderful. I got a chance to see her in Los Angeles (Where she sold out 4 shows in a matter of minutes) and she even brought Justin Bieber onstage.   Although not having a specific theme unlike her last tour, She still played with the \\"fairy tale\\" illusion where it is clear that she is enjoy being what she is- a girly girl who loves sparkle and playing dress up.   I recommend this show to anyone who isn't caught up on searching \\"perfect live vocal\\" and just wants to sit back and have a blast (and wave their hands back and forth and shrieking like a little girl).

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|While filming a zombie horror film on Super 8, a group of young kids witness a terrifying train crash. But the crash was not an accident. Soon, the Air Force arrives and it's clear they have a dangerous secret they're trying to keep when they begin lying to the local town and strange phenomenon occurs.<br /><br />The story mostly follows the young filmmakers, starring Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, and Elle Fanning. All of the children do an amazing job of bringing heart and a sense of wonder and humor to this thrilling story. I don't think the trailers did the film justice this summer. I didn't even bother going to the theater to watch, as the trailers didn't show any of the actual story. I regretted missing it later, after hearing friends' glowing reviews.<br /><br />JJ Abrams and Spielberg teamed up to make an impressive science fiction thriller. The backdrop of the 70s is realistically low-tech, with a similar feel to the classic 1977 Spielberg film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Though, Super 8 is much more fast-paced and full of action-packed, adventure.  The mystery and suspense builds to an exciting conclusion. During the credits, we are able to watch the kids' clever \\"homemade\\" zombie film, which made sitting through the credits not only bearable, but fun.<br /><br />The Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contents include:<br />Blu-ray:<br />- Commentary by writer/director J.J. Abrams, producer Bryan Burk and cinematographer Larry Fong<br />- Behind-the-Scenes Featurettes:<br /> * The Dream Behind Super 8<br /> * The Search for New Faces<br /> * Meet Joel Courtney<br /> * Rediscovering Steel Town<br /> * The Visitor Lives<br /> * Scoring Super 8<br /> * Do You Believe in Magic?<br /> * The 8mm Revolution<br />- Deconstructing the Train Crash<br />- Deleted Scenes<br /><br />DVD:<br />- Feature Film<br />- Digital Copy
B005OLF6BI|5.0|First I want talk about the video, I have been watching concert videos for 30 years since I got my first VHS deck. Most of the time they are a disappointment. many times the producers spend way to much time showing the crowd. I watched a MJ concert where they crowd was on the screen more than MJ himself.  This is the best concert video that I have EVER seen! At times I felt like I was there, the last time I watched a concert like this was a ONJ concert done in the late 1980s. The crowd scenes where held to a bare minimum. Big Kudos to Taylor and her production team for bring the essence of the the concert to home viewers. The home viewers get to see things that the people at the concert didn't. After one of her songs the crowd response brought tears to Taylor's eyes, no one that was there could have seen this, but the camera in closeup caught this. This DVD redefines concert videos.  I been around for 66 years, so I have kind of seen it all, From Frank Sinatra \\"All I owe them is a good performance\\" when asked about the fans, the birth of Rock ,etc. Never have I seen an artist that relates to here audience the way that Taylor does she has redefined this relation ship.   I have never seen an artist leave the main stage and walk to the back of the venue, get on a small stage so the people at the back could she her closeup, but Taylor does just this.   The show is fantastic, timing is excellent, the stage production is stunning and exciting to watch and completely entertaining.   I first became interested in Taylor because of two grand daughters that were nuts over Miley C. I wanted someone that had a positive image, I found this in Taylor and bought her CDs and DVDs for the grand daughters. In the process I became a fan after watching some of here videos. I stared to play guitar at 13 and had more teardrops on my guitar than I would like to talk about.  If anyone is a Taylor fan the CD/DVD is a must! It is the perfect present for a Taylor fan!  There is a good reason why Taylor is where she is, she loves her fans and they love her back!

B000ULQV0W|5.0|This movie has a great soundtrack.  Songs by Eddie Vedder.  If you're a contemplative person, this music is a good soundtrack for your life.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I listened to 30 second bursts of about three of the \\"songs\\" on Lulu in my mates car on the way to work this morning and instantly felt that I need to write the following to service mankind in my own small way......DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. Whether you are a die-hard Metallica or Lou Reed fan or even old enough to remember the Velvet Underground is of no significance whatsoever in this case. Do yourself a favour, combine Southern Comfort and Corn Chips and if you have enough, it will put you into a convulsing state where your bowels will feel like imploding onto themselves placing you into a physical coma that will no doubt lead to an eventual and quite violent vomitory episode....much like listening to this really. What a mess!!!!! I was more musically inspred the last time I flushed the toilet.....
1451627289|5.0|Rarely does a book move me towards any sort of emotion.  I read a book for pure entertainment value and when it's over, I go on to a new book. I connect with the characters and such but I'm never moved like I am after reading 11/22/63. 11/22/63 brought out a well of emotion that sent shivers down my spine.  As I read the concluding pages, tears had welled up in my eyes.    This book is billed as a \\"time-traveler goes back and stops the Kennedy assassination\\" but it is indeed more than that.  It is the truest and most sincere love story that I have ever read.  I found myself feeling distraught, happy, and a plethora of other emotions brought on by the relationship of the two main characters, Jake and Sadie.  It was as if they were real.  It was as if I was more than just an on-looker reading from the pages.  It was like I was there and part of it.  This is some of Stephen King's strongest writing in my opinion.  It takes a brilliant author to evoke so much emotion in me and he did it.  He brought out the love that these characters felt for each other so amazingly.    To me, the Kennedy assassination was just a subplot in the novel.  The real story was that of Jake and Sadie and the love and struggle that they faced.  What started as Jake's main reason for going back in time (stopping Lee Harvey Oswald) turned into something that at times he may have been willing to sacrifice, if only to remain with Sadie.  Usually I don't get all mushy about things such as this, but again, this book brought out a lot of emotions. It is truly a novel about how far a person is willing to go to be with the one they love. Also, when you read the concluding pages, you'll see why I was bleary eyed.    So, maybe you're not into \\"time-travel\\" or historical events, but I can assure you this book is much more.  It is about life: The love, the emotion, the changes that come with it.  It is about choices and how things you do today can affect the future.  It is more than just a science fiction novel, it is an inspiring piece.    In conclusion, this book has taken its place as one of my favorite books of all time.  This is only the fourth or fifth Stephen King book I've read, but I plan on reading many, many more.  Mr. King knows how to write and knows how to play on the emotions of his readers.  At least, he did with mine!   As a side-note, I finished this novel on 11/22/11, 48 years to the day that President Kennedy was assassinated.
1594201927|1.0|I do not recommend the book: The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World (2008).<br /><br />It is pity Mr Ferguson could not use all his knowledge to write a better book. It seems he had assembled many different articles in one book just to have a chance to sell it during the financial crisis. There is much detail where it is not need (Scotch examples, etc.) and no deep analysis where it is needed . In fact, the structure of the book does not make you comfortable in reading.<br /><br />I agree with much of the one and two stars review I would like to add, and option to who would like to understand the roots of the 2008 crisis: go and see the brilliant movie Inside Job (by Charles H Ferguson)<br />on)
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I ordered this cover when I pre-ordered the Fire, not knowing exactly what it would be like.  This is my 6th Kindle, and I have had covers for all of them, but this is the very best one.  It protects without being bulky, the color makes it easy to find and looks great. It has a very simple and therefore light weight and user-friendly design that is efficient and effective.
B005PW3OS8|3.0|Another Marvel Superhero flick. This one is good but not great. Really this just makes me anticipate the Avengers film. Marvel has done a good job being patient and releasing the films slowly, taking time to develop each character (Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye) but this one definitely felt the most 'slapped together' of any of them. Regardless, still a highly entertaining movie, but not with the weight in story and acting of the others.
B005QVCXM6|5.0|I've been a fan of Evanescence since the release of 'Fallen,' and after waiting 5 years for the release of this new album I knew I would either be very, very overwhelmed; or just incredibly...disappointed.   Upon the release of 'What You Want,' I was very confused on what kind of album to expect. Firstly, it's important for me to mention that whilst 'What You Want' is the first single, it is by no means the best song on this album. It's still pretty darn good, but certainly not the best.   Since I bought this album, it has been on repeat constantly. I think it's fair to say, this album is their best yet. The band sounds so tight, you can tell it is a band record that they all love and worked hard on. Amy's vocals are beautiful, the songs are heavier than ever and whilst there's not a ballad in the 'My Immortal' or 'Hello,' style; the intense emotion is still there (especially in 'Lost in Paradise' and 'My heart is broken.'   I would definitely recommend this album to anyone and everyone. It is simply, amazing. And I'm so proud of this band and the 5 year wait seems incredibly worth it!
B005R4255C|5.0|I seriously don't understand the negative reviews by people who call themselves fans. This is a good album and I say that as someone who doesn't like remixes much. But these are not the type of remixes those kill off the soul of the original music. These are actually much better remixes than you will find either on Blood on the Dance Floor (although the non-remix part of that album is a work of a genius, but I don't listen to the remix part much) or Thriller 25. And some of the mixes make the songs sound better. Such as the mix of Dancing Machine - the arrangement of the original was a bit dated but with this new mix it could be a club hit in 2011 again. Or \\"I'll be there\\" - OMG that voice!   Actually on all songs Michael's voice is brought foreward and it highlights what a great singer he actually was - besides being a great dancer and songwriter.  People need to realize that this is a soundtrack album to a Cirque du Soleil show and it should be perceived as such.   I'm pretty saddened to see Michael's own fans attacking every new release since his death. No, I'm not approving everything the Estate does automatically. In fact I thought the \\"Michael\\" album was poorly produced and Sony need to get their act together in the future in that area. But this is a good and fun album which will make you want to dance - even if you are not a hardcore fan.   I wonder how these fans think Michael's legacy will survive if they attack and sabotage everything the Estate does just out of partizanship or because of the conspiracy theories they have in their minds about Sony or the Estate or whatever. A Cirque show is something I'm sure Michael would have approved of since he loved Cirque. Actually he would be proud of it. I'm also sure he wouldn't mind these remixes since he didn't mind MUCH poorer remixes on Thriller 25.   Fans need to accept that things will never be again like they were while Michael was alive. His albums will never be like that again. He was a genius and he cannot be replaced. But don't get let this fact get in the way of being able to enjoy an overal good album like this one.
B0051OJCUY|5.0|as you can see by the title of my review, i love this music. Jimmy Smith was the best and his classics are still the best. An excellent set of cds. But. i was suprised to find that A Date With Jimmy Smith wasn't included.  Sincerely, Jake.
B004LROUNG|1.0|Grisham goes to great lengths to enlighten us about greedy lawyers and incompetent ones. Then he goes after big pharma. While some of his points may have some validity, the novel is boring as Grisham repeats his attacks but does not develop his characters. The novel lacks plot and suspense.
031617615X|4.0|Well, I hate to see this series end. So as of now I'm refusing to read the last 200 pages. I've really enjoyed the book thus far. A little more gory than I prefer, but suspenseful.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I'm really sick of this album. My 16 year old daughter plays it every other morning; as a result she now owns a fairly comprehensive set of Aretha Franklin, courtesy of me. Adele may have one of the greatest voices ever committed to record, but her songs are highly derivative of so many I've been hearing for decades that I can't really take her seriously as an artist.
B000X107GI|5.0|When you purchase these kinds of batteries in stores, you normally pay $4.95 for one battery. You can't beat the prices here! The batteries worked fine too - no complaints.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Great product for the price. It is mostly plastic but overall the construction seems solid. I am using this with a Verizon iPhone 4s and the fit is pretty snug with a case on the device. Shipping was fast and everything was received in good condition. Great little tripod for home use. I plan to using this on my desk for product reviews and it will serve that purpose just fine. I plan on doing a video review of this item in the next week or so.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|Save your money, unlike the older kindle covers it does not hold the kindle from falling out and if you use the elastic strap to hold it in place your screen is blocked from reading your book.  Try a different cover.
B005D9B26E|1.0|Since when is the director's cut edited shorter than the original? I am very dissappointed with the 5.1 Quadrophenia-lite version included in this box. Sure, some of the 5.1 mixes are quite good. The 5.1 mix of Dr. Jimmy is an exception. It sort of lays flat in the speakers which doesn't fit the otherwise dynamic performance. I might have been less critical if the 5.1 \\"E.P.\\" had at least included the best song on the whole album - \\"I'm One\\". Well, at least we get Keith's great \\"Sea and Sand\\" drums mixed in 5.1.<br /> I do like the demos even with the modern added drums on 4 or 5 tracks. If you want the original unadulterated demos in excellent quality, you can get them on bootlegs. For my money, the added drums on some tracks makes them more listenable. In fact, I would have preferred it if Pete took off his sloppy drums on the other demo tracks and replaced them with the professional drums. (Yes, I also prefer colorized movies -- throw stones now)<br /> I go along with other reviewers who are dissappointed that no Who outtakes are included. I think the book is fairly good with Pete's discussion. Some words from \\"Roj\\" would have been welcome as this material has been a good part of his bread and butter in recent years and the way he sings \\"Love Reign Over Me\\" is one of if not THE great thrusts of the album. The new stereo mix of is not significantly different from the 90's remix. I do like the 90's mix, and this one, better than the original as they lopped off a good amount of the excessive reverb that was part of the original mix (compare original and new versions of \\"I'm One\\" for the most evident example). I also would like to have seen vinyl in this set as we got in the \\"Aqualung\\", \\"Smile\\" and \\"Station to Station\\" super deluxe sets.<br />Here's hoping we get to buy a 6th version of this album (I'm including soundtrack lp and cd versions) when they release a complete 5.1 mix.
0316743003|5.0|Let me preface my review by stating that I have never written a review for a book before.  I usually just never took the time.  But Ben Rich's wonderful insight into the Skunk Works is by far one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read.  Part of this is because the book's subject appealed to me so much, being an engineer, aerospace history buff, tinkerer, and black projects fanboy myself.  But most of it was the amazing detail and writing style of Ben Rich and company.  The book delivers on so many levels, from details of the Skunk Works engineering challenges, to the personal stresses facing key members lives, to business and managerial practices of the unique organization- it's all there, written in an incredibly easy to read text.  I have since passed on the book to several colleagues, all of which are blown away by what is described in the book.  I was already well read on the SR-71 development and the Have Blue program, so much of the tech described in the book didn't shock me. What did blow me away was the amazing descriptions of the works of the Skunk Works- the all nighters, the close calls, the rules bent and broken- all to deliver 21st century technology throughout the 60's and 70's.   This book is a wonderful testament to the will of some of America's finest Engineers and Pilots, a great remembrance of the great Kelly Johnson, and a wonderful insight into the life his worthy successor, Ben Rich.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|The amplifier is nice and compact.  I could hear my mp3 a little better with the earphones inside my motorcycle helmet, but once I got up to anything over 40 it got harder to hear.  I ended up buying another one that had a little more power. It was also hard to see the power light in direct sunlight.
B00005JSGK|4.0|4 1/2 Star = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />I grew up with John Wayne movies, & the \\"Duke\\" was always one of my favorites! They just don't make them like him anymore! Of course, there is a multitude of great westerns that John Wayne made, more than I ever have seen, & probably ever will, but he also made other genre films, some truly great! \\"Hatari!' 1962, is one of them.<br /><br />\\" Hatari\\" is about African animal trappers that capture animals for zoos around the world. From Rhinos to Monkeys, the \\"Duke\\" & crew catch them all!<br /><br />\\"Hatari!\\" is truly a fascinating film, filled with real animals being captured! It is exciting, especially the first Rhino scene that starts off the movie! It is funny, John Wayne & Red Buttons giving classic performances. It is funny, cute! Three baby Elephants adopt a female photographer sent from a Switzerland zoo, to take pictures of the crew catching animals for a photo album. They follow her every where, like huge puppies with no hair, big floppy ears & a trunk, as John Wayne uses them like Bloodhounds to find her in, Arusha, his love interest in the film that tries to leave them all behind because she thinks the \\"Duke\\" does not want her to stay. A particularly funny scene is when the first baby Elephant adopts her, & they buy a herd of Goats to feed the baby Goat milk. Every time the baby trumpets, the goats go flying everywhere, trying to run away. Then there is John Wayne milking a goat, do I have to say more!<br /><br />\\"Hatari!\\" is a great film for those that want to see John Wayne play something else other than a cowboy. Though his role is typical \\"Duke,\\" well, that's why millions loved him & still do. The movie is quite unlike any other I've seen, & the fine cast, cinematography, script, & the directing by the great Howard Hawks, make this an essential John Wayne film!
B00022TPTI|1.0|The sound on \\"Wheels of Confusion\\" takes a dip on the right channel at 4:52.  How could the people who remaster this album miss that error.  Also, I noticed \\"Snowblind\\" is quieter in the beginning but in my Greatest Hits 2006 version of that song, it sounds excellent.  I would not buy this version of the album if I were you
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app works perfectly every day. I would like to say a big thanks to lifechurch.tv for distributing this free.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|This is a really amazing book that goes to the depth of how Google operates. If you are a tech follower, this book is a must read. If you're an entrepreneur, this book is also very inspiring.   Larry and Sergey are both really amazing individuals, they are rebels who does not want to follow rules and are really brave to do things their own way. When asked about who they want to choose to be the first CEO of Google, they don't want to go for someone less than the best, Steve Jobs. Only later they are convinced that Eric Schmidt is very suited to run the company.  The book also contains a lot of inside stories from Google, starting from Google drive, Gmail, Google in China, Google's relationship with Apple, Android, and so many more. Highly recommended for those who want to understand the history of tech in the 21st century.
B005QVCXM6|5.0|I definitely liked this album better than the open door and I listen to it now more than Fallen.  I am a fan of how it sounds more like rock and less like goth.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|One of the hardest things to do when wanting to immerse oneself in some classic novels is to understand characters who react in ways that are incomprehensible to our modern sensibilities.<br /><br />Victor Frankenstein, the creator of the creature usually called \\"Frankenstein\\" by those of us familiar with the countless movie and cartoon variations of this tale (but called \\"the creature\\" in this book) is weak-willed (he changes his mind at the slightest provocation), fragile (every shock either sends him into an illness lasting months or into a fit of madness), thoughtless (he creates life and then leaves his creation completely alone), and almost astonishingly dumb (if somebody threatens \\"I'll see you on your wedding night,\\" wouldn't you at least consider that the threat might be against your intended and not yourself?).<br /><br />The book is very different than a modern reader might expect (beyond the distasteful main character).  While modern science-fiction readers are accustomed to being flooded with details about the science of the book, Shelley presents Frankenstein's amazing accomplishment as a single step between inspiration and completion.  He simply decides to create new life in his university appartment and does it.<br /><br />The creature is the revelation in this book.  Incredibly articulate (he taught himself language by spying on a rich family fallen on hard times and reading books he found in the woods), he attempts to use language to force<br />Frankenstein to have pity on him.  Unfortunately, language isn't enough to turn Frankenstein's head around.  The<br />creature responds by targeting all of Frankenstein's loved ones. The violence we expect from the tale is there -- it's just mixed with surprisingly philosophical discussions between Frankenstein and his creation.<br /><br />The book's structure isn't flawless.  Frankenstein travels -- a lot -- and Shelley thinks we need detailed<br />descriptions of everything he sees.  The narrative is a little clunky (I love an epistolary novel as much as the<br />next person, but why bother if every single document is going to be from the same person and in narrative style?).<br /><br />However, the fact that the creature is so different from what we expect is what saves the novel -- the delight of<br />discovering what he will say and do next is what keeps the reader moving through the novel.<br /><br />The Kindle formatting is perfectly acceptable.  I read a couple of other reviewers fault the lack of white space -- but if that is very important to you, you aren't going to be happy with too many free public domain Kindle books.h as the   next person, but why bother if every single document is going to be from the same person and in narrative style?).

B005PTQPU0|4.0|I've been listening to Kate Bush since I first saw her perform on SNL way back in 1978! From her first album, \\"The Kick Inside\\" through the musically groundbreaking discs like \\"The Dreaming\\" and \\"Hounds of Love\\", she has proven herself to be one of the great innovators working in popular music. Now, thirty years later, she still makes distinctively interesting music. \\"50 Words For Snow\\" continues in basically the same vein as 2005's \\"Aerial\\", especially the album's \\"Sky of Honey\\" disc. The seven tracks of winter imagery flow together to form a powerfully evocative landscape. Song subject matter includes maybe the most erotic snowman imagery ever put to lyric(\\"Misty\\"), to the plight of the Yeti(\\"Wild Man\\"), then to Bush dueting with Elton John as two time-traveling lovers(\\"Snowed In At Wheeler Street\\"). Bush's voice is still impressive and is goose-bump raising in the final track, \\"Among Angels\\".This track which consists of Bush's voice soaring over her own piano accompaniment is an extremely effective coda. Finally, the recording's sonics  must be praised! Del Palmer, Stephen Taylor and other technicians all earn high marks in producing one of the best sounding discs I've heard in quite a while. For those of you lucky enough to have a good sound system or high-end headphones, you have a treat in store!!

0545403359|4.0|I liked Morpurgo's later YA novel, [[ASIN:0439636531 Private Peaceful (After Words)]] , very much. Since then I have read his [[ASIN:0007230591 Born to Run]], which did not interest me nearly as much, but was, admittedly, meant for a much younger audience. The [[ASIN:0141334886 Black Beauty (Puffin Classics)]] -ish WAR HORSE (1982), which has apparently been an enormously successful book for its author, spawning a stage play and now a movie, evoked mixed reactions in me. And perhaps again it's because of its target audience of pre-teens and/or young adults. There is a strong anti-war sentiment here, perhaps best represented in a statement from a young British soldier: \\"... a horse's life is maybe even more important than a man's, 'cause a horse hasn't got no evil in him except any that's put there by men.\\"<br /><br />This seems a bit oversimplified to me as an anti-war horse book, but it hits home nevertheless, and brought to mind a couple of other books I've read about the use of horses in war. Molly Gloss's novel, [[ASIN:0547085753 The Hearts of Horses]] , is a superb example of this sub-genre. Another is [[ASIN:B003ELY7JW Our Horses In Egypt]]. I enjoyed both of these books more than I did WAR HORSE. But again, I figure it's because I'm at least fifty years too old for this book. I would not hesitate to recommend it to young readers who love horses. Morpurgo's excellent reputation in the field of children's lit and YA books is well-earned. He knows what he's doing.<br /><br />- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir BOOKLOVER
B001AZFO14|1.0|Good to keep on as background noise if you are working around the house. Although in retrospect, the radio would have been better.   The only good thing about this movie is that Kurt Russell must have loved it because he had only about 2-3 lines in the whole movie, the rest of his on screen time was taken up by head nods, blank stares and of yes, more black stares. Did I say blank stares ?   Don't waste you time. There are a lot of good free movies on Amazon Prime.... this just doesn't happen to be one of them.
B004SDEP38|1.0|Ads ads and more ads. I'm tired of these Amazon free downloads of the day offering limited functionality and serving up tons of ads. Uninstalling this and amazon app store.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Almost everybody thinks that this movie was terrible and not as good the 1950's movie. Well they are wrong. Who cares if it isn't like the book of the other movie. What makes a movie good is that it isn't boring and cheezey like and from the stone age. This movie defenitly met those requrements. The whole movie is enjoyable and fun, so who  cares if it doesn't follow the story line of the book. The other Time Machine didn't follow all of the book's storyline so who cares if this one doesn't either.
1451627289|4.0|I began by turning the book over. On the back, was a newspaper headline that JFK was not assassinated. It is why I don't give it 5 stars. 800+ pages is a lot, but it was a page turner.  My biggest disappointment was that George went back and couldn't stop it because he discovered it wasn't Oswald on 11-22-63.  It was my first King book, only because I am a JFK assassination junkie.
0307387178|5.0|\\"Into the Wild\\" is an awesome book.  If you like, I would also recommend the newly published book and DVD titled \\"Back to the Wild\\".  They show many more photos that Chris took on his journey and explain more about his life and adventures.  They are also available on Amazon.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I just got the case today, and it has been pretty good. It has enough protection without adding too much weight.  The stand feature actually works, but you just have too massage the hinge a bit(it was quite stiff at first). The weight of the Kindle pushes the device down so that the cover will stay in the groove nice and firm. Mine refused to stand without the Kindle in place too, so just try it with the Kindle inside.  The only star I took off is due to the price. The quality isn't very bad, but I'd definitely agree that it should be at least 10 bucks cheaper.

1451648537|3.0|I enjoyed learning some of what made Jobs tick. But his inner life remains a mystery. How does a College drop out, put together a corporate entity without the skills normally acquired in business schools. He had mentors, what did they teach him? What was his relationship with these important people. Simply stating he was a perfectionist is an interesting point, but what made him decide what was perfect? What permitted him to change from a LSD user to a clear headed business tycoon? How did he self educate himself..was he an avid reader?  There is also an interesting dicotomy, between Steve's minimalist housing, and his need to be in the most expensive hotel suites,like the Four Season's Penthouse costing thousands per night? Needing a private jet, and not wanting to have money influence him? These are not fully explained...simply listed...mentionning limo rides to Pixar studios...it is these contradictions that are not addressed or answered.   The listing of Apple products does not make his thinking all that transparent?  The book gives an interesting reporters perspective that biographers normally don't have. So that this book felt more like a long magazine article than a true biography.

B00110K62U|5.0|Honestly words cant even describe how AMAZING this concert it! I have seen the Broadway musical twice (and am going to see it again in January)...and although this is only a concert of the songs its still incredible (especially if you have surround sound!!). All the \\"favorites\\" return to the stage for an incredible performance and WORDS just dont do it justice!! I have been a HUGE Les Mis fan since I was about 8 yrs old (25 years ago!!) and honestly I dont know why it took me so long to purchase this DVD!! It's the best thing we will have until they release the ACTUAL musical (start to finish).   Although it was made in 1995 (as you can tell when they pan to the audience...what WERE we thinking in the 90's? Our fashion sense was SERIOUSLY lacking back then! LOL) its a MUST HAVE for any true Les Mis fan! Colm Wilkinson reprises his role as the most LOVED Valjean that we've had. The Master of the House (Thenardier - played by Alun Armstrong) and his wife were comical as always and never ceases to crack me up!! I'm not the biggest fan of Judy Kuhn (Cosette) but I guess you cant always please everyone! Lea Salonga (Eponine) was awesome...she has always been my favorite character and I SWORE I was going to play the part of Eponine on Broadway when I grew up! LOL :) Fantine (Ruthie Henshall) was great but the wig they had on her was hard to ignore (it was NOT very attractive at ALL!). Australia's Philip Quast reprised his role as Javert and blew me away with his voice and talent!!   Even though they did not perform the musical (and only sang, dressed in costume, standing at microphones) the cast still stayed in character and conveyed the FEELING in each song wonderfully! It doesn't matter how many times I see the production, I still ALWAYS cry during Fantine's death....Eponine's death...and of course Valjean's death. Colm Wilkinson sang \\"Bring Him Home\\" more beautiful than I could ever put into words.   One of my favorite moments in this DVD was at the very end when SEVENTEEN of the \\"Valjeans\\" from world-wide performances all came up on stage and sang \\"One Day More.\\" It was really awesome as each Valjean took a turn at the microphone, singing in many different languages! It was a very moving performance and such a treat for fans!  The orchestra and chorus of what I would say was over a HUNDRED singers was phenomenal! After watching this DVD I am SUPER excited to see the full-fledged performance again in January!! It's also given me the opportunity to watch it with my oldest daughter (age 18) and husband so that I could explain the story and help them understand what was going on. Now when they go to see the Broadway musical they will be able to follow the storyline and understand it much better...which will help them to ENJOY it more as well!   The ONLY negatives that I have are:  ~During (young) Cosette's song, \\"Castle On A Cloud\\" someone dropped a book or something and it was LOUD making Cosette jump a bit b/c it startled her.  ~They have YET to release a DVD of the ACTUAL musical....and I am still wondering WHY!?  ~If I wasn't there to explain what was going on to my husband and daughter, it would have been a little hard for them to follow. It would have been nice to get a booklet that EXPLAINED the story a bit (like they have in the CD's)...instead of a booklet with nothing but pics of the musical.  If you are a Les Mis fan then you shouldn't wait....just BUY this DVD. You will NOT be disappointed!! :)

0553801473|1.0|Martin clearly was depicting how 'hungry' he was in this title when he went into detail over every damn meal. I wouldn't doubt it by looking at how large he is in real life. I've been a fan of the books since 2002, also this WAS my favorite series, but no longer. The past two hooks have been failures. Two wrongs don't make one RIGHT.<br /><br />My girlfriends father is an author (One Second After) so I know a bit of the relationship between the author and his editor and publisher. Martins editor probably sucks up to him, not actually editing in fear of being scalded. His publisher is obviously giving him too much leeway. It took 6 years for this book to come out, I mean COME ON!
0307454541|5.0|Of the 3 this is by far the best, which is really saying something considering there are a solid 50 pages at the beginning that should have been axed. But overall it is a powerful book, intriguing and satisfying on every level.
B003UYUQZW|1.0|Honestly, when I first saw the previews to this movie, I thought perhaps this movie wouldn't be *TOO* bad. When I had purchased this film, settled down in my couch and hit play on my DVD player, I was completely wrong about that last thought.<br /><br />It was horrible.<br /><br />I get the plot, I get the storyline. And honestly, if this movie was called anything else BUT the Prince of Persia, I would have enjoyed it!<br /><br />But...something about a bunch of white guys speaking in a British accent running around in the Middle East pretending to be Persians?? I just couldn't wrap my brain around it.<br />Yes, that was my biggest issue with this movie (despite the fact that this movie was based from a video game---and not even the original game at that but the more recent version for Xbox which also wasn't that great of a game to begin with): it seemed that Hollywood didn't even really put much effort into convincing me of their characters. I didn't feel that special magical pull I got when playing the playstation 2 version of Prince of Persia. It lacked the sarcasm and the plot twists and the true story line.<br /><br />With all that said, I still stand by my argument that if they were to make a movie played by the Japanese who would speak in a German accent playing the role of a group of Native American people who live in Canada, a lot of viewers would be annoyed by that.<br /><br />Again, if this movie was titled anything else but The Prince of Persia, I would have enjoyed it a bit more. It's hard to watch a movie about your own people and enjoy it when it has been completely exploited in the matter that it was.<br /><br />(And they should have left the video game...just that. A video game.)

B0000057D8|5.0|It's quite obviously redundant for me to simply post the same thoughts and sentiments that have already been posted around this set of acclaimed recordings, but some thirty years after first hearing these, I'm still convinced of the musical achievement of this set of recordings, and of their central place in the library of Bach.<br /><br />Pinnock and The English Consort recorded these pieces just as CD-ROM technology was being developed by Sony and Philips in the late 1970's and early 1980's. The first of these jewel-like plastic discs, which diffracted light falling upon their \\"digital encoding\\" substrate, were both mysterious and lustrous, and the sound that was capable of coming out of them represented a true shift in recording technology. The scratches, pops, and hisses that accompanied so many of even our best vinyl records was now gone, and we were free to start listening to music itself, not music and noise mixed into some obscure signal to noise ratio.<br /><br />Those early days saw a lot of \\"off-label\\" releases. As surrounded many other technological innovations, there emerged a race between producers to see who could produce the best examples of what the new technology could achieve, and it surely must be said that there were releases in the early 1980's from completely obscure musical groups and recording labels that were startlingly well done. But the big labels (Deutsche Grammophon, Philips, and so on) were also in on the act at the advent of the CD-ROM, and their already established ability to RECORD sound at the performance context was now coupled with this new technology that could DISTRIBUTE sound with little technical interference and with the best dynamic range possible. Many of the earliest CD releases therefore came from the big houses, and were subsequently received with critical acclaim. Digital technology is so fully ingrained into music reproduction today that it is easy to forget that it was just three decades ago that we still struggled with pops, clicks, hiss, and static from dragging a diamond across vinyl.<br /><br />The Pinnock/English Concert recordings represented here were of that early generation, though not perhaps at the very first outset, yet close enough for contextualizing their release in this discussion. Because of the time frame in which they were recorded, you will find that some of the pieces in this collection have the \\"ADD\\" SPARS code (meaning that the recording was made with analog technology, but that the mixing and mastering of the recording was done via digital means) and that others will be marked \\"DDD\\" (full digital recording, mixing, and mastering process). So, these recordings really do represent what Deutsche Grammophon was doing at the dawn on the CD-ROM technology, and in conjunction with performing experts like Pinnock and The English Concert.<br /><br />With all that as a preamble, I can say that, since their release some thirty years ago, this set of recordings by Pinnock and The English Concert of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos have been among my favorite recordings, and the time has done little to diminish their position in my, or many others, mind. These are superb performances that are rich but delicate, expansive yet personal, authentic yet smooth. The sound stage is clearly defined and well balanced. Technical accuracy is attended to without ruining the silkiness of the pieces. And, of course, with DG (under the \\"Archiv\\" label) using their immense recording expertise and then distributing these via digital means, the recording itself is technical mastery. These pieces remain, in my thinking, some of the best \\"on offer\\" by the major labels, even when one considers the wonderful and extensive set of releases that accompanied the 1980's (Gardiner's Bach choral cycles are one excellent example). They are simply superb music making and recording. Even with today's improvements and new releases of the Brandenburg Concertos (some of which also are gaining critical acclaim), these pieces remain solid entries into the musical lexicon of Bach performances. An easy five stars.laim), these pieces remain solid entries into the musical lexicon of Bach performances. An easy five stars.
1439153663|3.0|This book was quite well written and seemed historically accurate, I had to give it a hand for that. I also had to applaud the attention to detail and care that was put into representing the slave community, but it was really a downer. Maybe historical fiction isn't my genre.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|First of all the 5.1 Fly By night sounds fantastic. I had no problems with this disc unlike the other reviewer. I am now listening to 2112 and this sounds great so i'm sure the rest will sound great. This is my favorite period for me listening to Rush. I first heard of them on a TV show called In concert playing Working Man and a couple of other songs from their debut album with their first drummer John Rutsey. Bought the album the next day. Buy Sector 1 if your a rush fan. The packaging is also great.

B005TQAI6G|3.0|I have always been a Britney fan but I have never felt compelled to see her in concert because of the major fact that she almost always lip sync all of her music for her live performances. There is no real talent in that but nevertheless I love her and her music and I buy her cds. I love great dance music and I love to dance myself. She does have some beautiful ballads as well. For those of us who are Madonna fans also, I believe that some, if not most of us may be disappointed with the Femme Fatale Tour. Britney rarely dances and her choreography for the entire show is from the waist up. I do not believe that the stage set up or the costumes did her any justice really. It is her dancers who have all the energy but they(the dancers) do not accent her the way Madonna's dancers do. Some of you might think it's unfair to compare the two but as a fan, I am spending my money on their music so I have that right. And for the record, I have been to a Madonna concert-The Sticky And Sweet Tour. What I do like about the Femme Tour is the new song arrangements but there was nothing spectacular or memorable about the performances for me. Some of the fans were having a great time dancing while others just simply looked on. I give Britney credit for lip syncing to her songs well. However, in her final number for DANCE UNTIL THE WORLD ENDS, her lip sync wasn't in unison with her record. I am content with my purchase(at Target) and I am most happy that a dance remix cd is also included. With the inclusion of the dance cd, I gave this review one more star making it 3 stars.  Personally, life could have turned out for the worse for Britney Spears after her public meltdown. It is great to see her happy again and enjoying life.

B005TQACLC|3.0|Sadly instead of growing as an artist at least concert wise this went backwards. She isn't a train wreck but is nowhere near the performer/dancer she once was. I think she can be, but she has to find herself again too many ppl are controlling her. She looked uncomfortable performing some of the moves in \\"if u seek amy.\\" Even the costumes felt a little cheesy; it's sad idk who's running the show but it's not going to last... Circus would've been a better DVD to put out.  Britney seriously needs to take a year to think about what she wants out of life and to get her crap together. Whether it's being with her family or being worthy of being a top entertainer she can do it she just needs to find a direction and get some standards. She owes it to herself and I'd hate to say it but she's going to lose fans if she doesn't raise the bar a little higher. I'll continue to be a fan, but it's sad to watch wasted potential.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I prefer this app to the Weather Channel app because it has radar. It performs well on my Kindle Fire. I recommend it.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I was nervous about buying these, since I had already shelled out money in the past for the Director's Cut DVDs, and I had read several of the negative reviews about the picture quality.  Here is my honest opinion after buying them for $40 (on sale) from Amazon.  Most of those reviewers who gave it one star are technically correct when they say that Paramount could have done a better job.  The \\"restoration\\" of The Wrath of Khan is easily the best looking of the films, and watching it can make you wish that all the films had been restored in the same manner.  That being said, these movies look better than they ever have.  Watch the Klingon ships approach V'Ger in The Motion Picture: Director's Edition DVD on an upconverting player, then replace it with this BluRay version, and I think you will discover that all of the complaints are overblown.  The Blu Ray Edition totally blows the DVD out of the water with detail and clarity.  If you love Star Trek, and are shifting to BluRay, then don't hesitate to buy this set.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|So as a hardcore fantasy geek, I owe director Marcus Nispel and star Jason Momoa a \\"Thank you\\" for NOT taking an utter massive steaming dump on the legacy of Robert E. Howard, one of the founding fathers of modern heroic adventure fiction, though obviously not for lack of moron studio execs trying to make them.   2011's CONAN THE BARBARIAN - Way better, more invigorating and involving than I'd hoped, but still a frustratingly uneven movie - mostly in the writing, but also tonally. Everything that's right/wrong with this picture can be summed with Morgan Freeman's opening voice-over narration. As the music and lights rise, we hear Freeman speaking \\"Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities...\\" And yep, it's the most awesome such oration this side of Ian McKellen uttering \\"One Ring to rule them all...\\" ...Then about a third in, said voice-over veers off into some LOTR-ripoff scattered-deus-ex-machina evil artifact bulls**t from the hack end of the screenwriting-by-committee team. Of people who gave this thumbs-up/thumbs-down, everyone agrees that the opening act, featuring Conan-as-a-boy (Leo Howard - no known relation to REH) and his father (Ron Perlman) is the best part. And DAMN, were they not kidding! I'd have been perfectly happy had the whole movie stuck with the young-Conan-and-Dad team. The chemistry's so right, I ain't gonna lie, the inevitable conclusion of this portion had me a little choked up. The rest of the movie can't seem to decide if it wants to be a remake of the '82 Milius/Schwarzenegger movie or its own, truer take on the material. What keeps it afloat is Jason Momoa as Conan. He strikes a harder-than-it-looks balance between likable, intelligent and relateable, but also believably savage and ruthless, at times downright terrifying to a startlingly *un*likable degree. To say we don't get big screen action-hero characters with this much dimension often enough is an understatement. I just wish more of the story-tellingsurrounding him had as much sense. Nods/references to Howard's original stories were a joy to spot, but I have to ask myself the same question one often asks about, say, the Star Wars prequels: If it weren't for my built-in fondness for what it's drawing on, would it stand on its own so well in this context? Sadly, I don't think so. The villains: Stephen Lang is no James Earl Jones by a long shot, but he's convincingly, palpably nasty, and is no easy pickin's for our hero/anti-hero; As for Rose McGowen as an evil sorceress, all I can really say is... Mmmmmm, yeeeesssssss... She's a baaaaaaaad girl who does baaaaaaaaaaad things... and I like her >:-) *AHEM!* Anyway. The action here is brutal, breathless, visceral... and often jaw-droppingly over the top, with supernatural/fantastical elements that often play into this nicely. I frequently laughed out loud (in a good way) at the sheer audacity of how bugf**k bats**t \\"HOLY CRAP, DID THEY REALLY JUST FREAKIN' DO THAT?\\" insane this gets, in ways I won't spoil (my favorite bit involves a guard sliding back a panel to see who's there, then NOT getting what he expects when he opens the door). But this also becomes one of the film's biggest problems. This may sound weird to some talking about a Conan movie, but after a while it gets TOO heavy on one huge action set-piece after another. Yeah, the Hyborian Age is a chaotic, primal, dangerous, tough-as-nails, morally ambiguous, unforgiving world, but it's also a haunting, brooding, fantastical, bittersweet, hypnotically beautiful, mystery-shrouded landscape like none other. The best Conan stories are as much about this as all the bloody mayhem, the cinematography captures it spot-on, and I found myself longing for more of those quiet, reflective moments to just bask in it a spell.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are amazing! Great feeling when I took them out of the box. They don't cause too much pain after you've had them on for a long time and they have pretty good noise cancelation. Can't forget the clear, crisp sound they have. simply audio!

B005V20JKI|4.0|UPDATED REVIEW: I contacted the dev of this game, and he told me that the GET_TASKS permission is used exclusively by OpenFeint to see what other games you have installed and to make recommendations on what other games you might like. In light of that, I installed the game and tried it out, and it's definitely worth it. It's a fun game, the gameplay is unique and refreshing, and the graphics are pretty good. It's a little annoying with how the guys switch out, and you occasionally get a weakling, but I guess that's for game balance. It wouldn't be much fun if you could just pick the strongest guys all the time.  As for the compatibility issues, I don't know why the description is not here, but on the Android Market, it says this game is not compatible with the LG Optimus phone, and most of the 1-stars on here are from Optimus owners, so I'd say ignore those when judging this game.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I'm not one to usually cry \\"excessive permissions\\". In fact I like to point out why people's fear of some permissions are misplaced, but in this case, no one seems to have noticed one of the most excessive permissions I've ever seen:   \\"Get information about the currently or recently running tasks: a thumbnail representation of the tasks, what activities are running in it, etc.\\"  There is no reason this app would need to know this except for data mining what people use their phones for, and \\"what activities are running in it\\" is very vague. I'm going to try to figure out what that permission allows the app to see. For example, does it allow the app to know what I've input into other apps, like my login info for my banking app? Or does it just allow the app to know I'm running an app that's using GPS? I'm not saying this app is malicious, but I'd like to figure out exactly what that permission means before I install this game.   I will update my rating and my review if I receive an answer from the dev or find an answer online.  UPDATE: I've discovered from elsewhere thatthe GET_TASKS permission (which is the one this review was originally written about, description above) is used to block notifications when the app that launched those notifications is currently focused. I still don't know why this game would require that permission. I found this description of GET_TASKS in an app that is used to accumulate notifications from Gmail, Mail, Messages, Missed Calls, and any other notifications. Again, no reason for a game like this to have that permission. Still no email from the dev.

B001YV502C|4.0|C.O.M. is a very good movie, but it fell short of being a timeless great due to two major gripes. First is the CGI. Although much of it was seamlessly implemented throughout the film, the birth of the baby was done very poorly and looked obviously fake. I do not know why the director decided to show the actual birth, when a sequence of shots that implied as much would have sufficed.   My second problem was some of the dialogue. The story was amazing, but some of the dialogue did not really flow with the scenes, or was just plain weak or awkward.  I think the director did a great job though and paid great attention to detail; the atmosphere and themes were very profound. The part at the interment camp in the final act was an amazing bit of cinema; gripping, terrifying, grim.  4/5!

0321704452|3.0|This is a great book that teaches individuals how to present or communicate in an effective manner. The books core theme is to teach the reader how to take away all of the unnecessary things that have been taught during presentation skills training by simplifying the delivery. Reynolds's writes that passion is the most important aspect of a presentation along with honesty, integrity, clarity and nakedness. When he writes about nakedness, he means to be as natural as possible and let the audience see who you really are instead of being so formal that you are boring. He teaches that the core of a presentation is preparation, punch, presence, projection, passion, proximity, play, pace, participation and power.

B005M2A4DE|4.0|Here's another one of what may be an unpopular review.  I do not focus on such things like a story by story synopsis, since most other reviewers do this.  Instead, I try to focus on the things which people should know about this product other than... \\"Episode one was great because of blah blah and the SFX.  And in episode two...\\"    This season came under criticism on two fronts.  One, was the fact the Stephen Moffat took advantage of the fact that this is a show revolving around time travelers.  And as such, not everything took place in chronological order.  B, I mean, two, the season was bisected, which as to allow the show to be seen over a longer period.    Moffat took a big leap in making the show more interesting by having a complex and convoluted story arc, and in my humble opinion, that was brilliant.  Doctor Who was always meant to be an intelligent show, and I feel he did that quite well in the first part of the season.  Anyone who needs to have their hand held, and have someone connect the dots between episodes one, to four, to six, etc., should probably be watching something more simplistic, like Sesame Street.  It's just too bad that several episodes of the second part of the season were dumbed down.  \\"Night Terrors, The Girl Who Waited, and The God Complex\\" were filler episodes, and even though \\"Closing Time\\" was as well, it was by far the best stand alone episode of the bunch.    Overall, in spite of these three filler episodes, this season on a whole was what Doctor Who should be.  Engrossing, provocative, and intelligent.  On the aspect of the program itself, I would give it 4 stars.  It's well worth watching, and I'm happy to include it in my collection.  As for the way this box set was made, I have to give it 1 star.  While the prequels were included, there wasn't an option to watch them in order before their respective episodes.  Even last year's set gave the opetion to view the \\"Meanwhile, in the TARDIS\\" shorts as part of the episode!  COME ON 2 ENTERATIN!!!  Use your brain and think about what you're doing when putting this together.  Worse still is that there are commentaries on only four episodes.  And the only thing worse than that, is when there is a commentary for only one of the two part episodes!  REALLY?  Couldn't you at least finish what you started?  There was a time when commentaries were provided for every episode.  Don't get lazy now!  The fact that this was done so poorly, without any common sense, and lacking more features is not only sloppy, it's insulting.  Whether you agree with this review or not, please try to appreciate what season 6 has to offer.

The fact that she has been blackmailed into stealing a coin from the hoard of a dragon goes against everything she has ever learned or done.  While she does the crime she knows that she won't live if Dragos (the dragon) ever finds her.  So she goes on the run.  But, she can't help but being attracted to Dragos when he finds her.  But, will she share her most precious secret and her heart with him?<br /><br />Dragos cannot believe that someone actually had the audacity to steal from him, let alone find and succeed and steel from him.  Once he finally tracks down the thief he can't believe how interesting and sexy he finds his thief.  What will even shock him more is when it becomes clear he might actually be mating with her.  But, will his enemies tear them apart before they can really explore their secrets and heart's desire?<br /><br />Dragon Bound is a shape-shifting plot twisting read that captured me at the first page and didn't let me go until long after I was done reading.  I loved Ms. Harrison's characters and how she developed them into a society that was able to interact and all be believable.  I Joyfully Recommend Dragon Bound mostly because there is no higher recommendation I can give.  I can't wait until Grey has his own book, though I realize there are a few others (that I will be first in line for) that are coming first.

B004MGMIA8|5.0|So often we get to know composers through a handful of their most familiar works, continually played almost as a ritual, sometimes just on certain days of the year, and we never get a chance to experience what a wealth of music - at least as good as, and sometimes even better, than the limited few that are often applauded as soon as their first few notes are played.  The current edition is a real ear-opener.  It's like the adventure of meeting a man who seems to have been made of music and being taken through his own personal treasure house.    At first glance it might seem that a 52-CD set would be overwhelming. Just the opposite happens - as soon as you finish one you're looking forward to the next one.  Everything has been done in a meticulous way - including a referenced website that details any information you might be left wondering about, each link covering each CD and its contents.  And for those for whom music is a respite from words, it is reward enough to experience the extraordinary achievement of a composer from whom so much poured forth, and so little has been heard.
0446573019|4.0|In a rural coal mining area of West Virginia, a postman is delivering an envelope that has to be signed for. He knocks on the door, and as he waits, it is pushed open from the inside by a dog that is covered with blood. When he enters the house, he realizes that there's no one there who can sign.  The entire family, a man, his wife, and their two children, have been brutally murdered. Because the murdered man was a Colonel in the Defense Intelligence Agency, Army investigator John Puller is dispatched to West Virginia to assist the local authorities in tracking down the killer.   Puller arrives and teams up with police detective Samantha Cole. When one of her deputies who was guarding the crime scene is found hanged and a young couple living nearby are also found dead, they realize that the original murder was not just a random act of violence. From that point, the key to solving the mystery is for Puller and Cole to figure out what was the motive behind the killings.  Baldacci does an excellent job of weaving together the well-developed characters with a background of coal mining and the defense industry to create a plausible story. The only weakness with books of this type is that, because Puller is so infallible, there's not much suspense when he's in a life threatening situation. However, overall the book is a good read and it might make you think that it's possible that there could be dangerous things around you that you were never aware of.
B00007AJGH|5.0|This movie has been a long-time favorite with both my children and now their children. While the language can be a little rough for small children, in retrospect it is no worse, and probably tamer, than what they hear at school.  I would definitely like to see this movie in a Blu-Ray version. The graphics would be that much better. A great story with an enduring quality, especially for those of us with Southern California roots.
145551389X|2.0|This pairing really runs it's course.There are so many photos that are purely fan interest.Gaga comes off as a creature that photographs very unevenly. Such a compilation demands even more charisma. Only Marilyn Monroe could hold up to the scrutiny of the lens as  in Richardson's 450 photos. There are a few really good shots,like Gaga looking like a haggard misfit,looking out from a hotel balcony.One popish shot with her glamorized head in a sink.i also liked several concert shots. Terry Richardson(master of raunchy) is watered down here,and Gaga is diluted by too many boring photographs. There are hoards of pictures here,and the majority will not enhance the reputation of Gaga or Richardson.It appears to fall short of real art. It's as if you found a book of personal photos,taken randomly.  Richardson stops short of his trademark in your face vulgarity.(no spontaneous sexy stuff)Gaga is neutralized by the repetition of it all.Little Monsters  may like this vanity fair.Gaga needs the stage setting to be interesting.Madonnas Sex book makes this look like a romp in the playground.Pop star stuff. Gaga must have enlisted Richardson because of his popular vulgar style. Then she left out the vulgar!Well, it does have to be acquired by her young fans. P.S. I think Lady Gaga is a fun artist and a great philanthropist! She does many wonderful things! This book isn't one of them.

0385535139|1.0|Over the years I have enjoyed reading Grisham.  He knows how to spin a page-turning tail, he keeps it clean and brings his stories to a satisfying conclusion.  So I bought his latest on my Kindle and promptly started reading.  Yikes.  Did he have a contract to fulfill????  I found myself not caring where the story was going, and unsatisfied with where it went.  The characters were cartoonish (the alcoholic aging attorney, the young attorney, the sexy attorney on the other side, the burned out attorney. . .), and the plot listless.  I thought I was being set up for a David v. Goliath tale where small time lawyer beats big-money law.  Instead it was Grisham v. my need to sleep.  The latter usually won.  Too many books for this author?  My advice?  Read one of his earlier books if you haven't read them all.
B004LROUNG|2.0|I stopped reading Grisham many years ago - probably around the same time you did if you're a fan of his early work (e.g. A Time to Kill).  Somewhere along the way, he decided to use his books as a vehicle to discuss whatever random social cause he was interested in at the time.    Fast forward to this book.  I read the reviews and was excited because it sounded like he had returned to his previous form.  I was WRONG.  This book is filled with a bunch of characters you don't like - In fact, I started liking the main character simply because he wasn't as bad as everyone else.  There is also no \\"heart\\" to this book.  In his early books, he would pull the reader into his world and make them feel ... something.  That is completely missing here.  I can summarize this book for you right here:  Greed and fat people are the downfall of our society.  Oh, and apparently all fat people are slovenly, dirty, mean people who live at all-you-can-eat pizza buffets.    Speaking of greed... This book is $12.99 but there is one page on which I counted 5 separate product placements.  Why do I have to pay full price for book overflowing with product placement?  Mr. Grisham, I want my $12.99 back.

1466284862|5.0|How is it that Forester can deliver a layer-cake cross-section of English society, politely critique his countrymen, throw in a smattering of culture and a discussion of its merits, blend in an atypical \\"love\\" story, some sensational gossip, an unplanned pregnancy, and several off-stage deaths,  yet deliver an engrossing novel that is as literary as it is soap-operatic? Does anyone write at this caliber today? Forster interweaves 3 families of different classes to discuss the question of who shall inherit England. Shall it be the old-money German imports, the Schlegels, who care more for culture and nuance since they don't have to earn a living, or the industrious but artless Wilcoxes, who care only for money and property, or the working class Basts who have neither money nor position and must rely upon those above them for support? This novel seems especially poignant today as the financial crises has separated the classes; money, in Forster's world as in ours, segregates the survivors from the chaff; the poor do not fare well. Margaret, the heroine of the story, is able to strike a compromise between the disparate worlds, staying married to one of the newly rich who has fallen from grace, keeping her unwed and pregnant sister despite the contempt of society, and creating her own universe at Howard's End far from the reach of London's social snobbery to live out her mature years. Still further from the epicenter is Paul Wilcox, who leaves for India to find his own fortune, and young Tibby Schlegel, Margaret's brother, who can easily be viewed as the author; these two perpetual and self-determining bachelors are as removed from the fray as possible and ignorant of society's foibles. Perhaps the future of England lies with gay ex-pats?

0688002307|3.0|There have been critiques that say that this book has nothing to do with Zen or motorcycle maintenance, both of which I will confirm. I would also disagree with the book cover propaganda that it is a book about how to live your life better (there is nothing of the sort contained within these pages.) However, one cannot dismiss this book which has remained a \\"must read\\" for the decades it has been in print. This book weaves 3 \\"intertwined\\" tales: a travelogue of a man taking an aimless cross-country trip with his \\"crazy\\" 11-year old son on a motorcycle (seriously?), a meandering walk through a modern person's biased view of Greek philosophy, and the lion's share is about a teacher/student who loses his mind questioning things too deeply (and abstractly) as he fights the establishment with no real reason besides proving he is right. I can sum up the general zeitgeist of the book in two words, \\"question everything.\\" Should this be a must read? Probably not, but like Wikipedia, it is a jumping off point for the reader to question their own life and way of living and jumpstart their own journey into philosophical dialectics.

1451627289|5.0|The critics enjoy lambasting the oeuvre of Stephen King who remains as a favorite author with a wide audience. King has won the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to National Letters. Like the 100 year old Charles Dickens and other great writers he does what the best in the business know is important:<br />a. Telling a crackerjack story in language easily comprehensible to the average person<br />b. Using imagination to fascinate the reader and keep him/her turning pages.<br />c. Doing the homework necessary as he describes time and place.<br />  The Plot: Wild! This is a time travel novel stretching to over 800 pages in the hardback edition. Jake Epping is the chief character and narrator of the novel. We see the amazing events narrated through his eyes. The story begins in Lisbon Falls Maine in 2011. Jake teaches GED classes; he becomes intrigued by the story of a gruesome family member related by Harry Dunning the school janitor. Jake discovers that Al Templeton the moribund owner of a local eatery has a pantry. Inside this pantry is a time hole. Jake enters the hole to find himself in Derry Maine in 1958. His goal is twofold: to prevent the murder of the Dunning family and the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas in 1963.<br />  In the 1958-63 world Jaske visits he changes his name to George Amberson. He becomes a teacher in Florida and Texas. In the small town of Jodie Texas he falls in love with Sadie Dunhill a fetching librarian and a native of Georgia. Sadie's cruel and crazy husband John Clayton is on her trail hoping to harm her. Later George and Sadie will work together to try and change the obdurate nature of the passt. These two brave souls will seek to save Kennedy through the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald on that horrible day in Dallas.<br />  Caveats:<br />a. The book is much too long-yes there are boring sections. The book could serve as a doorstop!<br />b. Those readers hoping the whole book will delve deeply into the various conspiracy theories regarding the Kennedy murder will be disappointed. The book is focused on Jake and his love for Sadie. The material King does use to discuss the relationship between Oswald, his detestable mother and his Russian wife Marina are well drawn.<br />  The novel is a complex weaving of imagination and memory of an America long gone by a great popular storyteller. Stephen King is to be applauded on this outstanding novel. As a member of the baby boomer generation it was rich in nostalgia for a simpler and more innocent hour in our national life. King puts us back half a century ago as we savor the clothing, the music and the entertainment of those happier days. Life is dance so join Stephen King for a spell on the dance floor with a master author!ous conspiracy theories regarding the Kennedy murder will be disappointed.

0060873027|4.0|If you are hoping for a hard science premise you'll be disappointed.  The technology which the plot revolves around has only a very flimsy connection to any real science, and it requires a considerable suspension of disbelief.  As a long-time Crichton fan, this part was a bit of a let-down.  But once you get past that, the descriptions of life on a bug's scale were fantastic and well-researched.  Some scenes were so real and so graphic that you may find them disturbing. These aren't the cartoon bugs of animated movies, these are the real deal, in all their ruthlessness and magnificent construction.  These are the parts of the book that kept me turning the pages.  I just wish we could have entered that miniature world in a way that wasn't quite so \\"honey I shrunk the kids\\" silly.  Overall a good read, and still worthy of bearing Crichton's name.
B005V20JKI|3.0|This game sounded very unique and entertaining just from looking at the app page alone, and it was indeed unique. Entertaining? Not so much when it's constantly lagging on my device. And sadly it's bad enough that I can't do much when there is more than a little going on at once.   Pros: Originality and features rarely seen on moblie games, such as voice acting and multiplayer. Cons: Very laggy, and overly sensitive controls so you can't merely turn your character to shoot behind you. Also changing the character each time you get a muffin became a little fustrating after awhile too.
0898159156|5.0|Carnivorous plants are addictive!  Before I got into this, I read this book, to help me understand what plants were out there and how to take care of them.  Now, that I have many.....(I said this was addictive.)....I use this book as my Bible.  I am fortunate that I can visit the author's retail nursery.  I always take this book when I go shopping.  When I am looking at a prospective new plant, I look it up in the book to see what the growing conditions and tips are.  Based on that information, I can make a fairly good decision about what might survive in my studio apartment.  At home, the book is great for general plant care.  I love the soil recipes designed for the various types of plants.  When I need to repot or consolidate plants, I'll whip up the right soil mix, based on this book.  The propagation information is wonderful, too.  I have successfully propagated sundews from root cuttings.  I want to do more, but I don't have the room!  Anyway, this is a great book for someone starting out in carnivorous plants.  And it is a great horticultural reference for growing and propagating your collection.  You might start with just one, but believe me, once you get the carnivore bug, you are in for an exponential growth in your plant collection.  It is really fun!
B005OLF6BI|1.0|Reviews are mostly, if not exclusively, written by fans of an artist. I am making an exception with this review. Ms. Swift is, by most accounts, a nice person. Her music however (regardless of performance flubs) is at best \\"cute\\". I can see pre-teen or even teenage girls liking this sort of material. They buy and Ms. Swift's sales go through the roof. She is a star by all rights. But let us not kid ourselves here. Take away her image and extremely aggressive marketing and what you are left with is only inspiring if you are not curious about music in general. Once you you listen to musicians with real talent, it is difficult not to feel sorry for people who will continue to listen to Ms. Swift.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games is set in America's future. A civil war has resulted in a new nation, Panem, lorded over by the Capitol. To remind the districts of their defeat in the war, the Capitol has devised the Hunger Games, to which every district must send one male and one female contestant between the ages of 12 and 18. These contestants fight each other to the death. The victor wins lifelong rewards for him- or herself, and a yearlong bounty of food for his or her district.   District 12 is a poor part of Panem, in the coal-mining hills of Apalachia. A girl named Katniss and the baker's son, Peeta, represent their district, which has only produced two winners in the 74-year history of the game. While Peeta has been chosen by lottery, Katniss volunteers when her younger sister's name is drawn. Love gets Katniss into the games. Will love also get her out alive? That's the  question at the heart of The Hunger Games.   Despite the gruesome nature of the story's premise, the violence in the book is not overdone. But it is gruesome enough to make you question a culture which thrives on violence as entertainment. The holes were as follows: I wondered why, though the Lords of Panem are all powerful, why was their no rebellion attempt or at least screams of horror by the parents? Even if it meant death for them I doubt most parents would stand idly by as their children were rounded up and marched to their likely death in the games. Secondly it seems like the emotions expressed in the book are cinematic, meant for drama and lack subtle realism. It is captivating, but this very much felt like mass market fiction. There was entertainment to be sure, but no real depth.

B005OLF6BI|5.0|Normally when you see an artist put out a DVD for a concert you assume it is for the money.  One thing about Taylor is that she looks out for her fans.  I have seen her twice with my two daughters.  I was amazed the price of the tickets were resonable and even more impressed that I could get t-shirts, programs, etc. all at very fair prices. (same can not be said for the beer at the concert).  She helps takes care of her fans again with not only a near 2 hour DVD but also a near 1 1/2 hour CD and all for just over $16. Both are amazing and a must for any Taylor fan.  If you saw the concert you get to see parts you missed from whatever your seats were and if you didn't get to go you get the best seat in the house for $16.  I saw this concert on the Nashville stop.  Having seen her on the Fearless tour as well I had high expectations.  This concert is her at her best in both visual and audio.  If you are not a Taylor fan give it shot.  My guess is you will not be disappointed.
0385535139|3.0|I have to agree with a few of the reviews.  Hard to get into the book, and on the whole I don't like or care about the characters.  The main character is slightly unbelievable in his goodness to others, a little too moralistic, I resent being preached to while I am relaxing.  Do good unto others and somehow you will be okay is the message here.
B005V20JKI|4.0|The game runs flawlessly on my Samsung Galaxy S II.  The pace starts a little fast, but not terrible.  The gameplay is a little weak.  The graphics are great and the sound is good.  The theme is a bit offensive to me, but not obvious to everyone.  The constantly changing characters is annoying, it makes one want to avoid collecting the muffins, which is the goal in the first place.  Overall, I give it a 4.
B000001GS3|4.0|The other reviews here are a real love fest for this version of Macbeth.  I don't agree completely.  I bought this on CD when it first came out and have never been crazy about it, despite its virtues.  I find it rather uninvolving in places.  My taste in early to mid Verdi is for some blood and guts.  The recording has to have some impact, the singers have to really dig into their roles.  This performance sounds rather pallid compared to the competition.  It's too subtle by half.  If Abbado's desire was to react to the blood-and-thunder recordings of early Verdi, he was certainly successful, but I rather think that tradition should not be cast aside so lightly.    The recording quality is very fine and the acoustic spacing of the singers to create a good stage picture is superior to the competition.  Looking at the competition, Muti plays this opus like he's giving a traditional performance in an Italian opera house; so does Leinsdorf.  Abbado, an Italian for goodness sake, goes for a dark sound.  If you want Macbeth done as sort of a dark tone poem with voice, this is for you.  The acoustic is dark, Verrett as Lady Macbeth a mezzo.  Verrett sings very well, but she is in no way in the league of Rysanek and Nilsson.  Compared to Rysanek and Nilsson I find her somewhat underwhelming.  For example, for Leinsdorf, Rysanek reads the letter in Act 1 in great Italian, than sings a thrilling cabaletta and aria to follow.  Verrett sings well, but the thrill is gone  The male cast members are excellent.  The banquet scene in Act 2 is fine, with Cappuccilli outstanding in the segment wiht Banquo's ghost.  I like the way he acts the words and makes the scene exert the right effect.  I find Leinsdorf with Warren and Rysanek superior to this, even with its dodgy 1959 sound, which was darned good for its time on LP but not so hot (high-level distortion and low level hum) in the current MP3 incarnation.  Too bad RCA hasn't done a SACD reinvigoration of it as they have with some oftheir other great stuff from the 1950s.  On the evidence of LPs the original taped sound was likely a lot better than the MP3 version.  Oh, well, to each his own.
B005V20JKI|4.0|It loads.  It plays.  The game can't keep track of which way is up.  I kept the Kindle Fire at the correct level for playing on the horizontal level, the same as other apps, yet it kept flip-flopping while playing.  This made it rather difficult to play when the screen kept switching.  Other than that, the game seems to play fine.

0393064476|5.0|I never heard about this book before I saw it on the NYT's list, and decided soon that I have to find time to read this one on my Kindle reader. It led to my discovering of Lucretius Carus' \\"De Rerum Natura,\\" which I'm still reading as of this writing ('it's not an easy poem to read, by the way'). I even have its prose version in English from my online bookstore, which I'll read one of these days. And earlier, I read about this book's winning a National Book Award (non-fiction category), which totally delighted me.   What I like most about this book has been the curious, very intriguing narrative it shared that provided the context on how books (that include the mind boggling 'De Rerum Natura', which is a looong poem at that!) dangerously go about changing people's way of thinking and subsequent behaviors. And this book has got me into thinking that elites (at least, those members of society's elites who find time to read and write, of which there are so many kinds, depending on wealth and knowledge they have access to in their respective lives) make use of books, in general, plus among other tools, to overhaul and change structures in society. Yes, it's not only thru wars these elites change society---they also do it through books. And this continues to this day, although not many have been aware of the intriguing process because so many seems to take book reading for granted, given distractions of all kinds these days that compete on people's attention.   I got very curious in discovering from this book how the fabled Alexandrian Library went down and gone in a matter of a few generations after Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire under Constantine, which political development resulted to the eventual out-lawing of other forms of religions in the Western World, including those considered under 'paganism' (which was really an evolved mockery term for something considered not Christian). And I felt bad about how a very progressive female mathematician/philosopher/scientist, who happened to be pagan, was murdered ('she was skinned alive') by the extremist members of Christianity then. This kind of event actually happens eerily up to these days, although not in exact forms. You see and read about them from extremists among the Muslims, Jewish, Christians, Hindus, etc (not necessarily in that order---extremists are everywhere these days and they behave hysterically because they can't tolerate change, which, by the way, is among the main topics of 'De Rerum Natura').   Actually, and also based on what I've read so far about 'De Rerum Natura,' the world-changing ideas covered in this book that discussed Lucretius Carus' only known surviving work (as most of the books prior to destruction of the Alexandrian Library are now considered mostly 'remnants') are nowadays so-common. You'd wonder 'what's the fuss all about?' And why write about a book that's very difficult to read, in the first place? But note that in those years before 'De Rerum Natura' was brought to light again, those ideas were considered subversive. And espousing those ideas would even cost you your dear life as what happened to so many pioneering individuals who could not be tolerated by elites and their followers who felt their very lifestyles were being changed and threatened (which they would soon discover that they can't go against with, because that's part of nature, as 'De Rerum Natura' expounds).   Among these ideas include the mortality of soul, which 'De Rerum Natura' explains 'will die as soon as the mortal body dies.' And that there's 'no life after death.' And that religions espouse cruelty, the most disturbing example has been the practice of sacrificing one's own children for religious reasons. Also, it talked about atoms, which we learned from school or even watch on TV shows. Plus, the main purpose of life is seek pleasure, which implies, among other things, watching from a pleasurable distance how your co-humans suffer in theabsurd forms of their fears and unhappy existence. Go figure the implications of these ideas out now. We've probably gone far, but we're never sure if the same is true with some groups of people. And disturbingly, we discover that a lot among our midst have yet to be reached by the light that came from 'De Rerum Nostra' (among other books) when it showed up again during Renaissance time centuries ago.
1451648537|5.0|Hands down - This is the best book I have read in a decade.  It left me reflective, in awe, and inspired.  Steve Jobs and the products he created are unique and indeliable. They have changed the landscape of the world. I appreciate the author's careful attention to detail, particularly with respect to the hardware and software industry of the 1970's-1980's, and with respect to the main character.  I disagree with other reviewers that content was left out.  I think Isaacson covered all his bases, and then some.  I enjoyed reading this book; the ending left me both inspired and somber, but most of all in awe.

It<br />also continues the more complex and fractured time structure approach of<br />Almodovar's more recent work, to great effect.<br /><br />In the end it's a gorgeous looking, philosophically complex mystery and<br />horror film. Although not particularly gory, this is a disturbing work, both on a<br />literal story level, and also for the questions it raises about<br />identity, love, sado-masochism, and passion run amok.<br /><br />These themes are all Almodovar touchstones, but delivered here with a<br />visually stunning icy touch, and with much more complete logic than in<br />his early works, which often felt less fully thought through, and had<br />more frustrating plot holes and character leaps.<br /><br />Not a 'scary' film, but a creepy, moody and highly effective one. A<br />dark fairy tale as told by, say Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />It's good to see Antonio Banderas reunited with Almodovar, and he<br />delivers a wonderfully complex and quirky modern day Dr. Frankenstein.<br /><br />Less emotional than my two very favorite Almodovar films (Talk to Her,<br />All About My Mother), but its exciting to see this extremely talented<br />film maker continue to evolve and grow, and I think this represents<br />work that can stand among his best.

1594744769|5.0|Although the book was mysterious and thrilling, it's full of photographs and handwritten letters that are difficult to read.  After looking at them for a while, I could decipher them, but it was still difficult.  I really did love the book but I wished there had been more character development on some of the other peculiar children that were mentioned in the photographs early on in the book but never seemed to come up again later.
B005ORVMCY|5.0|Like Duane, I have the same problem with the \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" DVD-Audio.  The only way it will play is in DVD Video mode.  I bought Sector 2 to get the DVD-Audio.  It is very discouraging to hear that Duane returned it only to get another one with the same problem.  I will be returning mine today.  I was going to exchange it for another copy, but that may be fultile as it now appears these discs may all be faulty.  I also have the Oppo BDP-83 and have no problems with any other DVD-Audio disc.  I tried this disc in an older model Pioneer Elite DVD-Audio player and while it would spin it, the sound was totally messed up.  The sub was extremely loud and the front channels were extremely low.  Something is seriously wrong with the authoring on this disc.  It will play surround in DVD-Video mode but you loose the hi rez audio and the lyrics. Trying to play the dvd-audio results in the player locking up.  I have to unplug the player from power and plug it back in to eject the disc.  This is unacceptable.  If anyone buys this and the dvd-audio (not the 5.1 dvd video) works fine, please post it and let us know where you purchased it. I would love to get a working copy.  This should easily be a Five Star set, but with these problems I can only give it one star.  *** Update.  The latest Public Beta Firmware from Oppo corrected this issue.  Note that the latest approved firmware did not work.  My only problem with this set was the inability to play this disc.  This is now resolved and the rating changed to 5 stars.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app on my Kindle Fire, was one of the fist I got and I have enjoyed every min of it.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|What a disappointment.  The cover on this case is incredibly flimsy and barely covers the front, the stand doesn't work well.  And once you put the Fire into it, it is almost impossible to get it out again.  The whole think  is so thin, that I can't imagine it provides any real protection if you drop your Fire.  The whole thing feels cheap.  I'm packing it up and returning it today.
0439023521|5.0|This book totally rocks!!! i couldn't put it down! i read the whole thing in about 2 1/2 days. I love it! It is a little long, but long books are often better (in my experience). I really want the boxed set for christmas or my b-day (i got the first book on my kindle). This book is great! i can't wait until the movie comes out on march 23rd.  Ok, now for the main plot. A 16 year old girl named Katniss Everdeen hunts (which is illegal) for food for her family. this book takes place in a former north america. The united states has been destroyed, leaving 13 districts. district 13 was ruined. Katniss lives in district 12, the coal mining district. Once a year, 2 teenage children (one boy, one girl aged 12 to 18) from each district are picked to participate in the hunger games. they must fight to the death. the last one standing wins wealth, fame and prosperity. **SPOILER** when katniss' younger sister, primrose, is picked to participate in the hunger games, katniss volunteers for her. afterwards... well just read the book because otherwise i will totally ruin it for you because i love this book and i will totally summarize it and ruin the suspense for those who want to read it in 2 or 3 paragraphs.  This is a great book! :)
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app helps me so much. I highly recommend it as a &quot;must have&quot; app. I have used apps like this before but this one is the best.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|There are so many reviews here that mine feels quite hidden and unnecessary but I love this album so much that I have to put my two cents in. There is no track on this album I don't love, several are outstanding though-\\"About a boy\\" is beautiful and describes everything that I felt during my break up, and of course the almost overplayed \\"someone like you\\". The songs are addictive! The album genuinely touched my emotions, thank you Adele!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Everyone is dogging this movie and book I LOVED the book every bit as much as the rest and I really reaLLY  liked this movie<br /><br />I was a little disapointed that the soundtrack didn't include MUSE or PARAMORE but that's a small detail other than that the movie was very good I thought and I can't wait untill the second part
0571283578|3.0|\\"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed...\\"  It was with great anticipation that I opened my copy of \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\", PD James' new historical mystery/Jane Austen pastiche, set six years after the conclusion of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  I fully expected to love it, I really wanted to love it, but by the time I was half way through, I realised to my dismay that not only had I lost any interest whatsoever in whodunit and why, but for two pins I could have happily murdered most of the characters myself for being so unforgivably tiresome.   What can I say? I love the work of both Austen and PD James, and thought this would be a marriage made in heaven, but while \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" is a worthy stylistic achievement and psychological study, oh dear, it's dull, dull, dull!  Although James captures Austen's gently ironical tone beautifully, it lacks animation; unfortunately she fails to emulate Austen's lively banter and sparkling, incisive wit or her graceful sense of comedic timing. It would be unreasonable to expect a frenetic pace in a story set at a Georgian country estate and based around leisurely day-to-day domestic arrangements. However, the pace of James' stolid narrative could at best be called stately, at worst glacial. Sheer tedium is all too soon exposed as the real killer of this murder mystery, and quite possibly, rendering both Darcy and Elizabeth boring its true crime.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This little thing is amazing. I'm converting digital audio to analog with this [...] and it works but the volume was so low it was unusable.    This amp now boosts up the volume and is perfect! No distortion or static, does what it says.    I used it on my phone with my headphones and the bass is crazy with the bass boost.    Love it, definitely recommend this to anyone who needs louder and clear audio.
1451648537|5.0|I found the book to be very informative, I wanted to know about Steve Jobs the person,since I had heard so many different opinions about him. I did realize he was rude and all the other negative things about him but really was so impressed with his genious in design and ingenuity. The reviews I read stated alot of info was not included but realize too, the book was over 600 pages and he was such a complex person I guess it would take 1200 pages to explain him. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was horrified at his behavior and amazed at his accomplishments all at the same time. This book definitely worth the read!!
B001UV4XFG|1.0|Very disappointed. I placed 3 separate orders and 4 of the dvds, including this one, were made from Mexico.  It clearly shows on Amazon site one cover with English only text, but the DVD you get is stamped 'Made in Mexico', a different cover, and the Title & narrative are written in English and Spanish.  So if the price is 'too good to be true' and does not come directly from Amazon, this is probably what you will get. Yes, you can return it, and yes, it is a big hassle. Hope this saves some people the trouble I went through...

B005POK858|5.0|I was skeptical that a decent size RPG would be good on my Samsung Galaxy S phone. The app installed just fine and ran just fine with minimal to no slow-downs. The game drains the battery on my phone pretty fast, so I would recommend having a charger on when playing. I don't review an app until I have played through the game completely.<br /><br />Story: The machines are invading the planet again. They were defeated a long time ago but some strange force is transporting them back to the planet. It is up to you and your party to stop the machines and defeat the evil that is controlling them.<br /><br />Gameplay: 1 player RPG. You control a party that grows to 4 people total. Battles are random as move through the open world and shrines. You have objectives that take you from city to city. Fighting is a huge part of the game as well as leveling up and powering up your skills. Below is a breakdown of each. You get money by defeating enemies. The money can be used in towns to buy upgrades, skills, items, stay at the Inn, etc.<br /><br />Fighting: Each party member has special attacks and magic they can use in battle. Weapons and armor are bought from merchants or found in treasures. During a fight, you are given 5 options: Attack, Skills, Items, Retreat, or Defense. There are pre-emptive attacks from both your party and the enemy's party but that is also random.<br /><br />Skills: Each party member has a special attack skill and can add spells and other magic to their skills list. You can purchase additional skills from merchants. Skills can be upgraded using the following types of gems. The gems can be found in treasures, found when you find Ooparts and examine them from the history menu, some can be purchased (diffusing gems), and some are dropped by enemies when defeated.<br /><br />Reinforcing Gem- Upgrades your skill to the next level via the customize option on the menu. IE- Fireball will become Fireball 2, then 3 and Harty's power shot will become double shot, then triple shot.<br /><br />Change Element- Changes a magic skill from Fire to Wind to Thunderbolt to Ice-edge. Also works on some skills like Weakpoint, changing it to Item Checker.<br /><br />Diffusing Gems- Changes your skill from a single enemy attack to attack all. Can be used on magic skills and fighting skills.<br /><br />Intensify Gems- Reverts a skill that has been upgraded to attack all back to a single attack.<br /><br />Duplicate Gems- Copies a skill. Useful if you want to copy your attack skill so you have 1 that attacks single and 1 that attacks a group or a magic skill that you want to copy and change to a different element.<br /><br />Conclusion: The graphics are very good for an android app. The monsters and characters look good. Controls are simple with an arrow pad and an execute button. The game took me a little over 12 hours to beat and there was still a lot of exploring to do and places I couldn't get into. When you complete the game, you get a key that you can use to unlock doors that were locked during the quest. I haven't found a way to the member's only island yet so if anyone finds a way, post a response. Worth the price tag if you like RPG games. This game can easily give you 12-15 hours of play with lots of exploring.<br /><br />Update: 12/05/11- You get the member's only island card in one of the treasure boxes that is accessible using the key you get upon completing the game.en triple shot.<br /><br />Change Element- Changes a magic skill from Fire to Wind to Thunderbolt to Ice-edge.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|Having chosen a Fire over an iPad because of its smaller size and weight I was unwilling to add bulk or heft with a case.  I spend a great deal of time on airplanes and attempt to travel efficiently.  In addition, I travel with polycarbonate luggage and am accustomed to the thin yet durable material, so I ordered this case in spite of the reviews describing it as cheap and flimsy. This case is well-made, sleek, and perfect for the Fire, fitting it like a glove. It adds little weight and bulk, and the materials are of good quality. My Fire snapped into it easily and is securely seated. The attached elastic strap serves multiple functions: when the cover is closed it will slip around and fasten it, and when the cover is open it flips to the back to hold it out of the way. Although cost was not a deciding factor, the price was good and I am thoroughly satisfied. It does not have extra pockets or slips but I wasn't looking for any, so this was not a concern.  The Fire's power button is inconveniently located at the bottom of the tablet, making it too easy to accidentally engage it if resting the device on a table or even in one's lap. This cover adds just enough thickness to protect from accidental shutdowns without obscuring the very small button. Time will tell how well it wears, of course, though a first look suggests that it should be sufficiently durable.  Since I just wanted to protect the Fire and was not seeking to make a fashion statement, I am extremely pleased.  The fact that I actually got a fashionable item is a bonus.
0060936223|5.0|I was never a Patti Smith fan, and, in fact, I've never heard her sing anything but \\"Because the Night.\\" Still, this memoir of her youth with her companion, the photographer Robert Mapplethorp, is a fascinating document of how both grew up together in the Manhattan of the late 60s and early 70s. Written in a prose-poetic style, it is spare, but precise, in its observations, including many small, but telling, details of their lives as penniless young would-be artists, struggling to pay rent and buy art materials. I am now inspired to learn more about both of these exotic creatures. Well worth your time.
B00008AWNY|4.0|Side two sounds pretty good but side 1 is bad. They must have pressed this from one really old mother. Great Gig in the Sky sounds terrible. Probably spent their money on the reissued posters and inserts and not on the vinyl. I will have to resort to my CD when I wan't to listen to this great album.<br /><br />2/13/12 Update. The vinyl is getting better over time. The level of static electricity is starting to diminish which makes it easier to get all of the dust out of the grooves. Great Gig still sounds the worst of all the tracks however.<br /><br />5/8/14 The static is totally gone now, but there are still too many pops and clicks on this pressing. I'm using The Beatles re-release vinyl albums as a benchmark for this. If you're going to re-release a classic album on vinyl, you have to go all the way. The vinyl should be as clean as possible. The mix should be as high of a resolution as possible.<br />This release fails on the clean pressing part of the equation. The mix sounds great when the volume of the sound is loud, but the surface noise of the vinyl is totally unacceptable. Especially on Great Gig in the Sky!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've used many free calendar tools on Android (including Google's own) and was not satisfied with any of them on my 7&quot; tablet (B&amp;N Nook Color). Eventually, i found this one and haven't looked back.

B004UC4HCG|5.0|The SH67H3 was purchased as a replacement for my Shuttle SD37P2 V2, which died recently. Installed are an [[ASIN:B005L9E7J0 Intel Core i3-2130 2x 3.40GHz 3.4 2 LGA 1155 Processor (BX80623I32130)]] , 4 x [[ASIN:B002K23V1Q Kingston ValueRAM 4GB 1333MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL9 DIMM Desktop Memory]] (KVR1333D3N9/4G), and 3 x  [[ASIN:B0042SGDVG Samsung Spinpoint F4EG 2 TB SATA2 5400rpm 32 MB Hard Drive HD204UI/Z4]]. I also have an Intel PRO 1000 PCI Express NIC installed.  The SH67H3 is well made and on par with the quality of the SD37P2 V2. It is extremely quiet when running. I like the brushed metal and uncluttered look of the front of the PC. Other pluses are the recessed front power button (which prevents accidental pushes), along with adjustable brightness of the blue power LED.  Note that the Mini PCI connector on the motherboard is *NOT* mSATA compatible, and is intended for Wi-Fi adapters, etc., not SSDs. In order to install a 3.5\\" hard drive into the 5.25\\" bay I used a [[ASIN:B0001UZQWG StarTech.com 3.5-Inch Universal Hard Drive Mounting Bracket Adapter for 5.25-Inch Bay BRACKET]]. There is space enough behind the 5.25\\" bay for a 2.5\\" SATA SSD, so I may add a SATA 6Gbits/s SSD at some point in future.   Unlike the SD37P2 V2, the SH67H3 does not have space for three 3.5\\" hard drives plus a 5.25\\" optical drive. In order to install Linux I also ordered an external  [[ASIN:B005FUKLHM Sony Optiarc USB 2.0 Slim Portable DVD Writer, DRX-S90U]], which sits on top of the PC case. The drive needs two USB connectors and would only work for booting the Linux install CD when plugged into two USB 2.0 ports, and would not work on USB 3.0 ports. (The front of the PC has two USB 3.0 ports and a USB 2.0/eSATA combo port, so the drive has to be plugged into the back).  Check the Shuttle Website for BIOS updates. My SH67H3 needed flashing - no big deal.  I'm running Debian 6.0 on the SH67H3 and it makes an excellent Linux server box. Highly recommended.
B005XI9456|5.0|I am pleased with this album.  This has collaborations with some great musicians.  I really thought it had a great deal of organizing before making.  It has sounds that everyone would like.  The kid has a lot of potential.  The reviews of haters I do not believe are true purchasers of the album and just do not like the artist in general or are jealous of him.  I am 32 and like the kids music.  Every artist is different and all have an artistic ability to be respected.  He is talented and there is not a denial to that and other artist like to work with him.  He works with Boyz II Men, Mariah Carey, and of course one of my favorites the Band Perry in this album. I give hime a five star on this Christmas album.  Its upbeat, its slow, and its got a little old time style to it as well. A winner in my book.
1452651930|3.0|So, the audio version was well done - good narrator and quality.   I have an issue with the cover. Sienna is a red head with \\"cardinal\\" eyes (black with pinpoints of light). Hawke has silver/gold hair and is significantly older than 19 year old Sienna.   The models they chose for the cover are.. not Not NOT Sienna and Hawke.   That said, I'm always a little disappointed when authors write two stories into one. I wanted Walker's story and Hawke's stories to be told. Each of these men deserved their own stories. If Walker wasn't the compelling hero Judd and Hawke are, his story could have been told in one of the novellas Singh is fairly good at writing.   Now. The X designation. Ugh. Similiar to the resolution for the E designation, it all seemed a little too \\"simple\\". Without giving away too many spoilers, each character had to just let go.. Wait. That's it? At least with Judd, there was a real story for him to break Silence.   Then there's the logic gap in Silence. The Psy are supposed to be this Vulcan-like (but without the cute ears) race. Slender. Logical. I get that. They do some kind of master mind tricky stuff when the kids are little and BAM! no emotions. Some people died? No big. Changlings describe Psy as having a cold, metallic scent.   I like the idea of a Psy mind, linking and providing feedback to each member. I like the idea of having a kind of world wide web of minds with the potential for \\"hackers\\" and the challenge of keeping your private life - private. That all allows for some good science fiction stories.   But denying all emotions, all touch, all empathy - is illogical unless it serves a purpose. And Singh seems to ignore the fact that Silence had to have been logical, otherwise it never would have been implemented. Faith's story is the only one which shows the \\"positive\\" side of Silence. Maybe Judd's story, to a small degree, since he keeps part of the Protocol.   Silence is a drastic step taken by a panicked people. Rather like cutting the feet off of prisoners to stop them from escaping. There are 100 other ways to get to point X. Why do the Psy take the most drastic step available?   The Psy have their motives and logic shouldn't equal evil and yet, in the Psy-Changling World, it always seems to do just that.
078322737X|4.0|I wasn't around during the 60s or 70s but I can definitely appreciate the music and cultural aspects of this time. The characters could have been built up just a little more but what made the film enjoyable (for me) was the music and the cruising scenes. There's no huge plot here but its a good movie to watch while eating popcorn and with friends who wish they were around in this timeframe.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I have been a fan of White Srtipes for quite a while and just got this CD, and it´s Led Zeppelin III all over again in the XXI century. Just a fantastic set of songs by a talented and soulful bunch of rockers 2 say the least. My favorite rocker of the moment.
1451648537|3.0|This biography is a plodding narrative of the history of Steve Jobs/Apple that totally misses the passion, insight and genius that drove Jobs' amazing success and vision. I found the first part of the book, which contains stories about the early days of Apple and some of Steve's more colorful quirks pretty engaging, but I think that's because I'm an old Machead and fascinated by the subject.   Even though Isaacson had access to Steve and over 40 meetings with him, it reads as if it were compiled entirely from interviews with others. Isaacson  doesn't go beyond the surface or offer any insight into Steve's behavior. For instance, he quotes Steve saying LSD changed his life but does not include anything about his experience on LSD, what realizations came of it, what specifically changed in Steve's experience, etc. Ditto Steve's trip to India in his 20s, his reliance on intuition, and the infamous tongue-lashings and more.   We also don't hear much about Steve the man, how he was with friends and family. What the heck went on during those 40 interviews?   As I mentioned, I'm a old Mac fanatic. I wept when I heard that Steve died. He created works of art that are our computers, phones, iPads - the tools that are a large part of every day. The impact is huge - not just in 'usability' but in the beauty, intelligence and simplicity that the elegance of  Apple design brings into daily experience. With Steve at the helm at Apple, I could be sure that quality and sensibility would be built in to anything I bought there. I would have loved to know more about what went on inside his head. It's a shame that Isaacson didn't deliver.

B005M4K94G|2.0|I am a huge fan of Mobile Fidelity editions in both, gold cds and sacds. Unfortunately Caravanserai is not the best release from Mofi. Sound, image and instrument definition were so poor that I thought there was a problem with my stereo, so I played a couple of other sacds titles to check my gear (B&W, Macintosh) and fortunately they sounded as good as always. I wish I could return this sacd back to Amazon...!
B004X2M3SI|5.0|With season 6, the revived Doctor Who hits new heights. Some of these episodes - such as The Girl Who Waited, The God Complex and Let's Kill Hitler - are among the best in the show's 48 year history.  The opening two-parter is set in America and is complex without being overly-complicated. The finale, too, as the Doctor tries to cheat death, is brilliantly directed. In fact, that's one of the things I noticed most about this latest series: it seems like the directors are becoming much more adventurous.  Even the dodgy episodes are at least watchable. I'm thinking here of The Curse of the Black Spot, which really doesn't have much going for it, and Closing Time, which would be a nice episode were it not for the fact that it totally mis-uses the Cybermen.  Best of all, this season brings back some of the genuine emotion that I personally felt was sometimes lacking last year. Bring on season 7!

0307887898|2.0|I picked up this book as an entrepreneur with 2 Lean Start Ups of my own. The book title and its introduction spoke to my aspirations while the content did nothing for my situation. The author Eric Ries comes from the fast moving corporate world of technology upgrades and dot com bubbles where a business can fizzle in an instant or expand with viral ferocity. The Lean Start up concept is so common sense that the general public has had an awareness of it for the past hundred years but what Eric does is apply a language to managing those early waters. While I applaud his efforts and personal successes, he wasn't really speaking to the guy in his garage trying to make a better widget. His book comes off as more of a 273 page advertisement for huge corporations who want continue to innovate without risking their bottom line. I have no doubt that he has created a useful managerial engine for transforming a company who has gotten stuck in the mud but flowery language doesn't help the guy who just started a website, has a decent audience but can't figure out how to bring in capital.<br /><br />This is book was written by person who long ago passed the start up phase and his teachings are for others who have also done the same. I think the title and introduction was a marketing attempt to capture a larger audience than the content can provide for.
B003QSJDZQ|4.0|Special features aside, this is worth the main feature alone. I never saw it in the theatre, but I saw it at a holiday program when I was seven, and I've loved it ever since. Kuzco (David Spade) is one of the most unconventional Disney heroes ever, being a spoilt brat of eighteen. The villain, Yzma (Eartha Kitt), is also a riot, though her sidekick Kronk (Patrick Warburton) steals the show with his childlike nature and the fact that he is clearly good, even though he's working for the villain. Disney could've put songs in, which is the only trademark thing they left out, but this film doesn't need it. The musical score is still very good. Then there are great one-liners, and jokes, such as Kronk's shoulder angel and shoulder devil, especially Yzma's reaction (pointing to Kronk and looking at Pacha and Kuzco, they shrug). Kuzco's character growth is admirable, too. He stays a bit spoilt and is reluctant to be a nice guy, but underneath he is actually a good person. The animation, too, is good. But this is worth the humour alone. So buy it now.
B005V20JKI|5.0|Works fine on the HTC EVO 4G. People giving the app 1 star for permissions seem to be saying its a bad game based on the cover. If you aren't a paranoid nut, I highly recomend this game. Its a quick and easy game where you jump around, shoot enemies, and collect muffins. A good game for a quick 5 minute time killer, or an hour. The game is simple enough that it can be addicting and keep you olaying just to get that next unlock or that high score.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I don't get it, all the LG optimus bad reviews, I used to have that phone and it barely ran anything. those people need to stop complaining, and giving bad reviews because they have a crappy phone. go invest in a decent phone and it will work.   this game has awesome graphics and it runs fine on my sensation and on the xoom. a ton of fun

B00689J512|5.0|I just got this album yesterday and im am beyond in love.... Its rare that i find a album i can listen to the entire way through... Some people have their opinion about different artist turning to dance music... But i say its about time they changed it up a bit.... Everybody wants to stand on the wall and chill... or look like robots while every one does the same dance! This album makes you wanna move, and just enjoy the music for once.. I think this one and \\"Loud\\" are the best to date! Big ups to RiRi! Lovin this album keep makin that \\"Move it\\" music!
B004EPZ08E|5.0|With this many stars in a movie..you know it is going to be good. Fast paced, funny, and over the top from beginning to end. I love Jason Bateman because he is so cute, but performers like Aniston and Colin Farell shine as well. Each man has a funny issue with his boss, and they get into hilarious hijinks to try to kill them. Jamie Foxx is a treat as a \\"hitman,\\" that they meet in a bar. If you like funny movies like Hangover and Change Up, you will LOVE THIS MOVIE. A+++++++
B002BU0DPE|5.0|One of my coworkers at GameStop has a pair of these and told me about them, so I thought I would get a pair for myself and give it a try.  I got my set in the mail yesterday and hooked them up as soon as I got home from school to try it out with Assassin's Creed Revelations, and I was STUNNED by how incredible the sound quality is.  I'm hearing things in games that I could NEVER hear before, and it's amazing.  For anyone who either just wants a headset to play games without disturbing anyone else in the house, or to those who are really into multiplayer and need a good headset/mic, I highly recommend the PX21s.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|I really don't get the negative reviews about this movie! It was so funny from start to finish. I think Jason Bateman is so cute--I love watching him be the sarcastic straight man, and this movie offers him a chance to play a new kind of role. The comparison with the Hangover is pretty accurate, this is a bromance movie with NONSTOP laugh out loud moments and diologue. The first three minutes of the film had a gross out scene that almost made me puke, but the rest of the movie was comedy at its finest. I think everyone should give this a chance, especially if you hate work, obligations, like sarcasm, and extreme funny moments. A+++++++++++
0375831002|5.0|I picked up this book at a book fair several months ago, at a loss for anything else to buy.  Traveling for the holidays, I threw it in my bag and figured it would be a decent way to pass the time.  I didn't immediately realize this book was a \\"teen book,\\" but I'm a sucker for well written YA, and by the time I realized it, I was already well and truly sucked into the story and the gorgeous language.   I'm not a fan of historical works; I'm not a history buff in the least, and am often bored by \\"war stories,\\" even those I know and can feel have great import.  This book was an amazingly worded, beautiful picture of a decidedly ugly situation.    To frame the book in Death's point of view was an interesting touch-- and the one that made this book mean the most to me.  Even if you find the subject matter \\"trite and cliched\\" (as I've seen some reviewers say in other reviews), you cannot find the common experience of death to be overdone.  We know so little, and feel so much about it.  To see a personality-- to see something not to be feared, but something that has as much reverence for lives as the living often have for death-- was truly fantastic.   A great read for anyone, young adult all the way up to old adult.  I was wiping tears away on the plane in several spots.

B005JU5JTI|3.0|Not the worst nor the best movie. It was ok. Depends on what u r wanting to watch. It had some funny moments. I wouldn't buy it but renting is a good option.
B001HN694K|5.0|Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! My absolute favorite movie of all time! Alice in Wonderland is the best movie in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001DDBCUU|3.0|The movie itself is fine as it's just the TV series writ large. There's enough of the usual cast of characters but the 2+ hr. length does mean it drags especially after the 1st hour. Definitely a lot better than expected as often TV series jumping to the big screen have trouble making that jump.<br /><br />The problem is the DVD extras are sadly lacking. All we get is a director's commentary. You'd think with the fashions-a-go-go and the whole \\"will/won't they do a movie\\" controversy that there could have been more extras on here.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|One of the best cd's ive bought in a long time. Every song is great and worth the buy!! ENJOY
B005R4255C|5.0|I'm sure all those who love Michael Jackson enjoyed the \\"magic\\" he presented in his videos, concerts and his own persona. This CD really brings that back to life again. I'm sure MJ would approve and love those added sounds, they do improve the already amazing songs. I got the CD today and I just cannot believe how great it is. The sound, the packaging. The Cirque Du Soleil really honored the artist with this collection. I love the fact they included some gems like Speechless, Childhood, You are not alone, etc. The wanna be startin' something version is UNBELIEVABLE.  I haven't seen the show (but I will next month :0). The reviews are fantastic. With this soundtrack, that show will probably be one not to be missed.  To whoever put this compilation together: thank you for the magic.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Wow. This was ET/Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind/Cloverfield/The Goonies all rolled into one with some Stand by Me thrown in as well - and it was a roller coaster ride of fun, excitement, drama, family, friendship, love, redemption and forgiveness.<br /><br />The humor was excellent, especially between the kids. The humor was spot on, even during the more tense<br />scenes and how the kids pulled together, helped each other out, even when they had their differences. This reminded me so much of how I was with my friends when I was their age.<br /><br />Abrams' script and pacing with this film has made this a movie to enjoy over and over again. For an Abrams film,<br />it's quite different from how Star Trek (another excellent film) was, but that should not deter you from watching<br />this movie. Even the drug use by one of the characters is put to good use in a humorous way on how the use<br />of drugs can be dangerous. It made me laugh but it was a message to kids: DON'T USE DRUGS!<br /><br />This was how Spielburg used to make his movies and JJ Abrams hit the nail on the head with this one. As<br />others have said, don't wait to see this movie. It is a must see! I can't wait to watch this movie again. It's that much fun!<br /><br />Oh, and sit through the end credits to watch the zombie movie with a tip of the hat to George Romero. Watch<br />especially as the kids \\"act\\" their way through the movie - it's just like kids would act. I remember when I was<br />their age doing a movie my friend was directing. It fits and it looks exactly like how kids would do it, even with<br />the cheesy visual and sound effects. Hilarious and so realistic!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I long awaited this movie's release, but took awhile to open it.  When I finally unwrapped and played it, I found that the Blu-Ray disc skipped upon playback.  I missed the entire Godric's Hollow scene.
1451648537|4.0|Walter made a mistake in page 65. It says that Ron Wayne 10% shares had a value in 2010 of 2.6 billion. Big mistake. It should have been 26 billion. You can still correct this for the kindle version.

B00002MZ4V|5.0|Every track on this CD will take you back to the movie experience.  John Williams melodies are so destinctive and emotional that you cannot help but re-live the scenes when you hear them.  The recording quality is excellent.  You get the fan favorites (Superman, Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark themes) along with some of his lesser know work (Sugarland Express, The REivers) and of course the non-film work (several olympic themes).

B005OLF6BI|4.0|I took my daughters to see Taylor Swift over the summer and was amazed at the show.  This video does a good job replicating the show which is what is intended to do.  For 16.99 you cannot beat that price on any DVD/CD combo for any artist.  Good for any Taylor Swift fan!

B0013D8LKO|5.0|When Stanley Kubrick's thirteenth and final film was released in 1999 it was hailed by many critics but more so trampled over by those with an interest in Kubrick's work.  Many lashed out against the film and to this day laugh it off often considering the work boring, pointless, and difficult to understand.  Eyes Wide Shut was labeled a weak note to an end of a strong symphony.  Eyes Wide Shut was Kubrick's first film is over a decade, and it stands tall as one of the greatest films of the '90s.  So perhaps the mega-anticipation of a new Kubrick film for many critics and fans alike made it impossible to satisfy once Eyes Wide Shut was finally released.  On a most interesting note.....Kubrick had originally considered bringing the story to the big screen after he had read Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Traumnovelle (aka Dream Story) back in 1967 during the final days of production on his landmark epic of science fiction 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).  At it's core, Eyes Wide Shut is simply about the human condition.  As with all of Kubrick's work, the filmmakers intention is to give his audience something emotional.  A work of thought provoking transcendent cinematic art that those who experience it walk away from and continue to feel viscerally for days (if not months) to follow.  Eyes Wide Shut at it's core is about a human relationship and the devastating impact that honesty  has on one's own ego.  Cruise's character's gets lost in his own mental anguish, and sets out (which is a common theme in many of Kubrick's films) on a dream-like journey, similar to that traveled in Homer's Odyssey.  Any character setting off in such a way must travel from one point to another achieving change on all possible internal levels.  Cruise's character prevails stronger than he was at the start, and in true Odyssian form,  he returns full circle to the same place in which he originally set out from.  The brilliance of Eyes Wide Shut comes with Kubrick's ability to create a ultra realism inside Eyes Wide Shut by casting then real-life husband and wife, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.  Cruise and Kidman are simply wonderful in Eyes Wide Shut and provide an audience with a scary reality, that blurs a subconscious line between fact and fiction.  It is difficult for anyone in a committed relationship to comprehend our significant others true sexual desires due to the severe damage that such truth would give our own over indulgent egos.  As we're treated to Kidman's character's sexual desires, we spend an additional 120 minutes living out the dream-like desires of Cruise's character, eventually witnessing Cruise's character completing that Odyssian circle, returning home, broken and realized, finally  have eliminated his own ego.  Eyes Wide Shut is every bit a revolutionary film.  Kubrick is able to explore daring ideas for the screen while having the keen insight to extract truths from within the human condition that lurk deep, and this type of cinematic idealism had never been seen in theaters before.   Eyes Wide Shut is (as all of Kubrick's films on initial release) misunderstood, and within the next ten years it will be re-discovered and considered one of, if not the best film of the 1990s.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|The graphics are gorgeous - I love the clock, that I can see the next 12 hours of weather.  Plus it has all kinds of geek information, which I like too!

B000RH0C8G|5.0|I saw the movie first because in my opinion it had been a really long time since we have had a really good sports movie. The movie deserves a five star and the same as the book. Simply a masterpiece.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This is one of my favorite games on Android. it's challenging, and listening to the voice that announces whenever you switch characters never gets old. Plus, the music is fun, and the game is gorgeous to look at. All in all, this is one of the few games that's actually worth the asking price. It being the free app of the day makes it that much better.
B005OLF6BI|2.0|Taylor has sold millions to tween fans around the world but this live cd is really a sham since Taylor is known to both lip-sync and sing behind a track to cover her performance shortcomings.  Why can't so many people see the truth, see the fake guitar playing, the Les Paul prop, the manufactured smile?  Someday the industry will look back and laugh at what they gave Taylor, so many awards stolen from other artist?  Oh well, I congratulate her marketing skills and merchandising skills - good luck.  These songs are fine pop tunes, but nothing more.  These words do not \\"count\\" since they are basically about boys, kissing, and high school bleachers...not too deep to be considered an artist.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|I may be biased towards them, but I don't care if you're a fan or not, at least give this CD a listen.  I'm in my twenties and I appreciate all of their music just as much as the next twelve-year-old does.  Their first album was very catchy, but the group has \\"Elevated\\" a step up with this one.  You can tell that they put more work and emotion into this, and what makes it better is that they wrote/helped write 2/3 of this album!  I think a couple of these songs have that \\"old-school\\" sound that you don't hear too often nowadays.  Also, there are some wonderful ballads and a few songs that make it impossible not to dance along with.  Some of these songs will make you cry, smile, laugh, dance.... or you can flippin' do all four of these simultaneously!!  They each have a unique voice and I could tell who wrote what song just by listening to it.  One of the best things about this album is that it's positive and good for a younger audience, something hard to come across by in the industry today.  Many of these songs show that no one should feel inferior or invisible, and we all radiate in our own way.  Now I do not know any of them personally, but from what I've seen, they are four hard-working people who also happen to be  legit role-models.   These guys have got a crapload of talent, so please do not judge or critique them without listening to this, that is pure foolishness.    Give it a shot, it's a win-win situation.  Do yourself a favor and ELEVATE!!!!  =D
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I got really nervous reading the first negative reviews, but I actually really like this case and it meets my needs. I like it even better after the $10 drop in price. (I got an email telling me about the price drop and letting me know that there would be a $10 credit to my Amazon account).  The Kindle Fire snaps cleanly into the case and will not come out if you hold the case upside down.Yes,I did try this! First I tried it over the bed. Now I will even demonstrate it over a tiled floor because I have so much confidence in the snap system.   The elastic seems solidly attached to the case.  The snapping system and the attached elastic are the features that I was looking for in a case because I wanted to use the Kindle Fire on the treadmill to relieve the boredom. The Kindle Fire rests on the treadmill shelf and I bought some Velcro straps to thread through the elastic strap to make sure that the Kindle Fire didn't run off.  The stand (for horizontal viewing only) works well. Some of the early negative reviews came from people who had the case but not the actual Kindle Fire. As another reviewer wrote, you need to have the Kindle Fire in the case to give the case the form and weight to make the stand work.  It is very light. This is a good thing. I let a friend who has a previous Kindle incarnation play with my Kindle Fire, and she was surprised at how heavy the Kindle Fire was. Thank goodness this case doesn't add much to the weight. I believe that it is the lightest on the market. Since the case fits the Kindle Fire so snugly, it also doesn't add much bulk.  The case seems very well made and solid, especially when you see how beautifully it works with the Kindle Fire actually in it. The lesson is: do not judge this case until you have snapped the Kindle Fire into it.  I keep a microfiber cloth between the screen cover and the Kindle Fire. The is useful because the screen protector that I installed is a finger-print magnet.  At the new, lower price this case is an excellent choice if it has the features that you are looking for.
B005KAJPY2|5.0|I've loved VNV for years. With that said, this album is my favorite so far. Just saw them live in Portland (Oregon) last night, it was an amazing show. If you've ever liked VNV in the past, open your heart & your mind to them now. They will take you on an awesome ride with this album, if you let them. :)
0763644765|5.0|I just borrowed this book from the library and I have to own it. My daughter is 3 and since I have been reading this book to her and she can read it to herself. She has improved pretty quickly. I bought her the book A Potty For Me but unfortunately my daughter seems to want to gravitate to the \\"I don't think I can yet\\" so I have stopped reading it to her. This book gets to the point and my daughter wants to hear it and read it over and over. I am currently expecting now 18 weeks...I know that this will be perfect for the new baby when its time for this baby to start potty training.
0316098329|3.0|I listened to Room as a book on CD while on a recent road trip. Perhaps listening instead of reading made hearing the story told from a child less annoying but I agree with what others have said: a great deal of inconsistency in five-year-old Jack's linguistic abilities. It was never clear to me why Ma's teeth were in such bad shape. I kept wondering if she'd been a meth addict or beaten repeatedly.<br /><br />The premise of the book was intriguing, a story of survival. There were so many aspects of the novel that I enjoyed but I longed for someone to go through it and clean up the inconsistencies.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed Room and learned a lot about writing from reading/listening to it. I'm still wondering how an editor doesn't catch and correct the problems that so many readers have pointed out here. I'd love someone in the publishing industry to explain that.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|wrote Nights in Rodanthe review and thought of this one....I hated it the first time I saw it....it didn't feel right or true....and then it happened to become one of thos e movies I enjoy watching once in a while....not sure what made it grow....French music? the beach? the house? the silliness? or maybe it was wicked Nicholson? or maybe stunning Amanda Peet? but I love this movie!
B005N95JA4|5.0|I love how the Stones are putting out these deluxe editions....if not just for the extra tracks. I am listening to the album now on \\"Spotify\\"-I will buy it physically at a later date but I wanted to hear the extra tracks,since I already have this album. I have listened to \\"We Had it All\\" on youtube for a year and I am so glad it is included at least in this deluxe album. I love Keith's simple voice on every track I hear him sing front on and this one is just lovely and I don't have to hear Willie Nelson on it. Makes me real happy.(p.s. I wish Amazon would not lump all reviews together on one project it is very aggravating...if you have three versions of an album let them have separate reviewing area.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|I mean it was ok. Entertaining for as long as it lasted. Wouldn't watch it again. I hope it's not true :)

B001NEK2GE|5.0|UPDATE: If this has really been discontinued - DON'T WAIT, order one TODAY! If I have money left over after Christmas I'll get a second one for a back up.<br /><br />As I gather more and more flight gear (yoke, throttles, instrument panels, etc.) I still find a need for a keyboard.<br /><br />But a regular, or modified, keyboard takes so much attention away from operating even a simple airplane.<br /><br />I've passed over the G13 for quite some time because it was for \\"shoot 'em up\\" games. That was a big mistake!<br /><br />This is cheaper, and more useful, than anything short of a cockpit panel.<br /><br />Basically you can assign any of the keys on the G13 to any key used by FSX (or any other flight sim that takes keyboard input). That's so great, ho hum. But the real benefits come when you start using the software to assign key combinations or macros (so far no real programming required that I can see). BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!! For $19.95 you also get a pretty good potato peeler - OOOPS, wrong product.<br /><br />There is even greater power with the use of HIDMacros (a free program), that lets you assign commands not available to simple keystrokes. FSUIPC (payware) works with the G13 and can do the same thing, but costs money (duh). The software that comes with it looks to be quite useful, so most may only need that. All together you'll have a great deal of control over any aircraft you choose to fly.<br /><br />Some comments:<br />1 - The \\"joy stick on the right side is VERY VERY easy to use. I saw a YouTube video where some idiot was showing how difficult and awkward it was to use. Idiot. On the other hand, it can be used as a button by pressing straight down on it. I can see how you might inadvertently move it around as you press down. Just pretend that it isn't a button.<br /><br />2 - There are no pre-sets for FSX, X Plane, etc. You'll just have to figure out how to set it up yourself.<br /><br />3 - The \\"Quick-start\\" guide is imbecilic! It shows you that you put the CD in the front of a computer, and plug the end of the cable into a spot marked USB on the back of the computer. Speaking of imbecilic, check out the \\"playseats\\" (on the internet) shown in a brochure that comes with the G13. Pitiful.<br /><br />4 - To download a \\"real\\" manual you need to register for junk that you probably don't want. Just click on the chevron that appears over the question mark (when you mouse over it) on the main screen.

1451627289|2.0|Thougn I have long thought I might read one book by King, I have not till I read this novel just published this month.  Most fantasy bores me but I have enjoyed some books such as Replay by Ken Grimwood (read 10 Mar 2004).  This book involves a return to the the late 1950's and the returner seeks to prevent the assassination of JFK.  One can't help but get caught up in the wild events depicted, and can't help but want to see how the events are handled.  But on balance the time spent reading this 869-page book cannot be said to have been well spent.  The prose is decidedly pedestrain and non-scintillating.  But King's view as to the liklehood taht Oswald acted along is surely right--see not only Case Closed by Gerald Posner but Vincent Bugliosi's Recaliming History.  I do not intend to read anything else by King, but do not mind having read this--just so I can know what a book of his is like.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|I originally posted this review on my blog at[...]      Never for ever* content with shallow pop sensibilities, Kate Bush largely eschewed the 3 minute single in favor of more complex mood pieces and album-length concepts. At her weakest, she remained ambitious and talented enough to remain a worthy listen. At her strongest, she created layered masterpieces that represent the best of eccentric art-rock. 50 Words For Snow features Kate at her strongest, and the wintry, piano-driven tracks act as lovely mood pieces involving the sort of careful production techniques that made her a critical darling beginning in the late 70's. Though not as directly accessible (though no Bush album is wholly accessible) as works like The Dreaming or Hounds of Love, 50 Words manages to engage the listener thanks to intimate settings and Kate's voice, huskier than before but still girlish enough to remain familiar to even her oldest fans. Outside of some lyrical conceptions, it doesn't take wild risks nor does it attempt to genuinely hook you. But I found myself wholly enveloped by Kate's sensual voice and piano work as she continues to stretch herself further to the edges of pop possibilities while retaining a careful intimacy that grips the listener and takes us into the winter with her.    *Yes, I'm leading off with a Kate Bush pun. Quit Cloudbusting my chops.      The album's leadoff track, \\"Snowflake,\\" features choral work from Bush's son Bertie and also represents the LP's peak. With a repeating 8 note piano riff and some soaring vocals, \\"Snowflake\\" is a haunting work eradicating any possibility that 50 Words is a plaintive Christmas album for the Starbucks shelves. Bush manages to create a heavy sound without overwhelming us with synths. Every piano note stands out, the vocals are layered flawlessly, and a kind of quiet menace pervades as light strings break into the ivory landscape. \\"Lake Tahoe\\" leads with strings and piano and unfolds in a similar manner as \\"Snowflake,\\" the singer sounding lost in a blizzard and calling out in fragile, strained tones. Naturally, Bush's voice remains so strong that even when she intentionally strains, she elicits a considerable potency matched by the occasional violin freeing itself from the orchestral wall and driving right into our consciousness.    \\"Misty\\" spools through its 13 minute length with a jazzier touch, allowing for Bush's throatier vocals to work attractively alongside shuffling drums. She created jazzy essences before on \\"Saxophone Song\\" from her debut way back in 1978, but \\"Misty,\\" like the whole album, contains icier vibrations and the piano replaces the sax at the song's head. \\"Wild Man,\\" the album's single, lyrically focuses on the Yeti with Bush's vocals coming through in a breathy manner. It's the most synth-driven song on the album and probably comes the closest in sound to Bush's early 80's heyday. The chorus, more frenzied, fiercely complements the verses' wistful if uptempo disposition and allows for the best use of background synths that enter like flares in the blinding white morning. The following track, \\"Snowed In At Wheeler Street,\\" contains the album's most enticing surprise: Elton John guests as a lover, duetting with Bush. The Rocket Man hasn't sounded this captivating since Blue Moves and his voice, rich and throaty, proves that aging doesn't necessarily mean an end to vocal affection. When both trade yells of \\"I don't want to lose you!\\" we get the rare pleasure of hearing two art-rock legends running parallel on a single song and neither wastes the opportunity.      The title track marks Bush at her most lyrically experimental, enlisting British actor/comedian Stephen Fry to deadpan, literally, 50 words for snow as Kate pushes him on, counting. The swirling, windy tones, largely atmospheric, provide a neat backdrop and the track's peaks come as Bush wails \\"C'mon man you got ___ words to go!\\" The album generally leaves the listener outside with the hollering gusts and endless stretches of white powder, keeping 50 Words away from the complacent adult contemporary compromises too typical of aging music legends. Bush pushes the envelope, and songs like the title track ensconce us with so many textures that repeated listens reveal more and more. What I missed or ignored on a first go-around I picked up during the second, like Bush's final, \\"50 words for snow\\" call out to conclude the title track, a neat exclamation point that adds another bit of acreage to an already vast musical expanse. The album's concluding track, \\"Among Angels,\\" clocks in at 6 minutes, shorter than all the others. It returns to the more modest piano stylings of \\"Snowflake\\" and Bush allows her pitch-changing vocals to meander almost lovingly across the rangy piano work. Contrary to her earlier albums, 50 Words does not necessarily work best as a headphone symphony. It's content to exist just as well in the background with slight variations in disposition. Though Never For Ever, The Dreaming, and Hounds of Love mark a triumphirate of art-rock genius that 50 Words cannot match, her latest album affirms that genius can retain enticing charms even as it ages. Bush may not produce albums with any regularity, but her careful personal touch on 50 Words makes the waiting worthwhile. And until her next LP, Kate fans can own another impressive hour of eccentric but always enriching soundscapes that assure Bush's place at the top of popular music's solo acts.

This one seems to be very popular so I watched it. Wow. Certainly no disappointment here. Portman is amazing! Movie is so creepy and so awesome! One of the best movies lately that I've seen. Very recommended.  And make sure to watch the closing titles cause the way it's done is pretty sweet with feathers changing colors.....very creepy and beautiful.

0984380213|5.0|I'm extremely impressed- I really enjoyed the concise writing style of this book. It reads more like an exact how-to manual than theory and principal which I totally enjoy. I've underlined and noted more stuff in this book than I have in any other business books I've read. I may be a little biased as my company leverages Salesforce.com internally as well as for our clients so I was able to really connect with the thought process in the book (and saw salesforce.com grow and innovate from the outside during the years Aaron was inside). Initially I was thinking, 'okay- this book is going to be a little too basic', however as I read on, it gathered momentum and outlined with the least number of words concise practices I'm now in the midst of implementing.  There are very few books I've read which make me want to take immediate action like this one did.  I'd recommend this book to small/mid-sized business owners who have grown naturally from referrals and word of mouth who are looking towards being able to further automate themselves out of the company and free up more of their time for bigger thinking. A naturally grown business tends to have a smaller sales engine- and in some cases barely one, but a heavy dependency on the owner/operator for the referral modality to function. This book outlines a proven practice to transform and automate that.

B005DOKIYG|2.0|The biggest problem was the stitching on the one I received - in three separate places the stitching did not go all the way to the edge.  Also, the fabric was very coarse, as you can see from the close up of the photos provided.    The zipper only goes on two sides and the fit of the Fire in the sleeve is snug.  Even so, it is relatively easy to insert and remove the Fire.   As others have stated, there is a bad smell - not so terrible for me since I have a poor sense of smell!  :-)  I have returned the one I ordered and am going to try one (ordered directly) from Case Logic, which has an external pocket for the charger.   I expect to receive a refund for this one because it was defective with poor stitching.

B004W2UBYW|3.0|First part of the book is all upbeat and exciting, but the end of the book gets very depressing as you see what Steve had to go through in the final stages of his cancer. I learned a lot from this book, and found the retelling of the history of the dawn of the personal computer fascinating as a tech nerd and a history fan. That being said...<br /><br />After thinking about this book more, and discussing with some of the others, one thing that stuck out is that most of the people find the final 1/4 of the book rather brief, and not nearly as in-depth as the start of the book. Well, John Siracusa of Ars Technica pointed out in a podcast that the initial part of the book is just a regurgitation of other Apple books like Revolution in the Valley (the book that Pirates of Silicon Valley was based on), and as the writer (Isaacson) is not a technology guru he had little interest in the topics themselves, and didn't do the greatest job on doing research on more modern and important inventions of Apple like the iPhone/iPad.<br /><br />In the book we learn very little about monumental events like the launch of the iPhone and iPad, but we learn a lot about the launch of the Macintosh, which was launched 27 years ago. So why is it that he had such in-depth analysis of events that happened 27 years ago, but so little analysis of what happened 4 years ago? Easy, he was able to provide great analysis of the Macintosh because others already wrote that book, and nobody has written any great books about the iPhone/iPad.<br /><br />Isaacson got lazy, and rather than doing any research and interviews himself, he relied on the telling of the Steve Jobs story by others. Which is unfortunate, he was the only person to ever have unfiltered access to Steve Jobs, his family, his friends, and didn't capitalize on this incredible privilege.\\"

B005SV9X22|3.0|Ok.. to try to give this a fair review... we need to go back and look at the work of one Louise Ciccione born this way if you will in Bay City Michigan in 1958  if you have never heard of her you seriously need to look her up-in short all of this so music, dance moves, costume and hair trends, concert production, sex, controversial videos ,books and shock value -hell you name it- this has been covered originally at least 30 YEARS ago. So the question is weather or not the above artist being Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta is a legit artist/performer , tribute act, or plain copy cat riding off of other peoples success, genius and originality. If i really need to give evidence of what I am talking about I will name a few instances; for example: In Book form: Sex, In Live Performance on Award Show: MTV 1984 - Like a Virgin, Controversial Videos (just 2 named here) Justify My Love, Like a Prayer. Concert(s) (name em but I will just list 2 of the real thin here- no paws raised, so super fans just a Blond with an ambition to have a real FU attitude) The Blond Ambition Tour and The Girlie Show. Now the Media Appearances,Media shows (yep and some topless appearances at that) and everything else should be well known by now-forget about the media attention, rumors, scandals, controversies ect ect- they are legend now- been there and shes done it all-...Now If you have seen any of Madonna Louise Ciccones Concerts and then you the Monster Ball (if you have then you will know exactly what I am talking about/ for those who dont know-go ask some one about Madonna or better yet Google her name) How can you not come up with anything but an artist that is deliberately copying (and no this is no tribute act here..trying to image herself into a artist who has done all of this 30 years ago and still going strong. There is a difference of incorporating  musical influences and straight out being a tribute band or copying an artist.. (Prime Examples of this would be Jeff Lynne/ELO beinginfluenced by the Beatles- Alan Parsons and Pink Floyd- The artist manages to capture their OWN Sound while their influences in their music showed through but copying or imitating  not a chance they found their own persona's- and there in lies the problem here.) Now to this performance itself (putting this in to cliff notes version) Production- been there and done that much better, Performance: talking way to much- I know its important to reach out to fans-but she over killed this and it did not seemed sincere-even so way over kill. Letting the Fans Know that they were in MSG, 5th sold out more than the F Bombs were said in Scarface... the Dancing - been there done that- The talking and lack of original production (see Sticky N Sweet and Confessions on a Dance Floor tours among others) makes The Monsters Ball lackluster performance from a woman who-if really with her beautiful voice, musical talent ( yep she can play the Keys and Bass) could really be something special instead of a clone of an Icon. There is no problem paying homage to your mentors and hero just be original while doing it and Lady Gaga if she put the effort in to it could just might pull it off.. But not this tour or DVD.

However, I wasn't too impressed this time out. The book starts with an intriguing prologue, however by page 60 or so you know the good, bad and where things are headed...which for me, was silly and far fetched.   Basically, a group of college kids are shrunk down to a half inch in size by a \\"mad scientist\\" and/or venture capitalist, The next 350 pages is their trek battling insects, micro organisms, nanobots, etc., etc., on their way to defeating the mad man.

0439023491|5.0|I am mesmerized by the talent of Ms. Suzanne Collins.  Her Hunger Games trilogy is riveting and unforgettable.  \\"Catching Fire\\" is a fitting continuation of the series.  I would urge all readers to begin with the first book as you will be confused if you simply start reading this one.  Background information is essential, so this is one series that should be read in chronological order.<br /><br />Having been crowned a Victor in the Hunger Games, seventeen-year-old Katniss Everdeen should now be allowed a life of luxury; a life where she can help her family and all the inhabitants of District 12.  However, a visit from the soft-spoken yet sadistic President Coriolanus Snow, the ruler of the Capitol, proves to Katniss that her unorthodox method of achieving victory for herself and fellow District 12 partner, Peeta Mellark, has sparked a flame of rebellion among Panem's twelve districts.  If not quelled immediately, the spark will ignite an inferno that no one can stop.  Now, caught between President Snow's sinister threats and the ever-increasing unrest within her own district, Katniss must decide what to do.  The Capitol will not rest until they have obliterated Katniss from the earth.  Yet, they not only want her dead, they want to destroy her slowly and to watch as those she holds dear are consumed as well.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this second book in the Hunger Games series.  You will meet many unforgettable characters and embark upon a truly startling yet compelling journey.  My favorite aspect of this installment is the exploration of the themes of quiet heroism and sacrifice in the face of Satanic evil.  As an instance of this fact, see how Katniss' stylist, Cinna, (one of my absolute favorite characters), utilizes his talents in an effective and unforgettable way.  However, his quiet statement against the Capitol has lasting consequences.<br /><br />As in the first book, I was enthralled by the role of Peeta Mellark, the baker's son.  He is truly a character whom I can never forget.  His actions resonate in the reader's mind even after the book is finished, and his quiet love for Katniss is beautifully conveyed even though she herself is unsure of her own feelings.<br /><br />Please read this second installment.  God bless you all.haracter whom I can never forget.

0439023513|5.0|Ms. Suzanne Collins has achieved several goals with this series, the primary one being that she has forced me, if not every reader, out of their comfort zone.  She makes you think, and she \\"pulls no punches.\\" I have just finished reading this gutwrenching conclusion to this series and can only say that I will never forget the ride.<br /><br />Once again, I urge readers to begin with the first volume in the trilogy.  To be fully appreciated, this series should be read in chronological order.<br /><br />Following the events in \\"Catching Fire,\\" Katniss Everdeen is a refugee, along with other members of District 12, in the underground District 13.  The rebels are now waging war against the tyrannical Capitol, ruled by the cold-blooded yet suave President Coriolanus Snow.  Katniss is \\"the Mockingjay,\\" (the rebels symbol), and she must be strong in order to complete her mission.  However, her fellow partner in the Hunger Games, Peeta Mellark, has been captured by the Capitol, and all of Katniss' loved ones hang precariously in the balance.  What follows is a plot of epic proportions in which nothing is what it seems, friendships are tested, and difficult questions are not easily answered.<br /><br />I am quite surprised by the many negative reviews of this book.  The series ended in the only possible way it could have done so without destroying believability.  In a ruthless society that relentlessly destroys innocence for the sake of entertainment, do you honestly think there will be no cost associated with rebellion? The new characters are not one-dimensional as so many people have asserted.  Instead, they are desperate individuals playing their roles in the age-old struggle of good versus evil that will exist until the end of time.  The fight results in defilement and death, but Ms. Collins does an effective job in portraying resilience and courage.  I am particularly glad that Peeta, (my favorite character), remains a quiet yet strong fighter.  Although scarred beyond imagining by psychologically sadistic mind games while in captivity, he emerges victorious.  Although some may disagree with me, the same truth applies to Katniss.  She is still a survivor.  Regarding the \\"love triangle,\\" it was resolved very effectively for me.  I don't think the story would have been plausible any other way.<br /><br />Please give this novel a chance.  God bless you all.adistic mind games while in captivity, he emerges victorious.

B0032UYFA6|1.0|What started as a very compelling narrative about a man who faces his own mortality and fights to survive and provide for his family the best way he knows how turns into some gross disturbing look at an egomaniacal power trip.  I really want to point out that the tv show is gripping and the acting is superb for the most part, and the story is interesting. The problem is you start to really dislike the characters, and by the end of season 4 I could care less if any of the characters survived and I was actually hoping that they would all get Columbian neckties.  So what starts out as a character many people could half relate to, turns into this monster who by the end of season 4 does something that is very undesirable.  Its interesting 'cause another show I fell in love with was Deadwood which had far worse characters who almost relished in their antisocial behaviour yet I was not as upset with the show as I am with BB,(we considered naming our dog swigun).  I guess in many ways I felt more of an attachment to these characters. I understand that if the characters don't evolve and change the show will become stale, and that they could only swing the cancer plotline for so long, but the turn they decide to take with it is just very unsavory.
0439023521|5.0|I have heard nothing but praise for Suzanne Collins Hunger Games series and have been longing to read the books.  Now, thankfully, they are finally available in Braille.  The only word that comes to mind after reading the first installment in this series is \\"wow\\".  The sheer brilliance of Ms. Collins descriptive ability and her engaging characters will leave you breathless.  I am devouring these books at a break-neck pace.  The stories are choice feasts; utterly tasty even though the fare is extremely heavy.  Be forewarned that these books are not lighthearted material.  However, they achieve what any exceptional books do.  These stories succeed in making you think.<br /><br />In a futuristic society called Panem, a Capitol city is surrounded by twelve districts that are each responsible for providing sustaining materials for the Capitol's survival.  Seventeen-year-old Katniss Everdeen lives in the coal-mining District 12, where she has taken on the responsibility of caring for her fragile mother and twelve-year-old sister, Prim after a mining accident took her father's life.  As a result of an uprising several years earlier, the sadistic rulers in the Capitol have devised an annual televised event: the Hunger Games.  The Games not only serve as an effective tool to discourage rebellion, but they also serve to exhibit the Capitol's stranglehold over the districts.  A male and female child from each district is chosen to enter an arena and fight to the death.  The final child left standing is crowned the Victor.  During the annual Reaping to choose the children, Katniss' sister's name is drawn.  The older girl immediately volunteers to take her sister's place.  What follows is a riveting story in which a brutal struggle for survival is played out for a decadent society's entertainment.  Will Katniss survive the Games? Will her fellow district partner, Peeta Mellark, become her ally? If Katniss survives, what will her life entail?<br /><br />I was repeatedly struck by the relevance of this novel.  I could easily see a version of the Hunger Games being played out on our own televisions in the not-so-distant future.  Although I despise reality TV shows, many of my friends love them, and the connection between our society's constant craving for entertainment mirrors that of the fallen Roman Empire.  Surely, it is no accident that Ms. Collins uses such names as Caesar Flickerman, Seneca Crane, Coriolanus Snow, and Claudius Templesmith for some of the characters from the Capitol.<br /><br />None of the characters are flat or uninteresting, and my favorite character is Peeta, the kind yet resourceful baker's son whose talent for decorating the cakes that his family sells proves to be a useful talent in the arena.  Although Katniss disdains the merchant families in her district, (of which Peeta's family belongs), she cannot forget a single act by the baker's son that ultimately determines her own actions at a crucial point in the story.<br /><br />I love that Katniss is portrayed as unsentimental and determined, yet, ultimately, a person like the rest of us.  We, too, are desperate to survive, and we long to be heard.  Peeta asserts that he does not \\"want to be just a piece in their games\\".  May this same sentiment be our wish as well!<br /><br />Please give this unforgettable novel a chance.  God bless you all.is novel.

Some are downright awful .. No Spare Parts and Don't Be a Stranger .. what??? .. and Keith, We Had it All .. not one of your best.  BUT ...<br /><br />On the other hand, Claudine, So Young, When You're Gone, Tallahassee Lassie, Keep Up Blues, and even the Nicky Hopkins driven Petrol Blues (at all of 1:36) make it worth the admission price.  I always thought the Stones were at their best when they tapped into their bluesy side.  Think Midnight Rambler, Can't You Hear Me Knockin', Slave, and even Back of My Hand from A Bigger Bang.  When You're Gone is the epitome of this style and it's hard to believe it didn't end up on some collection somewhere before this.  In Petrol Blues, you'd think you were listening to Ledbelly.  And Claudine and Tallahasee Lassie .. pure out rockers.<br /><br />Nice trip down memory lane .. and yes, I have the original release with Lucy and Racquel, etc. on the cover.  $2.90 on release day at Sam The Record Man on Yonge St.  Now that's a reissue I'd go for .. re-open Sam's!!!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|My kids love this movie. I have two boys ages 10 and 3, both have seen this movie 10+ times already on the DVD and would not mind watching once every day. My elder one says Cars2 is better than Cars1 because of the action sequences.
B004KRVDDM|5.0|I looove this movie for it's delightfully quirky characters as well as its gentle, satiric take on small-time competitions and the big-time impact they have on contestants, families, and communities. The undercurrent of predictability is off-set by the deliciously bizarre characters and the interesting situations. You'll fall in love with every one of the supporting cast and the leads as well. And the dancing is phenomenal!
B001ET0826|3.0|This was the album that Prince took his experimentation to the next level while at the same time, his record company was trying to tell him what to do and re-write what Prince wanted to do creatively. So in turn, in 1994 Prince decided to give his label the finger with this album.<br />It is not commercial and is probably the most provocative album Prince has ever made in terms of sexual promiscuity and social issues. The first track, \\"Come\\", was originally around 4 minutes but when Prince got frustrated, he re-recorded an 11 minute version with extremely suggestive sounds and lyrics. You'd think that Prince could pull something like this off but it actually comes off as laughable and mediocre. It's almost like Prince has become a parody of himself for half the album except he sounds more negative and bitter and the tone of the music itself even feels dark.<br />The other half of the album is dark but it's actually really good considering the other 5 songs were mediocrity. \\"Loose\\", \\"Papa\\", \\"Dark\\", \\"Solo\\", and \\"Letitgo\\" are the songs that showcase the dark side of Prince without him sounding like he's lost his creativity and his edge.<br />I rated this album 3 stars because 5 songs out of 10 were just mediocre, however the songs I mentioned are really good.<br />Since the price on Amazon.com is 5.99, I'd consider that a good deal because that's about the price of an EP which is how much this should cost (5 songs plus usually makes up an EP).
B0050PYNN0|1.0|I started to watch it because it looked like it would be a fun farce. It was so unfunny to me that I gave up maybe a little too long into it.  I've only \\"walked out\\" of one movie before...American Werewolf in London.  Now I've got two walk-outs under my belt.
B005PTQPU0|3.0|Now you can listen to her count while some fellow dramatically reads off, well . . . 50 words for \\"snow\\"!!  The sad part is that's one of the more interesting things on this album.  I've been a fan for 30+ years (egads), but it took me a long time to get into Aerial (the last album), and frankly I still consider it Kate's weakest release since Lionheart.  So news of 50 Words for Snow was something I greeted with guarded optimism; I looked forward to hearing something new, but Aerial made me wary.  Yes, Aerial did eventually find a spot in my KB rotation (albeit quite a bit less often than, say,  Hounds of Love), so let's not rush to judgment, but I can say this much - if you were disappointed by Aerial, 50WfS will not be rekindling your faith in things Kate.  50WfS is much more like Aerial than anything else in the Katalog, but it's even more low-key, rambling, and moody; King of the Mountain seems like a hot dance number compared to anything in this collection.  The album has its moments (Wild Man and 50 Words are okay, though both do go on), but for those fans who were hoping Aerial was a side trip on the way back to the next Sensual World or Dreaming (or even Red Shoes), 50WfS will put those hopes to rest, at least for now.  Perhaps, as its title implies, this is intended to be contemplative music well-suited to playing in the background while staring out the window at falling snow.  I just hope that someday Ms. Bush's ambitions once again go beyond background music.  And umm, Kate dear, much as we love your sense of whimsy, what made you think we were really longing to hear an eight-minute duet with you and some lounge singer dude yelling \\"I don't want to lose you again\\" at each other?  There's actually something I like about \\"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\\", but the guy's vocal is so jarringly out of place that this one's probably not long for the playlist (I subsequently learned that the mis-cast lounge singer in question is actually Elton John, a sad fact in itsown right).  And why should we spend a quarter hour contemplating some extended metaphor or fantasy (whatever) about bedding a snow man?  We've followed you down some strange roads before, but musically they went somewhere; largely, 50WfS goes nowhere that interests me much.  You've always been evolving, so for now I'd like to hope this \\"meditation\\" mode is just a phase.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|have not yet heard this via my stereo.did stream it four or five time via the website set up for the record.let's just say i cannot wait to hear it again on my stereo.this is art....it will stand the test of time....people in 20 30 years will be singing this records praises.  i am a lou reed fan......i have said in other comments that over the course of his career he has been right more than he has been wrong.......i still would have loved to hear his \\"live in italy\\" band and what they would have made of this music.i can understand metallic fans not liking this as much as lou reed fans do.i give metallic credit for making this record...BTW there is live footage from european TV which is maybe even better than the record.don't hate people don't fear what you are not used to i have heard a lot of rock and roll in my day....this works and is worth the effort...well off to listen to the new fall record........
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Love this book.  I tried as hard as I could to not read as much per night, but I could not put it down. I was drawn in from page one and not released until the end. I will be going back and re-reading. This book compares to my reading of The Stand.  Not scary, but gripping.  Each character every line.  You want to know more and can't wait to click to the next page, (kindle.)  Well done Mr. King, well done.  The trip back in time was worth every penny spent, even for the Kindle version.
B005V20JKI|5.0|The visuals and sound are both really good. The gameplay is perfect for my short attention span and the goofy elements (a unicorn pooping rainbows) make me laugh and continue playing. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved it! it was funny and a great story.it did make me cry but in a good way.cant wait till it comes.
140053271X|1.0|I will keep this review brief. I bought this Nook Simple Touch for my wife in June. For the first couple months it worked great and we loved it. Eventually we purchased a Kindle too so we could each have an e-reader.<br /><br />However, the Nook Simple Touch slowly began to start freezing, requiring a restart every single time. Because we like the device, I have tried researching everything online to see how to keep it from freezing (carefully dusting it off, charging it, reseting it, etc.) Sitting down to read is hard enough to do at times (am I right?), so I don't need my e-reader to freeze on me when I finally make the time to sit down and read. Based on my research, many others have the same problem with this model. In fact, many people had the same problem with the previous model. They have exchanged theirs at Barnes & Noble, only to report a couple weeks later that their replacement does the same thing!!!  Hmm, I wonder if the new generation of the Nook Touch is going to have freezing problems too???<br /><br />I have been in conversation with Barnes & Noble management (\\"object key\\": 28817953) and they have refused to offer a valid solution to my problem.<br /><br />In short, don't purchase a Nook, they freeze all the time. Go with the Kindle. It works much better and ours has never frozen.
B004EF6632|5.0|VERY well done mini series.  much better than the book too, as it adds a bit more romance.  accents and parts are very well done.  one of my favorite period pieces ever!  i watch it often!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing series of books. Don't think about buying this, just do it! The only regret I have is that there aren't any more books!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the best series I have ever read. These books are non-stop page turners. Next to impossible to put down and stop reading. I want more!
1451648537|3.0|This reviewer nailed this book -- its strengths and many weaknesses.  A lot of other reviewers (and comment-ers) seem unable to divorce themselves from their personal adoration of Jobs and the Apple brand/products & services (quite intertwined at that).  This is largely a testament to Jobs' greatest gift:  promotion, foremost of himself followed by his company and its products.  More than a few times I wanted to hurl the Kindle across the room in disbelief of his treatment of people and disregard for a few fundamental social norms.  Genius?  Maybe.  Spoiled, insensitive SOB?  Most certainly.  We get a little understanding of this -- and that's where the book falls short and this reviewer nails it:  \\"It's written almost as a sequential fact-finding report, rather than as a truly insightful look at a man and his work.\\"  Well done.  Had the author only written as well.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|Its 1942 and France is under the Nazi jack boot, yet thanks to the plucky resistance the fascists are being thwarted at every turn - or not as it turned out. This is a tale that has its roots in the now infamous round up of the Jews of Paris in the summer of 1942. They were mostly women and children and were herded into the city's velodrome, where they were kept in stifling temperatures with no amenities, including lavatories, food and water.<br /><br />Sarah is living in a building in the Jewish quarter with her parents and younger brother. When the gendarmes came calling, she hid him in a wardrobe, locking him in and taking the key. Once they reached the velodrome they realised their mistake in having left little Michelle behind. The Jews were then taken to transit camps before finally going to the death camps including Auschwitz. This was all done by the French authorities, albeit at the behest of their Uber Lords.<br /><br />Meanwhile in the modern day, Julia Jarmond's (Kristen Scott-Thomas) husband has inherited that self same apartment from his ailing mum. Julia is working for a new French magazine and is doing a piece on the `round up' and has done some digging as to who these people were who had been in her new home.<br /><br />The story flits back and forward telling the ordeals of Sarah and her fellow captives, in line with the unfolding truths that Julia finds increasingly difficult to accept. This is an extremely well acted and crafted film that deals with an emotional scar on the French psyche in an open and honest way. President Mitterrand actually apologised for French complicity in these deportations of 76,000 Jews. It took that long for France to face up to that part of her past, but at least she did it. This whole episode was told in a much more acute way in the film `The Round Up'[[ASIN:B0044GG5RS The Round Up ( La rafle ) ( To astro tou fovou ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - France ]]], this film has some resonance with that but also `Sophie's Choice'[[ASIN:0784011710 Sophie's Choice]]. There are fine performances all round and an excellent musical score, the whole thing exudes quality.<br /><br />This is not an action flick and not straightforward good versus evil, as some of the Gendarmes are portrayed as good guys in the wrong place etc. Whilst it does not show some of the grittier sides to the subject in hand, it still faces up to them. It is in French, some English and a smattering of German, that is not always translated. Fans of war history films and Kristen Scott-Thomas will want to see this. A special word has to be said about the performance by Melusine Mayance who plays Sarah, she is utterly convincing, a brilliant performance. Write and director Gilles Paquet-Brennan has made an interesting and thoughtful film, that does him credit.Sophie's Choice]].

0679805273|5.0|I am one of the thousands who received this book as a high school graduation gift. It's been over a decade since then. I liked the book then, I love it now! Like any truly great book...its relevance has lasted through time.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|Well, this movie was OK, there were lots of flaws to this one.<br /><br />First off, there is this new trend in movie-making to have this atrocious bigger-than-life sound to it and as a result the volume is either too loud or too low, this movie fails because of this flaw, the sound is just awful, noisy, busy, and tiresome.<br /><br />Next, the lighting was also just plain awful, very dark to the point of distraction, you will wind up just wanting it to be over already.<br /><br />Another annoying thing that Mr. Abrams tried, and failed at, was trying to create realistic dialog with the character talking over each other and lots busy stuff going on in every single tiresome scene and it just fails. I think that this is because the film had so little ground to cover in what seemed like a very long time...yawn...<br /><br />What was good about this movie were the kids, I mean, the movie that they made in the film, it was pretty good...<br /><br />My suggestion? Don't expect a Spielberg experience from this movie...
0316154687|5.0|David Sedaris....Where have you been all my life.  This was so funny I couldn't put it down and was hysterically laughing out loud.  Great author!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game works great on my rooted / overclocked droid 1 and rooted/overclocked nook color. Very smooth game. Have not had any issues with it. Niece loves to play the game.
1451627289|4.0|I was very excited about this book when announced -- Stephen King does time travel -- and eager to read it. My love affair with King's writing has gone up and down over the decades, but I know he can sometimes pull a masterpiece out of his hat when we least expect it.  11/22/63 is not a masterpiece, but it is an excellent novel of ideas and emotions. King's writing delivers real impact and the story is long, but not too long to keep you engrossed. His treatment of time travel is interesting and very matter of fact. This is not a book for someone that wants to understand the mechanics of time travel and multiple universes.  This is a book, however, for someone that cares about the impact small decisions can have on the bigger world and who cares about love. I think King is writing here about his love for America, his love for some aspects of the past, and his belief in the immense power of two people in love with each other. I applaud him for that.  I have a small fear that anyone under 30 might not really understand the larger importance of JFK and his killing in American history. As time marches on and trivial news floods our brains, the turning points in recent history can lose their impact. Perhaps this novel will spur the interest of some people in an important era in our history (and one with many similiarities to today).  Overall, I highly recommend 11/22/63.
B0040JHWKS|1.0|Most of the album consists of ill-conceived, poorly written, insubstantial love songs.  Judging from the album's cover, I think the Boss spends more time worrying about what tight jeans he's going to wear next than thinking about what he is writing.  Gibberish, especially for someone his age.
0525423656|2.0|Like many others here, I thought Matched was okay... good enough, anyway, to warrant seeing what the author had planned for the next book.   I hoped that this follow-up would start to move things along a bit more. Instead, it hardly moved much at all. Most of the story just seems to follow the characters as they meander around in those maze-like canyons; which is a pretty good metaphor for how I felt as the reader.   I find I just don't care about the characters, and was seriously bored by the tedious, whiny, adolescent love pining that dominated the already-thin plot. While (in my opinion, of course) Condie is a far better writer than that hack Stephenie Meyer, the former still lacks the impact and story-telling style of Suzanne Collins and The Hunger Games, books that really know how to keep readers entranced.  Not sure if I will even bother with the third book. Maybe if others review it better...

B000000WFF|5.0|People love to hate on the Spice Girls but lets be real, they were ''That Girl Group'' of the 90's. Yes, their corny and downright chessy at times but their music is fun and upbeat. I was a diehard fan until Ginger left and their music went to hell and while I was a fan I brought both their albums and this one is by far their best album. There's nothing ''deep'' or life changing on the album. The lyrics are simple but every song is fun to listen to and the girls sing well together. So well, that I can't tell them apart at times. This whole album is good and if your a 90's kid/teen you should own this.
B005UG542S|2.0|The only good thing that this produces is the hope that somone will one day do a proper movie that ends the Harry Potter saga as the author meant it to be ended. At the moment, the only way to know how the Harry Potter saga ends is to read the last book, this movie kept us from knowing how it actually does end. This Movie is a Bogus invention, a story very UNLIKE than the one written by J.K. Rowling as the Last Harry Potter Book, and a misrepresentation of the Last Deathly Hallows Book. . It is like buying a movie about The Sinking of the Titanic, and discovering you paid for a movie about the sinking of the Andrea Doria.    I certainly felt cheated because I was scammed into buying a movie that simply was not the ending of the Harry Potter series as the author wrote it.    Also for all the people who obsess over the digital delivery of this movie, THAT is NOT A MOVIE REVIEW.  The Quality of a Movie in a review is all about the movie itself.  Great Movies are Great even when the digital delivery system employed stinks, and a Lousy Movie like this one doesn't become better or worse because of how it was delivered to you. Hudson Hawk was a lousy movie, how it was delivered never affected that fact.  Try learning what a Movie Review is before wasting everyones time.    I would simply add that all this is fiction, make believe, and not in any way real or even possible.  Harry Potter is a brilliant invention from the mind of author J.K. Rowling, and we owe her for this truly wonderful invention, but never forget that it is only an invention with no connection to anything real beyond we who read it.  God is real, His Only begotten son Jesus is real, the Holy Spirit is real, but Harry Potter is not.  God is an absolute truth, one you may depend on, seek and find,  a truth and reality you can learn from which makes God very unlike myth and fiction.atrix Le Strange was a great antagonist through her killing the parents of Nevel Longbottom, then Sirius Black, Harry's Godfather, and then the weasley twin, and she was behind goading Snape into making the curse to kill Dumbledore.  The sequence of her death at the hands of motherly old Mrs. Weasley is a necessary part that was reduced to a photo op unworthy of the author as well.  With all the really excellent HP movies the climax was a complete letdown for all the millions who actually bought and read all the books, as well as the movies.<br /><br />The only good thing that this produces is the hope that somone will one day do a proper movie that ends the Harry Potter saga as the author meant it to be ended.

B005W6UT6M|5.0|same movie but theres better graphics. Most of you, if not all of you have already seen this movie so a review is not needed
B005N95JA4|4.0|The 2nd disc of unreleased tracks is quite good considering they've been stored away since the original sessions and now polished off by the actual dude that \\"moves like Jagger\\". A Deluxe Edition re-release that truly adds to a legendary bands catalog...oh, and Some Girls itself is quite possibly the most complete album The Stones ever put out being a snapshot of 1977's New York City wearing and tearing with Disco at Studio 54 and The Ramones at CBGB's, Shattered in other words.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I have watched this series over and over again. I love this series and wish they made more. That is the only problem with watching great shows like this, you're upset when its over and wish they would make more. The storylines of the characters are great and the reality of the series is perfect. The best part is, Rudy Reyes is played by himself, what a badass!   If you liked the Band of Brother series, you will love this wartime tale as well. Although the two are set in different times, they both have great character portrayals of war and the struggles the soldier face with it.
B005EY2XFC|4.0|I wanted to do a review mostly based on the viewing experience from this new Blu-ray release. First I think I should give some background on my experience with this film. I have owned a copy of The Crow since it came out on VHS and like most fans I have found just about every release somewhat limited. Although this release has \\"more\\" extras on it it still feels somewhat lacking. However, since the film was made in the early 90s, well before DVDs and all the extras you could associate with them, that is just how things are.   Ok, on to more technical aspects.   Video: The transfer is very well done. In fact most Crow fans will notice that some of the effects, which were pretty good in their day, show a bit easier than they have in the past. The overall quality is brighter, but not in a way that detracts from the films dark tone. A lot of the \\"grainy\\" feel of the film is still intact despite the improved quality.   Audio (DTS 5.1): Some of the staging in the Audio is a bit iffy to say the least. The musical performance portions especially are VERY vocal heavy, much more so than past releases. Some of the gun fire is also staged kind of oddly, most likely caused by the original staging of the sound. Overall, with the age of the film, the sounds is very good.   Extras: I don't pretend to know every little extra that's available for this film but I would bet this is \\"most\\" of them. You have a behind the scenes for the film, which appears to have been made before Lee died. It includes most of his last interview, which was on the original VHS release of the film.   You also have a deleted scenes montage, this is what I found lacking. Instead of making any attempt to restore any of the audio, you get music from the film laid over most of these scenes. I realize that it would cost a lot of money to restore the audio but it seems at this point that you could more than make up for it with sales. Still, its nice to see the Skull Cowboy scene and the extra ones with Allbrecht.There is also an extensive interview with James O`Barr in his basement, which is very interesting. He talks a lot about his artistic process and how it took him 9 years to complete The Crow, something he had no intention of showing to anyone else.   This movie changed my life as an artist more than any one singular moment before or after it. To this day the imagery has a profound affect on me, and this Blu-ray only accentuates my continuing love for the film. Even after 18 years, the movie still holds a power over me, that I simply cannot explain. If not for the weird staging in the sound and the lacking attention to the deleted scenes I would have gone 5 out of 5. Still, a great release.
1594744769|3.0|I thought this would be a great creepy story, but I was disappointed. It seemed to me that the author tried to build a story around the photos, trying to make the story fit the photos, so it didn't really flow.  Not good enough for a second read.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|The hard part about the loving Blu-Ray version of this film (Didn't watch all three yet, just the first) is the fact that the video transfer.  It turned out OK, but there are other movies, for example Terminator 2 and Man on Fire, that really show off a good Blu-Ray system as a whole.  That being said, the audio quality on Jurassic Park is definitely awesome.  Very crisp, clear distinctions in the channels.    If you can get this while Amazon.com has it for $30, I think it it's worth it.  I am an audiophile, so great surround sound is a must at this movie has it.  I imagine the other two flicks are just as good with the audio, but I will report otherwise, if necessary.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|Mostly harmless. Don't waste money on this as it is available for free quite often. Fun while you're stuck somewhere and you weren't smart enough to bring a book or real video game portable.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|I cannot express how much I love Big Time Rush! I'm in my mid 20s and I adore these guys. They are perfect role models, and they have so much talent and heart for what they do. They are driven, passionate, and dedicated to their work and their fans. This album trumps their first album by a long shot and I am so proud of these guys for how far they've come this past year. The boys worked directly with this album, and wrote most of the songs themselves. I have a good feeling about this album, and I am honored and blessed to call myself a deep admirer of Big Time Rush.<br /><br />Everyone should have this CD. It's incredible! Elevate a little higher!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This was a very, very good film about the financial crisis. Okay, it's true that, like a Michael Moore documentary, various poor sods are caught unprepared in interviews with the objective of making them look foolish. Still, there were some gems in these interviews, where many of them deserved to look foolish.   All considered, the film manages to both entertain and inform. Although entertainment seems the first goal of the filmmaker, it still raises a ton of serious issues for public policy. One has to entertain if one wants a lot of people to see the film after all!  There are priceless moments galore.  For example: we hear a representative of a credit rating agency say that their ratings are only opinions that don't speak to the value of a security or its suitability as an investment (so what the &*?%@ is the use of them then?). The DVD includes extra interviews which are very interesting : for example, it was hilarious and enlightening to hear Das talk about Iceland.  Seriously, everyone should see this film.   My suggestion to Charles Ferguson would be to make his next film about Tax Havens.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Great train wreck! The actors were good and I liked the JJ Abrams feel of the film. A little Spielberg doesn't hurt either!
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|What a great role for Clooney. His character is a wealthy Hawaiian lawyer who has just learned that his comatose wife's condition after a boating accident is not improving and they may have to pull the plug. His daughters--one 10, the other 17--are acting out in ways he hasn't a clue how to handle. He holds the reins of a family trust that owns a huge chunk of scenic land and the cousins are queuing up on both sides of the question of whether he should sell and make them all rich or hold on to it. Now his teenage daughter tells him she's seen evidence that she thinks indicates Mom had been cheating on him. Here's a man who's never met a situation he couldn't handle with ease. Now his life is threatening to come undone from every direction. Yet you know he's going to somehow figure out a way to handle all this. What you may not be expecting under the circumstances is just how very funny much of that will turn out to be.<br /><br />Add to all of the above a perfectly cast supporting cast. The kids who play his kids are required to play almost as wide a range of emotion as Clooney is and they play it with an ease and naturalness that is as believable as his. The young actor who plays the teenage daughter's dorky hang-around boyfriend provides delicious comic relief just when it's needed. The actors who play the grandparents are superb in small but important roles. Beau Bridges gets only a tiny bit of screen time as one of the cousins, but he makes the most of it. And then there's the marvelous Judy Greer. I've long loved her work in ditsy comic sidekick roles, but here she leaves the funny business to others and plays a serious role beautifully--both the quiet warmth and the heartbreaking bravado. And let us not forget the actress playing the comatose wife...that role couldn't have been easy either. Very highly recommended.
B000J10EQU|2.0|Simply put: Style over substance. There are some excellent sequences, but that is all this film seems to be, well planned and executed sequences - but with nothing coherent gluing the whole thing together. The `aeroplane near crash and last minute rescue' is extremely impressively realised and the machine gun ammo slamming off Supe's chest followed by the bullet in the eye are magnificent. My jaw was dropping and I almost wanted to cheer. That is what Superman is about: seeing him defeat the bad guys in new, engaging - even amusing - ways. But that was where the fun ended. As what Superman is not about is love children and ridiculous heroic dabblings with kryptonite. I find both to be so hideously implausible that they must both be ridiculed. As Brodie (ably played by Jason Lee in Kevin Smith's Mallrats) points out, \\"It's impossible! Lois Lane could never have Superman's baby. Do you think her fallopian tubes could handle his sperm? I guarantee you that when he comes during sex, he probably blows a load like a shotgun blast... right through her back.\\" So aside from Lois Lane being alive post coitus, you would then have the impossibility of a human being conceiving and bringing to full term an alien's child. Do not forget that just because Clark Kent looks like and ostensibly acts like a human he is an alien. He is a different species entirely. And entirely different species cannot mate. Just think of the havoc it would cause in the animal kingdom if a lion fell in love with and mated with a crocodile. Or a guinea fowl.     The other issue that makes me quiver with anger is the whole cretinous concept of Superman being physically able to lift an entire continent of kryptonite into outer space. As internet blogger dpogue21 so proficiently phrases it (much better than I could - so thank you dpogue) in his imdb review, \\"My next major complaint [is] that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. It doesn't take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what's wrong with that. I don't know how many comic books Bryan Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Superman-related projects ever again. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pyjamas. That's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground.\\" Need I say more? Didn't think so.  **  [...]

Great show. Two dvd's.
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen yet this year. I liked this movie because it shows a better perspective on what it was like for African-Americans during the 1960's. It shows how one human being can be cruel and racist to another human being. I fully enjoyed watching this move and could watch it over and over. One of the best parts of the movie is where Aibileen talks about one of the first kids she raised. The little boy asked her why her skin was darker than his. Finally, after she gotten tired of him asking her all the time, she told him she drank to much coffee. I laughed so hard at this part, I was crying. This move goes back to when the Civil Rights Movement was just starting. Where African-Americans were working as the help, during this time and basically raising the white children. The help also cleaned the house and cooked the meals. As for the white women, most of them grew up, settled down, and had children of their own, except one, Skeeter.<br />Skeeter had gotten to go to the college to pursue her own dreams as becoming a journalist. She gets a job at the local journal called The Jackson Journal writing for a cleaning column. The funny thing about Skeeter is that she had no knowledge of cleaning or anything that had to do with cleaning. So she turns to the help for some advice on what to write and how to write for the column. The person who helps her out is a helper called Aibileen. After talking to a big journalist in New York City, Skeeter decides to write about the help in the help's point of view. Skeeter then tries to persuade Aibileen into helping her out and telling her about her experiences of raising the white children and working for the white people.<br />Minnie and Aibileen work as maids in Jackson, Mississippi. These ladies are amazing in this movie with how they acted in their roles. Minnie worked for a white woman named Hilly, a southern lady who was raised by Aibileen. She is also Skeeter's sister and the total opposite of Skeeter. Hilly is very racist in this movie, to where she is on the committee to require each white family to have a separate bathroom outside for the help. The Help is just as good as any other classic movie. It will be put down in the history books alongside To Kill a Mocking Bird. There are parts in the movie that are unbelievable fantastic and heart-wrenching. This is definitely a must see movie! I was honestly moved and astounded by not only the movie in general, but the way the each character had a meaning to the story line. This is by far one of the best movies I've seen this year.lly is very racist in this movie, to where she is on the committee to require each white family to have a separate bathroom outside for the help.

B000JMLFLW|4.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was assigned to me at my University. It was the first English classic book I read while getting my degree. Pride and Prejudice was a part of my English Literature class. At first I didn't want to read it, but a few pages in I really enjoyed it and now have read other books by her.<br /><br />The book made strong my belief that love overcomes everything. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are so well drawn out, slow and with meaning. They are characters you will fall in love with. It's funny how at first they don't like each other but come to appreciate each other
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|I so was looking forward to this movie and couldn't wait to it came out. What a big disappointment! The acting was ok, effects were good but the story and directing were sad. It felt rushed to get to the next topic or event with little struggle and no big end.
0486406482|5.0|Jane Austen was a great author who without using too complex words made simple stories, with characters you can't forget. She had insights into human nature that make her story meaningful today just as it was in the early 1800's.  Emma is a beautiful and fortunate woman who has had only good luck. She thinks she knows it all. But really it's just she hasn't experienced the world. But this belief makes her get involved in the problems of others and disrupts her peaceful life. However it's not that serious, the results are comical and teaches you the important lesson to mind your own business!
0553386794|5.0|Take a look at the cover on this book before you decide to invest seven hours of your life in this book. Unlike many book covers, this one is a pretty good representation of the story. Yes, there is a big, brawny man on this cover, but, no, he is not passionately yet gently kissing anyone here. This big, brawny man is sitting on a throne and the throne is not a golden throne embedded with diamonds and other jewels. This throne is made of hundreds of well-worn swords that have been welded together.<br /><br />Are you getting the idea yet? Do you have a glimmer of what this story is about?<br /><br />The man is staring at the floor, and he is not smiling. The big, brawny man is angry and bitter, and he is scheming, he is planning, he is plotting.<br /><br />A black crow sits beside the man on the throne. He is not smiling either.<br /><br />Before you shudder and throw the book back into the display at WalMart that advertises both the book and the HBO original series made from the book, let me share one more thing with you: Though it would be difficult for me to imagine a book that would lie farther from my Reading Comfort Zone, I must also tell you that I was surprised, no, shocked to discover that I loved this book. I hated most of the characters, but they seemed oddly, startlingly realistic. The plot involves lots of battle scenes and brutality and cruelty and treachery, all of which I usually loathe, but which, here, felt deeply compelling.<br /><br />I therefore find myself in the peculiar situation of recommending highly a book which should have, and did in fact, repel me. Odd.
0439813786|5.0|A visual masterpiece, The Invention of Hugo Cabret is sure to delight readers of all ages.  Hugo Cabret is an orphan who lives in the train station in Paris and keeps all the clocks running.  Hugo is an inventor, a creative thinker and a thief who needs to steal to eat and create.  He is on a mission to restore a automaton (mechanical man) that his dad found in hopes that his secret wish will come true.  Along the way he meets a old man who runs a toy booth and his granddaughter, Iabelle, who becomes his only friend.  What begins for Hugo as a secret desire becomes a mystery waiting to be solved and he and Isabelle set off on a quest.<br /><br />The book is a visual tour de force and will have you turning the pages at a fast pace as you read the text and absorb the 284 original drawings and images.  The Invention of Hugo Cabret is not a typical book as it is like a cinematic film on paper.  The storyline contains some cinematic history and includes visuals from early French films.  The book will leave you with the impressions of a graphic novel combined with a children's picture book.  The text is enjoyable to read in combination with the artwork and the result is a timeless, innovative piece of literature that will leave a lasting impression on the reader.<br /><br />While I was reading The Invention of Hugo Cabret, my 11 year daughter was peering over my shoulder.  When I set the book down, I came back and noticed she had started reading it in tandem with me and for a few days we had two bookmarks in the book and had to fight over who was reading it first.  Now my 13 year old son is in the midst of reading it and our plan is to see the movie version of the book this weekend.  The film version is called Hugo and is directed by Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />  The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a book for families to read, cherish and treasure.  You must leave a special place for it on your bookshelf and re-visit the reading experience again and again.

B004ZNAGNE|5.0|I didn't notice all that much difference in the remastered studio album; Brain Damage sounded a bit \\"spacier\\", but otherwise it's the studio album of Dark Side of the Moon.  The live recording from 1974 is a great addition however, it was really interesting to see what they were doing with DSotM right after it was released.  I still prefer the studio album, but for the DSotM \\"experience\\", it adds a lot of value.  I'm wondering now if I should have bought the full immersion set - what other extra treats would I have found?  Recommended for DSotM fans.

I got over it quickly, however, when the book found its way into my hands. It was another Riordan can't-put-it-down-till-I'm-finished book. I actually read until two in the morning to get to the end. Lots of new-old monsters and its setting in the labyrinth is ideal. Rick, I hope you are writing like a madman on book five.

Compare to the Tour of the Mongoose DVD this one is really simple but Shakira's energy, dances, singing makes up for it.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|So far out of all of the cases for the Kindle Fire, this one is pretty decent. My only problem with it was the initial price for its quality but I'm glad that they discounted it eventually. $30 is still a bit too pricey, I think, but if you don't mind spending a little extra for a decent cover, by all means just go ahead and purchase one. It's definitely light weight and protects against scratches. Not sure how it will hold up against drops but who would ever want to test out that theory? The stand is a little flimsy, however, but I'm not one of the Kindle Fire users that ever really need a stand as my screen is usually locked onto the vertical position.  Great case for the Kindle Fire thus far, but we'll see who will whip up a better one that is price appropriate for the product.

0439023521|5.0|Before I started reading Hunger Games, I had read some reviews going gaga over the book, but I was still not ready for it. The basic story premise goes something like this:<br />Set in a post-apocalyptic future, America is now divided into 12 districts ruled with an iron hand by the Capitol.  The 12 districts each supplies the Capitol with different products such as coal, agricultural goods, etc. Years ago, there had been a rebellion by the districts against the Capitol which had been quashed mercilessly and utterly by the Capitol. As a reminder of the power the Capitol holds over the destinies of the districts, every year the Capitol chooses 2 children from each district, between the ages of 12 and 18, to fight in the `Hunger Games', a fight to the death. The winner is treated as a hero uplifted from the poverty that hounds everyone else in the districts.<br /><br />The event is of course televised, with compulsory viewing by the people in the districts. The inhumanity of this comes out when the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen's younger sister, with no survival skills is chosen for the Games. Long story short, Katniss volunteers to take her place and enters the Games.<br /><br />The way in which Katniss and Peta are readied for the Games, they seem like lambs being fattened before they are sacrificed at the altar. Though well-meaning, the team provided to them comes across as being immune to the horrors of the Games. They can only see the glory this could get them. Not to be overly critical, they do help both Katniss and Peta get into a position to win the Games.<br /><br />Each character has been perfectly created and moulded.<br />Katniss comes across as a hugely determined girl, who is extremely competent for the task for which she has been chosen. Her training in hunting and survival skills holds her in good stead during the Games. Her unwavering need to get back to her family, who she believes would not survive without her, keeps her focused on winning the Games. I found the moral tug-of-war going on in her head to have She does come across as brutal and manipulative in the way she uses Peta's love for her to win support from sponsors during the games.<br />Peta Mellark, who is the other contestant chosen for the Games from Katniss' district, has been in love with her throughout his life. This is initially used as a tactic to garner sponsors for them by their mentor, but it really comes across during the games, where he sacrifices himself on a number of occasions to save Katniss' life.<br />Katniss and Peta seem to be on opposite ends of the emotional spectrum. Katniss is brutal while Peta Is lovable, Katniss is competent, while Peta seems to stumble along, Katniss is driven by the love for her family while Peta is driven by her love for Katniss.<br />Haymitch is the team's mentor who initially comes across as a highly incompetent drunk. He however, has a big role to play in the team's winning the Games.<br />Gale is Katniss' best friend and hunting partner. They have a relationship where they can tell each other anything, and there seems to be a connection between him and Katniss. This gets sidelined due to the publicised love story of Peta and Katniss.<br /><br />This is a story that touches on so many of the social aspects that everyone seems to just glide over and brings them into the spotlight. Each part of the book is a subtle reference to the ills in our society today. The description of the districts gives us the stark difference between the haves and have-not in the world today. While people in the Capitol, without realising it, have too much of everything, those in the districts barely subsist from one day to the next. The broadcasting of the Games seems like a direct reference to the excess of reality shows on television today, and how they seem to pull in viewers and get them addicted to even the grossest and meanest of images. Katniss and her friend Gale are afraid of talking ill about the Capitol in their district and have to go into the jungle to vent their anger. This alludes to the growing Big Brother attitude of governments today, where everyone and everything seems to be tracked. There is a section of the story, where people in the Capitol regurgitate whatever they have eaten, so that they can stuff themselves some more. Not being satisfied ever, no matter what you have seems to be the mantra of today's materialistic world with no end to `the want for more' in sight.<br /><br />Although the build up to the Games seems to stretch out a bit, the Games are fast paced with not a single dull moment. I found myself holding my breath on a number of occasions to see what would happen next. The killings are not unnecessarily brutal, and the blood and gore which is there in the book seems necessary to get the message across. The description of scenes is beautiful and left me imagining them as happening right before my eyes.<br /><br />The book had a hold on me and I could not stop reading it, once the actual Games started. The story, though brutal left me rooting for the underdog and when, towards the end Katniss defies the Capitol, I was cheering for the humiliation this caused the Capitol. It has gotten me thinking of the direction our world is heading and whether it is something I endorse or oppose. For this I give the book 5 stars.alludes to the growing Big Brother attitude of governments today, where everyone and everything seems to be tracked.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|I grew up in the golden Steven Spielberg era of Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and Poltergeist.  If you have read a biography Mr. Spielberg you will find out the story is based on his childhood.  During his early teenage years he used a Super 8 camera(amateur 8mm celluloid film) along with his best friends to direct, edit, and produce his own short films -- almost all of which played only in the kids family rooms.  This is exactly what the film's protagonist does -- (except, of course for the derailment of a super secret military train).  Now it is the J.J. Abrams era (with Steven Spielberg producing).  This film is a four star film with an extra fifth star because of the Spielberg nostalgia.  This film also reminds me of Stand By Me (another masterpiece) because it truly captures the mind of a 13 year old perfectly.  Its like a fountain of youth.. only with scary monsters.  J.J. Abrams is the new Spielberg.  This film, along with 2009's Star Trek are at the top of my \\"watch over again\\" pile..

0060873027|3.0|I was, and am, a huge fan of Michael Crichton's work.  I never had very high expectations for this final novel, but that's no reflection on the choice of Richard Preston to complete the work.  In any case, for better or worse, Micro lived up to my tempered expectations.<br /><br />Like several of Crichton's earlier novels, Micro has a high concept hook.  Most nanotech companies fabricate on a nano scale, but Nanigen MicroTechnologies has developed revolutionary shrinking technology.  Not only can they reduce machines and robots, they can reduce living beings and then return them to full size.  I won't get into all the details of the novel's set-up, but seven graduate students learn about this technology the hard way once they become a threat to Nanigen's president.  Seven against one is much easier to manage when the seven (and one unlucky Nanigen employee) are half an inch tall.  Before they can be dispatched quickly, however, the students escape into Hawaii's verdant \\"micro world.\\"<br /><br />Crichton's strengths and weaknesses as a storyteller remain consistent.  His primary characters are more archetypes than individuals.  Rather than Rick, Erika, Amar, and Karen, these students quickly show themselves to be the Leader, the Warrior, the Know It All, the Weasel, and so forth.  Each has an assigned role to fulfill.  Some barely live long enough to become typecast, because the micro world is treacherous.  When you're half an inch tall, a beetle is not unlike a rhinoceros.  Luckily, these students are unusually well prepared to survive their hostile surroundings--or unusually well informed about the danger they're in--depending on how you look at it.  Among them there are experts in insects and arachnids, poisons and venoms, and the chemical defenses of plants and animals.<br /><br />Crichton is great about translating the wonder of science.  His amazing shrinking technology won't send me running to the textbooks this time around, but there's still plenty of gee whiz science to be enjoyed in Micro's pages.  More than that, he effectively shows the beauty as well as the horror of the situation his characters are in.  As for the horror, I have to admit that I found it especially disturbing this time out.  I have no special fear of dinosaurs, but I am absolutely phobic about spiders and insects.  There are scenes that I definitely could have done without reading, and if this is an issue for you as well, be forewarned.<br /><br />Much like Jurassic Park, Micro has a picaresque quality, with its protagonists leaping from one threat to another.  I hate to say it, but the plotting was pretty by the book.  There was a police procedural subplot that never really went anywhere, and true surprises were few and far between.  Despite this, I read the novel easily in a day (instead of saving it for my Thanksgiving flight like I was supposed to).  Once I started, I didn't want to stop reading, and the pages flew past swiftly.<br /><br />Preston appears to have done a good job finishing what Crichton left behind.  There is no feeling that this is the work of another author.  Still, I do find myself wondering how the novel would have differed had Crichton written it all.  Alas, we'll never know.  If you're a hard-core Crichton fan like me, by all means read this novel.  Just don't expect this final work to be the man's masterpiece.  And even if you're not a hard-core fan, if the premise sounds fun to you, you could do a lot worse for airplane reading.icro's pages.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|Easily the funniest movie that I saw this year, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil was screened at the DC Fright Fest.  Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine were both spot on as a pair of baffled country boys completely out of their depth and confused by the absurd situation that they found themselves in.  Katrina Bowden did a good job as the object of Labine's affections (it was nice to see her get a bit more dialogue to work with than you see out of 30 Rock), and the supporting cast performed admirably.  The writing deftly defuses what could easily be a chillingly frightening situation with an injection of perfectly toned comedy, especially in the dialogue exchanged by the title characters.  The fact that Piranha 3D got a wide release while this gem struggled still has me baffled.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Wow!, Wow!, Wow! That's my review of The Help, a novel by Kathryn Stockett. As a first novel, she has sure hit one out of the ballpark with this story. As a naive Yankee,with no first hand knowledge of life in the deep South in the early 60s, I found myself holding my breath through half of this book. I could smell the fear, feel the tension understand the dread of the brave maids and the woman who dared to help them tell thier stories!!.  Whew I feel as if I've just been on a roller coaster ride. This is an awesome story. Don't miss it.
B005UD1E2A|4.0|Terry Pratchett stakes his claim to being the funnyman of science fiction in the Color of Magic, book one in the Disc-world series.  He grabs you from the first page with his uncanny wit and his character's humorous banter and keeps you chuckling to the very end of the story.  You've likely seen similar characters from other books, television and movies but Pratchett takes the classic comedy duo and firmly plants them in a fantasy world that is over the top hilarious.<br /><br />Rincewind and Twoflower are Discworld's Costanza and Kramer with supporting characters who run the gambit of personalities.  You'll meet the brainless, brawny Hrun and the tenacious, terrifying luggage; that's right, a seemingly living piece of luggage with legs and an uncanny willingness toward violence.<br /><br />When you consider this entire world is literally a ginormous disc, supported by humungous elephants who reside on top of an astronomical space-travelling turtle then you'll be very comfortable knowing that the rules of magic and nature constantly fluctuate in Discworld.<br /><br />You'll join Rincewind, our comedy's straight-man, on his escape from the burning city of Ankh-Morpork (which coincidentally is burning partially because of his shenanigans) with his tourist-sidekick, Twoflower.  The story begins with the duo telling their story to a couple of heroes on the road out of town, launching you on a journey through some of Disc-worlds most perilous places populated by some cunningly funny people.<br /><br />Character growth, mixed with the multitude of laughable moments provides smiles from beginning to end.  Rincewind is layered like an onion; cowardly and almost indifferent in the beginning but certainly altered for the better as he learns the value of friendship.<br /><br />In protecting his clueless friend, Rincewind sets off a chain of events that leaves nothing but mischief and mayhem in their wake while the Gods twist and turn the tables our unlikely pair.  Rincewood and Twoflower narrowly escape horrendous perils at every turn rankling Fate and completely befuddling Death himself.<br /><br />Pay close attention to Pratchett's humorous pokes at our view of traditional fantasy, religion and social norms that lace neatly within the plot.  Color of Magic is easily a family read with enough mature comedy that adults will absolutely love this story's wit.  Pratchett thoroughly establishes a new world while maintaining a quick pace that will leave you wanting to jump right into the next novel.<br /><br />While I certainly found the story hilarious, some of the humor is quite British and therefore not to everyone's taste.  But  if you are a fan of the classic comedy duo and if you appreciate a good Monty Python skit then  you will absolutely love Terry Pratchett's Color of Magic; a solid four-star comedic fantasy tale.at every turn rankling Fate and completely befuddling Death himself.

B001DCQI8W|5.0|I've listened to this set about twice now over the last week and I am amazed at the sheer brilliance of Karajan when it comes to Bruckner. He is the ultimate Bruckmaestro. When I first started listening to Bruckner some 10 years ago I was put off by the constant repetitions, the starts & stops, the transitions, the relatively simplistic music (felt to me like that at that time) etc. Then I discovered Karajan's rendition of Bruckner's 8th with BPO. That changed things for me. Karajan made Bruckner so much more accessible to me. I then listened to Karajan's Bruckner-7th and liked it within the 3rd hearing. From there on, my Bruckner collection started growing with Karajan's reading of Bruckner. I very deeply feel that there is no conductor who owns Bruckner's symphonies 7, 8 and 9 like Karajan does.   The 9th is a symphony I came to quite late. Why are the 5th, 7th and 8th more popular symphonies out of Bruckner's symphonic output? I feel that the 9th is the jewel of them all. It is the pinnacle of Bruckner's compositional achievement, the manifestation of years of Bruckner's acquired unique compositional technique. Karajan's rendition shines like a giant in the 9th. This symphony (left incomplete by Bruckner) even with it's three movements is like an epic. If Wagner's ring and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings are epics, this symphony with just it's three movements invokes a deep emotional response in me. This symphony under Karajan is majestic. I feel I am listening to Wagnerian operatic music. Karajan conducts the 9th with a measured tempo where you can feel this brilliant beast of a symphony's beating heart. The 9th symphony is like a massive towering gothic structure or a massive cathedral in my mind's eye. Karajan brings this massive structure to such an acoustic manifestation, it just blows my mind. I compared Karajan's 9th with Guilini's 9th, Karajan's shines through. Karajan extracts such a rumble from the orchestra, the brass blasts out, the basses groan and rumble, the tempo just right, the orchestral weight heavy and thick. The 9th by Karajan feels like a bark of a 1000 year old tree, massive giant, majestic, powerful.   With my purchase of this CD set - the 1st, 3rd and 9th were new to me. I was listening to them for the first time. Why aren't the 1st and 3rd more popular? I found the 1st to be a gem. You can see traces of Bruckner's style-to-be although faint. It is more springy, has the impression of being lighter but when you listen to it, you realize it isn't a light work at all. I believe Wagner was sent Symphony 2 and 3 and Bruckner asked Wagner to decide which he preferred to be dedicated to him. Wagner chose the 3rd. It is easy to see why; it is just a brilliant work with homage paid to Wagner's music. There is no bummer on this set. Only Karajan's Bruckner-6 did not wow-shock me. I also think Wand's Bruckner-5 is better than Karajan's rendition. That being said this is a magnificent set to own. If you are Bruckner fan, just go for this one. You need this set in your Bruckner CD shelf. You cannot do without this. This is the set every Bruckner cycle should be/will be/was being/is being judged against.   PS: I love Karajan's Bruckner but recently heard Wand's Bruckner - Symphony 5. I must say Wand is a wonderful Bruckner interpreter. Wand conducts Bruckner's score literally, with no embellishments & with clean straight lines. I am torn between Wand and Karajan. Who is my ultimate Bruckner conductor? I need to listen to more Wand. Is there only one ultimate way to play Bruckner or are there mulitple pathways to Bruckner Bliss?
B005UKJX4E|5.0|I read some reviews before seeing this movie along with watching several trailers. I had no idea the depth of brilliance this visual and audible ride would take me. It was deeply touching and intimate. I cried through some of the scenes (yes, I'm a grown man) and left the theater in an overwhelming 'awe' unlike any other movie experience of my entire life. This movie, to me personally, is a MASTERPIECE of film making that has set a new standard of poetic genius. Now, with that, I will say, this movie is NOT for a vast audience of people to enjoy. Many people have bad reviews and I can understand why. If I had seen this in my early 20's, I most likely would have walked out or complained how lame it was. Being older in my late 30's with some \\"life experiences\\" under my belt, I was mesmerized and humbled beyond anything I've ever experienced from a film. I'm also thankful that I had a select few of my more intellectual friends to view this movie with and we talked for hours about the film afterwards. Even days after, we were still discussing various scenes and situations of this movie. To me, that is a wonderful gift from a director. I can't wait to watch this again with the director's commentary. From a Biological/Cosmic/Psychological/Philosophical and Intellectual standpoint, this film is a MASTERPIECE.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I read a few Stephen King books when I was in junior high and high school (IT, The Stand, and Eyes of the Dragon). I also read 'The Dome' last year. That is the extent of my experience with Stephen King. Each of those books were books that I had a hard time putting down, and when they concluded I had wished that there was somehow more to the story so I could remain in the world that King had woven. When I picked up 11/22/63 I was intrigued by the idea of changing the past, and the JFK assassination. 11/22/63 uses the JFK assassination as the catalyst to bring the main character to 1958-1963 through a time portal, but the beauty of the book was following George (Jake) live his life in Derry, ME and Jodie, TX during those years. The details that King was able to share made me feel like I was there as well. I love when an author can truly pull you into their world and Stephen King does a masterful job in doing this. I found myself enjoying George (Jake's) life in the past far more than the mission to save JFK.<br /><br />The details of Oswald's life were interesting, yet I found myself wanting the story to get back to Jodie, TX. In some ways this is also how our main character felt, so the parts were I felt like the details were feeling like they were too much actually helped me to connect more with George (Jake).<br /><br />I also felt like a time traveler myself when George (Jake) meets two characters in Derry, ME from Kings previous book 'It'. Since I read 'It' over 15 years ago, it was a powerful moment when I realized that Derry was where all of that took place, and that Bevie and Richie were with me once again.<br /><br />Stephen King also does a masterful job with the end of the book. An ending I wasn't prepared for and would have never suspected. The ending is powerful and satisfying.<br /><br />I finished this book last night and then realized it was 11/22/11, 48 years after the JFK assassination.
B004MQ9W4I|5.0|I have to say, this was better than the first and I thought for sure it would be predictable (which in some respects it is) but if a horror movie can make me jump three times, then I like it. This was excellent in that respect. There were some scenes that gave me goose bumps or toward the end just totally freaked me out. It was just the right recipe of low budget but still kept a level of some believable moments. I've seen a lot of horror movies over the last thirty years so not much can truly scare me. I sit and laugh through the exorcist films. This movie was different... it actually scared me. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Odd enough, as low budget as it is, I have to admit it's a fantastic concept with a great scare reaction for the vast target audience. Who ever put these series together has a brilliant and effective ROI. This movie hits the mark.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|After seeing the movie, which I also thought was awesome, I decided that I was going to get the soundtrack. I really like orchestral soundtracks, and I currently own quite a few soundtracks including some of the Harry Potter soundtracks, Chronicles of Narnia, Gladiator, Phantom of the Opera, Twilight, Moulin Rouge, Aladdin, Star Wars, Beauty and the Beast... well you get the point. This soundtrack is by far my most favorite soundtrack. Itis a good thing you cannot wear out mp3 files, because I probably would have by now. My favorite on the sountrack is \\"Forbidden Friendship\\". C. Manson, the ONLY reason I would buy a soundtrack is if I had seen the film first, because as you stated, there really isn't a point otherwise. Also, the entire soundtrack is \\"Celtic\\" sounding. I am sure they did this on purpose due to the Vikings in the film.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|When I purchased Adele 21, I didn't know what to expect beyond Rolling in the Deep.  But the more I listened, the more I liked everything about this album... and every song.  Adele doesn't disappoint.  She leaves you wanting to hear more, over and over again, of her powerful, soulful vocals.  I loved it.
B005V20JKI|4.0|ok its not ice cream. its poop, and its awesome. this may be the best game i have played on android ever. its hilarious and addicting. maybe im just hooked because i just had dreams of unicorns and dragons fighting a war; both of which are in this game.   I only gave it a four star because it is making my T-mobile G2 beg for mercy. Guess its time for an upgrade.
0143118706|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has done it again:  within the pages of her book, Committed, she has shared an astonishingly revealing glimpse into her though process and her personal experiences.  Although some portions of this book do read like a college term paper written by a women's studies major, most of the book zips along like a gossipy conversation with a very chatty acquaintance.  Gilbert doesn't seem to mind sharing some very revealing conversations that she has had with her close friends and relatives and that makes her books very juicy reads.  This book certainly didn't change the way I perceive the institution of marriage, but I really enjoyed reading about Gilbert's thought process as she worked to come to terms with her divorce and subsequent remarriage.
140131046X|5.0|If you have read other Mitch Albom classics like Tuesdays with Morrie or The Five People You Meet in Heaven then Have a Little Faith needs to be next on your list.  Typical for Albom, Have a Little Faith is inspirational, uplifting, and real.  It is another narrative on approaching death and dealing with reflection, trust, and ultimately faith.    Even though this is longer than his other books, I flew through it just because I was so intrigued.  It's another story that makes you feel for the characters and reflect on your daily interactions.  It's pleasant and enjoyable; it will prompt you to reevaluate how to approach challenges you are facing and how you perceive those around you.    This book follows Albom as he becomes familiar with a Rabbi from his youth because he has requested Albom to write his eulogy.  You will also read about Henry, an inner city pastor, whom Albom has difficulty trusting at first due to Henry's sketchy past.  You will also see Albom learn from these men and change his perspective as he discovers that people can change and that life has interesting and unexplainable twists.  He learns life is truly fragile.   I felt this was a light read; I was able to read through and enjoy the story with less emphasis on the religion and more on the individuals.  It wasn't until after I would put the book down that I was engaged in deep thought; it is a thought provoking and heart touching narrative.    Every page has a line that is quotable, something that can be read out of the context of the story and can be used as an uplift or motivator.  One of my favorite was, \\"And is often the case with faith, I thought I was being asked a favor, when in fact I was being given one.\\"   I'd highly recommend it to anyone seeking to soften their heart, be uplifted, or to further their understanding and faith of those around us.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I just received this case yesterday for the new kindle. I like it but not in love with it. I cant really rely on its stand since its too flimsy. Got this for my daugthers new kindle but i definitely will not be getting it for myself. I expected better.
0525423656|3.0|I had been given Matched as a gift and really found the YA dystopian love story interesting having read it in one day. I really enjoyed the set-up of the characters and society - though the \\"I will give up my whole life for the boy/man I love\\" line was a bit tired, a la Twilight. What I did enjoy in Crossed is that Cassia found strength in herself and wants to be part of the movement for own own reasons and not just for Ky. What I did not enjoy is that this book had gotten the Michael Bay Transformers 2 treatment - I felt like all of it was running. I think better editing could have gotten the self-discovery aspect summed up in half the book and left the other half to focus in on Xander and what is currently going on in the Society.
0374532281|5.0|I read this book in a day just after my daughter unexpectedly found herself in the middle of the filming of this novel-made-movie in Center City Philadelphia (an extra with hopefully some extras face time!).  With De Nero and Bradley Cooper center stage, the movie, I'm certain, will be a winner. The book? Well, I loved it and could not put it down until I finished it, which I paid for dearly Monday at work. I rooted for Pat Peoples as he struggled with facing reality, and finds help with his struggles in the most unlikely places. I loved the forming of new and  enduring alliances, especially when others who should be counted on, can't be. With a little inside knowledge, I think I know where the movie may depart from the book in at least some aspects, but I must say that with the latter, the writing is simple, honest and true.  I thought often, \\"This is how people talk to themseveles inside their heads, whether they admit to it or not.\\" For me, it took the stigma out of mental illness. And as a local author who's lived, worked and based all of my writing here in the Philly area, it won my favor instantly and never disappointed along the ride as the writing skillfully balanced humor, love, irrational thinking and hometown passion in a way that we can all relate to.  Congrats, Mr. Quick, on your successful debut .
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I was looking for the last year or more for a good controller for FPS games on my PS3, having come over from PC gaming... tried the FragFX controller and found it to be too awkward and very jerky in it's interface.   This interface however allows me to use my existing gaming mouse and keyboard and custom program the controlls to suit me. The interface is prety smooth and precise. The issue I found with it is that I have to increase the DPI on the mouse to compensate for it being a bit sluggish at the start. Once I increase the DPI however the controlls are flawless, feels exactly like id did playing on PC. The fact that the controls are wired also makes it a bit cumbersome but it's worth it.  Another issue is that there is a limited number of compatible keyboards. I was lucky enough to be able to use my G5 gaming mouse but had to buy a new keyboard since my G15 was not compatible.  Overall I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to be able to use their mouse and keyboard on a console.
B0067AKZHU|5.0|I've listened to \\"Break The Spell\\" through a few times now, and I liked it the first time, which is rare for me.  Usually, I have to listen to a CD a few times before I start to like it.  If you have enjoyed any of Daughtry's prior work, you will be pleased with their effort here as well.  As others have said, they \\"played it safe\\" and remained in their comfort zone of creating a slew of radio-friendly songs.  I don't think that this is always a bad thing.  Some bands have tried new things and in the process have driven away a large portion of their fan base.  If you're old enough to remember when Mariah Carey decided to abandon her comfort zone where before she was putting out hit after hit and after, not so much, you'll know what I'm talking about.  I preordered this CD without having heard any songs from it and I'm glad I did.  Daughtry remains on my \\"buy immediately\\" list.
0307891372|5.0|626 pages of very helpful information. I own all the TES guides and this was a beautiful addition, even including warnings for spoilers. Brings a map that has every location plotted and named. Great book, perfectly written, good buy.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I looked forward to learning more about Jobs and what made his creative mind tick. While I learned much about Jobs, I could have done so without having to read over and over the same statements concerning Jobs. The book was repetitious.<br /><br />What I found most interesting was how Jobs, who was very religious, and spent time visiting areas of faith seemed to never put into practice what he learned when dealing with people. He did put into practice those same teachings when it came to building and design. Perhaps he was a bit on the autistic spectrum that was never diagnosed. We will never know.<br /><br />Overall, this would have been a better book, if it had been better edited.<br /><br />Recommend with the caveats given.
1451627289|1.0|Or perhaps he's grown lazy. It doesn't matter which, b/c both yield the same result: a dull brick of a boring book that's about 400 pages pages longer than it needs to be.<br /><br />Look, it's no secret, King has produced some awful clunkers recently. But we, his old fans, still dared hope. No longer. He has retained the worst of his signature tropes - the wordiness, the repetition, the dumb societal commentary - but lost the best of them - the sharp characterizations, the explosive talk, the driving pace, the neat plotting. The book's a snorer. Chapters go by and nothing happens; it reads like a diary, like a school composition titled, \\"What I did on my Time-travel Vacation.\\" The wooden time-traveler from 2011 clumps about in a paper cut-out 50s and dispenses his enlightened views from the future to bloodless caricatures of 50s people, many of whom seem borrowed from some other King novel. Many of the enlightened views concern racism, which King finds it necessary to mention over and over again, as if we don't know already that Stephen and everyone else is against racism. Yes, Steve, we know, we know! You can stop now. And none of this stuff emerges organically from the story; it's all exposition, the time-traveler talking to his diary. Just impossibly boring.<br /><br />(Don't even get me started on the sloppiness of the time-travel premise. What a joke.)<br /><br />A caveat: My review covers the first half of the book, after which I gave up and closed it. Life is too short to waste on such trash. Maybe the second half is better, but I wouldn't count on it.
1609611543|4.0|I recently gave up wheat in an attempt to reduce inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis. The results have been very good, so I decided to read some of the literature. This book presents many of the arguments against wheat. I thought those were handled well, although maybe they were a bit verbose. The analogies from pop culture were pretty, uh, interesting.  The only thing I didn't like about the book was the diet section. It seems like a bolted on afterthought.
B005V20JKI|4.0|I really enjoy this game! There are a few characters I wish I didn't have, but for the most part this game is great! I really enjoy unlocking the characters and leveling them up, it really keeps this game interesting!
B00170GXYO|1.0|I have a brand new laptop that I downloaded this too and the copy was horrid. Blurry, bad coloring, just like an old VHS. I didn't expect that. I thought it would be an upgraded HD version.

B000P46QTA|5.0|Others have captured my opinion of this film already.  It is my favorite film largely because of its heroic, virtuous characters and fantastic edge-of-your-seat storyline.  Inspiring and timely.  I love, love, love this film.
B005V20JKI|1.0|receiving information about recently ran tasks and getting a thumb nail preview of those tasks etc. is just unacceptable, this is data mining at its finest, so if the last task I ran was an app that has a credit card purchase option, this app can allow the developer to receive not only what I entered into previously ran apps but get a picture of the app or the credit card number that I typed into that app, or if the last app I ran was my camera app the developer can get thumb nails of the pictures I recently took etc.. the possibilities of what the app could send to the developer is endless and until that permission is removed from this app my 1 star review will stay here. I have developed a few simple apps for my phone and tablet and this permission is completely rediculous, I made a simple flip style card matching game for my son and installed the app with this permission onto my girlfriends phone and was able to see all her calls, messages, browsing history, and just about anything else she did on her phone including purchases and log ins.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Fear not--although \\"Margin Call\\" focuses on events that precipitated the current economic meltdown, this movie is NOT about economics or arcane government policies. A knowledge of mortgage-backed securities is not required in order for you to enjoy this movie, If, however, you enjoy compelling performances in a tightly-paced, intelligently written and emotionally powerful movie, you'll enjoy this film.  An especially intriguing aspect of this movie is that it remains keenly focused on the three classical Aristotelian unities of drama: unity of action (the story remains centered on the imminent demise of the American economy), unity of place (the vast majority of the action occurs within one firm's corporate office), and unity of time (all of the action takes place in one 24-hour period.). The film's crowning achievement is its ability to depict the human drama, anxiety, and uncertainty that led to and resulted from the economic mess we're all coping with today. \\"Margin Call\\" belongs to a very rare genre--the economic thriller--and it succeeds mainly due to its brilliant script (by writer/director J.C. Chandor) and the mesmerizing performances of Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, Jeremy Irons, and Penn Badgley. This is good stuff.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Fun way to kill some time. Like that you have to think it through not rush through it. Don't like that the hint shows you the whole solution. Would prefer a move or two at a time, but not necessarily limited to once a day. A little slow to start up.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Thank you. This is much better than the free mahjong game I tried first! I even liked the tutorial. Very worthwhile both the expense and the time.  Thanks again.
B003Y5H53S|3.0|First of all, this IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE! It is ful of cussing, and jokes about sex. Don't allow your children to view this film... but on the other hand, it is pretty entertaining for adults. It is really funny and i liked it. I guess it all depends on your taste though, so decide for yourself. Good Luck :)
B005V20JKI|5.0|The permissions you fear are needed and not excessive. The one in question is \\"READ PHONE STATE\\" in other words it allows the app to know what state you're phone is in so it can pause properly. The other permissions are normal too. SD card access, internet access, prevent phone from sleeping...pretty normal stuff. Take off your tinfoil hats and enjoy a fun and unique game.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|First played it on Iphone.  Its fun but not worth the cost or the hype. I expect more from a game. Once you played it for about a week.. you dont play it again.  It has very little replay value. Its prolly not worth the space on your phone.
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|Okay, first off, if you like (or like me, love) Hawaiian music, this is a wonderful album. If Hawaiian music (meaning slack key guitars and vocals in Hawaiian) than, frankly, this is not for you. While many soundtrack CDs are of the instrumental score, this one is contains 8 vocals and other instrumentals by some of Hawaii's best-known artists and some earlier recordings. (Note that the subtitle to the CD is \\"Music from the Motion Picture\\".  Most are current - I've reviewed Keola Beamer's CDs in the past) but there's also a nod to the past with a track by Sol Hoopi's Novelty Trio from the 1920s.<br /><br />I haven't seen the film yet - it's on my \\"to see\\" list so I don't know how these songs are integrated into the film.<br /><br />But, again, this is a really nice sampler of Hawaiian vocal recordings.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

B000002I25|5.0|\\"The Doors\\" #2 (1967).<br />The Doors were formed in Southern California in 1965, by Jim Morrison b.1943, Ray Manzarek b.1939, John Densmore b.1945 and Robbie Krieger b. 1946.  On their first album, this psychedelic-blues band teamed up with 32 year old producer Paul Rothchild and made one of the great rock debuts.  The opening tune \\"Break On Through\\" #40 is still a tremendous song 44 years later, a song about the experience of drug taking, a failed single in 1967, but still gets plenty of spins today.  They do a version of Willie Dixon's \\"Back Door Man\\", everyone knows their #1 hit \\"Light My Fire\\", but the interplay between Krieger and Manzarek still haunts today.  \\"Soul Kitchen\\", is a stomping time, \\"The Crystal Ship\\", is as spacey as it comes, love Densmore drums on this one, Morrison's vocals were elegant.  \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\", is still a stunner, good rocker.  \\"Alabama Song(Whiskey Bar)\\", written by Bertoit Brecht and Kurt Weill is the Doors at their most lightest and fun, good drinking song.  \\"End Of The Night\\", mysterious and has a nice Robbie Krieger guitar.  \\"Take It As It Comes\\", is a snappy little number, which doesn't get much respect.  \\"I Looked At You\\", is a nice little beat piece.  The album closes with \\"The End\\", a 11 1/2 minute piece of pure hell for a family.  Great album, they would never recapture this sound, but came close on a couple albums in the early 70's.  R.I.P. Ray Manzarek who passed away May 20, 2013.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|its the best app I ever use. service is great. I use it every day for something. logging data, saving articles, clipping images, and more.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|This was the best \\"alien\\" movie I've seen in a long time.  It was well written, directed, and acted. This movie is definitely worth watching if you like this genre.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|A coming of age story taking place in the mental ward of a hospital?<br /><br />Sign me up!<br /><br />Channel surfing rarely--too rarely--stumbles upon a gem that gleams like an opal in the deep.  IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY fits that mold; it is the bittersweet story of 16-year-old Craig (Keir Gilchrist, who nails this role), an insecure and depressed youth feeling not only teenage angst, but (self-induced) insurmountable pressures resulting in suicidal tendencies.  As the film begins Craig checks himself into a psychiatric ward--only to promptly harbor second feelings, as his fellow patients are. . .nuts.  Alas, Craig must stay a minimum of five days for evaluation--five days that turn out to be a defining and transformative transition in his young life.  Through Gilchrist's performance, Craig's insecure, yet tongue-in-cheek outlook on life can yield at any moment to Walter Mitty-esque fantasies; it's a point of view that's completely heartening and charming.<br /><br />Gilchrist is surrounded by a stellar supporting cast, headed by the outside-the-box Zach Galifianakis as Bobby, the astute psych ward veteran who takes Craig under his arm and becomes a dysfunctional mentor.  Yes, Galifianakis is funny, yet he also brings a poignant and compelling dimension to his role--augmented by his character's concern that Craig not follow in his problematic footsteps.  Emma Roberts gives an impressive performance as Noelle, another suicidal teen in the ward who becomes not only a friend, but a budding romantic interest.  IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY simultaneously makes you laugh as it puts a lump in your throat; this gem should not be ignored.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|Okay, we don't have the 1980's brooding hulk version.  What we do have is a mid-20's adventuring Conan.  Part-thief, part-warrior, this was a wonderfully fun movie that should be seen.  Mamoa is charismatic enough to carry the movie.  Completely over-the-top and un-yielding for most movie fans, but grab some popcorn and enjoy if you can separate the original and this version.  This is the Saturday-morning, little-brother version of Milius' classic.  Much better than the ultra-silly Conan the Destroyer.
B005V20JKI|1.0|it just freezes my phone every time I opened it. I have to re boot my HTC by taking out the battery.
B005V20JKI|2.0|I don't know if its my phone or the game but the controls suck. can't push 2 buttons at once with on screen or using hardware keyboard.  droid 2
0446573019|4.0|This is the first book by David Baldacci that I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The John Puller of Zero Day has been compared to Lee Child's Jack Reacher whom I adore.  I do see the similarities but as far as I'm concerned you can never have too much Jack Reacher!<br /><br />Good story, lots of action, lots of twists and turns.  Great read that I highly recommend.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I wanted a lightweight, unobtrusive case, with a front flap that folds nicely behind for reading. This case fits the bill perfectly. It's made out of non-slippery rubber-like material.
B005XG8V2A|5.0|Seriously this album is amazing! Anybody that loves Jeff buckley, Fiona Apple and Florence + the Machine can appreciate this Album. I can enthusiastically recommend this as a wonderful gift for yourself or to another music lover... Good stuff. Bible that!
B005PTQPU0|5.0|Here she is again.  After such a long wait again, Kate bush, has an album of all new material, bound to confound even some of her fans.  I've been listening and watching her for 35 years and I can accept anything she does as a new phase of her.  It's  music to meditate and dream of Kate by.   The critics can be ridiculous and harsh.  So what.  This album, gives me goose bumps.  50 Words for Kate  Beautiful, genius, masterpiece, brilliant, moody, enveloping, cosmic, mystical, meditative, yogic, absorbed, Katejazz, incredible, delicious, still sexy, real, enlightening, enthogenic, clever, wonderful, merciful, loving, objective, harrowing, blizzard, nirvanic, psychedelic, ruminous, numinous,  provocative, secluded, visual, magical, samadhi,  iconoclastic, bizarre, gushing, meandering, unpretentious, raw, unnerving, gorgeous, sweeping, hermetic, alchemical, vast, leaping, alien, mind-boggling, visionary,
B000023X9W|4.0|Silver & Gold (2000) is another folk album that doesn't disappoint. I expected the same relaxing stuff that Harvest Moon or Comes a Time provided, and got just that. The album starts off with GOOD TO SEE YOU, which is a somewhat upbeat song that sounds a little like something off After the Gold Rush. My personal favorite is THE GREAT DIVIDE, as this song is very relaxing and smooth. Once again, Neil sings about the world around him, as well as important people that he's met. What I like most about this artist is that he's not afraid to step out of the box for an album and go back to his roots, even when people are listening to other genres. Neil is known as the 'Godfather of Grunge', but will still make music that is nothing like it. I recommend this album for people who want a break from Crazy Horse (who by the way are awesome) and want some easy listening before going back to them.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|this takes me back to a more innocent time in my life where things were easy and simple.  thank you for this game...
B005HSG3U6|2.0|This is a nice sturdy protective case, but the fold in the cover leaves a crease line on the screen.  Also it is such a tight fit you need to use a tool to pry the Fire out of the case.  I would not buy again, but would buy something that had a smooth cover for the screen
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|They may as well not say that there is a digital copy.  1. You don't get a copy.  2. You have to install an app and create two different accounts on some random website.  3. Even then it only streams.  Serious ripoff.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Was searching for Celtic music since spending time in Ireland.  I wanted music that covered the joy and spirituality, the mystic and modern, all that is today's Ireland.  This CD is all that and more.  Have ordered a second one for a fellow traveler.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I think this album is much better than their previous release. Much more like their work before Dark Horse. I like almost every song on this album.
B002RL7W9W|5.0|I gave this to my nephew for his 6th birthday.  My family said that he was so focused on creating it, that he didn't even want to watch TV.  He was so excited about receiving it, and his determination and hard work did not go unrecognized.
1853262390|4.0|We had to read \\"To the Lighthouse\\" in high school, and based on that book, I thought Virginia Woolf was a chore. I still hate \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" But \\"Orlando\\" is fun, carefree, and witty. I recommend it to anyone who thinks that Woolf is impossible.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|I don't understand where all the bad reviews are coming from. As the director and Robert E. Howard described; Conan is like a panther. He's not the muscle bound Arnold Swartzenegger version from the 80's. The movies borrow from the best of the Howard mythology. Ron Pearlman was ideal to portray Conan's father. The action was very brutal; however it was just like it was described in the actual source material. The dark fantasy aspect of the movie blends more reality than expected. Moma as Conan was perfect for the role. He moved just like the character did in the Marvel Comics version. The interviews with Roy Thomas from Marvel demonstrated how unknown the character was to the general public in 1970. If you saw any of the Frank Frazetta book covers or John Buscema Conan comics; you would see Moma did the research. The producers and Moma himself are all fans of the original books and it appears on the screen. Arnold's portrayal shouldn't be the template.
B005V20JKI|1.0|The character starts jumping and moving on its own. It runs me into objects and just jumps repeatedly. DROID X.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|What more can I say about this movie, it sets the standard for 3D movies and many tried to do the same but failed.. The storyline I would give it a 8.5/10. The characters played their part well especially Sam Worthington. If you haven't watched it yet, go do it now..
B005V20JKI|5.0|This game is really fun! The graphics are really nice and the music/sounds are entertaining. Not sure why some kindle fire owner are complaining about it not work because it works just fine on mine :)
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Watched on the Amazon Instant Video Program using my Blackberry Playbook very nice they work flawlessly together.<br />Pretty Interesting movie if you are into style martial arts, not much talking just lots of action. I wish amazon would give the choice between language like English version or Cantonese Version Audios that would be kinda nice.
0553807919|4.0|I am probably the wrong person to be writing this review - I know too much about brain science, but am not expecting to be a father for another year or two.  That said, I have enjoyed this book.  Brain science is reduced to a few glosses - left brain logical, right brain emotional, 'upstairs' brain thoughtful, 'downstairs' brain driven by primitive drives - and applied to a variety of authoritative, non-authoritarian, emotionally reponsive child-rearing techniques.    I think this is useful for someone who wants to do right by their kids and know why what they're doing is right.  But I'm not sure it's really valid neuroscience.  It's more \\"pop-sci\\" applied in a thin veneer to child-rearing techniques that grew, not out of the field of brain research, but out of the fields of interpersonal and behavioral psychology, which have a far more empiric basis.  Be that as it may, the book's format is simple and enlightening.  Plenty of case studies are presented, with examples of how a parent might resolve a behavior problem right at the moment it occurs, by coming up with a creative, brain-based solution.  The book gives a lot of schemas and rubrics for becoming the kind of parent that I, for one, am hoping to be; and I am glad I read it.
B004SDEP38|1.0|Supposedly, this was the $14.99 fully functional free app of the day, however, its really a crippled free app of the day that is ad based and view only. You still have to pay to create new docs and other basic functionalty like searching. Totally useless. Removing this and the bait and switch app along with the amazon app store.
B005L3HJ8M|2.0|i like the music on this LP but i am dumbfounded as to why the music industry purposely makes the music they produce sound inferior. it is the only business that goes out of it's way to do so. why do they do this? movies have a set standard volume, so does tv, dvd and bluray. this 2 channel stereo vinyl record has no dynamic range and even worse is heavily distorted through out(you-tube audio quality). i don't get it. it sounds like it had potential to sound really good and for some reason the volume was cranked well into clipping. not to mention the bass is so loud i have to turn my sub woofer off - i have over 600lp's and this is the only record i have to do this to.     it sounds to me like the mastering on the record was ok - but the audio files they had to master from is where the problem is, so that being said i can only suspect the CD and itunes must sound even worse than this.
