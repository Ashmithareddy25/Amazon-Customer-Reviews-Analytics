B0050DIWFC|5.0|Outstanding - powerful and keeps you guessing.  This story stayed on my mind for a week after I finished it.
0811876373|5.0|The book contains beautiful pictures. As I live in Europe, it might be difficult to get all the ingredients that are listed in the book. However, I really look forward to try the different recipes. The instructions are very easy to understand. Five stars!
0618918248|4.0|This book is a great introduction to atheistic ideas and issues that the non-religious have with religion, but if you are already an atheist or non-believer and you are already involved in these issues, it simply repeats things you already know.  As such, I didn't learn anything new from the book, and that made it only mildly entertaining.<br /><br />I give it four stars because as an intro book, I'd give it five, but as a book for a seasoned atheists, I'd give it three.
B0086700CM|2.0|This is a OK game but after awhile it gets lame. But it is free so it wont hurt to try it.
B0043UCWQ8|5.0|Big fan of Spartacus.  All three seasons.  The story is very appealing to men and women.  No go for kids under 18.  Violent, Gore, Nudity yet very cool.<br />Story telling is realistic (sorry Rambo, your fake lol).<br />What is nice about this show is how it's produced to display slavery, hardship, the true life of a gladiator.  Yes its violent, but as gladiator games existed at that time this show shows where gladiator came from, how they turned into a gladiator and their purpose.<br />I would recommend starting from the very beginning and finish all three seasons. Can't wait for season 4!

B005MVJM3I|5.0|I was NOT a Machine Head fan prior to this release. I loved their version of the Iron Maiden cover for Hallowed Be Thy Name but was not able to get into anything else by them. Then I heard Darkness Within on SiriusXm and decided to give the album a try. No regrets!! This album is unbelievable from start to finish. The solos are amazing, the guitar tone is classic metal, vocals are incredible. I can't say enough good about this disc.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A must read! Best written books! Can't help but fall in love with the characters! It's not just erotica, it's passionate, a love story, suspenseful, dramatic! Simply perfect!

0142418218|5.0|\\"So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,<br />Go throw your TV set away,<br />And in its place you can install<br />A lovely bookshelf on the wall.\\"--Roald Dahl, '···Chocolate. Factory'<br /><br />Watching the movie companion, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' at about the age of eight, I felt I just was given my cinematic experience equivalent to my generation's 'The Wizard of Oz'.<br /><br />Now past forty, I am still enchanted by the same movie, but it has taken me this long to take the above advice from the Oompah Loomphs given about Mike Teavee who held my closest vice.<br /><br />So enthralled was I to own and see this classic gem, that I had to take the joyride in reverse:  And now, finally, I have actually read Dahl's children's novel and seen for myself what it is like to take my own advice to this generation so attached to gadgets:  Reading does, indeed, exercise the mind's muscles, exerting the VCR of one's imagination.<br /><br />Yes, there are plenty of differences between the book and the movie, and while I'll never know what it would have been like to read the book before the movie as a kid, I at least have been able to save some literary enjoyment that can extend childhood into my middle years.<br /><br />Both the book and the movie are a juvenile extention of Dante, 'The Purgatorio'--that is, but without its grimness or some of the sterness of Hilaire Beloc, whose moral lessons in rhyme resemble only his in structure--rather than whimsey.<br /><br />Whatever stage of childhood you may be in, even if it is rediscovery, it is never too late to read 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' and for all it's mindport, now's as good a time as any.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Very durable and helpful box-keeps everything in one place for convenience and can be carried from one room to another..
B0084IG7KC|2.0|Phenomenal box office opening and hype and then you have it: an overlong, boring, no-climax and compromising movie. And do they really need a triangle love story in every movie? The shaky camera was totally annoying and unnecessary. The only redeeming quality was Wes Bently and his beard.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!  This is like the only game I play.  I lags every so often but additive! Don't listen to the Temple Run haters! :P
B004I744AS|5.0|Although it lacks suggestions when looking for words when you're unsure of the spelliing, I find it quite useful.  Plus, it's free. The home page has games that challenge the mind, improve vocabulary, and articles that are interesting. I highly recommend this app.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm reading the book and I can easily see the novelity in it. I'm a Beauty book fan, written by Anne Rice under a pseudo name in 1984,84,85. I'm not a Shades of Grey fan, however it is entertaining. I actually skim over the sex scenes, they rather bore me, but I do see the unlying mystery of Christian and his past. I am more attracted to the mystery than the sex.<br /><br />Just a note, Colette Bennett Special to CNN, wrote, \\" young, inexperienced woman and an older man...\\" Do not listen to her. Anastasia is 22 yrs old and Christian is 27 yrs old. The story is NOT about a young woman and an older man, it is about a inexperience woman and an experienced man and their personal and sexual relationship. Period.

B007OWG3LM|5.0|This album is one that is to be listened to many times to get the full effect. It is missing the crescendos (for the most part) of their previous albums, but it is in no way boring. A very rewarding experience and an album I'll be coming back to time and time again for a long time.
B0044RUSZM|1.0|If I could give this product a 0, I would.  Despite having read the other negative reviews, I decided to purchase this stand for my husband (from our kids) for father's day.<br /><br />As the other reviewers indicated, there is now two small plastic clips that are supposed to hold the laptop in place.  However, the clips wiggle around and I can see them eventually coming loose and falling off.  This would leave the laptop vulnerable as the rubber slip pads are not enough to keep a heavy 15\\" MBP from falling off.<br /><br />Second, the base is connected to the two legs, but only by sliding in.  There is NO way to keep the legs in the base that holds them, so the entire unit wobbles!<br /><br />Unwilling to take the risk with an expensive computer, we've returned the item and will be buying the logitech lap stand.  I'd rather pay more for peace of mind and a solid product.<br /><br />Buyer beware!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|wow<br />this game is freaking awesome best yet on my kindle . I wish I had more friends to play with though
006197806X|5.0|Pandemonium was not what I expected. It has a completely different pace/tone than Delirium but I absolutely loved it and I enjoyed this book more than the first one. The first story, for me, was more about discovery while the second book is about survival. The story is heartbreaking and touching. I was completely on the same emotional journey Lena was on and the plot twist at the end is a sucker punch. Even if I did somewhat see it coming. I am very excited/nervous/anxious to see where Lauren Oliver will take the final book.
B0058X67OM|5.0|ELP is one of prog rocks ginormous bands that contributed a unique fusion sound of classical symphony and progressive rock's pompous epic lyrical music. This 5 cd collection reflect that evolution of the ELP sound. It documents the career span of the 3 members from their early days to their last album. This contains a nice booklet complete with archival photos, stories from each member as they relate their involvement with the band particularly on the album, the songs and the tours. In terms of cost for 5 cds at less than 20 dollars this is a good buy. Compatibility 5 cds crammed in a pocket book size is really a struggle getting the cds out and putting them in place without dislodging them is really a pain but this is part of cost cutting not to make it expensive. Content is acceptable since it comprehensively and concisely cover the bands output from their early beginnings to the last album however only one track were derived from each latter albums. You do get scattered all over the cds- alternate versions, singles, b and a sides, radio mix, live versions of some of ELP's popular songs. The last treat here is the Live Mar y Sol in its entirety. If you are an ardent collector who is a building a library of every sound that ELP made then this album is for you. If you are just a music collector and would not like to buy the entire collection this is a good summary or representation of ELP. I would admit that like any band they do have some throwaway or boring albums and ELP is no exception. They have produced some of the best and worst albums in Prog rock history. If you have the Return of the Manticore 4cd box set then this a just an appendage. But if you don't have the Mar Y Sol cd then From the beginning is a good set for you since buying it separately is around 10 dollars. Since ELP only made 12 studio albums in their whole career as a band excluding the extensive live, bootleg, compilations and box sets, these 12 studio albums can be released in a box set at areasonable price like Tangerine dream's Virgin years. This would solve redundancy since ELP has already released many 4 cd box set with just minor additions and differences in the track list. At this price of a under or a little over 20 dollars there is no reason to complain even if the content are repeats.
0307352145|5.0|Growing up, everyone had always commented that I was an 'invert'. While I have always accepted that fact, I still felt for a long time that there was something wrong with me. Why couldn't I make friends the same way everyone else did? Why did I prefer to stay home when everyone else wanted to go out? Reading this book has given me multiple \\"ah ha!\\" moments. Never before have I felt so understood. Our society places such a high premium on having a big personality that those without it are often thought to have something wrong with them.<br />As she states in the book, not everything written will apply to all who read it, however I highly recommend it to introverts and extroverts alike who have always felt pressure to create a 'false' personality to fit into our modern world. When you accept what you have to work with, maybe you can finally get some work done (metaphorically).<br />A very valuable read for sure.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|A couple of months ago I noticed that Draw Something started to get really buggy. I would try to load the app and it would crash. I would try to load the app and it would fail (then I would have to uninstall and reinstall). It would disconnect in the middle of a game (even though I had a strong and constant internet connection). I would complete a round by sending a drawing to a friend, log back in later and find that my drawing was not sent, and would have to re-send a new drawing. I would log in and my colors and/or coins would be missing (they eventually come back). With one of my friends we were stuck on round 99/100 for over 20 rounds. Well then I found out Zynga bought OMGPOP about three months or so ago.<br /><br />Too bad because it is, for the most part, a pretty fun game ... the major drawback being that words tend to repeat frequently (I think I've drawn the word \\"peacock\\" 5+ times).
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I've been a fan of Adam's music for several years now, but I've shared Trespassing with other non-fans/lovers of pop music, and they cannot stop jamming to it!  Trespassing expertly mixes funk and disco with more modern electronic sounds.  Adam is known for his killer vocal range, and it shines through on this record even with all the production.  The album is both a throwback and something very modern.  The first half is pure dance joy.  Put it one while you clean, at a party, or when you're on the tread mill looking for motivation to go that extra mile.  The second half of the album is more introspective and soul searching.  It's good when you need to mellow out or just sit and think for a while.  It all sounds great coming through the car speakers.  So buy a copy, pop it in, and turn it way up!
B007N0REX6|4.0|Slash's second solo album features just about exactly what you would expect, sleazy rock n roll in the west coast L.A. glam tradition.  There are lots of gritty guitar solos and the vocal histrionics of Myles Kennedy soars above it all.  Unlike Slash's last solo effort from 2010, that featured a myriad of guest stars, this album features Slash's touring band with gives the album a bit more cohesiveness.  Kennedy is one of the great vocalists in rock today and his presence here on all of the tracks really brings Slash's music to a new level.  All that being said, I don't think this album is quite as strong as the last one from 2010.  The songwriting here is good, but with 14 tracks it ends up having a bit of sameness about it all.  Still, if hard hitting old school rock n roll is what you are looking for, this album certainly delivers.  Slash is playing better than ever and obviously the fact that these guys toured together for over a year has made them a tight as hell musical outfit.  Overall I don't think this one quite rises to the level of its predecessor, but it is a solid 4 star album.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books!  The Lucky One is such a good one to read.  I was sad when it ended.
B000YGIIPO|5.0|My husband and I both got hooked on Terry Pratchet and his Disc World series quite a few years ago. We discovered him accidently in a book of short stories and buy his work all the time. This book had some interesting ideas in it and really gives you a different look at \\"people\\". Fun to read and does not disappoint. Loved it!

B0001E5TSS|2.0|First off, frankly I'm not interested in all of these people leaving reviews for the MOVIE rather than the PRODUCT. Apparently everyone on here believes they're a bona fied movie critic. If I was able to see reviews for the PRODUCT instead of the MOVIE, I would have read that people in the US were unable to play this DVD--yes, I realize it says it somewhere up there, but I was TRYING to browse through reviews to figure out whether or not this thing worked. Instead, customers are treating this page as a homework assignment for a film class. Frankly, if it does not play in the US or Canada, why is it not only listed in Amazon.co.uk or in other country-affiliated versions where the DVD WOULD work? I had no idea there was even a region issue when it came to playing DVDs until this product and its reviews wasted my time and money. It appears other sellers are more careful about what US-faulty products are viewed by US populations.<br /><br />If you live in the US or Canada, DO NOT BUY THIS. IT WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR DVD PLAYER. I'm sorry all of these idiots think they're movie critics, and I hope the right people see this before clicking the check-out button. I'm sure it'll get buried by even more 3-friggin'-page-long mediocre movie reviews before anyone is able to benefit from it. At least I've learned users on here are self-important amateur movie critics and that I need to scour every line of product detail to avoid getting duped. Thank you for being of little help, fellow reviewers!
B005T87QCI|3.0|It was good but could be better like on kindle its good but I beat it in a half hour the app cover shows atom but hes not even in the game. They should put every charecter in the movie in the game not nobodies. And they should add a build a bot mode. I'm hearing a lot of people say there is a updated version how can I get that on my kindle please anwser me.
1597801585|5.0|i must say this is a great book. I picked it up on a whim and fell in love with it. while it has great characters, setting and plot, there are some rather \\"triggering\\" scenes that you must be mature about. I wish this was part of a series id get them all!

You really think Lexi has it all when she wakes up in her hospital room.<br /><br />But sometimes what it looks like is not really what is going on.<br /><br />I would read it again!
0061900656|5.0|The \\"I'm A Big Sister\\" book worked well with my daughter and helped her to understand her baby sister's arrival.  So I bought this book for a friend who was having another baby so she could give it to her older son.  Super cute!  Highly recommend! :-)

Love the book & I certainly love MY MAN. This may change your life.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the third best series I have ever read.  You could really understand Katniss.  Everyone was going on about how violent it was, but it really wasn't.  I really liked it and the second one too.  I haven't read the tird one yet, but I plan to soon.  I really liked it.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|I don't know where I read it but I'll agree with whomever said it that Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is to Ghost Rider as The Punisher: War Zone was to The Punisher..a better take, overall, on the comic book character but in movie form. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance begins when a monk, Moreau, alerts Blaze that a woman named Nadya & her son need protection from the very devil that created the Ghost Rider. Blaze feels obligated to help and that's where our new adventure begins.<br /><br />Most of you will notice that this film bears very little resemblence to the previous Ghost Rider film that came out in 2007, although Nic Cage reprises his role as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. I hate to admit it but it took a couple of viewings to agree that this is a better film than the first. It's better in the fact that the action is more frantic and intense than the first. My only gripe would have to be that Nic Cage's performance is predictable in this movie. It seemed like he dialed this one in, instead of really giving a Grade-A performance. It was nice seeing Christopher Lambert on screen again. The last time I seen him was in Mortal Kombat, I'm afraid.<br /><br />Despite negative reactions to the movie, I thought it was pretty decent movie. If it were given a bigger budget, I'm sure we would have seen a more robust movie by  Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor(whom most of you know as the directors of Crank). As it is, though, I loved it. I hope this isn't the last we see of ol' Ghost Rider. He's one of my all-time favorite Marvel characters that's deserving of some screen time.

B004132HZS|5.0|There have been some lousy interpretations of Sherlock Holmes lately, ( i.e. the Robert Downey Jr. movie ), but this IS NOT one of them. It is EXCELLENT. I LOVE the fact that it has been updated to our present time. I thought that would ruin the stories by diminishing the Victorian atmosphere, but instead it really makes them more fascinating. After all, if Sherlock were around today, he would certainly be utilizing all of the newest technology. Me, my husband, my 75 year old mother, AND my 16 year old son have all been RIVETED to this program. It transcends generations. Can't wait for season three!!!!!!!

0553386794|5.0|OK, I held out as long as I could!  I said that I wasn't into fantasy, I said I wasn't into dragons and such, and I said that I wasn't into reading 600 page books!<br /><br />But...I received this book as a Christmas present - and after I let it sit on a shelf for 6 months - and I thought I should give it a chance.<br /><br />I have to say that the first hundred (or so) pages are kind of difficult to get through.  There is a lot of info to absorb and I found myself flipping to the maps inside each cover (kindle users will have no such luck) to try to get the lay of the land.  Once I really got into the book and stopped flipping back and rereading to make sure I didn't miss anything, I really started to absorb the story and the scenery.<br /><br />This book is an epic saga of the fantasy genre.  I DO NOT usually read fantasy, so it's hard for me to compare to other authors or books, but it really is a great read!  It left me feeling a connection to the characters, anxiety for their future, and it left me wanting more.  Thankfully there are plenty more to read.
B0059XTUXQ|4.0|This was an interesting moving. Very well done. At first I almost turned it off as I felt so sorry for the old lady. But over the course of the movie I began to empathizes with her. I am glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />Great leadership points here. She was never one to form a coalition. It is interesting to see her stick to her guns in all situations. She was very black and white. My theory with women in power is that they are more principled and more likely to be a hard liner because they have a safety net. Married women can always return home. In her case she had a supportive husband at home. Men dont have that option. Chauvinist sure but true. As the movie shows the men are more interested in preserving their careers and don't have the luxury of principals. It is an old boy network for a reason. She rocked the boat and won...for a while.<br /><br />Over all a very interesting enjoyable movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My 3.5yr old likes some games and so do I.  you want to play more so you can open more games.

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I bought four of these, and they're great. However, one of them has a considerably lower gain than the others, and another one hums if you're not connected to a properly grounded AC supply. They must have some quality control issues at the plant where they make them. Who cares, though? The price is right, and the quality is good.<br /><br />I connect all four to an audio mixer board. If you plug them in with the 1/4\\" jacks, you cannot get the gain up loud enough to hear them. You need DI boxes. The least expensive (and actually best) solution is Radio Shack's 1/4\\" female to XLR male adapter/transformer. At $18, it's a great and unobtrusive DI box. The part number is 274-017C (search on their website using \\"274017\\" and it will come up).<br /><br />The combination of this mic and the DI allows me to interview four people at a time on camera with pro results.<br /><br />Except for the occasional dud, I have no complaints and would highly recommend these mics for videographers on a budget.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I needed more, so I bought four more. One of them bursts into white noise intermittantly after awhile. It ruined an interview I did.<br /><br />All in all, the quality control on these is terrible, and you have a 37% chance of getting a dud - or one that turns out to be a dud when you need it most. I'm going to spend more money and get four decent mics that I can depend on. If you buy one of these mics, good luck.
B00000J2PH|5.0|The Music CD that I purchased Carole King is a classic album one of the artist best albums.

I saw the movie and it is kinda low class and stupid but the book depiction was Spectacular...and a class in its own...the movie has stupid conversation which does not make sense...but the book is a pleasant and intelligent read... i have a HARD COPY...it is a book to keep....after reading you won't regret it...
0345803507|5.0|Awesome book, but we all know that! It was an easy read. I may actually read it a second time.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok.. I finished this book at my wife's request. It's not horrible but it certainly isn't great. I do see why most women would LOVE this book and I get why they must oohhh and ahh about Christian. I am a fan of nonfiction books and rarely read fiction so this was a tough mountain to climb. Yes, it is a page turner but it's a very simple story and flows well so I do credit the author for this. But I really found it repetitive and both the description of the lead ups and the actual sex scenes. Also, I simply can't get past how unrealistic this guy's life is and really why did he really fall so hard for Ana so quickly? My wife said I should read the other two books now.. I'm really struggling with that idea. Sorry, I really did want to like it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very fun I could build lots of buildings and I never ran out of energy I like it that you get money even if you are not playing the game
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book restores my faith in the resilency of the human spirit.  Victoria who was abandoned at birth and lived all her life in less than desirable group and foster homes.  As a result she struggles with love and committment issues.  I applaud Vanessa Diffenbaugh for bringing to the attention, in such a positive way, the need of community involvement.  In the language of the flowers \\"cammelia\\" means my destiny is your hands'.  Vanessa is launching The Camellia Network in order to create a nationwide movement to support youth making the transition from foster care to independence.  You can check it out at [...]
B007IXWL2C|5.0|AWESOME trilogy of real true love!  Enjoyed all 3 of the books from beginning to end.  I could not put down the books!
B00881VLCE|2.0|I love puzzles but this one doesn't fit on the kindle fire screen.  the pictures are great however if you can't see what you are doing it gets frustrating
0393338398|5.0|When you are French there is little chance you will buy and read this book. There is no french version and it's talk about baseball. But, if as me you saw the movie and was thrilled by the subject, you'll make a great move by reading the book.<br />I know there is a big part of the action that is not accuratly described, hey it's a book... but the subject itself is gold : how can you go straight to your objective in your business without concern for the past, the surrounding and even your own mind. I saw the movie three times, I plan to read the book at least 3 times... great investment.
1400069289|5.0|I borrowed the book from the public library, read it, and then ordered it from Amazon. 'Nuff said? I had good study habits in college and law school, good work habits for 45 years, and a great marraige with my one and only wife, so I was satisfied with my habits. Now I can see a lot to do and am looking forward to changing some of my habits. So is my wife. By the way, I also read \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\\" by Daniel Kahneman; the two books tie in neatly. I recommend both.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|What can I say? This book sounds like a high school kid wrote it, not my kind of writer, didn't even finish
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this on my ipod and kindle and have never had one glitches or problem! I love it! I play it all the time:)
0446563048|5.0|Very inspiring. Inspiring me doing business differently . Everyone who wants to start business should read it. It will change your thinking.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love his app its so awesome I could play it all day :) I cant wait to get a new player well you should soooooooooooooooo get. GET IT NOW &asymp;}
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game was amazing just you have to read the directions witch most kids do not like to do. other than that I loved it!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is so so good my 8year old son and me LOVE this game . the levels get harder and the tiles change theme the storyline is great too!  if u like mahjong u will love this game
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I didn't connect with the writing in this book.  It was not what I had expected (but I knew nothing of the book prior to opening it up).  The story kept me going and I wanted/needed to know what happened to each character.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Finally a game i can enjoy without having to be on an actual computer!! The intertainment of farmville an castleville that I been lacking on the Kindle...
B0086700CM|4.0|ive played this many times.  it is definatley something I would use storage space on.  good job to the creators.
B000I9VOO4|4.0|This movie is special to me.  I saw it as an early teenager as a two night special movie presentation.  Atticus Finch is for me like an amazing Uncle who showed me what values and character are all about.  I believe this story is among the most important of my generation.  I'm grateful it's available to download through Amazon unbox.<br /><br />Now, about the quality.  It may be as good as it's going to get, but I'm hoping there's a better copy to come where faces aren't a bit washed out in the bright light, and the detail is a bit crisper.  It's not neccessary, but I hope it can happen.  If it happens, I'll buy it and give it the 5 stars it deserves.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun I enjoy the game not quite like the original though. but over all it is pretty kool. thank you
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!  It is easy to find chapter and verse, easy to read in any light condition, and great to share the different versions.  Such a blessing!
630233683X|5.0|Singin in the Rain is a first rate musical. Many realize that Gene Kelly stands on his own as far as an excellent dancer, however, Donald O'Connor is not to be over looked with his excellent dancing in this wonderful musical! As they pair together in their musical numbers, it's pure joy to watch! Debbie Reynolds is adorable as well as Kathy.<br /><br />A musical that can be watched over and over!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't know what else to say that the other 5 star readers haven't already written. All I can say is that I did enjoy them (all three books) that I read them back to back TWICE!! Yes, they were super erotic but hey whatever.... Some people like it and some people don't. It's call free will people...if you don't like erotic they don't freaking buy it then complain about it!!!!
1451627289|5.0|Read most of King's books .LOVED the earlier ones, not too crazy about the Dark Tower series. But this book was GREAT.A page turner...Amazing how he thinks of these things! Would highly recommend, especially to King fans.
0307352145|2.0|I looked forward to reading this book as I have been an introvert all my 80-year-old life and have come to understand and accept my basic personality with its strengths and weaknesses.  I expected an entire book on the subject would supplement and enrich my understanding of myself.  Unfortunately, I found the writing and the insights amateurish, far from scholarly, and full of examples of her own life and that of others that were often off-the-point.<br /><br />I, an intutive introvert, was the child of 2 sensing extroverts.  This was actually good for me.  As an only child<br />they took me everywhere:  movies, card parties, sometimes dances.  I loved the movies and quickly learned that many of them were based on books and by the age of 10-11 I was reading classics like Jane Eyre, The Good Earth, How Green was my Valley.  I took books and read at card parties until I fell asleep on couches.  So I learned early how to value my extrovert friends.  Both my parents worked full time and this was another plus:  I got to read all day (without being told to get my nose out of a book and go out and play), I worked puzzles and played games all by myself.  So I learned to entertain myself with what I enjoyed doing.<br /><br />I was given music lessons so I learned to perform in front of an audience.  I continued performing all through high school and college in musical productions and plays.  So I learned what I could contribute to an extroverted world.<br />My secret was that this \\"was not about me.\\"  I was conveying a message and entertaining an audience.  This worked well when I chose a career field, which was one of public service.  I was promoting my product, which I believed in.<br /><br />Now, in retirement, I can allow my basic personality to reign.  I read, work puzzles, play games online, only occasionally go out to do necessary errands.  Sometimes my adult children visit me and I am happy to see them, they are happy to find me independent and unneedy.<br /><br />Idon't think this book advanced my understanding of myself or anybody else.  We introverts can be just as much a part of the world and contribute just as much as extraverts and I've always known this.  I didn't need a simplistic boring much too long book to tell me what I already knew.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I purchased the whole season for smash, and you know what the season/show just keep getting better, and i can't wait for season 2..<br /><br />Amazon has made it so easy to watch on my kindle fire, or on my computer.. SO SO SO easy!!<br /><br />LOVE IT
B0086700CM|4.0|It's fun however it apparently has no end in sight. There is no main goal. No finish line. No dock or final level. That's a bummer because there doesn't seem to be a way to beat the game. Basically,  you run until you fail. This could be a problem for anyone who desires  resolution.
030758836X|5.0|I could NOT put this book down!! This is my first time reading Gillian Flynn. I loved this book so much I am going to buy her two other books. I can't wait to give it to a friend.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|This set was on sale on Amazon for about $135 when I bought it. It was a steal at that price with Prime. The set itself is awesome. There's a lot of cool new pieces that aren't in most sets. You get a variety of animals and items. The actual set has a really nice design to it. I was really impresses how far lego went with actual detail. There is also tons of room to place minifgures inside. I recommend over any of the other creator sets out there. Definitely most bang for your buck.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|hunger games is just amazing there is no word that describes how great it is this book deserves a rating of 1 MILLION !!!!!!!
B000SEGCRS|5.0|I don't usually go to the effort of rating books but felt compelled to rate this after finishing it.<br />I am only learning to get into photography and this book has suddenly helped me not only understand my camera better but also take better photographs!<br />The way it is written made it easier to understand why some things work and others don't.  It will be my future guide to taking photos of any type with the quick settings as advised depending on your scenario.  I have gone ahead and purchased the photoshop CS5 Ebook by the same author because previously I have found playing with CS5 difficult to understand. I am sure if it is written along the same lines as the photgraphy book then I will feel a lot more comfortable giving that a go.<br />I am also going to continue with the series of photography books by the same author as I trust his style of writing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this app is awesome I always play it. my mom says its a big waste of time.but its not u can put events.that's my favrite part about this app!!!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Putting musical experience into words is impossible..however, I felt compelled to write a review of this amazing album.  My first Rush \\"experience\\" came to me when I was 9 years old when I received my first Sony Walkman (remember those?) and a cassette (remember those) of Rush Signals.  When those first heavy synth chords hit my ears, it propelled me into a musical journey with this band that has been going strong for over three decades now.<br />Now I'm 40 listening to Clockwork Angels with my 9 & 5 year old boys and we're all rocking together with this band that just keeps getting better with time.<br />I titled my review \\"the protectors of music\\" because to me that's what this band has always been.  In a world of such disposable, insignificant music...Rush puts together a masterpiece that is just light years ahead of everything else.  The sound of Clockwork Angels is aggressive, hypnotic, melodic and at times apocalyptic.  It's an emotionally charged collection of tunes that will leave your head spinning and wanting another thousand listens.  And if you're not welling up by the end of The Garden you are not human.<br />As a musician I am in awe of this band and always have been.  They are just beyond compare!<br />Can't wait to see them this fall...I hope they play the entire album!!!  Thank you Alex, Geddy & Neil for protecting the music and making it matter
B00846TTDG|3.0|Yeah yeah i know its got real soldiers in it but come on couldnt they have just kept them to the action shots...oh wait there was real actors in it? Terrible dialog good action scenes and that's about it.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This book is intense. It contains a lot of violence and graphic sex; including gang rapes, which I found a bit much. however, overall great book. Certainly keeps the reader on his toes.  A must read!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this book was just as good as the first!! oh so so hot!! i haven't had a good good bokk to read in a long time glad i found this one!!!!
1936608898|5.0|I have long followed the paleo lifestyle and found this book to be exceptional in explaining the science behind the diet, especially the psychological affects of modern, processed foods.  As a trainer, I have several clients with food addictions and disordered eating who are anxious about changing their diets which makes encouraging sound, whole foods nutrition difficult.  Dallas and Melissa's explanation of food addiction comes from a place of healing and understanding rather than accusing.  Their approach assures the reader that \\"it's OK, it's not your fault, and we're here to help.\\"  I have recommended ISWF to several clients and they are finding the book to be an incredible resource in overcoming their strained relationships with food.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book, never muh for love stories but this one was good! l would def re-read prob more than once!! ive read the second and im starting on the third!! cant wait to see what happens next!!
0060873027|1.0|Both Michael Chrichton and Richard Preston are masterful authors who can weave science fiction and science fact into gripping and mesmerising tales. So what the heck happened here? This novel is so poorly-written it's actually painful to read. One-dimensional characters (even more one-dimensional than Chrichton's usual fare), stupefyingly-boring plot, terrible dialog. It reads like it was written for children, and maybe it was.<br /><br />Here it is in a nutshell: Gargamel (here named \\"Vin Drake,\\" but just a bumbling fool bad buy like Gargamel) shrinks some college students so they won't reveal his nefarious deeds, making them smurfs. Each smurf has his own one-dimensional personality, just like the real smurfs. Gargamel then accidentally releases the smurfs in a jungle, where they have to fend for themselves and fight against time to become human again.<br /><br />Good Saturday-morning cartoon. Awful novel. What a shame.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've seen this game everywhere and now I finally get to try it out myself. I love this game, it's terribly addicting. What a great game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Never judge a book by its cover - my bad!  This and next in the series were recommended by the bots.  Ugh!  WTF!  Definitely a bad match - I was looking at Guidepost magazine renewal (nominally christian uplifting stories).  I read better soft-core porn in Australia in the 70's.  Draw and quarter the programmer.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Such a simple and excellent game.  Very good controls and a nice look / setup to it.  I think of it as sudoku with a point.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I loved the book but there is something wrong with the \\"engineering\\" (this is what the Kindle customer service told me). I had great difficulty advancing the pages.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Works great.  I use it connected to a Denon AVR receiver to listen to my Iphone through my surround sound speakers.  This a Apple brand cable not a knock-off brand as some other reviews have stated.  Also charges your Iphone while playing music or videos.
B003O7I6L6|5.0|This is one of my many favorite films from the early eighties. Even Kurt Russell himself has said that out of all the big budget films that he has done in his career, he believes that he is best remembered as Snake Plissken. The great anti-hero of a failing future society. A war hero that went bad and robbed a bank, and was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison.  The prison of Manhattan Island New York, converted into a prison sometime in the near future.<br /><br />Then, as fate would have it, he was given an option to be absolved of all his convictions if he takes on a new opportunity and take on a solo mission of the rescue of the President of the United States. Air Force One (the President's plane) was hi-jacked with the President aboard and the hi-jackers carried out a suicide mission to crash the Air Force One deep in the heart of Manhattan Island.<br /><br />The end of the film made a classic anthematic theme about our attitude with our faith in our nations leaders.  After Snake Plissken asked the President what he thought of all the other people who died in the process of helping him rescue the President, Plissken walked away and made a personal non-verbal statement of his own, that makes for a classic moment to compare to all of classic film history.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I bought this cover almost two years ago when I bought my first Kindle, and this cover is definitely a conversation piece.  I have had so many compliments on the colour, the look; people running their fingers over the case; my goodness, I even had one lady take it from me so she could read all the countries written on it! I have the red and it is a rich beautiful colour. The elastic is holding my kindle as firmly as when I first got it. And I have to say I carry my Kindle EVERYWHERE with me. I have had absolutely no problems with this cover. I love it so much I am debating ordering it in the brown just in the event Verso ever decides to take it off the market; I will have a fall back....<br /><br />So, if you are thinking about this cover, I say get it.  You will not be disappointed.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really enjoy this game.  It is fun and addicting, but it is kind of laggy.  When ever I turn this app on it takes a while to load and sometime (this is probably more of my fault then the games) when I swipe up it doesn't sense it and when I swipe over it makes me jump instead of turn.  Other then how it is a little laggy it is an AWESOME game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book and I found it very difficult to put it down after I started reading it.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run was a game i nevrr thought id like. when all i heard about was temple run i thought it was stupid. after giving in while my cousin pressed me for an hour i downloaded it onto my kindle fire and now im addicted!
034580404X|5.0|Finished reading the last in the trilogy yesterday and find myself missing the characters so much!  I want to know more.  I enjoyed every page.  I laughed out loud, shed a few tears, and held my breath in suspense, not to mention it was very erotic.  I will be waiting to see what E L James comes up with next.  Hopefully the wait won't be too long.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles with cut pieces and this is the best ones I have found for kindle fire. There are lots to choose from.And many good ones are free!
B00526ZKYS|2.0|The concept for this novel was so full of promise. But the execution was lacking. The writing style was beautiful, but it rambled on. There were often long passages between dialogues within the same conversation. The first book of a trilogy, most information given here are obvious set ups for future installments. So there is a feeling of incompletion that goes beyond the promise of a sequel. Oliver gets an A for effort, but it was still a disappointing show. She promised a work as epic and wonderful as THE GIVER but delivered something almost as mindless and muggle as TWILIGHT.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|we are all his children and we should all say thank you to our father on this day of the year
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my 3 yr old loves this game, easy enough for him to play by himself &amp; great to keep him busy during times of long waits
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Good story line, good acting, just very long. Don't watch with your girlfriend or wife if their not into it, or you will be watching it by yourself.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|THIS MOVIE STARTED OFF GOOD AND ONLY GETS BETTER. THIS MOVIE ALWAYS KEEPS YOU GUESSING. HIS FAMILY IS A LITTLE MESSED UP BUT HIS BEST FRIEND, WELL LETS JUST SAY WITH FRIENDS LIKE THAT YOU DONT NEED ENEMIES. GREAT MOVIE
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|I am less then half~way through it,<br />and I'm loving it! It's good to see<br />Johnny Depp playing \\"NoRmAl!\\" l O l !
B0086700CM|4.0|I thought that it was very choppy at times when you collected coins but if you turn off the music it has less of a hard time prowessing the app but love that it is now on kindle fire
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Pros:<br />PRICE!<br />Watch looks SO good.<br />Size is perfect, I don't have small hands/wrist (I'm in the 200+ club).<br />Slim and sleek - not bulky like other men's watches (fits under shirt sleeve without you having to force it, it just slides under)<br />Back of the watch is awesome to look at - makes for a great conversation.<br />Packaging was great, came wrapped around a little pillow inside a box. All papers, etc were included and intact.<br />The second hand ticks at x6/second, which looks so cool, and if it's quiet enough, you can hold it up to your hear and hear it ticking super fast.<br />Go's well with the NATO watch bands (I bought a few of them and I swap them out regularly)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Time is a tad fast - about 4 minutes/week (not that big of a deal to me, just adjust it every now and then; and at least it's not slow...)<br />Setting the watch isn't super intuitive (because of the date/day setting), just read the directions and you'll be fine.<br />Audible sound of weight spinning -  I agree with others that it does sorta sound like you have a broken piece bouncing around in your watch;<br />but to be clear, the room you're in has to be pretty quiet for you to hear it.<br />None of the above cons are a big deal to me - I just listed them to be thorough. If you want everything to be perfect, you'd probably have to break out of this price range, and I personally don't ever want to spend more than $75 on a watch...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Go figure, this version works better on my cell phone than the one on my ipod. In fact the one on my ipod no longer works due to continous updates.<br />No question. I love the accuracy. I did really well first time ! '
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is addictive and fun, everybody should try this game once, that is, if you can put it down after the first time you play it!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|creating random games takes forever. NEVER EVER logout...logged me out for some reason and lost my whole game (ppl, colors and thousands of coins) had to start over with a new screenname and everything and is again taking forever to start a random game. The random game is still loading and it has been a day...even when I add people by email or username it never shows up but says I have an active game with them....too frustrating, I ended up deleting it.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|We have a whole slew of regular dvd Avatars, and were shocked when we tuned up the new BluRay I got for my guys. We figured it would be moderately better, but what we saw was much more.<br /><br />Sound was amazing, subwoofer content (LFE) was extraordinary, and the video was pristine. Colors were excellent and the resolution was spectacular. Could not recommend any stronger or higher.<br /><br />Avatar, Dark Knight, and Tron: Legacy MUST be seen in BD to appreciate their subtelties.  The best of the best out there..
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun I play it as much as I can whenever I'm board ill play this game! it rox ;)
B007JRUCGO|5.0|Redefines \\"free Willy!\\" Lots of good characters who are developed and make the story. It' a kid's flick, so not too deep.  The operetic portion was, well, I was glad when it was over.  But, clearly we discover Eric had a hidden skill.  If he's the grown up star of Happy Feet Three, I'll keep my memories of 1 + 2 and spend my money on another flick by this company. (Great graphics.)
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It was a unique book.  The Young Adult label may keep Mature readers from reading.  It is a new twist on the telling of Hiltler, Jews, and the German people that had to live their everyday lives during this horrible time. I have never read anything using death as the story teller.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it has some fun games but the others are difficult to do. if you could make it easier it would be perfect.
B0086700CM|5.0|my friend was playing this and I asked her what she was playing and she told me temple run and I accidently came across it in my app store looking for something else and downloaded and have been playing it nonstop!!!!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Happy with this reading material especially as I now have Kindle and can download it immediately. I can now takemy reading matter easily without having bulky books to transport.
030758836X|2.0|I have read all of Gillian Flynn's other books, so I was biting my nails waiting for this new release. As soon as I got, I settled in for what I just knew was a good book. I'm actually sad to say I was a bit disappointed. I mean it was a good story that at times got so long winded, you were ready to skip pages, and then the ending just kind of fell flat.<br />I was not prepared to be disappointed, because her other books had me reeled in from page 1. I see there are a lot of positive reviews, and yes it is okay, but I guess I expected more from this great author. The best way to summarize, I would have preferred that this book was on the free list and her first two were regular priced. I wouldn't have felt so bad if that were the case.
B0031SCV46|5.0|I got this keyboard to use with garageband and ableton live. I was delighted when I later got my iPad and found that they worked together with the right connection equipment. Piano isn't my primary instrument but this keyboard is perfect for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Compact form factor, but the keys themselves are of normal size.<br />- Just plug in the usb and you're good to go.<br />- The body construction is sturdy.<br />- The buttons and knobs are of decent quality, but could be better.<br />- The keys have a great semi-weighted feel.<br />- Modulation and pitch wheel have a good feel: Good grip and a little resistance but not too much.<br />- Sustain pedals are also plug and play- no configuration needed<br />- Will work with iPad! But because the keyboard is powered off usb, you will need a powered hub and a camera connection kit to run the usb into the iPad since the iPad itself doesn't supply power to usb devices.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No battery or adapter power option.<br />- I never use most of the buttons and knobs because most of them require configuration. The pitch wheel, modulation wheel, and octave changer work without configuration, though, and that's all I care about.<br />- Sometimes the numbers on the display inexplicably change. I think maybe one of the knobs is faulty but its not a knob I've configured so it never interferes with my playing.<br />- 49 keys is a good balance between playing range and size but you'll run out of keys on many songs if you're not careful. 49 keys is best suited for synth work than piano. Fortunately the octave increment buttons are easy to use.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is a must read book! You have to really concentrate when reading because it has a lot of twists and turns. It has suspense, love story, romance and \\"Odd 'sexual encounters. It tells the story of a young girl who hasn't had any \\"sexual\\" partners to one and he is screwed up.
B006B9XZ1K|5.0|I bought it on Amazon.com, I was very excited to get this cd.<br />In the Girl in the Dress, she shamelessly presents her pain, without judgment or anger, to a past lover.<br />I love Taylor Swift and think this album is fantastic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just finished this book and Im a fan of the Hunger Games! I loved this book. It was full of suspense and kept me on my feet! I couldnt wait to get back to it everytime I put it down. Im an adult and I know it was written for teens but I found it to be a really good story! I already bought part II and part III and will start reading part II tonight!
B006H3MIV8|4.0|I thought this albulm was a pleasant surprise.  I LOVE Bob Dylan and I agree with another reviewer that I don't need to hear someone redo a bob song trying to be bob.  I appreciated that the artists kept their own sounds and just proved what an awesome songwriter Dylan is!
B002ZG99G8|4.0|A fun, action movie about a team of Black Ops<br />Cia,out for revenge. The characters are<br />well scripted and defined.  There is never a dull<br />moment. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Zoe Saldana are<br />a perfect match in this steamy on screen relationship. Chris Evans, and Oscar Jaenada are also providing<br />snappy dialog, and nice eye candy too.  This movie<br />is a fun way to spend 2 hours. It deserved better<br />marketing then it received. Don't miss it on<br />DVD.  Take a chance.
B002YE452Y|5.0|Love her! Awesome album I can just throw it on and let it play, the deluxe version has all sorts of extra remixes and songs in spanish. Shakira is thoughtful, melodic, and out of this world- YOU GO GIRL!!!!!
0393338827|3.0|I really enjoyed this book but it's a third of the story at best.<br /><br />Mr. Lewis is a good writer and this is a fast read but he leaves out some important information like why did banks start lending to subprime borrowers in the first place? HUD started pushing banks to make loans to people they had not considered credit worthy. The act had been around since Carter but was not really enforced until Clinton (and Bush didn't stop it). If you doubt this just go search on Henry Cisneros and find the interview he gave the NY Times. So bankers figured out a way to make money out of loans they thought would go bad.<br /><br />And that's just one example of what's missing here. It's easier to make Wall Street the villians and Mr. Lewis states he has an ax to grind with Wall Street in the beginning of the book.<br /><br />It's fun but it needs to be taken with a grain of salt.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|This product is absolutely a MUST OWN for any REAL guitarist who realizes that at some point, if you're not living in a studio and you're serious about guitar, you are going to want to practice at ALL POSSIBLE HOURS. This headphone amp not only makes that possible, but it delivers an unbelievably good sound. I'm not even joking, this thing sounds BETTER than my regular amp! Well, considering the fact that its coming through a pair of Razer Cacharias headphones, it sounds better. I also play through EMG active pickups so I know that helping but man, the tone on Metal Version of this headphone amp delivers the crunchy beef sound that essentially defines modern metal and all its variations. The sound produced by this bad boy is SERIOUSLY beefy and just sounds great. I'm going to give it a try through my Fender Jagmaster as it has duncan designed pickups as opposed to active EMG bad boys. Honestly though, I don't think its going to make much a difference and I'm sure I'll be pleased regardless.<br /><br />I haven't even begun to play around with the option of plugging into your MP3 player to jam along to your favorite tunes. Since I'm currently learning how to play a guitar with 8 strings a la Tosin Abasi, being able to play along with Animals as Leaders tunes ReALLY helps with my practice. This headphone amp is a must own tool for any real guitarist as being able to play along with songs or whatever backing mp3's you want is a TREMENDOUS help and its just a lot of fun! Its like becoming a part of your favorite bands and you can either jam your own stuff over your favorite tunes or play along and learn them as a means to getting better. I'm a self-taught guitarist who, like Tosin himself, started by learning and playing along with the music I was listening to when I picked up the guitar. Being able to do that and sound like a part of the mix makes this process amazingly fun and cool.<br /><br />This headphone amp is a MUST OWN!!! BUY IT NOW and you WON'T BE SORRY! If you have the money, I would recommend purchasing both the AC30 and the metal variation (or classic rock if thats how you roll) as it provides you with practicing with a WIDE range of tones from clean to dirty. The AC30 model provides all the amazing and dynamic tonal possibilities of the real deal (pristine clean or down and dirty and everything in between) while either the classic or metal models provide the distorted tones according to your preference, rounding out your ability to practice a full range of songs and licks.<br /><br />BUY THIS NOW!!!!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Echoing the comments of other reviewers, I find that the show is actually much better than I remember it to be. First of all, the quality of the picture on these DVDs is as good as it gets - aside from the very 70's music and styles, it looks as though it were shot just yesterday. But aside from the fact that it looks better than it ever looked on a 70s TV set, the shows are actually sharply written, the acting is top-notch, and the style of filmmaking is patient and calm and does not pander to the lower common denominator in the audience. It's a rarity to find a show that is stronger than one remembers it - in every other case I find that shows I loved in my childhood are usually painful to revisit as an adult. It's a thrill to report that The Six Million Dollar Man is as good as it gets and worthy of the rabid fan base it built during its run. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Genius writers, hilarious actors! My family has been watching an episode or two every night. We can't get enough of this great show.
B004UG7RQ0|3.0|My best guess is that this adapter will only work on devices that leaves control with the iPod.  If after you plug in your iPod, the iPod screen displays the name of the device and transfers iPod control to that device, this will not work.  My Alpine stereo just says \\"searching\\" after plugging this adapter in.<br />(update) I bumped the stars to three after finding a section in my Alpine manual that suggests I could have turned on \\"AUX+\\" and this should have worked.  I guess the maker of this adapter can't publish instructions for every type of iPod player but they can at least indicate there may be more to it than just plugging it in.  I've already sent this back and ordered a different type of adapter.
B00005V9HH|5.0|I received my order really fast. I was a little leary about ordering a used DVD, however it works like a brand new DVD would. So glad I bought this movie.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Love this movie... so does my GF.  The minions are great.... it's perfect for kids and adults alike as it has humor for both.  I will watch over and over.
0385344228|3.0|I only read this book because a book club I am in chose it. The book was slow, not very much depth and the characters were not anything special.  The book did become interesting when I was 75% through and the ending became interesting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the BEST sci-fi stories that I read in some time. A solid five stars. Can't wait for the sequel.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This led upgrade has performed as advertised. All the parts fit well. The light is much brighter than it was with the standard bulb and battery life is longer. The on/off switch on the back rattles a bit, but still works fine. The flood/spot adjustment still works; it also allows you to lock out the power switch to prevent the light from coming on by accident.  I would recommend this product and buy it again.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game. works great on my kindle fire. very addicting. Graphics are really good too. The further you get the more intense it gets.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app even if you have the adds you can get rid of them for 99cents. you also have to pay for some pictures. which is why I only gave it 4 stars.
B004132HZS|5.0|Once again BBC is the royality of quality entertainment. Whatever and however it is that the best casting, storytelling, and production consistantly comes from the BBC, please keep on with that intangible something amazing.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I had this amp for about 2 months and then it suddenly just died on me. I've never even dropped it or anything. This would have been a great amp for the price but the durability is questionable. I've read other reviews of this this product and it seems many people have had this same problem as well.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|BBC perfection. Writing, casting, directing, production.....perfection. The quality of storytelling that would make Sir Arthur Conon Doyle wish he had written even more Holms/Watson stories.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|I have steam for my main comp but got this for my kindle soon as it was charged. now I can stay connected to my friends at school or on the go. worth the space and its free!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game but one prb. ........... its blacking out every time I go on this app the screen goes black.... help?!!
1416585710|5.0|I think King made a concerted effort to pour his heart out on the page in this one and it shows.  He played with the idea of a writer's wife dying in \\"Bag of Bones\\" and in this one the main character's writer husband dies.  It is truly a what if scenario if King were to pass away...what it might be like for his wife Tabitha and the ruthless fandom that would want more King books.  He has said in interviews that it is most definitely not him or his wife that he is writing about, but there are similarities and he undoubtedly wanted to explore this area through fiction.  A literary masterpiece for him.  Just great.  The ending will rip your heart out.

B005723JSQ|5.0|Poppy Wyatt is about to embark on the life she always wanted. Engaged to the brilliant and handsome Magnus Tavish, Poppy is ready to move forward with the wedding. If she can find the antique family heirloom Magnus gave her as an engagement ring. After she gets her cell phone stolen too, Poppy really starts to worry until she finds a cell in the trash of a hotel. Now she can use that number to have to hotel call her when they find her ring. The phone introduces new chaos into Poppy's life as she discovers it belonged to the assistant of a very busy businessman, Sam Roxton. Poppy makes a deal with Sam that allows her to keep the phone if she forwards his messages. Poppy is soon caught up in Sam's life as well as trying to wade through her own mess, and soon she finds that she may be the key to solving a major crisis of Sam's. If she can survive her own crises that is.<br /><br />So I love Sophie Kinsella books, and this one was no exception. It has her usual charm and wit. I kind of felt like the last Shopaholic book or two were beginning to feel a bit formulaic, so I was worried that I may not enjoy this one. However, I was happy to see that Sophie Kinsella is able to keep the things I love about her writing, and these new characters kept things feeling a bit fresher. I didn't quite get Poppy and Magnus as a couple in the beginning, but things made much more sense in the end. I also loved the use of the cell phone as a plot point. It really helped show how much our communication has changed with people. It is much more common to text and use technology to communicate, but I think some people think this isolates us from others. I've always felt like it helps me reach more people; people I would never be able to talk to otherwise. This book did a great job of showing how technology can actually bring people together.<br /><br />Naturally there's not going to be anything earth shattering and new in this book, but there doesn't have to be. More than anything this book is fun! It's a great relaxing read. There are even a couple surprises in this book. People who don't like Sophie Kinsella are not going to like this book. That's pretty much a given. However if you are someone who enjoyed her books in the past, even if you are like me and felt some of the charm wearing off the latest Shopaholic books, give this one a try. It is a fast and fun read.<br /><br />Galley provided for review.
0061148512|4.0|Sylvia Plath had a tragically short life on this earth, but she left us The Bell Jar. The Bell Jar is a short, yet jarring story of a young English major descending into mental illness. Plath sets a dark, forlorn, tone from the very first page. Plath had this remarkable gift for language that creates a haunting portrait of a girl losing her mind. Plath's Bell Jar is like a ghostly shadow that seizes the reader around the shoulders and refuses to let go until page 244. The Bell Jar is one of those unique books that stays with the reader psychologically long after the last page is read.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|This Apple cable is a must for directing your iPad, iPhone, or iPod output to your stereo input.  I have some auxiliary jack that can handle an outside music source in my car.  I plugged these cables and and they work fantastic.  The sound is crystal clear.  It is a clearer sound from my iPhone 4 coming from bottom output as opposed to the headphone output.  The cable also include the video output so if you have video monitors in your car it is also a direct plug in.  The other thing that I like is to be able to charge your apple items at the same time.  The quality of these cables is great.  I would recommend these cables highly.
B007SGM084|4.0|I gave in and began the trilogy in mid-May...I couldn't put it down.  Yes, there are psychological demons and seriously, why would any person subject themselves to BDSM, but there is a story line...with a plot!  At the beginning I kept reading out of shock, and then I couldn't stop because I felt myself so entwined in Christian's and Ana's love-remorse relationship.  A completely captivating read, by far.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I don't know how this book ended up on my Kindle for my trip to Oregon, but it did. And it was the perfect book to read on this trip.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed was a lost soul after her mother died. She couldn't finish college and she picked up men and she couldn't stick with her marriage.<br /><br />Then she decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. It changed her life.<br /><br />Read this book. It just might change your life.
B005GSZZ1A|2.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book but unfortunatley, it gets too political for me.  I guess my simple brain does not do well with political subjects.  I will try to read it again sometime in the future.
B005DC68NI|5.0|After spending literally hours searching for titles, reading reviews and samples about how to go about self-publishing your work, I found \\"Let's Get Digital\\". My search is over! This is a substantial book full of practical information from not only the author, but other writers as well.<br /><br />I was so tired of reading hype from writers who only seemed to write books on how to self-publish. It all seemed so circular. I was wanting to read from someone with *real* experience in this arena.<br /><br />The book is in three sections: why you should self-publish, how to go about doing it, and 33 stories of successful authors who have done it. Truthfully, before I read the book, I thought the last section would be the least interesting. It may not have step-by-step directions, but the stories told are definitely inspirational!<br /><br />Section two is where the real \\"meat\\" of the book lies: how to self-publish. Great information, well presented, and easy to understand.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Gaughran, for your excellent book. Highly recommended!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Only good for bored housewives who don't read. The writing is appalling, weak, clunky, immature. The characters are 2 dimensional and annoying-clearly ripping off Twilight- the author's just swapped vampires for sex. There are seriously so many much much better erotica type books written for women. Don't get caught up in the hype-HUGELY dissapointing
B00881VLCE|1.0|well first of all it won't let me get the app...hate it beady much!!!people out there DO NOT GET IT!!!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We've got kings climbing out of the woodwork vying for the coveted Iron Throne.  We've got a little girl wandering around the countryside just trying to get home, and what she does just to survive, and another young lady just trying to stay alive, living among her enemies.  We've got one little boy left in charge of the homestead and trying to keep the home fires burning.  We've got a young man trying to find his place upon the Wall and beyond it, and another who could possibly jeopardize his war for independence due to his hormones.  Add into the mix, two brothers who can't seem to come to terms, a trusted friend turned traitor, a stalwart amazonian female knight charged with the daunting task of protecting a prized prisoner, a red witch, dragons, emerging magic, a cameo appearance of a familiar face from season one, and an awesome season end shot of what creeps and crawls beyond the Wall.  This is a recipe you can't wait to sample when it's done cooking!<br /><br />The cast is amazing, but then, was there any doubt?  Who does not love the irrepressible Tyrion, (Peter Dinklage)?  He's accused of many things he hasn't done, but doesn't get the credit for the good things he has done, yet he always seems to take it in stride.  Close on his heels is Jamie, (wonderfully played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau).  Next to Tyrion, he's got some of the best one liners, \\"Where did you find that massive beast?\\" (referring to Brianne (loved that!).  Bronn (Jerome Flynn), is great as Tyrion's muscle.<br /><br />We get a couple of brief glimpses into Cersei's (Lena Heady) attempt at humanity when she laments to Tyrion about what her and Jamie's actions may have brought about.  But it's not enough to allow us to sympathize with her a whole lot, as she's still a hateful manipulative person.  Tywin (superbly executed by Charles Dance) is cold and unyielding, but delightful to watch.<br /><br />Arya (Maise Williams) is magnificent as she's thrust into an unknown world and tries to adapt asbest she can.  Sansa, (Sofie Turner) although still naive in a lot of respects, is starting to use her wits somewhat, and knows the right things to say and do to keep from getting beat by her \\"beloved Joffrey's\\" henchmen, or worse.  She's learning the game. Littlefinger, (Aiden Gillen) and Varys, (Conleth Hill) are, as always, the snake and the spider. Both are wonderful in their roles.<br /><br />Bran, (Issac Hemstead Wright) tries to run Winterfell as best he can in the absence of his brother and mother.  At least he has Maester Luwin for council, as well as wildling Osha, and let's not forget his surrogate legs, Hodor.<br /><br />Jon's (Kit Herrington) oath and loyalty will be tested as the Night's Watch ventures beyond the Wall to gather information.  The constant badgering and harassing of Jon by wildling Ygritte is delightful to watch.  She definitely gets under his skin.  Robb does his best to continue to win battles and loses his heart, while Catelyn (Michelle Fairley) will do whatever it takes to bring her girls home.  Speaking of loyalty, Dany (Emilia Clarke) finds out who her friends are and who aren't.  We see a different side to the Theon (Alfie Allen) we've known, and see a much more sadistic side to Joffrey (Jack Gleeson), (me thinks the apple doesn't fall too far from this family tree).<br /><br />I am a ASoIaF book reader, (on book 4, a Feast for Crows).  After watching spellbound to season 1, I decided to pick of the books.  I'm glad I did.  Having watched the show before having read the books allowed me to put faces to names, got a sense of places and of course the magnitude of the ever imposing Wall.  It greatly helped in understanding this immense world known as Westeros.  Let me tell you, it can get confusing, it's that big!<br /><br />And, because it's so big, HBO had to streamline some events and/or characters.  Keep in mind, this is an adaptation.  If the show followed the books word for word, that would be boring, because we'd know everything that was going to happen.  At that point, why watch at all?  There is no element of suprise, such as there is now with these (what I feel is minor) changes.  This way, it keeps book readers on their toes.<br /><br />Some events which were not in the books are in the show.  Does that devalue the story of the books?  In my opinion, no... not really.  While interaction between Arya and Tywin never took place in the book, I loved the fact their paths crossed in the show, and personally that's an event which would have played out well in the book.  The scene of the council of 13 in Qarth with Pyat Pree was fabulous, and I could have easily seen it as part of the book.  True, there was no \\"weasel soup\\" but with an undertaking of this massive size, some events just have to go, some characters have to do double duty to knit the storyline together.  Yes, they've deviated from the sacred books, but I do understand the necessity of it.<br /><br />A couple of places in the show were muddied just a little bit.  They should have gone more in depth and been more succinct over the importance of Arya's \\"list\\", as well as clarifying what was happening between Qhorin Halfhand and Jon.  It can be a bit confusing to non-book readers. While I thought they could have done the House of the Undying a bit better, it was nice to see a familiar face.  Other than that, I've got no complaints about the season.  The story and our characters progressed, some a little more than others.  Even with the changes and deviations, this is by far, the best show out there.  It bites that we have to wait almost a year before season 3.<br /><br />Definitely a keeper.  It is known....  : )<br /><br />~ jade ~
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very easy to describe because it is the best game ever made.  I am not even that good at this game but it is very addictive, and I don't think I have gone a day without playing it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|TThis app is pretty awesome.  No need to worry about static ips or anything just down load the computer side app and presto your are good to go
B0054JELS4|5.0|I recently purchased NCIS on DVD, Seasons 1-8. I did this not because the price Amazon was asking was a great value, but because I LOVE THIS SHOW.  The whole cast is wonderful and their chemistry together is fantastic.  Of course my favorites are Abby, Ducky and McGee, but the rest of the cast is also essential to the shows success. I'm anxiously awaiting the release of Season 9, so I can have all the seasons so far in this shows history.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!  it is the perfect thing to entertain kids.<br />this game is like a mix of angry birds and Mario.

B001DUDKEY|5.0|Great adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel.  Some alterations from original text, but as big Jane Austen fan, I can enjoy and understand why the minimal changes were made.
034580404X|5.0|Could not put the book down, finished the first one in a week. Absolutely wonderful series!! This is one of those books you love, or hate. I do not recommend this book to teenagers, or the close minded. This book has gotten a lot of hype saying that it is Twilight fan fiction. NO. I see no similarities between Fifty and Twilight. Fifty I can read, and enjoy. Twilight, I cannot. The story line keeps you on your toes, I didn't want to put it down.

0345803485|2.0|Disappointed by the romance novel stereotypes-turned off by the sado-masochism. Do women really need to explore victimization? Perhaps I'm in the minority, but they had so much sex it was boring. It is worth reading for the main character's description of her orgasms.
B003ZYJS5Q|5.0|I just think it is funny that 9 out of 10 people buy and rate the CD version of these mono Dylan albums.<br />What is the point of listening to and comparing to \\"the original\\" versions if you are not listening on an original format?,let alone digital v. analog...<br />Sorry folks - you all need to have turntables and listen to the recordings on vinyl before you bother to write a review of how these sound and compare to \\"the originals\\".
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great.  Easy to grasp the objectives but not so easy it gets boring. Works well on the Kindle Fire,  too. My go-to game when I need diversion.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good ,hard to put down when you started reading it. I love them all. It was alot better than the movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I've read a lot of reviews here that are very negative.  And while, yes, the storyline is a bit of a stretch and the author is repetitive (which did bother me a bit as I was reading, but I was able to overlook it), there is a lot about the storyline that would be much easier read if the reader partook in the lifestyle.  I have been a participant in BDSM for years, and on the sub side at that.  I have experienced that ridiculous, indescribable draw to a dominant.  And I find this book very relatable.  Yes, the characters are somewhat outlandish, but then who wants to read a book about two random people that meet up and start a relationship?  That's just porn.  There has to be something intriguing about the main characters to draw in the reader.  There has to be a reason you want to find out what happens with these people.<br /><br />Also, I found the vocabulary to be much better than that of some others I've read lately.  So while the book may not be a literary masterpiece, I still found it to be highly enjoyable, and actually read it in two days.
B007Z9R69M|1.0|this move is horrible and boring all the action you see in the preview is all the action thats in the movie.
1936608898|5.0|This is quite simply the easiest to understand book on the market about paleo nutrition.  I devoured this in less than two days and came away with clear understanding of why a paleo diet is optimal for humans.  Clear, concise and at times funny, this book is a must-read if you are interested in understanding how food affects the way you look, think, and feel.<br /><br />I have dabbled with paleo nutrition in the past and am a huge fan of Dr. Cordain, Robb Wolf and Mark Sisson. This is just one more fabulous piece of literature to support a nutritional lifestyle that is dependent on vegetables, fruits, meat & fish, healthy fats and nothing else!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so fun. plus it is easy to play. very addictive. the graphics are great. the Color on my kindle fire it so nice.

1609613937|5.0|I've seen great results in my health from turning to a plant based diet 3.5 years ago, but I was always so hungry.<br />A salad-based vegan diet was easy to implement and a delicious experience. After loosing 40 lbs on a salad based program, I found myself getting much too thin and totally exhausted. The new book by John and Mary McDougall, The Starch Solution, explained just why that was so. Although green leafies are vital to building a foundation of health, starches like potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, and brown rice contain the calories we need to maintain a proper weight and energy level.<br /><br />Certainly, people enjoy eating animal products, but the modern degenerative health epidemic necessitates a paradigm shift. If Alexander the Great's army could conquer the known world on plant foods, a sedentary society can thrive on them. When people learn to eat and cook according to Mary's recipes, they will discover how liberating it is to be thin and delightfully full after meals. Plus, the money saved by eating cabbage, onions, carrots, beans, rice, and potatoes over beef and cheese is substantial. Not only that the hidden savings of avoiding degenerative diseases could save the world's failing economies. It is possible to eat this way on about $3 per day. Yes, it is!<br /><br />Based on oodles of research, the Starch Solution isn't just Dr. McDougall's opinion. It arms me with answers for all the questions I get from friends, family, and students concerning health and diet. I wish everyone would read the book and give these ideas a try. Dr. McDougall has had so much success reversing degenerative disease with these principles. Replacing meat, cheese, and olive oil with lentils and rice is so much easier than taking blood pressure pills every day for life or recovering from open heart surgery. Plus, it's way more effective.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|Everyone is complaining about in app purchases. They are optional and I beat the game without them. Pretty good game
B00169N0BK|5.0|I was totally satisfied with the ColorMunki Photo and now find it to be indispensable if you print your own photos. I went from trial and error with many wasted photo paper sheets to being correct the first time. Being able to match your printer (for each type of paper) to your monitor for color correctness is a time saver.
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|I read the entire series when I was young. It was a simple, action/romance driven story, and I always thought that when special effects had advanced enough, the first book A Princess of Mars would lend itself well to a simple screenplay and a great movie. This is not that movie. This is part of the first book, part of the second book, and numerous awful plot changes which are confusing to those who haven't read the books, and aggravating to those who have. Why are the Therns immortal intergalactic bad guys like the one in Star Gate who can shape shift? They changed everything about them other than the name Thern and the fact there are bald. What is it with the ninth ray wrist gun thing? What are all those flaps sticking out of the flyers, which are repeatedly describred in the book as \\"sleek\\"? Where did the medallions come from? There are literally hundreds of story line changes which can't be explained as making for a better screenplay. At least the appalling version done by the Asylum stuck to the basic story. I give this bloated epic two stars instead of one, for Bryan Cranston's backhanded humor in the blonde wig, and some of the special effects and action scenes.

The charts and tables really are almost incomprehensible, and many of them are essential to reading the book with understanding. The price is quite similar, the book is generally available in libraries, do not waste your time and money with the eBook version -- much as I generally like the portability of eBooks.]<br /><br />A key quiz in the book is also a key to analyzing how we think and how we are misled from time to time.<br /><br />A bat and ball cost a dollar and ten cents. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?<br /><br />The spoiler is at the end of my review.<br /><br />Some of the key findings:<br /><br />Smarter people are more vulnerable to thinking errors; intelligence is not a buffer against short cuts that mislead, for example.<br /><br />We are subject to anchoring bias: if we are given differing ranges of choices, we are often misled by ignoring &#34;outliers&#34; even the outlier is correct.<br /><br />Being aware of our biases or mental weaknesses does not improve our mental performance; as Kahneman writes: &#34;My intuitive thinking is just as prone to overconfidence, extreme predictions, and the planning fallacy [how long a task will take] as it was before I made a study of these issues.&#34;<br /><br />We all suffer from &#34;bias blind spot&#34;: we excel at noticing the flaws of other people but are often unable to see the same flaws in ourselves.<br /><br />The kicker: intelligence seems to make things worse.<br /><br />It's not clear, actually, what do do about all this. What I plan to do is read and re-read this fine study -- but only in my hard copy -- and really make a study of my own stupidity.<br /><br />Robert C.

B0079C9TJK|4.0|A more surrealistic than historically correct account of the composer's life, actually taking place during one of his last days, with lots of reminiscenses. The scenes are sometimes burlesque and even revolting, but on the whole, the director shows an emphatic view of this very complex and problematic genius. Much emphasis is placed on the composer's wife Alma and her frustration of having her own artistic ambitions thwarted by Mahler's ego-centered demands. There are lots of well-placed quotations from Mahlert's symphonies. To sum it up: A must for Mahler-fans, of which there are a lot more today than when the film was made.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Insightful, providing explanations and tactics for people that are somewhat introverted, shy or not. It is also useful for understanding others in your life, those who might need more downtime and quiet. Overall, it was an enjoyable read, but I was less enthused as the book went on, as it transitioned from the scientific basis of introversion to real life stories and strategies.\\"
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I don't understand why there was so much hostility to this film.  Perhaps the three openings confused people.  But once into the story, the film worked well.  I liked the characters, the actors who played them, and the FX.  I think if they had named the film Princess of Mars instead of John Carter it might have brought in more people.  I don't know.  This a good film, and one I recommend watched.  You'll see that the openings are confusing yes, but  as for the rest, well, just watch and see.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I thought this was superior to the first movie. A lot of fun to watch, a beautiful film (digital backdrops were gorgeous), RDJ is not quite as out-of-control as in the first film. The plot moves along and the action is exciting and not as over-the-top as in the first movie. I personally thought the \\"bullet time\\"/Matrix-like moments were excellent, very artfully done. It's funny, it's exciting, it's got RDJ (and Jude Law) in top form, and a wonderfully evil villain. What's not to like?<br /><br />But then there's the whiners and complainers \\"getting back\\" at Amazon with their one-star ratings.  What's got their undies in an uproar? The Ultraviolet copy doesn't work! Heavens! You people need some REAL problems. You've got electricity that's on 24/7, clean drinking water, a safe clean home to live in, you're most likely American (as I am) and spoiled completely rotten. You've got an incredible magic viewing screen that shows you BluRay movies that are stunningly realistic--truly a miracle device. Meanwhile, 800 million people (nearly the US population x 3) have no access to drinkable water. And you are pissed off because something you don't really need isn't working as promised. Give me a break. Try spending the day collecting cow dung for fuel and then tell me about your stupid Ultraviolet copy problem.<br /><br />Another reason this movie (and the BBC show \\"Sherlock\\") get panned here is because it's not true to the original books and stories. I call these types fundamentalists, and suggest that you ignore their ratings, too. What you're left with is a 5 star rating, as far as I can see. Can't wait for the next installment!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded it just last week and I'm so addicted. It is a lot of fun.. prepare to not stop playing.  This game is similar to the real game on any other computer. With very good quality. I would buy it for $2; which makes me happy that it is free! :)

B005LAIGSC|4.0|Great plot twists, Jaw-dropping Action, and overall very well put together. Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds really pulled this one off. This was a highly entertaining CIA movie and I deffinitely recommend as a purchase.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game!  fun and challenging!  The kids love it too.  works great on the kindle!  I would definitely  recommend it.
B005LAIGZU|4.0|The movie starts out at a slow pace piecing together both factions, Good and Bad. There is a good character build before the plot starts to unfold. I wont give out any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet, but I will give you a summary of what it's about. Basically a psyched out Jihad has reaquainted himself with an old childhood friend who is now a smuggler and they both plot to carry out a terrorist attack on the US and it's up to the Seal's job to do what they gotta do to stop them. The camera angles switching from First person to third person were done great. Reminded me of playing Call of Duty when it went to 1st person POV. The cinematics were great, excellent action scenes. OFCOURSE the acting was off I mean they were REAL Navy Seals but it wasn't that bad considering. Overall I highly recommend this movie. It gets to your emotions and deffinitely makes you realise what these brave men go through just to protect our freedom.
B0083EXW50|5.0|The album is well,, \\"Fear Factory\\" I can see why many would say a 4 star, FEAR FACTORY has not changed much , similar riffs, similar screams and clear vocals, They have not changed there style, nor should they have too, there music does hold a deeper meaning if wise enough to see it in their words. Not to mention they \\"STILL\\" can bring the thunder which is the real REASON WHY THIS ALBUM KICKS A$$! FIVE STARS.
B005PV81MS|1.0|I want my rental money back. All the positive reviews are totally misleading.  Aliens invade and are able to be beaten back by a bunch of thug kids with bats, the movie takes this seriously and there is nothing fun about it. Nothing likeable about any of the characters. Total absolute garbage!
0345803485|5.0|Could not put this book down. Finished it in no time and can't wait to get started on the second one. It is brilliant!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|exciting game with many twists and turns. easy to play, hard to master. you may come to hate monkies, trees, and flamethrowers
0790725657|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! I watched this as a child and fell in love with Sara, Becky, Captain Crewe, and even Lottie! The story is beautifully told and the acting is superb. Even now, watching as an adult seventeen years later, I still cry at certain moments in the movie. Every child should have the opportunity to experience the magic and hope of \\"A Little Princess\\".<br /><br />Side Note - This version is much better than the older one with Shirley Temple. There's no comparison really.
1597801585|5.0|This is an amazingly rich and detailed vision of a dystopian future after global trade and agriculture have been devastated by a rise in sea-levels, genetic modifications gone awry and the exhaustion of petroleum. Things move along a bit fast in the final chapters, and it may seem a bit rushed, but the pace was fine for me.<br /><br />The first half of the book is a gradual reveal of the world, and a slow buildup to the crisis at the end. The characters may appear \\"flat\\", but that is largely because they're trapped by circumstances and there isn't a lot of room for them to maneuver. There are no heroes here, and no happy endings. Any reader looking for a character to root for is going to end up disappointed. Uncompromising crusaders and conniving pragmatists are both equally adept at destroying themselves and those around them in this world.<br /><br />My only quibble with the world as imagined is that I think our energy future is brighter than Bacigalupi suggests, alternative energy sources should help us avoid returning to domesticated animals as a power source. Anyone who has seen Asian farmers transporting produce on a bullock cart while talking on their cell-phones will have no trouble understanding how genetically engineered animals might be used to power factories.<br /><br />The novel is one of the best expressions of how fragile our extremely comfortable and privileged lives are. Characters whose lives have been completely overturned, either by large-scale riots, or the actions of a bureaucracy respond in different ways to the memory of their powerlessness. Bacigalupi's description of urban rioting is amongst the best I've seen.<br /><br />This is a dense, well, written, powerful book written for a thoughtful reader. It is not simple but few good books ever are.
B008434PC4|5.0|loved it !I,m a big fan of criminal minds,can't wait for new season to start again.I watch reruns all the time!
B004VQRCF0|5.0|Okay, I'm biased. My new wife and I (we'd been married less than 9 months) had just seen Yes at the Oakland Coliseum (\\"in the round\\") several months before, and were back in Mountain View at the Shoreline Amphiteater for this show. I'd been a prog-head my whole life, but my bride was a recent initiate, having been introduced to Yes music via a ABWH show in Seattle a year or two earlier. At the time, the excitement generated by having past and present members of Yes on the same stage playing the canon's \\"greatest hits\\" was palpable and simply cannot be overstated. It started a tradition of our seeing Yes at nearly every opportunity when their tours brought them through the Pacific Northwest. This show remains a high point in our memory.<br />That being said, as a document, the DVD gives us all we need. Yeah, yeah, I know, the show is cut, but the material that was cut was stuff from the \\"Union\\" album and Jon's solo performance. We didn't go to the show to hear that stuff, anyway.<br />Here's hoping that there's a DVD out there of similar quality that documents the one of the shows from the \\"Talk\\" tour in 1994.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I wanted Cheryl to keep walking so she could share more of her experiences.
0679720200|3.0|This book is interesting in spots.  Its portrait of a disaffected \\"outsider\\" whose emotional responses are shallow, whose sense of morality works against self-interest, and who focuses on trivia seems to have influenced other writers and works (I'm thinking \\"American Psycho\\" and \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", particularly).<br /><br />The sequences about the old man and his dog are the strongest, very poetic.  The whole portion around those dealing with the protagonist's last days of freedom are evocative and well-written.  The rest slows down.  I think that I understand Camus' intentions and subtext, and they're interesting, but the book is hit-or-miss.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Good story with a short climax and quick ending. I enjoyed it but wouldn't recommend it to friends. The Lucky One is a quick read!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have to play it every day or I feel lost!! I love the challenge and the fact I have to use my brain!!!
B007MDQW3W|3.0|I am a huge Regina Spektor fan and I am disappointed by this album.  It lacks a lot of the heart and soul of Begin to Hope and Soviet Kitsch.  It seems like it was written to appeal to a more mainstream audience by abandoning the wonderful artistic quality of her earlier works.  There are no outstanding vocal performances that are the hallmark of her other albums.  She does not show her true musical gifts in any of the songs.  She cones close in one or two but there are none that rise to the level of Samson, On the Radio, Us, or Human of the Year.

B007N85ZXY|4.0|This album is not as bad as some reviews (MOJO gave it just two stars amidst great castigation and you can see here that there are a lot of ones and twos) say it is. First and foremost for me, it is just simply wonderful to hear these guys playing something/anything after all these years. The sound is raucous and undisciplined, with a real analog feel to it. Be sure to keep the volume up high (duh!) because there's all sorts of dialogue going on among the band members. Secondly, it's very, very surprising to hear these archetypical standards not just performed differently, but absolutely reinvented. This is particularly the case with the first three cuts where the transposition of these `classic' lyrics onto a Crazy Horse melody palette works far better than it sounds like it should. And, to be sure, this reinvention works better on some songs than other. The version of 'She'll Be Coming Round Mountain' is driven by a melody that imparts a drama to the song that I never heard from the orignal. The same can be said of 'My Darling Clementine,' where the already somber story is presented with a touch of cynicism and chauvinism.<br /><br />Now, while it's great - sublime even - to hear new Neil Young and Crazy Horse material, this album doesn't break new ground. But, maybe as another reviewer said, we shouldn't be surprised by that. I've always felt that Crazy Horse is where Young goes to rejuvenate himself. In the past, he hasn't stayed away this long from them. There were reports of acrimony between members dating back to the `Greendale' period and since then the albums have been, perhaps, stubbornly personalized - something about which I'm sure David Geffen could agree.<br /><br />So, how do you rate a CD of public domain folk standards where melodies are turned on their heads; a `tip-of-the-hat' to Stephen Stills via a song on which he sang just before forming Buffalo Springfield; a doo-wop standard ('Get a Job') and a transmogrification of the UK national anthem (with some new lyrics, by the way) into `My Country Tis of Thee.'<br /><br />You know, folks have won American Idol for doing just that. How often have we heard a judge (usually Cowell) complain about a lackluster performance by demanding the contestant do something original with the song? That's what goes on here and, because of that, it rates four stars.ith some new lyrics, by the way) into `My Country Tis of Thee.'<br /><br />You know, folks have won American Idol for doing just that.

0099579936|1.0|I've never been compelled to write a review after the second chapter before.  All I can say is I wish I'd read the reviews before buying this 'book'. I can safely say 'damn' and 'damn' and 'jeez' again and again at the absolutely appalling writing style I have encountered from the start.  I have cringed my way through chapter 1 and 'blushed' and 'flushed' my way through chapter 2.  Jeez!  This makes Mills and Boon look like Austen!  I'm not sure I can put myself through any more of this.  In a nutshell it's the Teletubbies of book-writing.  Well, I'm afraid I don't get a buzz from repetitive, unintelligent adjectives and already I really couldn't care what happens to either hero or heroine (I use the terms loosely).  I am so disappointed that the masses can find this entertaining in any way.  If in doubt, check out page 24.....besieged....I say BESIEGED they are at that store!!  Editors.....for shame on you!  Damn!
B00845PV16|1.0|I wont waste my time describing how poor a movie this is. Gone are any interesting elements of the 1st movie. Read and believe all the other poor reviews.....wish I did before I paid for it. So bad, I turned it off 15 minutes into the film. Nuff Said!!!
0446310786|5.0|Everyone else has said it all.  I don't know how I avoided this book for so long, but I did, until a week ago.  What makes it a classic?  Harper Lee could have written that book last week instead of 50+ years ago.  Sadly, race equality is still an issue for many. Luckily, there are still people like Atticus Finch to uphold moral values.
034580404X|1.0|Just finished 3rd chapter in 50 Shades.....BIG YAWN.<br /><br />I even read ahead....trying to find something arousing.....NaDa.  This book is poorly written and doesn't leave much to the imagination.<br /><br />I'd rather read erotic porn or WATCH porn.<br /><br />I guess if you are a teenager or in your 20s this series could be titillating....<br /><br />It is an S&M Twilight...and I didn't enjoy Twilight after New Moon....sick of these types of....\\"heroines\\"....cough.....<br /><br />Returning the trilogy today...I have zero interest in what happens to these characters....
B00846REIS|1.0|This book was suggested by amazon because I had previously purchased fifty shades of grey. I purchased with high hopes after seeing it received 4 stars. I would give it no stars, but it's not an option. The character build up is awful, and it just felt like an awful version of Fifty shades of grey. Don't waste your money!!!!!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I have often said I am not a romance fan, but I am starting to rethink this statement.  I am not a traditional romance fan.  I do, however, enjoy these contemporary romances I've recently been turned on to.<br />Beautiful disaster spared me most of the eye rolling moments I have when reading a traditional romance;I appreaciate the authors choice to use realistic language and crazy situations (underworld fighting, underage drinking, underage gambling!!!)right out of the gate.  This is not only a ploy to a younger audience-it is an absolute necessity for the contemporary audience who appreaciates some grit.<br />For once I DIDN'T have the urge to throat punch the main character (bonus).  Abby has realistic reactions and her backstory was completely unpredictable, which I appreaciated.<br />Travis appealed to the alpha male lover in me (tats and all), and I really dug that he was not a knight in shining armor on a big white steed.<br />The author did a nice job with pacing her story and I felt like I had the information I needed at the time I needed it, from the readers perspective.  I will mention that I felt like some of the physical description was a bit lacking-I made a lot of false assumptions about what characters looked like before the were described, which can be a bit jarring as a reader.  Also, there were scene transitions that did not have the *** breaks I am accustomed to, but these are tiny, techinical, knitpicky comments aimed merely as genuine feedback for a talented writer.  Nice job!
0785134352|4.0|The book is fantastic i would give it five stars but when i recieved it the book was slightly damaged and had stickers all over it because it was from a library in another state.All in all its a good book and i would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes superhero books.

B00004Z459|5.0|I really grooved on this blend of nu metal, rap, and electronic alternative pop when it came out and I still do.  Not a bad song in the bunch and every song a potential hit (excepting for \\"Cure for the Itch\\").  Fun, energizing aggro elements and some decent lyrical ideas.  Not to mention those great videos that came out with their hits.  I can't really pick highlights for this CD because they're all so good.  LP never sounded or got better IMO.

B007RKPO84|5.0|For a thrash band who had one of the most successful comebacks with the last decade, Kreator show absolutely no signs of slowing down on this their lastest album, Phantom Antichrist. The band has successfully figured out to makes not only great, modern day thrash metal, but modern albums that can proudly sit next to their late 80's-early 90's material. That's not a easy feat for most veteran bands, but Kreator have proved to be like fine wine. On this album, Mille continues to write relevant lyrics on what is happening in today's world. I like to think of him as the Bruce Springsteen of thrash, in the best terms of course. The music and lyrics combined create such a lethal mix, it's nearly impossible to compare the band to any other. From the political and financial turmoils happening in the Euro nations at the moment, to the downright existence of the earth and human race, Mille nails it again. Along with the music, which is crushing, along with perfect blends of melodic harmonies mixed in, the band is on fire. The solos and even some of the rhythm work is quite amazing and intricate. Every track is strong, no filler on this album. So if you're looking for quality metal in both lyrical and musical terms in today's world, you can't go wrong with Kreator's Phantom Antichrist, along with their past 3 albums. Consistently killer!

0765342294|4.0|The book is about a child in the future who is being prepared to defeat an alien invasion.  While the language may be a little easy for adults, if you enjoy science fiction books, it is well written.  My 9 year old son read it after me and loved it as well.
0671027344|5.0|This book is absolutely brilliant. The story grabs you and won't let you go. After I finished reading the last page I just laid there on my bed thinking about how real Charlie, Sam, and Patrick are. I thought about my own life, and how many of Charlie's letters reminded me of experiences I have had. This piece of literature deals with sex, drugs, love, bigotry, suicide, molestation, homosexuality, music, and great literary works. In my opinion PBW should not be read by those younger than high school students but then it should by everyone. This book is a masterpiece. It is on par with Catcher in the Rye, The Color Purple, and Black Boy. I would recommend this book to anyone. It's a grand coming of age story, told by a master storyteller. I was greatly moved. Read it.
B005RAQ42Q|5.0|I'll admit, I had never heard of Mayer Hawthorne until a recent episode of '90210' and he was performing \\"You Called Me\\".  I was instantly hooked and had to go and download the album - and glad I did.  His songs, vocals and melodies are AMAZING!  After downloading 'How Do You Do', I went and purchased other songs.  One of my favorites is a cover he does of Chromeo, \\"When The Night Falls\\" - great song!  There are a few artists I listen to over and over again, but I can honestly say I listent to his songs pretty much on repeat because they are just that good.  I can't wait until his next album and looking forward to seeing him on tour.  I highly recommend this artist to anyone who enjoys good music!

B000Z27HLS|1.0|I am a Jane Austin fan,but this one is really lacking compared to \\"Emma\\" and \\"Pride & Prejudice\\". It's as if Jane, one evening, didn\\"t have anything else to do, so she whipped up a quick story. The story is bad and the acting.

The characters are well acted. I loved the comments made between the main two actors. It was real and cute.  The customes were nice and simple, but well done. Once again I loved the two main character remarks between each other. Also, the camera shots of the flowers and showing season changings was very good and colorful. I'll watch this over and over again. My husband will watch it again with me.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|[[ASIN:0984183523 Case Interview Secrets: A Former McKinsey Interviewer Reveals How to Get Multiple Job Offers in Consulting]] is an awesome book for anyone who is interested in going into consulting jobs at major consulting companies. The author provide a insight into the whole process of job interview form the mindset of the interviewer to the frameworks that will guide the case interview. Would recommend this book to anyone looking to excel in case interview and land a job.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have watched the first and second series.  A very good story. The best part was Maggie Smith's. She is a woman with strong opinions and sharp remarks. It keeps you waiting for more.  The customes and setting is wonderful. It let's you in on what the house staff is doing and thinking. Also, how the elitest house hold may have worked in that day. There is one bedroom happening with the oldest daughter, but it doesn't show anything, just implies. I liked the way they shot it. With series tho, you don't always has an ending.  But it was good what I saw of it.

1466401885|5.0|Here is a short review for those on the fence on buying this book.  DO IT!  This ia a very well written book with very flawed characters and it is absolutely impossible to put down.  I read it in less then 2 days.  I am in awww of the relationship between Travis and Pigeon.....great read!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|seems like a classic solitaire.  enjoy the winning hand deal, some of us r sore loosers. layout is nice too
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|this book was excellent! it started off a bit slow, but quickly became a book I couldn't put down and couldn't wait to have a free moment to read. somewhere in the middle it slows down again but never enough to put down the book. it was thought provoking and exciting. I finished reading it over a month ago and I still have dreams that I am a character in the novel or that follow around the characters.

0765365278|5.0|I have NEVER read any book twice. Once has always been enough for me. But I found that it deserved that. By the end of the book I found I wanted to change the kind of person I was. This book made me want to be a better person. You care deeply for these characters and it affects you to have to end their story till book two, whatever characters those may be. Read this book. You've seen the great reviews, but you do not realize the opportunity you have with this book. Brandon Sanderson has changed how I look at literature in general and has given the world a new way of looking at their exterior. This does just give you happiness that it was \\"a good book\\" but will give you something that lasts throughout your life, having changed your outlook on it.
B00425S1H8|4.0|I mainly wanted this usb/serial adapter so that I could use my newer laptop with no serial port with my older, computer-controlled TenTec RX320 shortwave radio receiver.  It does work for that, once I used Control Panel/System settings to change the adapter's port to be COM1 or COM2 (it defaulted to COM12).  The radio's control software, being older, didn't have settings for COM ports beyond 2 or 4, depending on which program I was trying.  Some programs didn't seem to recognize the port anyway, but some did.<br /><br />So, now I can use the radio again, with my current PC.  I kept my old desktop with XP and Win98 on it around, partly so I could still use the radio.  Now I have more flexibility in where I use the radio, but less flexibility in which control software I use.<br /><br />I also hope to use the adapter cable with my older handheld Cobra 1000 GPS unit, which uses a serial port for data and map transfer.  I haven't gotten around to trying that yet, but I wanted to get a review posted saying that the cable did work with my Vista and my RX320.  And I didn't even use the CD that came with the adapter cable!  Windows searched and found the driver online.<br /><br />I also have an old, old HP pen plotter with only a serial port, and now I may be able to use that with my laptop as well.  That trial is even farther in the future than the GPS test.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I chose this adapter cable and I consider it a good bargain.
0393339882|5.0|This work is simply brilliant!<br /><br />I have so many good things to say about this work that I will have to selectively give the points I think are most important.  First, this book stands as a tremendous work of scholarship.  For enyone interested in verifying that Kumar got the story right, he laboriously includes endnotes.  The truly amazing part about this book is that, while upholding the high standard just mentioned, he also makes it unbelievably accessible; the text reads very smoothly.  I am not sure how to describe the writing, because the writing is journalistic, but I mean that in a good way: it is as though Kumar has such a grasp of what was going on, the important underlying stories that are involved, and an organized view of it all, and as though he were there, as a someone documenting the goings-on.  This book really is quite enthralling!<br /><br />I must comment on Kumar's handle of the subject matter, because I think it is important.  That Kumar has a more than adequate knowledge of philosophy and physics, he stands to give, what I think is, a rare, thoroughly understood account of the minutia of the Bohr-Einstein debate.  Kumar's understanding of the details is so precise that, in each instance where I anticipated a particularly relevant point should be brought up, it was.  Even better, I had some questions in my mind, with regard to more than a few historical facts, and Kumar was immediately on it, within a paragraph or two, addressing and clarifying.  I would say that one of the great successes of this work is that Kumar has a very strong grasp of how the theories are changing over time.  A great example of this comes in his discussion of Planck's evolving ideas about the quantum, especially, within the context of Wien's law.  This is simply an outstanding, well told, and thoroughly organized presentation of events and theories, which led to the subsequent alteration of physical theory.<br /><br />This book has all of the hallmarks of a fine piece of history of science.  My only wish would be for it to have included more equations, as they developed through time, and some of the more technical details that a physicist or historian of physics might like to see.  Admittedly, Kumar designed this work to be accessible to a general audience, but I think the addition of equations, which would have told the story from another perspective, would have made this book a top tier piece of scholarship in philosophy of science.  As it is, I think it still stands as a formidable piece of scholarship in the history and philosophy of science.<br /><br />The book was a joy to read.piece of history of science.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|The Game of Thrones: Season One was one of the best miniseries that HBO has ever shown. The popularity of this series has grown largely by word of mouth and from a base of rabid fans of the book series by George R.R. Martin. After watching the first series, I was so enamored by the story I bought the 4-book bundle from the Kindle store and read them all in just over 3 months. Having the series on DVD or Blu-Ray with the extended features makes the experience even better and I'll be able to watch it over and over, and this is a series that you can watch over and over and enjoy each time.<br /><br />You also may have heard of the recent controversy involving comments made by the shows creators regarding a certain head on a spike looking very similar to one of our nation's recent ex-presidents. HBO decided to re-release new copies of this series in both DVD and Blu-Ray removing the offending scenes. It's a shame that this controversy had to happen because the miniseries is great and didn't needed the added connection to the real world intrigue. Shame on the show creators for doing that. However, if you are lucky and buy soon enough, you may snatch up the remaining stock of the original, unaltered discs which are bound to become highly sought after and collectible. I bought my copy on June 6 and it shipped June 8.<br /><br />My only regret was that I ordered the Gold Box special for the DVD version instead of the Blu-Ray version but other than that, I have no regrets.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|no one else has dared do this before so i give the creators kudos for daring and innovation.  that is, to transport the series into present day and make sherlock present day obnoxious.  he has an impossible personality in his own era but it has been updated to fit in the present.  the lead actor captures this perfectly and it is impossible to picture him in a relationship of any sort other than what he has with watson.  this is, of course, precisely the way conan doyle created him on the page. i've read that the actor playing sherlock has become so popular that he is now besieged with other roles.<br /><br />in this second series the creators increase their daring by taking on three of the most challenging Holmesian sagas.  There is the meeting of Irene Adler in SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA, Moriarty in RIECHENBAKER FALLS and my personal favorite, being a dog lover, HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES. These are also newly adapted to fit the modern era and some viewersdo not like the radical changes.  However,  why even bother doing this series if you aren't going to take these risks?  after all, is anyone going to equal Jeremy brett's rendition of the original doyle masterpieces set in their rightful era? no, i don't think so.<br /><br />you will enjoy this is you are willing to alter your perceptions of sherlock holmes and imagine him as a present day detective.  if you find the very idea appalling, this is not for you.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00633W614|5.0|Jeffery Archer has done it again! His writing is so compelling that I couldn't put the book down until the very end, and then I immediately started the second one in the trilogy. I can't wait for the next book to be released!  The characters he's created jump off the page at you and it's like you're in the scenes with them. They are both wonderful books.
B0054R6BFM|2.0|I think the author's point in writing this story can probably be summed up in this statement by the main character, Hannah (who committed suicide): \\"I guess that's the point of it all.  No one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people.  Oftentimes, we have no clue.  Yet we push it just the same.\\"  I think the book does drive home the message that we should be more mindful of how our actions (whether intentional or not, whether joking/cruel/oblivious, whether \\"minor\\" or obvious) can have a major impact on someone's life either directly and/or by causing a chain reaction by other people.  That's probably a good thing for everyone (especially teens) to live more aware of- I have actually said something similar to some teens on several occasions.  Another point is that if you could have helped but missed the signs, not to let it happen again with someone else.<br /><br />Hannah decides to confront everyone that she blames for their contribution to her decision (in the form of a taped message delivered post-death) so that they will understand her (and, it's implied, never forget what they have done wrong).  The reasons vary from starting rumors, to taking advantage of her (socially or physically), to pettiness in various forms, to not helping her enough or bringing her down more (even though most had no idea what she was going through).  Again, this is an effective way of getting across the point in the first paragraph (which I agree with) and probably illustrates the message to teens better than just telling them.  At the same time(and I'm saying this as someone who doesn't know anyone personally who has committed suicide), I don't think blame is always that black or white, and it may not be fair to heap guilt on everyone.  I'm not saying that other people don't ever contribute (i.e. bullying) or shouldn't have been more aware, or shouldn't become more aware after it happens, especially if it will help someone else (including in this book), but parts of the book just seem petty or vengeful.<br /><br />I guess the decision about whether you should read the book and/or give it to someone else, especially a teen, really depends on if you (or the teen) need to be hit harder with the messages in this book: be mindful of the impact you can have on other people; don't be too self-absorbed/cool/afraid/etc. to help someone that might be in trouble.  This book probably isn't a good idea for someone who experienced the suicide of a close friend/relative (unless you are blaming him/her and trying to impose more guilt!)  I found it a very suffocating read (although that may have been the intent).  I almost never (perhaps twice in my entire life) read the ending midway through the book, but I had to do that with this one, to see how it concludes and decide whether to go back and read the rest because it became that difficult to read (I jumped around and eventually finished).  Also to note for parents of teens, there is a graphic sexual part.  Conclusion: effective literary device to get across a couple of good points but I'm not sure if it's worth the read beyond that (or even for that) purpose.
B007SGM084|5.0|While this book is not the best written book I have ever read (spelling errors, punctuation problems) that story line is good enough that you over look the bad grammar and just keep turning the page.  The story draws you in and you can't wait to hear what happens next, very hard book to put down and a quick read.

0345803485|1.0|This book is horrible. Very upset that I even purchased it and wasted my time reading it.<br />The book is very poorly written. People who are praising it must not read much.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|Rush is my favorite band. I own all their studio albums and most of the live ones. This album sounds a lot like the past three from RUSH: like they spent a lot more time overdubbing in the studio than songwriting. If you stripped these songs down to a vocal melody, words, and one accompanying instrument, you'd realize that these are weak, yet masterfully produced, songs. The sections are disjointed, the album doesn't flow well, and some of the slower, touchy-feely piano/acoustic sections are downright annoying. The lyrics are cryptic and preachy as is often the case with this band.  Oh yeah and the album is 67 FREAKIN MINUTES LONG!!  An acceptable album length is 30-45 minutes.<br /><br />RUSH gave us the longest streak of great albums ever from 1976-1989, and we should remember that.  But this album is just disappointing.
B0078N2T8I|5.0|This one leaves just the right amount of ambiguity after the final scene.  The director doesn't beat you over the head with all the answers.  Draw your own conclusions.
0307730697|5.0|I read this book in just over 24 hours.  Having read many of the books about the military and Navy SEALs I must say that this one truly stands out as unique.  It is a completely candid view of Adam Brown's life, both good and bad.  He was not perfect and had his demons.  This book shows the reader a truly inspirational story and in so forces the reader to examine their own life and strive to be better.

0307957934|3.0|Robert Harris has had enormous success as a writer of what might best be described as historical thrillers.  He has produced masterpieces set in Classical Rome or during WWII that have earned him a loyal fan base.  He draws on the same intuition to create atmospheric contemporary works.  His writing is just as good as ever in The Fear Index, but rather as in Ghost Writer, he stretches his main theme of conspiracy / paranoia just a little too far for the final account to be totally compelling.  Power is always corrupting and this time, it is the economic power wielded by a small handful of super smart, super arrogant investment gurus and the computer systems they have developed to turn massive profits at every twitch of the global markets.  Only this time the events scale up quickly to seismic catastrophes and it is far from clear who is controlling events as the financial tsunamis start rolling in.  Sound familiar?
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app.  easy to use and read.  first thing I check each day.  love it.kids love it too. could get it everyday.
B001TODCII|5.0|A retired CIA agent lets his ex-wife twist his arm into letting their daughter round all over Europe.  He warned them of the possible and we would not have a movie if the possible did not happen. Yep the daughter was abducted by a ruthless cabal or two to serve in an unsavory capacity.<br /><br />\\"Let her go and you won't die.\\" Now how many movies have we heard that in? Well a lot. But Liam Neeson can run with the best of them. He fights the odds and so-called friends to shoot, drive, stab, and what not his way through Sleaze Town and more.<br /><br />Will he succeed?

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Fascinating book. Can't wait till our book club discusses it. Trying to figure out the genre: is it sci-fi, fantasy, mystery, psychological intrigue?  Or a mixture of all.  Only problem with having it on Kindle was reading the written letters and seeing the photos well. A \\"real\\" book or a larger e-reader would have been better.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|No american college students speak like this.  i cant get over the stiff writing. (an english author is trying to set a book outside of Portland/seattle about a recent college grad) How many 22 year olds quote poetry and use the word keen?  i have no problem with subject matter, the sexual dialogue etc etc, but the conversations they have are so stiff and unlike the way americans speak, i just couldnt get past that.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|This book gives good understanding of Habits, how they are formed and how they can be changed. Habit is a process consisting of three steps - Cue, Routine and Reward. Cue is a trigger which tells the brain to go into automatic mode. Routine is the task performed which can be physical or mental or emotional. Reward is result achieved by doing the routine.<br /><br />Author also explains that old habits don't die. Even if we change our habits, old habit still exist in brain but remain dormant to new habit. He also gives examples of how habits can be changed effectively. To change a habit, one has to keep the cue and reward same but change the routine.<br /><br />For the change in habit to last long, one has to have belief that change is possible. Without strong belief, habit change won't last long.
1597801585|4.0|I checked this book out on CD from my local library. I tried to listen to it for three weeks and kept falling asleep. I had to replay several of the CD's. I love science fiction and have read it all my life. I'm also a voracious reader. Needless to say, I was very suprised to have my attention wander so drastically during the reading of a book that had received so many prestigious sci fi awards.<br /><br />I finally broke down and bought the e-version of the book to read. It has made a world of difference for me. Because the style of the book is so choppy (yes, I can tell the author penned mainly short fiction prior to this effort)and it relies so heavily on jargon with which I am not familiar, I found I really needed to process the writing in its written form. This is not a book I can scrub the sink and fold laundry to! I have to concentrate and immerse myself fully in PB's world. Sometimes that's not easy because it's so depressing.<br /><br />I think parts of the work are masterful and so intriguing. I also think parts of the work are redundant, disorganized and a bit shallow (in terms of characterization, not philosophy). However, the latter occur because readers are viewing this dystopian world from so many points of view. If I could be a fly on a wall in several of my friends' and family members' living rooms perhaps I would hear about the same subjects over and over again in different ways too. So, the book is lifelike in its overlaps. I just tend to like stronger plotting even though it's not \\"real.\\"<br /><br />I'm glad I experienced this book. I can't stop thinking about it; a good sign. I just hope PB's next one is more like a novel--like a continuous, tarnished silver band instead of like so many algae-slimed, pearly short stories loosely knotted together on a gritty string.
B007NZDES0|2.0|This sure seems lip synced, and a tremendous amount of odd camera angles that almost always feature the microphone directly in front of her mouth, or shadows on her mouth when the camera is close up. The audio is so incredibly perfect and close to the original, sure makes me wonder if she is lip syncing or singing with stacks... I am often wrong, so I could be wrong about this...<br />(There is an online video of an August 26, 2011 Oakland, CA concert during the song, \\"Cherish The Day\\" where the vocals start and she is not moving her mouth yet, about the 3:38 time frame on the video. If someone is going to lip sync, often editors will not feature the singer close up at the start of a line or sometimes near the ending of line... because that is the most difficult time for the singer to hit exactly. That is what happens at 3:38 or so on the Cherish The Day song in Oakland... she misses the mark. Several people posting under comments catch it and post, \\"Why lip sync?\\".)<br />My observation in most concerts it is very, very difficult for singers to hit the original vocals so closely. Most concert videos will tell on an artist a little - it is difficult to repeat that excellent studio performance. Again, the microphone directly in front of her mouth hiding her lips, and snappy editing that rarely stays with her close up very long - sure makes this one look odd...<br />BUT... I could be wrong...

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Got this book the other day simply because of the great reviews it had and the fact that it was only $1.50.  I read through the book in about 3 sittings and was hooked almost from the beginning.  I'm not a literary critic by any means, I simply look for a book with an engaging story, beleivable interpersonal interactions, and something unique that sets the story apart from the MANY other books in the same genre.  I don't particularly look for, and am not distracted by typos or minor grammatical errors.  If I notice them, eh it it was a $1.50, it will be fixed in the next installment of the series.<br /><br />As far as story goes the only nitpick I have are, the blood song needs to be explained better in the next book, I believe the author was intentionally vague in this first book as the character himself doesn't know that much about it.<br /><br />This was a great book book and I will definitely buy the next one when it comes out in kindle format, please don't do a wheel of time and release the kindle format after the real book release.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was a real page turner. I read a LOT of post apocalyptic books, but this one is on another level. I couldn't put it down. I was actually pretty surprised, I had low expectations after seeing the book was a collection of short novels, but it read like a novel, I couldn't imagine starting earlier and having to wait for installments. It's really cheap too, less than 6 bucks. Read it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|its just like a real Bible, except not with one version. I'm 12 and decided I wanted to he more spiritual and learn more for now and the future. I don't understand the king James version just like MANY others,  that's why I enjoy having different versions to choose from. for anyone who is spiritual, should get this app. and if you sign up you can download versions for offline reading.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a very easy to read fun summer book. You will hate to love Christian. He has a mysterious irresistible way about him and it's easy to see the dilemma Ms. Steele has found herself in. You will find yourself giggling as you read this book and possibly biting your bottom lip from time to time. I enjoyed the uncomfortable sexiness about this book. My husband is so happy I read this (lol).  Read and Enjoy!!!

B0073LWEXK|5.0|uugubibbjbibbjbjbi means awesome my friend's told me it was great and it was!) great awesome and<br />supper uneak! it is also hard!
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Pros: Lots of action,<br />  The story line moved quickly,<br />  Good special effects, most of them anyway.<br />  Characters you will find interesting (the disabled vet or the retired vets for example)<br />  The lead Taylor K. is actually enjoyable.<br />  They even give a shout out to the board game in a very tense scene.<br /><br />Cons: Rihanna?? Really? I guess Katty Perry was busy.<br />  Editing- example in one scene Rihanna is done up in full make up (not very realistic for someone in the military), then in the next scene two seconds later she's a mess, then cut back  five seconds later and she looks like she's about to go on stage for a concert.<br />  Liam Nesson is barely used, more of a cameo.<br /><br />Yes you will be reminded by other similar movies (Independance Day, or any Jerry Bruckhiemer type movie), but it was a very entertaining movie, especially if you suspend all disbelief, and don't go in expecting much you might be in for a pleasant surprise.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|i liked it. interesting characters.  i liked it well enough to buy the sequel and will probably buy more from this author. this book would make a great movie.
1933952806|5.0|I purchased a new Nikon d7000 in April and purchased Mastering the Nikon D7000 at the same time.  I previously used a Nikon d70s.  You would think having spent six years with my d70s I would know how to use the D7000.  Thank heavens I purchased Mastering the Nikon D7000 at the same time.  The first thing I did after taking the camera out of the box was to sit down and start reading.  It was fantastic because within the first few pages I understood what settings I needed to establish and the best part; the author explained why.  I also enjoyed reading the author's recommendations which I pretty much followed.  The book was easy to use and covered everything.  While there was some technical information I never felt overwhelmed.  Truth is, I use the book all the time because there are so many features on the camera that I need to refer to the book to better understand them.<br /><br />I highly recommend Mastering the Nikon D7000 by Darrell Young.<br /><br />Marv<br /><br />[[ASIN:1933952806 Mastering the Nikon D7000]]

1451627289|4.0|11/22/63, like everything written by King, is pulp, but it is damn good pulp. He didn't spend a lot of time pondering the ethics of time-travel or using advance knowledge of things to come, which is good because that is not King's strong point. The plot moved along nicely for the most part and remained engaging throughout. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has previously enjoyed a Stephen King novel.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Why did mainstream Hollywood media try to sink this picture? True, Disney did a terrible job at promoting it, but all I heard about John Carter was negative, that it was a big flop, a joke.  Not so!  This film will live on as a science fiction cult classic in my opinion, a nice shelf-worthy DVD for any true Sci-Fi collector.<br /><br />But you have to put this picture in its proper historical context and understand that these stories were primarily intended for young people, not adults. Most of these so-called \\"reviewers\\" failed to understand that, they reviewed this thing as if it were just another big-budget sci-fi extravaganza like Star Trek or Star Wars when, in fact, it was closer to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Awesome CGI, lots of action. Scripting seemed awkward at times but they probably were trying to stay true to the original text of the book. The beginning was rushed a bit and you have to pay close attention to the narration to understand the set-up.<br /><br />Hard-to-read subtitles were used in early scenes with Martian creatures called Tharks. Thankfully, Carter drinks some kind of elixir that allows him to understand their language and the awkward subtitles were no longer needed.<br /><br />The movie is based on a good example of early pre-1930's classic science fiction.  I know many reviewers balked at the some of the silly contrivances and gadgets shown in the movie, but it was true to much of science as it was known in Edgar Rice Burrough's  time (early 1900's); imagine how dumb Star Trek or Stargate Atlantis will look 100 yrs. from now.<br /><br />Another point: Many of Burrough's stories were targeted towards older children and young adults; science fiction and fantasy were not considered \\"proper\\" literature in those days, but was enjoyed by millions of bored kids as good escapist summer-time reading; there was no TV in those days, radio was still in its infancy as was the motion picture industry.  Reading and stage theater wereabout the only forms of popular entertainment available.<br /><br />Never the less, I think it would have been better to retell this story in a more modern setting.  Instead of Mars, pick one of the recently-discovered planets in a another solar system; update some of the technological references and replace the hokey teleportation amulet with something more in-keeping with known physics. You can do all this an still be faithful to the original story just as we are still faithful to Shakespeare via some 250 modern films based on his plays (like West Side Story or Forbidden Planet).

B007MDB71O|5.0|always a fan of the books.  I read them 30 years ago and loved them.  I feared<br />that the movie would not live up to the story.  This movie is a keeper the only<br />real downside is the Disney political infighting probably killed any chance at<br />them doing the second book.
2070643026|5.0|I decided to read the Harry Potter series in French because I was bored. The books are in great condition and are pretty easy and fun to read. If you are using them to help learn French I suggest keeping a tab open with wordreference.com and look up and make flash cards of the words you don't know. I have taken 5 years of french and I had 300 words after reading 66 pages. The reading isn't hard but there are quite a few magical/english words that are translated funny into french that you will want to write down and remember. It's really cool to see how it is translated.....there are little differences that make reading the series new all over again
B007PKSN6Q|1.0|I guess Tom Cruise will be fast tracking Mission Impossible 5. 15 mil opening weekend, an admitted disappointment for the studio. Doubt this will recover over the next few weeks.<br /><br />I suppose the Mission Impossible movies are all Cruise has left that will make money. I realize this is suppose to be a review for rock of ages soundtrack. But I thought it stunk back then and it doesn't seem to have swayed my opinion any less.<br /><br />Maybe Cruise should star in a movie about Scientology. Maybe he should leave the organization in a big stink, huge publicity, turn around and do a movie about all the crap we've been hearing about that cult. That might revive his career. Cuz lord knows, one day we're all going to get tired of Cruises' Ethan Hunt.

B0034G4P8A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie very much especially with the blu ray which really enhanced the film itself. The plot resembled prince and the pauper except with magic hammers, ice monsters and enchanted robots.  However i think they really could have done better with the romance part, there in love for about twenty minutes.  The acting was exceptional and plot always kept you on your toes (SPOIL ALERT!) Including the part where Loki fakes betraying Asgard and pretends to side with the frost giants in order to gain power. But when the time comes for Odin to be killed he slays their king. All in all a good buy!
0306812835|5.0|...By God and Man, is reviewed along the way by Gordon. While Timoshenko authors on the History of the Strength of Materials but really reviews the history of elasticity theory (Gordon lists him in the references at the end in Structures, as well as Cottrell- both outstanding men in their fields) Gordon ENLIGHTENS as to why things are the way they are and for better or worse were made that way. Not math intensive- you'll have to see Timoshenko for that. On the other hand, Timoshenko hardly touches on why materials crack and break, whereas Gordon reveals all on that topic. A Must Read for Engineers- Structural, Mechanical, Metallurgical, Materials-

B005LAIHY0|5.0|I was a little worried when I walked into the theater to see \\"Prometheus\\".  The stakes were high.  I'm an enormous fan of the Alien film series and the original is still my favorite (only by a narrow margin with the second though).  \\"Alien\\" was a Ridley Scott masterpiece.  It was dark, it was suspenseful, it was immersive, it was terrifying and launched one Ellen Ripley into the stuff of cinematic legend.  What would this new film, this mysterious \\"pseudo\\" prequel to Alien be like?  I had heard very mixed reviews and even outright thrashings of the movie.  Ridley Scott himself was reluctant to call it a true prequel and was very cryptic about what it was.  My hopes were firmly in check as I entered the theater.  Even if the reviews were bad, I still thought maybe there was hope.  Afterall, a lot of people hated \\"Alien Resurrection\\"-and I thought that was a great film.  (I even enjoy the AVP movies on some level-even if they aren't \\"real\\" Alien movies.  I hope that doesn't destroy my credibility here)  :)<br /><br />  I'm pleased to say that both myself and the buddy I was with LOVED Prometheus.  That being said, it was not at all what I expected.  Instead, it was something entirely unique.  In short, \\"Prometheus\\" was this strange new thing I discovered unlike any other film I have ever seen.  It was bold, it was gorgeous, it was thought provoking and it dared the audience to invest in it's odd mythos.  Plus, I never knew where the next crazy turn would take me.  There was just no way to predict what curveball would come next.  Hours, even days later after viewing it-I was still thinking back on it, trying to put pieces of it together, thinking about all of the elements and how the chain of circumstances came together to create the end result.  In today's age of disposable entertainment, where films are so easily forgettable the second the end credits roll-I found Prometheus to be a welcome disrupter to the flow.  It takes a special film for me to find myself repeatedly drawn back to it and drawn back to it I was.<br /><br />  Prometheus is a haunting film.  Not just for the world that it creates and the bizarre events that unfold, but also for the intriguing and memorable characters it introduces (David anyone?) and for the stunning beauty of the film itself.  I did not see the film in 3D, but will probably see a follow up viewing in 3D because I'm curious about the possibilities of what the third dimension could add to the film.  Prometheus truly is the most beautifully shot film I have seen since.....well I can't even remember.  It's an absolute visual stunner on every level and easily the most immersive Science Fiction film I have seen since the original Alien.<br /><br />  All of this being said, there were a few things I did not understand immediately following the film.  I will not go into them for fear of spoiling others, but the buddy I was with had a pretty strong theory on what the first few minutes of the film meant and also made a biblical correlation that I had missed completely.  (On both accounts I believe he was spot on).  The only major issue I had with Prometheus is a continuity problem with the original.  The way Prometheus ended did not line up for me.  In order for the Nostromo team to make their initial discovery in the original, events would have had to transpire a little differently than the way they did in Prometheus.  I don't quite understand that either since it seemed to me like like that particular plot hole would've been easy enough to fix.  I assume Ridley Scott knew what he was doing and I guess if you really want to get creative there are scenarios you could imagine where the two could possibly line up, but to me-it seemed like a gapping plot crater in an otherwise profound and thought provoking piece of Sci-Fi brilliance.  (Still loved the film though)  Prometheus is fairly open ended and even though I don't imagine there will be a sequel, I would absolutely love to see one made.  My hat's offto Ridley Scott and the writers for creating something so vastly unique.  That's really quite an accomplishment for a prequel (of sorts).
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I bought this pool for my 2 year old son and 8 month old daughter. I think it is perfect for their ages! I'm sure they will be able to play in and enjoy it until they are at least 4 as well. (hopefully longer!) I love that the sides are low so my son can easily jump in and out. Shallow enough for my baby daughter to sit in and splash but enough water for my 2 year old to enjoy. The slide is sturdy and even has a little inflatable pad down at the bottom so kids will have a softer landing. The only thing I don't like is that there is a drain/hole (without a plug) in the deeper wading pool so you can't really keep the water deeper in there. I guess the only real reason for the \\"deeper\\" pool is to support the slide. Not really a big deal though, and I understand that it is a safety feature.<br /><br />The inflatable toys that came with the pool are very cute, too. Especially the turtle! My daughter loves the turtle and the bells that are inside.  I'm sure once they are older they will enjoy the ring toss.<br /><br />I especially like that there is enough room for me to sit in the pool with my daughter and my son still has enough room of his own to splash around. Definitely the best pool I found and I looked at A LOT of inflatable pools online before I bought this one! I am very happy with my choice!<br /><br />I also bought the intex electric air pump and it filled up the pool within a matter of minutes. I definitely recommend getting an electric pump. There are several different air chambers to fill on this pool and it would be quite a workout with a manual pump.<br /><br />I only put 4 stars for durability just because the palm tree and one side of the slide deflated a little bit after a day. I think I may not have put enough air in that side of the slide to begin with, though. However, The sides are still firm after a week!<br /><br />I put 3 stars for educational, only because I view this as more of a \\"just for fun\\" toy, not an educational one. :)
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was the best I have read in a long while.  I hope she continues to write these types of books.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|It's a great MoBo, however, unfortunately it still runs the \\"traditional\\" style BIOS.<br />Not a deal breaker by any means, but I do like the form and function of the Intel Visual BIOS<br />Not really much more to say than what's already been said.
B00846REIS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  Some of the language was a bit more explicit than what I was used to in other romance novels - but I didn't feel like it took away from the storyline.  Speaking of which, I felt the story was good.  Two \\"damaged\\" main characters looking to create a relationship that can work for both of them. The relationship between Gideon and Eva is intense and explosive from the moment they lay eyes on each other.  During the course of the book their personal demons are revealed and the story progresses well from there.<br /><br />In addition, there are secondary characters featured in this book that actually have storylines as well.  I hope that those are explored in the upcoming books too.  It seems to me that Eva's best friend Cary definitely has a story worth telling.<br /><br />If the two follow-up books continue to build on the relationships started in this book - I think the author will have a winning series on her hands.<br /><br />If intense romance (and steamy sex scenes) are your thing...than give this book a try!
B002N5N5LG|1.0|My wife teaches at a community college and my son also attends. I was hoping for some clever, relatable, and warm humor from this series but found none. The characters are comic book fabrications. The alleged wit and cleverness of this show seems to consist of the ability of the characters to rattle off pop culture memes and references as rapidly as possible. I have tried to let this show grow on me but the characters are too inhuman. I wouldn't wish to know any people remotely like this. If you live in the real world all day long, have actual principles and values, and do genuine productive things and your idea of chilling out is to watch a bunch of nihilistic, parasitic, clueless, post modern knuckleheads grope their way through life than you should absolutely buy this.

0894803123|5.0|The Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Book has been my go to ice cream recipe bible since it first came out - LOVE it!  There are a few recipes that I use that are not out of this book (namely a salted caramel ice cream, and a chocolate lavender one) but this book has got just about anything you'd want to make in it.  I've given it for gifts and even have 2 myself because I thought I lost it (I'm keeping the duplicate in case I really do!).<br /><br />For those who have issues with the raw eggs, I guess you can use pasteurized egg product, or you can cook it and make a custard.  I've always followed their recipes and used raw eggs, with nary a problem!<br /><br />Highly recommend this book!
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I would have gone to see the film in the theatre but I was extremely busy with work and it was in the theatres for such a short time. I read the entire Barsoom series of books back in the 60s. I reread the 1st 8 or so last summer. I viewed the DVD last week about three times, and reread the first book (a pretty quick read, especially if you've read it before). I believe that practical considerations have to come into play when an imaginative book or series is translated onto the screen. Hence my little bit of research. On my third viewing, I could reconcile what the deviations were from the books' storyline. It would have taken about 5 hours to present accurately the happenings in the first book in film form. I can see how much of the events in the books were rearranged and condensed for more economy of exposition. The bit about Dejah's science expertise threw me for a minute, but then I ran across her line in the book when she explaned to the Tharks that her ships had set out from Helium to study and chart air currents, and she explained in non-specific terms how much the Heliumites had done to preserve Barsoom and \\"keep it alive.\\" The re-imagining of the therns and the teleportation apparatus were a bit much for me, but perhaps the writers thought that was a way to bring the story into the modern era. I can suspend disbelief regarding the issue of life on Mars when viewed from the perspective of a mid-19th century cavalryman. Further, Barsoom was consistently described as dying, so perhaps its peoples didn't make it into the 20th century, well before modern day exploration.<br /><br />I did enjoy the movie quite a lot, and the love story between John Carter and Dejah Thoris, the driving force of many of ERB's Barsoom stories, was presented well and the centerpiece of the plot. Some have mentioned that the ending precludes a sequel. I think the opposite is true - what was transpiring on Barsoom when John Carter sent himself back? Problems at the atmosphere plant? Furthermore, fans of the movie are creating a movement to encourage a sequel, including trying to make it financially attractive to Disney. I am in favor of that - a film based on the rest of The Gods of Mars would be very interesting. And then the logical and final installment could be The Warlord of Mars. There is a logical arc throughout.<br /><br />I recommend seeing this. A great deal of the film is true to ERB's creations.<br /><br />A few more comments - I have watched the film a few more times. The portrayal of Woola is so much like the description in the books, it's amazing. When the Tharks capture John by apparently hitting him in the rear with a rifle shot, the next scene shows Tars Tarkas applying the \\"miraculous Barsoomian salve\\" to John's rump while he is strapped on top of the pack animal. I can't tell if it is a large thoat or a zitidar. Nice touches, though. The world of Barsoom is so strange, I guess that is why many have trouble following what is happening, but it was quite easy for me, especially once I paid attention to the exposition itself and quit comparing it to the progressive almost \\"odyssey\\" plot line in the books. As for a sequel, I hope that the Disney creative and marketing folks are sharp and humble enough to research through all the reviews here and the various other related blogs, because there are many great observations and comments. It would be great to see what they would come up with a sequel - which characters and plot elements they build on to create a flow from the first movie. Thuvia, Carthoris, Phaidor, Xodar, Issus, more Sola and Matai Shang... that could be very interesting. The atmosphere plant hasn't even been threatened yet. I'd love to see how Andrew Stanton and team rework it.<br /><br />Before I forget, there is, to my mind, a subtle juxtaposition of the scenes in Arizona, including the appearance of the Apaches, with the landscape and Tharks of Barsoom that works very well. A much wilder wild west. It makes sense that John Carter looks and acts oddly on Barsoom - he's from another planet and culture. He gradually becomes knowledgable of the ways of this new place, and that can be seen in the movie in little ways.<br /><br />PPS - some viewers are purturbed by the transmission of the supposed copy of John Carter to Mars. Look up astral projection - I think the \\"telegraph\\" trick here parallels that mystic concept. And I agree with everyone about the huge mistake on the film title - it should definitely have been JOHN CARTER OF MARS. sheeesh

The cinematography is stunning (and filmed in high-definition meaning it shines on Blu-ray), the narration is perfect (go Attenborough ), and the series as a whole presents a most wonderful and awe-inspiring view of our planet. I would recommend this to absolutely everyone.<br /><br />One of my favorite purchases in recent memory! 5 stars.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Though A GAME OF THRONES: A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a little pricey for an ebook that was published in 2003 (clocking in at $8.99 at my time of purchase), it is very much worth every penny.<br /><br />  Anyone who has watched the HBO series of the same name will benefit greatly from reading this novel. The first season of the television series closely follows the general plot and smaller details of the first book (even sometimes ripping dialogue straight from the pages of the book), but offers more insight into the characters. I watched the first two seasons and then decided to pick up the first book. I was pleasently surprised to see that the book's chapters (which are not numbered, which is its only negative, if I had to nitpick) plop you right in the mind of the chapter's  namesake. It almost feels like you're watching the show as you read. The KEY difference being: You are inside the character's head. You see things more intimately through them and get a better feel of their personality, feelings, and thoughts.<br /><br />  Aside from the improved POV, there are still some small plot differences and details that will keep the reader interested if they've already seen the show. It is a great augmentation to the television series. If you have trouble keeping all of the houses and sigils and mottos in order while watching the series, you'll have no problem after reading the book.<br /><br />  Something interesting that struck me nearly right away is that all of the characters are significantly  younger in the book than they are portrayed in the series. I suppose it goes against U.S. law to have minors do some of the things their would-be characters do in the book, so that doesn't bother me too much. If anything, it makes you sympathize with these characters' tribulations more.<br /><br />  If you have not watched the HBO series yet, reading this book before watching the series would be a great help. There are A LOT of characters from many houses and with  many different agendas. Having background knowledge from the book would help.<br /><br />  The book is interesting and colorful and keeps you  hanging on its every word. Excellent for male and female readers a like (there's something for everyone). This would be an excellent read at the beach or poolside.erent agendas.

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's book, Gone Girl, was an amazing read.  It had all the elements I look for in a great book; especially it's ability to keep me engaged to the end and think about picking it up constantly.  I read Dark Places and thought it was a little too dark but Gone Girl was intense, funny, and jaw-droppingly disturbing.  I definitely recommend this book.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|I already own two of the earlier albums and am pleased to note that Strangeland is as good as Keane's previous works.  In fact some of the songs move this album above Under the Iron Sea.  If you like Keane you will enjoy Strangeland.
0374531943|5.0|Carrying the fire is beyond any doubt the best of the astronauts biographies.  As I'm sure you will know if you are looking at this page, Mike Collins was command module pilot of Apollo 11.  Whilst Neil and Buzz went down to the moons surface, Mike remained in the command module and conducted experiments, took photographs and was there in case any emergency happened during the lunar rendezvous.<br />Mike has a great style of writing and his humour comes across excellently in the book. He leaves no stone unturned and one of the most entertaining and unabashed passages in the book is when he is detailing his thoughts on the other astronauts.<br />This book is often quoted and any NASA or Apollo buff has at least 1 copy sitting in his collection.  Even if you are not a NASA or Apollo buff but just want a good read, then this book comes very highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is so much fun! I was surprised that it was free. it is kind of annoying that some of the goals u have to do require u to buy things with coins but its ok!! u should absolutely buy this game don't know atone who doesn't love it! ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app soooooo much!! it is such a great app. I highly recommend that you get this app. it is amazing. the only thing I don't like about it is that it is highly addictive. get it!! you know you want to!! :)

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Usually, a Rush disc takes a few listens to sink in, but I was hooked by the second time through.  Since Caravan and BU2B are familiar to me, the disc really gets going with track 3, Clockwork Angels.  It doesn't let up until the end.  Such a powerful sound throughout the disc, they just sound so comfortable and in command.  Every time they release a new disc and tour, I think it could be their last, but, amazingly, they sound energized with no signs of stopping.  I have all of their discs, studio and live, and this is my favorite over ANY OTHER!
0195170776|4.0|Another must-have for any home/office library. If you do not already own one of these, stop reading and buy one.

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|wonderful puzzles. beautiful graphics and fast and accurate touch response. it is well worth the 2.99 price tag.  I highly recommend this game!!!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is an excellent toy! Both my 11-year-old nephew and my 5-year-old son loved the toy so much that they took it to school and the teacher ended buying the 100-challenge model for the classroom. It teaches patience and is great for adults too! Can't put our hands off it and we've had it for almost a month now. Highly recommended.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|The movie is slow-moving, predictable, and has a horrible ending.  Decent idea, but doesn't go anywhere with it...  Probably not even worth watching once you can get it for free, much less paying to watch.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game. have you thinking about how to make more money. if you like strategy games and games similar to Sims you would definitely like this.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I really like this game for the most part but you have to buy points in the game to reaally do anything :  the prices aren't bad but I think its stupid you have to spend money to play a game.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was compelling from beginning to end. Its rare that I find a book that I read all the way through without stopping but this one did it. Halfway through I bought the other 2 books so I wouldn't have to wait. Her  characters have depth that engage you right away.
0061692042|2.0|Richard Ford has once again created characters who have no character.  His book, the Sportswriter, was comtemporary writing that held promise.  Everything since is flat word-smithing.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Suzanne Collins just lost it for book 3. Yes, I am old enough to know the 1971 song by The Who, \\"Won't get fooled again.\\" Great song but basing a book on it. Wait? Or was this just a rehash of Orwell's, \\"Animal Farm.\\" The point of her series was that it was unique. This final book was an old formula and a tired author who was out of ideas. Hey, I forgive the author b/c book's 1 and 2 were so damn good.

1849386684|5.0|A wide selection of songs at gradually increasing level of difficulty covering many different musical interests.  Plus Justin has made excellent videos available on DVD and justinguitar.com that go along with the book with lots of hints on how to embellish the songs as you become a better player; you aren't stuck playing them in versions that you feel you have grown beyond!  A LOT of value here.
0345803485|5.0|Excellent book, a definite page turner...well worth the money..recommend getting all 3 books at the same time as you just want to keep reading!
034580404X|3.0|I had several reactions to this trilogy. I resisted reading them for a while just because everyone was mooning over them. But curiosity got the best of me. I am torn in a few different ways after finishing.<br /><br />I am not sure how I feel about the writer profiting off of fan fic based off the Twilight series. It's plagiarism but she told everyone up front that's what it was so how does that change things?<br /><br />I am not comfortable with the BSDM aspect to it. That was the part that really put me off because it's not something I could ever imagine signing up for or allowing someone to do to me. Every time the physical dominace/abuse/control he uses ON HER is mentioned it made my hackles go up in a very feministic \\"I am woman hear me roar\\" kind of way. However, I think it's interesting because she's not being *Forced* to do those things she's *Allowing* those things to be part of their relationship so it's not really abuse even though it feels very much that way to me. It may even be MORE (in shouty caps) feminist because she throws aside what she \\"should\\" feel about that aspect and only goes by how she really does feel and she enjoys it so she allows it. She goes for (and gets) what she wants.<br /><br />The writing is crap. There are aspects that are wholly unbelievable, she's 21 but doesn't have her own email, laptop or blackberry. She's a virgin. She's never even had a boyfriend yet she magically HEALS and SAVES this tormented, disturbed and messed up man in a way that no one else has ever been able to. She says \\"Holy...\\", \\"Jeez\\", \\"Shatter\\", \\"Inner Goddess\\" and \\"My Fifty\\" about a million times throughout the whole series. At one point I believe the sentence is even \\"I never fitted in...\\". ?!?! It's infuriatingly crappy editing. It feels very much like you are reading a Fan Fic quality novel and that they printed it off her website, bound it and put it on the shelf. Every sex scene follows the same pattern, 1/2 way through book 2 I started skipping through them. He looks at her with his grey eyes, she feels it deep in her belly, he builds her up, calls her Mrs. Steele, Her Inner Goddess roars, he tells her he's going to take her, have her, do her...etc, he slams into her, says \\"Oh, Ana\\" and then she shatters. EVERY SINGLE TIME.<br /><br />There are little aspects that you notice if you've read Twilight, like the cars  (Audi), the piano music, the messy bronze hair, her oval engagement ring but nothing so obvious that you go \\"Aha, TWILIGHT\\" apart from the juvenile writing. He's very different from Edward, minus the control freak stalker aspect. She's very much Bella. Clumsy, innocent, retardedly and blindly in love with this man who is so obviously dangerous for her. That part is maddening. They don't allow the characters to develop enough for you to understand WHY they are so in love and need each other so. They just *DO* and you are supposed to accept it.<br /><br />If you just go at it from the aspect of social curiosity and mindless summer reading, you will be pleased you read it. Definitely lacking in the story telling department but polarizing in many ways nonetheless.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game has some interesting mini-games... it takes more points to unlock another mini-game which I think is stupid. yet the games waste some pretty good time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Lots of fun when you are waiting at an appointment at work on break or just to play  keeps kids happy also
0099579936|1.0|I got this audible and its actually very stimulating when you hear it than reading it, but I HATE the parts when they are emailing each other. Over and over again with the whole to: From: Subject: and Time: etc., etc....so annoying!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: This has to be the worst book ever! I am not quite sure where to start. Ana the main character, simply putting it: she is some dumb chick and all her innerself thinking, was enough to make me stop and listen to this stupid chick. Could there really be women out there that believe this crap. C'mon? REALLY?<br /><br />All I could say you if you are planning to buy or even listen to this, please be ready for repetition after repetition. And that this stupid so call \\"college woman\\" falls for this man that takes pleasure in beating a woman and let me not forget the part that she is a virgin and that has never once played with herself.<br /><br />OH and by the way....\\"down there\\", we WOMEN like to call it a VAGINA! I hope I don't get band by Amazon for saying VAGINA !!!! So WARNING, this author sucks! Can't believe she is actually getting rich from this and I surely hope they don't make this to a movie. Maybe a stupid porn! LOL
B00005N6KG|1.0|Received it and the left ear didn't work out of the box. I tried it in multiple devices. On top of that, the right ear didn't sound very good anyway. Returned it for a refund and got something else.<br /><br />Skip this and spend a little more money. Not worth the risk or poor quality even for listening to spoken word audio.
1451608659|4.0|I have been a fan of Dominique Moceanu's since we were both 14 years old. Now at 30, I was so thrilled to see she'd written a memoir. As we are the same age, and knowing she'd gone through drama in her past, I was so curious to hear her side and see what she's been up to in the years since she retired from gymnastics.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed her book. It was a very fast read and very interesting. I was most interested in the behind the scenes world of gymnastics and what she experienced, and while I wish she would have spent much more time in these areas, what she did write about was honest and informative. I particularly give her a lot of credit for calling out the Karolyis; good for her for saying what everyone else in the community has been much to scared to say. I give her a lot of credit for exposing what many of us know but no one discusses regarding this couple.<br /><br />The major downside to this book was the complete disorientation of how it was put together. It was so odd and disrupting to jump from a chapter on her newfound sister, to the olympics, back to her sister, etc. Very, very odd. She had two co-writers and I am so surprised they ordered the chapters this way. It didn't flow well at all.<br /><br />I really wish she would have delved even further into the behind the scenes life of her career. I could have read twice the size of the book in this subject alone; I felt like, while she was very honest and forthcoming, she could have gone even deeper into her gymnastics life.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this memoir to any Dominique or gymnastics fan. And I give Dominique herself a lot of credit for her honesty with some dark subjects.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|The movie was boring and the quality of the streaming was poor so I use 100% VUDU now. 2 hrs. of fake stuffed dog heads was a waste of time. Who ever wrote the the script should have used some survival skills in the film.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am very selective about what my children; 7 - 12; play on electronics, &amp; I really didn't want some glitchy game messing with my favorite device,  but LOVE THIS GAME! The kids did start it, but this 40-something parent took the village over! ha, ha. After awhile, we were all having fun sharing in the goals, collections, &amp; redesigning the village all the time! Yes,  we accidentally bought the small pack of acorns a few times, I think $6.00 was spent.i We just learned how to avoid it in the future. I can proudly say: We made it to the top- LEVEL 50, have over 45 families, play the New Scrat games &amp; earn acorns or animals, ALL FOR FREE! ( We wish we could buy acorns with our 20mill.+ coins, also; but you must use patience, or do without, if you don't want to spend real money.)  So what; I don't have a highly rated village because I can't connect with other villages, I'm ok with that! I can see by all you other people enjoying this game, that you probably have great villages, &amp; until I get this MINOR issue resolved,  I will keep playing...&amp; HAVING FUN!  WE LOVE IT-- U MUST TRY!
B007SGM084|1.0|I just can't wrap my head around why this trilogy is so popular.  I wish I hadn't wasted $30 bucks on this.  The author is in desperate need of a thesaurus as she has one of the most limited vocabularies of any author I have read to date.  After reading this book I am sick to death of \\"apex\\", \\"mercurial\\", \\"admonish\\", etc.  The shock value of the BDSM content is just not there.  A bit of spanking and a couple of toys is supposed to be shocking?  Her version of BDSM is more vanilla than anything else.  I found her intimate scenes to be rather boring.  I was also surprised at how she could describe some aspects of these scenes in graphic detail, but was too timid to use big girl words for body parts and acts.  I was thoroughly disappointed in the story and character development.  There are multiple scenes taken almost verbatim out of other works. Scenes from Pretty Woman, Twilight, and Original Sin jump out of the pages at you.  The story is completely lacking in originality.  The characters are flat and underdeveloped.  She creates \\"conflict\\" in the story by trying to throw in a bit of mystery and action, but fails miserably.  The ending drags on and on in an attempt to clarify all of the holes left in the other 95% of the trilogy.  There was no humor in this series, only teenage melodramatic eye rolling drama.  The book certainly didn't turn me on much less entertain me.  It certainly wasn't worth the time I spent reading it either.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|A mature Bieber, a very well done CD, from the R&B Feel to the pop and house. Great CD, even moving at times. Shows the grown up Justin is a very nice fashion, so over all if you've been listening to him from his start, you need to listen to this, it was worth the wait from the Christmas album.
1451629184|5.0|I read this after reading some of the reviews...I cannot believe her strength and ability to adapt at such a young age. It is also a portraite in another case where our criminal justice system failed ....over and over again! It reminds me of the Steven Stainer case where his abductor Parnell was in prison multiple time for rape and molestation and was released....also the man who murdered Adam Walsh was on parole for sex crimes...oh and Polly Klass too....What a system we have here! The help she has recieved has been very empowering for her ....a must read

0984999302|5.0|Having started 8 business and invested in over 50 more, I wish I had this resource a long long time ago.  It is an entrepreneur's job to manage the risks of their enterprise, and to allocate resources where they are most needed.  Before The Startup Owner's Manual, most of us were left to our own devices, randomness, and serendipity.  The near-death experiences of most successes have been glorified with the buzz word \\"pivot\\".  But what does that really mean, and can you expect to learn when, why and how to iterate successfully?  The answer is yes; the recipe calls for equal parts of the business model canvas and customer development, with a healthy dose of constant agile development and customer interactions.  Combining the right ingredients in the right order is a process, and how to best navigate that process is revealed in this invaluable guide book for anyone who wants to figure out if their great idea can become a great business.  It also gives angel and venture investors an edge in evaluating proposals, looking to see if the team has gotten out of the building enough to know their target market, can articulate a compelling value proposition, and know how to get, keep and grow customers.
055357342X|5.0|The battle at King's Landing is over. The Lannisters have won... for now. Wights have attacked the Night's Watch and Jon Snow has joined Mance Rayder's ranks in hopes of learning enough to help his brothers and defend the Wall. Jaime Lannister has escaped, with Lady Catelyn's help, and is being escorted back to King's Landing where Catelyn hopes he'll be exchanged for her daughters. Arya travels to Riverrun to reunite with her family and Bran is headed North under the cover of his supposed death. Across the sea, Daenerys has gained ships but now needs and army to back her when she returns to Westeros. And though everyone has counted Stannis out of the game, he is far from done.<br /><br />I know we've all learned after book one not to get too attached to anyone in the series, but this is craziness! There are some major game changers in book three!<br /><br />Each installment in the series is a big chunker of a read and every time I finish one, I'm desperate to move on to the next to find out what happens! And with season three no doubt a year out, I've got book four already lined up for my next GRRM binge.<br /><br />While I love the tv show, one thing that I adore about this series that's missing from the small screen is all of the intricate background and history of the Song of Ice and Fire world: the stories of Bran the Builder and the various empires that populated Westeros; the lands across the sea, of which we see very little in the show at all; the First Men; the Children of the Forest; each of the family histories that are delved into in each book... this has all become expendable (understandably) in putting together a realistic television series. But it adds such depth and richness to the books that I wish at least some of it was touched on in the show. Ah well, the fact that this epic epicness has made it to tv at all is kind of a big accomplishment and I'll take it as I can get it.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I haven't like a Rush album in 27 years ('Power Windows').  This changes that.  A *really* nice album with a strong basis in Rush's historic style, but with influence from more recent trends from the last 2 decades.

B002VECM6S|5.0|\\"The Blind Side\\" is a drama film based on true events.<br /><br />Teenager Michael Oher is the nucleus of the story, and he has had a difficult upbringing. He is accepted into Wingate Christian School on compassionate grounds with a view to make a contribution to the school gridiron program.<br /><br />Oher doesn't have a permanent residence and the Tuohy Family notice him living meekly and offer him shelter. What starts as a temporary arrangement becomes long term and he is adopted by this family.<br /><br />The essence of the narrative is that by opening their home and hearts to Oher the Tuohys are able to help him realize his potential in sport, academically, and in family life.<br /><br />The film contains a wonderful cast who present the characters with warmth and authenticity.<br /><br />It is a movie which allows the viewer to appreciate that giving can change a life, and that the love of a family is the greatest wealth a person can have.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

B0083EW97W|1.0|I have seen JM three times, own a few of his \\"albums\\" and was anxiously awaiting his new effort, Born and Raised. Maybe this new effort should be titled Shot Down in Flames or Boring for the Times. If you are a fan of Neil Young, you'll enjoy this yawner. Trust me, I wanted to like it!<br /><br />I have listened to the entire collection more than once and over the past few weeks, so this is not a knee jerk reaction... I mean I gave the collection a serious try!<br /><br />But there is no way 'round it,  this is the slowest most boring set from JM ever. If I could get a refund I would.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great way to pass time! simple and mindless - not quite challenging.  perfect to play in small chunks of time- maybe 15 minutes or so.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I don't like musicals and I usually don't like covers of songs. I only want the originals. In this case, all of that goes right out the window. I absolutely loved this movie and went right out for the soundtrack. I surprised myself even more by wanting the cast to sing it, not the original artists (although, of course, they are wonderful too). I've had this on repeat. If you love the movie, get the soundtrack. If you love 80s music, get the soundtrack.
0765316994|4.0|By way of disclosure: This will be a review of the hardback. I did not get it from Amazon. So 1) I paid full price, but 2) mine is an autographed copy.<br />Also for the record, Mr. Scalzi in what he calls his performing monkey mode conducts an open, friendly, creative and classy book signing. This one had about 200 people in a fairly small space and he gave everyone a good show and everyone in the book signing queue received a few moments of personal attention. Reading Sci Fi may be for some of us a casual experience.  Mr. Scalzi takes the craft of writing Sci Fi as a serious activity.<br /><br />The book should be understood as having two parts.<br />The novella is intended to be a comedic spoof of the well worn Star Trek joke. Red Shirted extras will be expended, usually at the beginning of an episode and to little purpose.  In REDSHIRTS, we are asked to see this from the point of view of the crew members. Crew members who realize that they are highly likely to die. For them staying alive is possible if they can avoid the attention of the senior officers. What follows is their effort to escape the \\"Narrative\\".<br /><br />As parody or satire the joke is spun out by about page 50. The humor is never more than at the chuckle level. The plot, characters, conceits and conventions are fairly typical for a Sci Fi novella. The plot moves at a good pace and overall this can be a pleasant few hours.<br /><br />Then comes what are called the Codas. Each is a short story. Each is told in a different person (as in first person, second person and third person). And each is related to the novella.<br /><br />In effect, the novella is the back story for the Codas. Incidentally the use of person is an artificial constraint set by the author perhaps to challenge himself or to emphasize what I propose is the real intent of this book. More on this shortly.<br /><br />The Codas have heart. Each one has a feel of real people and real emotions. This is not typical SCi Fi fare. There may be some elements of space and time and dimensions, but the real purpose is not finding the power jewels or saving the universe. These codas are about human feeling. The quality of the writing in the codas is better, more focused and more demanding of the reader. All are worth reading.<br /><br />Taken together this book reads as a cie du Coeur. Mr. Scalzi is more than a writer of Sci. Fi. He is a blogger, reviewer and organizer/leader in the profession. This rather makes his point of view \\"meta\\". (This word may be a requirement if you are to review this book).<br /><br />As often as Mr Scalzi writes about how poorly different literary/cinematic science fictions universes are engineered - why have none of these super science cultures ever invented a decent barrier to keep people from falling to their deaths in the vast empty caverns that all of their space vehicles, engine rooms and palaces seem to have by the cubic hectare? But I digress....<br />What this book asks is:<br />Why can't other wise good writers, write like good writers? In the immediate example, we all understand that death is part of action books/movies/TV shows, but why does so much of it have to be pointless providing cheap cover for a lack of skilled writing? Mr. Scalzi would like to see writers treat their characters as a general treats their troops. In war, troops are expendable, but only to be expended where the loss is proportionally correct.<br /><br />Most of us readers may not find this \\"meta\\" purpose as sufficient cause for reading this book. Speaking for myself, the novella was a fair ride. The real value is in the Codas. The Codas benefit from the back story.y be some elements of space and time and dimensions, but the real purpose is not finding the power jewels or saving the universe. These codas are about human feeling. The quality of the writing in the codas is better, more focused and more demanding of the reader.

Mr. Scalzi would like to see writers treat their characters as a general treats their troops. In war, troops are expendable, but only to be expended where the loss is proportionally correct.<br /><br />Most of us readers may not find this \\"meta\\" purpose as sufficient cause for reading this book. Speaking for myself, the novella was a fair ride. The real value is in the Codas. The Codas benefit from the back story.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I loved this book. It hit you emotionally in all the right places. I think the authors writing is very raw and real. She takes you right into that moment and you feel every bit of it. Great book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I usually HATE to read, and I read the sample of this book and it left off in a bad spot, so I had some amazon gift card credits so I decided oh what the heck and just purchased it. I was getting a little bored with it in the beginning but then it started to get interesting after awhile. Towards the middle and end it is great, and the second book is amazing! I love these books, obviously everyone has there own opinion but you shouldn't base your thoughts on the book after just reading the reviews, actually read it! I read a few reviews, and do agree that a lot of the words used in these books are super repetitive, but a good story besides all the sex!
B006LSZECO|5.0|What an amazing book!  As you delve into the story, you really aren't sure where it's going or which character to root for.  And there were a couple of big twists that I really didn't see coming.  I would definitely recommend this book and I'll be reading the author's other titles.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|This was exactly what I wanted, a well done 3D movie with lots of fun effects. As far as the product itself goes, I couldn't be happier!<br /><br />The quality of the movie (acting, script, etc.) is definitely not top tier though, so don't go in expecting a 5 star movie.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|The app will not be listed in android voice action/command feature.  so when you speak \\"listen to beatles\\" the amazon mp3 app will not be listed as an option to play music.  fix this please!  see developer link: [...]
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|its a good game but you have to hit the items your looking for twice or more. seems like it freezes. love it.
030758836X|2.0|I really don't know why this has made it onto virtually every summer must-read list in the press. Yes, the writing is creative and the plot twists you never see coming, but the story falls apart in the last 60 pages. For all the buildup I was seriously, seriously disappointed in the way things just fell apart. I couldn't decide whether the author ran out of creativity or had to meet deadline and just let it go to waste.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I purchased the Opteka X-Grip for filming skateboarding with my Nikon D5100 and from the moment I attached my DSLR to the grip, it felt like a match made in camera heaven. Holding the grip is the best part, the foam almost feels luxurious in your fist as no longer do you have to clamp your hands around the camera body in a contorted fashion while praying to the ground that it doesn't eat your camera.<br /><br />The D5100 has an articulating LCD screen which makes it very easy to review your footage and monitor your shot as you're filming at a low angle. I like that the X-Grip has a rounded bar on the rear because it's actually an improvement over professional camcorder built-in grips. You can hold onto the rear while adjusting settings or reviewing footage.<br /><br />Since I use the Nikon 10.5mm fisheye for skateboarding, I was actually slightly concerned that the fisheye might see a Rode mic attached to the grip's accessory shoe (since it is further forward than the camera's hot shoe); however, even with the camera balanced in the very center of the plate, it does not see my hand where the mic would be. Therefore, I am not concerned and I may go ahead and order the mic.<br /><br />For those who are worried about the screw and plate not securing the camera properly, my Nikon D5100 screws in very tightly and securely so I'm not a firm believer in the reliability of the video review left for this item which shows the camera moving about. Furthermore, the video reviewer said that the grip was flimsy, well, it actually feels quite sturdy from a lightweight DSLR perspective. It doesn't give nearly as much as his did. You really have to pull on it hard if you wanted it to look flimsy (like he did in the video).<br /><br />If you own a DSLR with an articulating screen, it comes highly recommended, you will not regret it! It's only $30.00 and it does just as good a job as the hyped Scorpion or whatever!<br /><br />Keep on skating and filming. Welcome to the new age of videography.

B001FA0H3E|4.0|My introduction to international political thrillers occurred largely through John Le Carre's novels of the 70s and 80s. Among the various writers portraying Cold-War espionage at the time, I found him the best. His writing was peerless, his plotting dense and imaginative, and his subject matter undoubtedly relevant to the times. What I found most unique about him, though, was his ability to convey the moral ambiguity that often characterized that world, and its blurred lines between right and wrong.<br /><br />In the 90s Le Carre's basic mastery of the genre remained, but the end of the Cold War seemed to leave him without the same relevancy he'd held earlier. This in turn made his works somewhat less even, though I did find `A Perfect Spy' and `Single and Single' consistent with his previous excellence.<br /><br />`A Most Wanted Man' bears some features of Le Carre's best works, particularly the high-quality writing. In addition the setting and atmospherics of Hamburg are vivid and well-done, and the book offers his usual subtle plotting. But Le Carre's attempt to venture into the world of Islamic terrorism seemed to me a bit stretched, perhaps---unlike his Cold War and other books---because he has little acquaintance with the milieu.<br /><br />Still, he's Le Carre. Even when he's not at his best, or somewhat out of his element, he's still vastly better than most other writers in the genre. If you're already a fan of Le Carre, you might nonetheless consider adding this book to your Kindle list.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a great game! You will love this game. This game will have you going nut! So give it a try.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I think the iPhone 4S is simply a beautiful phone.  I love the combination of stainless steel and glass, and for a long time, resisted putting it inside some bulky or awkward vault-type case.  But, because the stainless steel makes the phone a bit slippery in the hand, I was reluctant to take my phone out of its dedicated pocket whenever I was standing over concrete.  This Amazon Basics case looks to be exactly what I need.  Because it's translucent (almost clear, even), it preserves much of the phone's beautiful design.  Plus, the case allows for a much more secure hold on the phone.  Finally, the case is easy to remove when I want to plug the phone into an iHome clock/radio, something that I could not do easily with a more protective vault-type case.  I'm not performing any test drops, but because the case extends beyond the front and rear glass of the phone, I suspect that it will provide reasonable protection in the case of a drop on concrete.  Hmmm...I can now take calls in the city!  NOTE:  I am not using the included screen protector, continuing instead to use a GreatShield EZShield bubble-free removable and washable screen protector that I purchased on Amazon six months ago.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|what a disapointment..... both of the draw something apps don't load. I have tried to create space by deleting almost half of the content on my device, but nothing has improved. please fix or tell me how I can possibly work this app that cost me money! please
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel twists and turns and I absolutely could not put it down.  I read it in one day and bet you will do the same.  The story centers around a marriage that is not what it seems and we get to see what is behind the closed door.  Both husband and wife are at times suspect and victim and we don't know until the end what really happened, or why.  Even after the end is revealed you will still be thinking about this book.  Read it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|there are a lot of levels included which is great for long trips or if you want an app that wont get old very fast
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I got these headphones about four days ago. my initial impressions were the amazing clarity but they were slightly thin sounding. I can say that they sound much fuller now and have an enormous sound stage. These cans are definitely not bass-shy. I have the Denon Ah-d2000 and in comparison the denons sound very bloated and absolutely pale in comparison, so much so that i don't use my denons anymore. I highly recommend these headphones for those who crave detail and wonderful sound-stage(accurate reproduction of sound). Also keep in mind that these headphones require about 100 hours burn in (A week of heavy use). It doesn't matter if you think burn in is purely psychological, the sound will improve a great deal and is absolutely worth the wait. The mids are incredibly smooth and detailed. I really don't know how smoothness and detail could coexist but the AKGs do it. I highly recommend these headphones,a truly GREAT product.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|great game. fun to connect with friends this way,  but really want the update on my kindle please! have on my phone &amp; its great.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game and its very addicting. I play with my cousins and we just cant stop. but my mom has it on her phone and its updated. I really want it to update on here!!! please!!!????

B007KZY1YY|3.0|o.k, was dying to read but found there was way too much sex seens on it and not enough good reading. But fair play to the author she has some  imagination. I just found the book a bit slow going overall.
B0086700CM|2.0|I feel like I'm missing something great about this game. It's the same thing over and over. You collect coins but you just use them to collect more coins.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Read the first one and of course so it begins number two loads of sex again and again, maybe to much, maybe. Glad my kids did'nt pick it up I felt like hiding it. Though the first one was slightly better maybe it was because I did,nt know what to expect. Again good imagination for author.
B00881VLCE|4.0|good app for all ages. flexibility of puzzle piece counts and rotation allows you to tailor this to youngsters but still be able to challenge older users
B0086700CM|5.0|very fun game.  Would recommend for any age.  My 7 year old and I both play even my 2 year old likes to try and play.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|When Neil and Crazy Horse get together, the result is usually a keeper. Americana has the quality and unique sound and feeling that only they can produce. Like most, I've heard all of these songs in their traditional format. The sound that comes out in Americana breathes life into every one. The arrangement of Clementine, the full lyrics and Neil's deilvery paint such a vivid picture that it makes me feel like I'm there. The same can be said for most every song. It's like hearing something familiar, but fully hearing and feeling it for the first time.<br /><br />For Neil and Crazy Horse fans, it's a must have. For others, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Unlike some music legends, Shakey will \\"not fade away\\".
0345803485|5.0|These books are definetely at the top of my list of favorite readings , completely captivated me. It does have a lot of sexual content, but aside from that it is a very fascinating story. I've read the first two books in the past week, and no I don't just sit around my house, I work and have to little kids; but I find the story so interesting that I keep it in my purse and read whenever I have a minute, even staying up late at night until I'm too tired to continue. I am so excited to get started on the third one. Definetely a must read!!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author is skilled in painting a clear picture of this strange world of cleaners.  Thanks for writing this series - pure enjoyment.<br /><br />I am 90% through the Omnibus and am loving it, although part 1 and 2 were a bit slow for me.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I have never written a review before but this book just made me. It was just so....gah. That's the only word I can say about it...gah.<br />I stayed up until 4:30 this morning to finish it, and just finished the sequel. Lol. Both of the books were amazing!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome. The narrative is fluid, events lead from one to the other so fast that you wouldn't dream of putting it down for a second. The series has underlying themes of oppression, political unrest, human subjugation, desensitization, reality TV.. the elements that will compose the imaginable future. Beautifully conceptualized and excellent food for thought.
1612130283|4.0|I wanted so much to hate this book.  All the accolades it has received, surely not deserved.  She was a Twilight fan fiction writer...how good can this book really be?  Well...damn good.  I was immediately sucked into this story.  The familiar pattern of late night and early morning reading stealing my time and sleep away from me.  Its not my first time around books of this sort, my preference is for paranormal adult erotica.  So picture same story, but Christian is a vampire or shape shifter or werewolf.  Kate is the same.  But this book was really well written, funny, smart and most importantly hot.  I connected with the characters.  Being older and supposedly wiser I wanted to shake Kate throughout the book.  That did annoy me a little bit that she seemed so naive and inexperienced.  But luckily there are 2 more books to read.  Perhaps she will get it in the end.  I highly recommend this book and look forward finishing the trilogy.
B005D4YHSO|5.0|I've had these shoes for about 3 weeks now and took them with me to FL. I had them soaked and full of sand and they still look and smell new. No odor. The reason I mention odor is that I have used Merrill's and Lands End sandals in the past and both have had awful foot odor after about a few weeks. It traps moisture in the cushion of the shoe and gets worse. These have a hard rubber sole and I don't think they will ever trap moisture. So far so good!
B005UDD1R6|3.0|Maybe I was just too stupid to figure it out, but I saw no way to delete videos you no longer want. All in all, I think it's a great app, but not being able to delete unwanted media annoyed me to the point I uninstalled it.

B0074JODEY|2.0|My introduction to these characters was via the outstanding Lone Wolf and Cub series. I have 5 Lone Wolf films in DVD (not Blu-ray). But I have to say, those DVDs have better resolution and color than the Shogun Assassin movies in this collection. That's my technical complaint.<br /><br />As for movies, any potential buyer should be aware that these movies are intended for those who love cheesy dubbed Asian action movies. There is no Japanese audio track. There are no subtitles. Shogun Assassin was a recut/reinvention of two Lone Wolf and Cub movies, made for the American audiences. We're talking B movies way way way down in the Bs. If you like samurai movies, like the Samurai Trilogy, Yojimbo, Hari Kiri, 47 Ronin, Zatoichi movies, then this collection is NOT for you!<br /><br />I regret buying this collection mainly because I didn't realize what I was getting. That was my mistake. However, I am surprised at the lower quality of the film footage. One would expect a Blu-ray mastering to have better results than older DVD transfers of essentially the same footage. I suppose the SA films are already 2 or more film generations from what might be available for LWAC, so maybe this is the best they could have done. At any rate, it's very disappointing to me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent story...didn't want it to end...hope there is more!  Would like to know what happened to fifty shades when he was little.
B001OGRIWW|5.0|This, along with More Songs and Fear of Music, are the essentials. If you are new to the Heads, any one of these three albums would give you a great introduction to what The Talking Heads were about.
B00008HCCF|5.0|this is my favorite Norah Jones recording, not so much the video, but the musical style which she and her band use for this performance...they turned it up a notch by using a rock and roll style, where her voice is not the only dominant feature....the band's efforts shine through as well making for a more colorful presentation yet all of her vocal/acoustic talents shine through too...this different style also adds depth and dynamics to the recording and creates one of the best soundstages that I have ever heard from her as well as all other artists....this performance makes many other recordings sound boxed in
B002FE5XVK|5.0|Not only is the band at its peak (just after \\"Burning Down the House\\" became a hit), and David Byrne at his charismatic best, but also the performance is captured by Oscar-winner Jonathan Demme (\\"Silence of the Lambs\\"). The movie is intimate without getting in the way, attuned to the performance as much as the lighting and sound crews are. The music and the band are up front. It's about them.<br /><br />As for the Heads themselves, well, I watch this movie and find it hard to imagine anyone not wanting these Talking Heads to be performing now, today, in their youthful prime. This is smart music. Odd. Fun. Cheerful. Jaded but over it. Energetic as all heck.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that this band ruled the NYC club scene when punk was king, Led Zeppelin were the supergroup, and Van Halen made its big splash on FM radio. People try to label The Talking Heads as New Wave, but I don't see it. The Heads influenced New Wave, but they were their own thing, and no band came close to their sound.
B007TBCTRK|3.0|Why, oh why, is there always some controversy regarding the musical scores for films by the great Ridley Scott?  This is of course an exaggerated question, but it is often the case and the music for Scott's notable production of \\"Prometheus\\" is no exception here.  This is an outstanding film that works in every way on the screen (and it begs for a sequel...soon!).  And indeed the music is fine...on the screen, but is cut a bit short on the album.  The first problem emerges on the soundtrack recording which seems to be missing some of the most memorable music from the film; then slowly reality sets in.  What is clearly the main theme in the score as seen on the screen appears only in one cut (with minor appearances elsewhere,\\"We Were Right,\\" and \\"Earth\\"):  \\"Life,\\" because it was not written by the primary artist here, Marc Streitenfeld, but by Harry Gregson-Williams who is simply credited as having contributed \\"additional music\\".  In the end it is certainly more than that.  Now to complain loudly of missing music is only partially warranted because the theme is in fact on the soundtrack just not in the manner it appears in the film and certainly not in a form representative of how often it is heard in the film.  On the screen this is a significant part of the music, perhaps even the \\"main theme\\" and it works very well throughout the film.  This is not to diminish the contribution of Strietenfeld, and indeed most of the score (and some 85% of the soundtrack) is his and it is very effective in the final production.  There is also one minor appearance of Jerry Goldsmith's original music for \\"Alien,\\" which would have been just fine as an homage, but it appears with the introduction of the old industrialist (\\"Friend from the Past\\") that we are led to believe is dead and therefore is something of an odd touch.  Why the soundtrack album has so little of Gregson-Williams' music is a puzzlement, especially given how important it is at the beginning, some key points, and the end of the film.  But it is represented here and that is that, as they say.  With the mystery of the \\"missing\\" music solved, one can then press on and focus on what is on the album and it too is good stuff, but it would have been nice to have most of the full score even if it would need to be credited to two composers.  Nicely produced and packaged by Sony.

B0079XPUOW|2.0|Too much \\"comedy\\" without an actual serious plot makes for bad scifi, this is kind of meta because the book is about bad sci fi.
B007RXC3A8|4.0|Sonata Arctica are the premier power metal band in the world and Stones Grow Her Name is their excellent new album which plays to their strengths while delivering a few surprises. Sonata Arctica have a very impressive discography beginning with pure power metal that transformed into a darker type of progessive metal and which has now eased into a style somewhere in between. What has remained consistent is their intense musical performances, their crisp and clear production, and the passionate melodic vocals of Tony Kakko. Highlights on this album include the powerful sound of \\"Shitload Of Money\\", the killer euro rock of \\"Losing My Insanity\\" featuring amazing classical shred solos, the awesome chorus and huge melodies of \\"I Have A Right\\", the heavy metal lullaby \\"The Day\\", and the exciting vibe of \\"Cinderblox\\" which features a banjo over some old style Sonata Arctica power metal. The deluxe edition also contains the beautiful ballad \\"Tonight I Dance Alone\\" with a gorgeous guitar solo from Elias Viljanen. Sonata Arctica continues to evolve and challenge themselves and their audience with complex songwriting and unique melodies which combine to make memorable albums. Despite the fact that they will never please everyone, Sonata Arctica has delivered a strong album that shows why they are held high in the world of metal.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The series turned into a bit of a drag after a while. Definitely not a \\"can't put it down\\" type that I prefer, but understand it's not geared toward readers of my age either (mid-30's). Content is a bit disturbing for pre-teens, but maybe recommend for the 17-20ish crowd. Formatting issues drove me a bit crazy in the first book, but seemed to be corrected for the rest of the series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was being blabbered about so, I thought--try it. Oye veh. Dull as dishwater, I couldn't make it past page 20 something. To each their own clearly, but I'd recommend \\"The Story of O\\" or \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\" way ahead of this book.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is amazing! It so much fun I cant stop playing it!!!You have to get either the doughnut cupcake or candy to Om-Nom.So much fun BUY IT!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book features a girl who thinks very little of herself as the heroine and a compulsive, manipulative control freak for the male love interest. The only thing that makes him attractive is his bank account. Even the sex scenes get boring as the series progresses because they bang every 5 seconds only to wake up the next morning with a bad after taste. This series was not worth the time spent flipping through it. Its way easier and less time consuming to pop a porn in the bluray player.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|The move of John Carter requires that the viewers put themselves in the times of Burroughs (1915 -1930ish) and only then imagine what the future could be.  In that way it is sort of like the movie Inception, but the viewer has to do all the work.  That takes more effort than many viewers are willing to do, but if you exercise your mind you'll find an enjoyable film and experience.<br /><br />Along the way you'll experience storytelling they way it was in the '20's and '30's which is different from what movie goers are used to today.  The imagery is exceptional and pays homage to the graphic concepts of the illustrators who have used the John Carter story for inspiration.<br /><br />I suggest watching the movie at least one time with the commentary off and once with it on. It's more then just a contemporary movie.  It is moving history.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Worth the money for sure. Everyone who plays it loves it, and even the bored amongst us stop whining when they play it.
B0060AY85C|5.0|Another wonderful read by Toni Morrison - this short piece by Morrison is best read in one sitting.  The book chronicles the Homeric journey of an African American vet after Korea.  The book is too short to provide the reader insight into the main characters in the book and as a result there is a lack of character development - so what we are left with is a broad brush into the experience of African - Americans at a specific point in history. Beautifully written - the prose is lyrical.

014241039X|5.0|This was a fun story that I read with my then 5 and 7 year old children. They were in the early stages of reading and we read together everyday. This story will provide laughs and teachable moments all at the same time. The children are now 17 and 19, and this book is still quoted by us all. We give this book as a gift to new reader so they too can enjoy the story of the grumpy old people. Roald Dahl was a favorite for all 6 of my children and now my grandchildren are learning to appreciate his unique and fun writings.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game works perfectly, its a perfect port of the original PC game from PopCap. glad to see that it's come to Android.

0345803485|5.0|I bought this book because of all the hype. I thought I'd give it a try as I'm a huge fan of Fan fiction. I am so glad I did. What a great story. The sex scenes are hot and the characters are so interesting. I love Ana and Christian. I was cheering for both of them right through the series. I know a lot of people hate these books but I for one, love them.
0393088774|5.0|This book is really unique because its author, PHD Paul Krugman,goes in the contrary direction of the rest of the world economists.He shows that we can go out of this global crisis but just with stimulus and focus on growth.Not with more depresion and cuts in budgets.

B000BDLJBU|5.0|Ok, this is a great product, even I had hardly any problems getting it put together and working, and i have no experience. the product is very strong and sturdy, i can tell its going to hold up. No diffrence in the sound quality. Great product, for the price, awsome. get it.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I haven't had good luck with Kindle covers in the past, so I was a bit doubtful when I got this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. The clips that hold the Kindle in place are very easy to use and keep the device solidly in the cover.  The elastic strap that can be used to hold the cover closed is very sturdy and has shown no signs of fraying or disconnecting from the cover.<br /><br />I've used the cover to prop my Kindle up for watching movies a few times, and the cover stays firmly in place and doesn't slip a bit.  When reading, it's very unobtrusive. I fold the cover back on itself, and it does this easily - no sign of breakage in the spine at all.<br /><br />All in all, it's an excellent Kindle cover that wears well and has no real flaws.

B007XZREFE|4.0|I saw part of the scene where they had the chicken on tv many years ago and i liked what i saw. My family who also<br />watched tv said it was a sick film so they changed the channel. Ever since then i have wanted to watch it in it's entirely. It is<br />good waited because now i could watch it in HD quality and lossless sound. I am glad i bought it.<br /><br />I think the character Henry was interesting + i liked the strange atmosphere. David Lynch sure made the film look cold,<br />strange, bleak and uninhabitable. That family he meets was strange and the conversations had that awkward silence<br />vibe.<br />Also that peculiar baby who i think looks like an alien. I was surprised when the mother tried to kiss Henry. I liked the<br />shocked facial expressions Henry made. I think it was a bit hard to interpret this film. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Picture quality: 4/5<br /><br />The film takes up circa 18 GB and have an average of 24 in bitrate. I was surprised how good it looked. Since this was a<br />very<br />low budget film made by 20,000 USD. Not the sharpest film i have watched, but i didn't expect it to look like Avatar<br />either. I think close ups shots looked good and detailed.<br /><br />That baby who has many close ups looked detailed and sharp. Seems like no DNR or EE was used which made me<br />happy. It looked grainy as it should do. I like that it was filmed in black and white because i think it suits this film just<br />fine and i think it makes it more atmospheric. I think the black levels looked good.<br /><br />Audio quality: 4/5<br /><br />The audio is in LPCM 2.0 {Dolby Surround} remix with 2304 kbps, 24-bit. I was just as surprised as the picture quality how<br />good it sounded. Eraserhead is filled with urban noises. Not much actual music. I heard some hissing, but was not a<br />major problem for me.<br /><br />Very little Stereo effects. You basically can count all of them on 1 hand. The dialog sounded mostly clear and fine to<br />my ears. There was also some surprisingly good bass in a few scenes. I think it was a pretty good BD edition by<br />Capelight Pictures.<br /><br />Film: 4/5<br />Overall: 4/5s. There was also some surprisingly good bass in a few scenes.

030758836X|4.0|I like to read, but I can be picky at times. I don't like books that are too 'girly', I don't like authors that use tons of big, obscure words that I have to look up, and I definitely don't like anything that isn't REAL. I love to read, but I am an amateur reviewer. I won't tell you about the book, instead I'll tell you how I feel about the book - because isn't that why we read? To feel something?<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is a fantastic book (although, I'll admit - I did have to look up a few words :D).  I read it in 3 days, which is pretty quick for me, especially given it's length. I literally spent an entire Sunday doing nothing but read this book because I simply couldn't think of anything better to be doing than reading it. It will keep you enthralled and horrified at the same time. There are characters you'll love, and characters you'll hate. You will change sides many times and find yourself not knowing who the real \\"bad guy\\" is - even after you finish reading.<br /><br />I only have two complaints. First, there were numerous uses of British slang (for example: kerfuffle ??) and I don't understand why. Flynn is not British (I checked), the characters have no British roots, and there was never a mention of England at all. I found it confusing and distracting.<br />Secondly, I thought the ending was a bit of a letdown. Not so much what happens in the end, but maybe more the lack of... detail... emotion... in the conclusion. After 350+ pages of pure (struggling to find the right word...) fire, I was expecting a big, explosive ending and I was left feeling a bit confused and empty.<br /><br />But all in all this book is FANTASTIC and I will definitely be reading Flynn's other books!

These two books together define a paradighm shift for how to eat right and live healthier. I lost 18 pounds (from 246), blood glucose dropped from 170's to 130's, and blood pressure dropped from 140's to 120's over the first 18 days (and counting) on the plan these two authors suggest. Amazing that no calorie counting is needed to achieve all of this. Although a little difficult to read (lots of details), it rates a 5 due to the much needed education about the effects of wheat and what following the ideas presented can lead to.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I finally broke down and read Hunger Games a few months after I ordered it.  I do not regret the purchase but there is no way that I would let any child under 16 read it.  The violence is pretty shocking and the only thing keeping the publisher from listing this as an adult read is that there is no sexual content in it.<br />I would have liked the author to have given just a little more background on the districts and the capital but you had to pick up what little she gave you fast because once the games begin, it is pretty brutal.<br /><br />All in all, I admired the premise of the story but it was a little hard to understand that these games could even exist.  This it where it would have been nice to have more of a history of the circumstances that brought the games to life and the reasons that parents accepted that 23 of their children would die every year in a fight to the death.  I get that there was an uprising but why did the hunger games appear out of that.  Keeping the districts starving and captive not enough?  Taking all their resources not enough?  The writer just did not give enough of a background to make this believable.  I found it hard to accept that all the residents of the capital would tolerate these games for as long as they have. Fear only keeps us captive for so long.  These games have gone on for a long time.<br /><br />P.S. If you are committed to reading the trilogy, do not read the reviews for the final book in the series.  The reviews were mixed and many were quite harsh.  Alot of spoilers as well.

0345803485|2.0|bought the book because a friend of mine read it and loved it so much she could not stop talking about it, seriously what is wrong with this woman, the book is poorly written, the main characters are veryyyyyy unrealistic .. a multi millionaire 27 year old, who has his own business?? yeah right give me a break!! and a College graduate who is a virgin... ha!! felt like the book tries to sell the idea of being tied up, humiliated and spanked as a very good way of release... I did not like it.. this author needs an editor, really bad!!
0345803485|3.0|I had a feeling this book would disappoint after all of the hype.  This book would entice a married couple that needs to spice up their \\"night life\\" ~  at least that is what it appears to be doing to all of my married friends with children.  Longtime experienced \\"singles\\" would not think much of this book- let alone get turned on by it.  I find it very easy to put down.  I knew it wasn't going to be a great book after the first virgin sex scene...totally unrealistic along with the ages of this couple.  I think if they made him 47 and her 41 it would have been more of a believable sex story...

0786838655|4.0|I'm honestly not sure why it took me so long to read \\"THE LIGHTNING THIEF\\". I grew up on Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc. and this is a series I surely would have loved as a kid. The only possible explanation is that I was 11 when the first book came out and at that time I was already reading at a much higher level. By the time the series gained momentum, I was a teenager. Anyway, I saw the film when it was released and found it fairly poor but the basic concept intrigued me. Greek demigods in modern times? Adventures? Super powers? Sign me up. I bought a paperback copy and it subsequently lay in my room for months. Then, after reading the \\"Game of Thrones\\" series  I finally picked up The Lightning Thief for a bit of light reading.<br /><br />THE PLOT: For anyone who isn't aware the basic plot is as follows: Percy Jackson, a young boy with ADHD and dyslexia has been struggling through various schools all his life. Trouble seems to follow him everywhere but he is unaware of his true powers and destiny as a Greek demigod. A son of Poseidon, god of the sea. He discovers the truth and must go on a quest with friends to save his kidnapped mortal mother and prevent a war in Olympus. Zeus, lord of the sky, is convinced Percy is guilty of stealing his master bolt, a powerful weapon, and so on top of everything else Percy must find he bolt and prove his innocence. Along the way, he meets many figures of classical mythology who have moved into the modern world.<br /><br />THE WRITING: Rick Riordan has created an engaging tale, and his pacing is addictive. Many of the chapters end with cliffhangers that are sure to motivate you to go on.  The chapters are quite short as well, which is nice as it provides many stopping points and never seems to drag on. The writing is fairly simplistic and easy for children to read, and Percy has an amusing, slightly sarcastic voice as the lead character. The story is written in first person, which I know can be off-putting for some people. I myself prefer 3rd person narration, but it didn't particularly bother me here. The world Riordan has created is, like Hogwarts or Narnia, the kind of world any child would gladly jump into. I imagine many kids debate over which god would be the coolest parent to have, and what powers would be the most fun to inherit.<br /><br />THE COMEDY: Humor is certainly a large part of the appeal of these books. The chapters often have silly titles like \\" I Become the Supreme Lord of the Bathroom\\" and \\"A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers\\". These are pretty indicative of the kind of humor you'll find throughout the novel. It's definitely goofy, American kid humor and whether it works for you depends on personal preference. Personally, I prefer wittier, more subtle, often British humor(Ex: Monty Python, Harry Potter, Joss Whedon) but I appreciated Riordan's style even though it never caused me to laugh out loud. Much of the humor comes from the clash of ancient, classical mythology and modern America. (Ex: The way the gods are portrayed in human form. Poseidon seems like a chill fisherman with Hawaiian tees and a crinkled smile, Ares, god of war, is a tough biker dude type, etc.)<br /><br />POTENTIAL FLAWS: Overall, I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars because I thought it was exciting and enjoyable but not without flaws. In particular, I thought it sometimes shied away from emotional depth, such as when Percy's mother was kidnapped. I thought more could have been done with that situation. However, as a children's book I accept that it didn't want to be too dark early on. Riordan isn't much for slow moments, which can be both a strength and weakness. He always keeps the plot and action going, but I could have used a bit more character development for the leads. Annabeth and Grover are good characters, but they never seem as fully fleshed out as similar characters in other series.<br /><br />PJ vs HP?: For Harry Potter fans: I'll try to keep this short as it bothers me how whenever a series becomes popular it immediately must be compared with Harry Potter or some other cultural icon. I hate the endless labeling of books as the \\"next Harry\\". Series should be taken on their own merits. But, despite that, I wanted to comment on the constant comparisons between these two series and give my take on the question: Is Percy Jackson really as good as \\"Harry Potter\\"? In my humble opinion. No, It is not. Not even close. Having read the entirety of both series, I found Percy Jackson to be much less complex, less sophisticated, and less well-plotted. There are far fewer major characters and narratives to deal with, and generally less backstory, world building, and philosophical meaning. There were moments when I found Percy Jackson to be a bit derivative of \\"Harry Potter\\", but never enough so that I would consider it a \\"rip-off\\". It distinguishes itself well with its premise surrounding Greek and Roman mythology. That said, is it still worth a read for HP fans? Perhaps. If you loved HP there is a chance you will enjoy many aspects of this series. It definitely takes you back to your childhood and ignites a sense of fun and adventure. Percy Jackson is NOT the next Harry Potter, but it is a good series in its own right.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: The greatest compliment I would give this book is that it is FUN, pure and simple. It's not always particularly deep, but it's a great adventure story and also surprisingly educational. I know I've learned loads about mythology from reading this series. It's popularity with kids is well deserved. I'd say it's an ideal novel for young reluctant readers.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful as it's my very first book review for this site!<br /><br />-Kailee
B00406UK7S|3.0|The title pretty much sums up my feelings about this movie. The storyline (while hardly unique) is interesting enough to hold one's attention. The cinematography nicely depicts the desolate nature of the terrain and adds a level of desperation to the hero's tale. The actors and actresses do a great job of conveying their various roles, although the lead character seems to have three emotional states - sad, angry, and really angry. All in all, the components of a very good movie are here.<br /><br />And then...<br /><br />It appears that at some point, the directors decided that gory violence trumps any kind of real character development. Case in point - the woman who plays the relentless scout looking for the Centurion. The actress does a wonderfully understated job of projecting rage and a relentless desire for revenge without ever saying a word in the movie. There is even a good storyline about her background and why she wants to kill the Romans so badly. Her character could have been further developed to flesh out her role but that doesn't happen. Instead, she is a two-dimensional cartoon character of anger and rage against the Romans. So what do they show instead? Heads being cleaved, arrows being put in people's eyes, pikes almost splitting people in half, and so on and so on. By about the fourth battle scene, only my thought was \\"Oh no, here we go again\\". Of course, this is all done like the Matrix movies where things are happening so fast, you cannot even figure out what is going on. I guess the idea is to pack in as much violence and gore as will fit in a movie of this length. For me, it was my cue to go get a refill of my drink.<br /><br />In the end, this movie was a lost opportunity. The fate of the Roman Ninth Legion is one of those enduring mysteries that would make for a great story. The \\"bare-bones\\" of a good story is here. There appears to have been some energy placed in developing the characters. However, nothing is fleshed out into a coherent storyand the characters end up being textbook characters with no real depth to make us want to care about them. It's not like there isn't a template for this either. Check out Gladiator. That movie had plenty of violence, but not at the expense of the storyline or character development. Even the supposed plot twist at the end is both predictable and boring. As for the violence, if gore is your reason for seeing a movie, then you will not be disappointed. However, for me, I would have preferred to have less battle scenes and more character development.
B007SGM084|5.0|I simply could not put these books down, while reading the first of the series and being 75% finished I knew I had to obtain the second so I didn't have to wait between readings. I did the same with the third.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged by the description of erotica(yes, there is a lot of sex), however, once I began reading it was less about the sex and more about the relationship.<br /><br />The actual writing left a little to be desired, however, the story more than made up for the shortcomings. I loved the nice little wrap up in book three and the bonus following the epilogue. Great job E. L. James!

The pacing of the book was great, I was just so invested in the story I wanted to know now.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I ordered this product to turn cassettes into MP3 files.  The product plugs into a USB port. However, once you use a USB port and unplug it, that port will no longer recognize the device. It triggers something not to allow the computer to recognize it from that port. Once you use all your USB ports on your computer, you can no longer use the device. Also, it uses Audacity software to run. Every other time I recorded part of the cassette and was ready to export it, a message would pop up saying Audacity had stopped working and would have to be shut down. One of the most frustrating computer experiences.  I tried finding dbTech online and found a company in New Jersey that sells software globally; it was not the company that manufactured this product. There is no contact information on them anywhere in their material. I would not recommend this product at all.

B007L96SI6|4.0|I absolutely love Haley - she has the most amazing voice, style and charisma - I like the cd, and could never give Haley less than 4 stars, but I am disappointed that this cd is so over produced - her voice does not require anyone using a lot of electronics and mixing to make it sound better - it is like putting a lot of crappy sauce on a filet mignon or fresh swordfish - I hope her next cd is a more bare bones, t-bone burnett approach - with a couple old Ella Johnson, Helen Humes, Ruth Brown or Irma Thomas tunes Haley is amazing now and will only get better, but next time get the too many cooks in the kitchen/mixing room producers out of the way and let the soulful voice of Haley shine through
1401216676|5.0|This was really incredible. The story was great, but what really made it so memorable was the terrific art and the way panels mirrored each other as we shifted from the Joker's tortured memories to the present day.

0393080269|4.0|\\"Then He saw wisdom and declared it; He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out.\\" -- Job 28:27 (NKJV)<br /><br />Books designed to highlight relative investment opportunities are very difficult to write. First, they quickly become dated. A newsletter would seem like a more appropriate place to share the information on a regular basis. Second, you have to know a lot about many subjects or your observations don't have much value. Third, if you don't include information that investors want to know, they don't see much value in what you provide. Fourth, there's a tremendous amount of fact-checking required unless you just wing it. Fifth, it can be dry, dry, dry.<br /><br />I found that Mr. Ruchir Sharms, head of Emerging Market Equities and Global Macro at Morgan Stanley Investment Management did an above average job in Breakout Nations.<br /><br />Here's the good news. He's been to these countries and provides \\"on the ground\\" perspectives that go beyond the usual statistics. He tries to pick on bigger themes so that his observations won't go out of date so fast. He also warns readers on what to watch out for should things change (as they inevitably do). He addresses industry sectors where there should be divergences within a nation. He also has a mental framework that he uses to size up markets and pretty consistently applies that method to his reports. He also has a pleasant writing style that relies a lot on anecdotes and factoids that serve as straws in the wind to make his points.<br /><br />Here's the bad news. It is dated. You'll learn an awful lot more about GDP potential than individual stocks to buy. It's awfully thin in covering some nations. I didn't always feel confident that I could draw the indicated conclusion from the facts presented.<br /><br />One of the book's best strengths is that he takes a realistic approach to why commodities have been so bullish in recent years and makes an effective argument that such is likely to be all but over. That observation can save you a bundle as the market shifts to new nations.<br /><br />I also think he's right in saying that some emerging markets, not all, will do well. You will have to be much more selective in years to come.<br /><br />So what does he conclude? With specific noted reservations, Mr. Sharma is most intrigued by the opportunities in China, South Korea, Poland, Czech Republic, and Turkey. With more doubts, he also sees potential in Indonesia and Thailand. He describes ways that other nations could do a lot better, including Russia and India.<br /><br />I didn't buy his argument for China. That's a bubble waiting to burst big time. Be careful there.<br /><br />It's a fun read, but be aware that any major shift in trading blocks could knock many of these arguments into a cocked hat . . . something he didn't say much about.tion can save you a bundle as the market shifts to new nations.<br /><br />I also think he's right in saying that some emerging markets, not all, will do well.

030746363X|4.0|I'll only comment on the parts I did, which is how you are meant to approach the book.  A lot of the knowledge is already out there in a lot of fields such as martial arts (I trained 9 years MMA) and body building, but he brings it altogether and condenses it well.<br /><br />Low carb diet - works if you follow it. I lost 8 lbs in one month, with no adjustment to gym routine, and without taking the 4HB stack.  My girlfriend won a slimming comp at her local gym, whilst also stepping up to 2 spin classes a week and also using the 4HB stack, losing around 14 lbs in I think 8 or 10 weeks!  It is hard to stick to, make no doubt, and you seem to gain the wait back when you come off, but having cycled on and off twice it definitely does work.<br /><br />Bulking - again, it works.  If you stick to the amounts of protein to be consumed, and use the low rep to failure, big compound body moves prescribed, this will work.  Not that much particularly new here to those that know this field, but he does condense it well, and I was effectively able to hold about 5KG / 11lb of extra defined mass, with only a couple of very short workouts twice a week (although i did a couple more things over the basic big moves prescribed, mainly core stuff though).<br /><br />Injury rehabilitation - from having 2 ruptured L4 and L5 vertebrae, pushing on nerves making me limp 18 months ago, the ecosture system he shows worked wonders for me - within a month or so all symptoms were gone.  It's actually a massive expansion on what my consultant orthopedic surgeon gave me as an exercise, and obviously hugely increases the effectiveness of it.  If you have any disk/degenerative/nerve pressure issue in your back, you really have NOTHING to lose trying this - it's non-manipulative, and easy to do.<br /><br />15m minute female orgasm? - don't think you could keep most girls that still for long enough to find out  :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app all the time to know how much batter power my kindle fire has left, and about how long I can use different types of apps on the device.  It helps me understand what I have used batter power on.  It helps me decide if I need to plug in my Kindle before I go to bed or to just power it off.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book.....makes you wanna find your own Christian Grey.  I could not put this book down.  After every chapter I would say, \\"One more chapter.\\"
0345522478|5.0|So I'm on the most recent of this series (Tricked) and wanted to go back to book one and write a review, because if I can convince even one person to pick this book up it's so worth it. This author is a genius, he combines magic and all the worlds gods and goddesses, real-world realism and puns into a butt-kicking series that is always worth a laugh and a read. Seriously, if you don't laugh your insane. It stars a 2000 year old Druid from Ireland whose best friend is an Irish wolfhound named Oberon who talks back, and I mean seriously talks back and commiserates. This is like a beefed up, modern, real-world, pun-filled type of adult Xanth series by Piers Anthony. Its the conversations that go on in your head. This series is worth a read by anyone, seriously. Pick it up and read it, you won't regret it.
0345803493|5.0|Ok so I LOVE this series...this one had a little to much sex in my opinion but the story line was GREAT...my local bookstore is suppose to have some of book number 3 in by Friday I do hope they come in because I CANT wait to read it!!! I finished this one in one day!!! AWESOME!!!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|when I purchased angry birds space there was no release form to buy space eagle I didn't even get to try it free!!!!!!!!!!! If it was going to give me a release form I would of rate this 5 stars
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not only is the writing style very dull and the characters extremely unbelievable, but when did submission to a man with power once again become ideal? I can understand why many women are drawn to the novel as erotic literature, but the idea of submitting yourself to a rich playboy only to somehow \\"change him\\" is a completely laughable and contrived form of romance. The characters in this book will never turn out happy. Get real.
B005DB7NHO|5.0|i love 1D so this was the perfect book for me! the book was absolutely fabuLOUIS, phenomeNIALL, brillLIAM, exstraordinHARRY and amaZAYN!!!!!!
B004I654WQ|5.0|Awesome movie. Having both Blue Ray and DVD come in 1 package is a great value.  Convenient for those of us who use both blue ray and regular DVD machines.
034580404X|1.0|Could not finish.  Not impressed.  Trying too hard. Shows our morals are going down the drains. Books like this are the reason we are declining as a society.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Beware of this application.  They are spamming Amazon with fake reviews claiming that people love their product who have not really reviewed it.
B000FBJGKO|2.0|We chose this book for our Book Club, and the overwhelming response was negative.  The common thread was that the letters in the book actually distracted from the story, were difficult to read (poor language flow), and in general did not enlarge the understanding of the characters.  In addition, the characters in the book did not engage and in some cases, actually enraged, the readers.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I remember when the first Mission: Impossible movie released. I thought it was fantastic. Great intricate story and spy stuff.<br /><br />Then the second one came along. It's been a while since I saw that one, but the one thing I remember is constantly wondering who will be wearing a mask, revealing they are not who you think they are. Long story short, it was a dumb movie.<br /><br />The third movie brought the franchise back, with J.J Abrams at the directing helm. A much improved movie, although it still lacked the fun of the original.<br /><br />All of that is rectified with Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol. Sure, J.J. Abrams still had a role with the movie by producing it, but Brad Bird of Pixar fame was wisely put at the helm to direct. What comes from this is a fun spy movie with a great sense of humor.<br /><br />From the fantastic opening scene (I won't ruin it for you here) where Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt as he should--a smart spy who makes dangerous choices that are to the point of being humourous--to the very end where a frantic entanglement with the enemy takes place, the movie is a load of fun. It brings it back to the glorious days of the original.<br /><br />Although, let's be clear. The original movie is still better. This is a close second.<br /><br />I'm not going to waste this review on telling you the story, as other reviews give plenty of that. I will say that this is a fun movie with great action, spy tactics, and character development. We learn more of Ethan Hunt's character along with the crew he ends up with. I enjoyed it a lot and hope this installment of the franchise invigorates it and leads to more in the future.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game. It is very addicting and I play it every day. I want to get the full version but it costs way too much.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|This game is a great relaxing time waster.  Good price for a whole lot of game.  If you are into puzzle<br />games like Dropple or just brainteasers in general give this title a try
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book alone is not complete. The writing is weak and redundancy abounds in. the author's themes, descriptions,  idioms, and vocabulary. The ending is blatantly (shamelessly) set up as a means to invest the reader in the sequel. That being said, the trilogy ends up being a nice love story where a woman's love saves/\\"tames\\" a completely lost, emotionally inaccessible, controlling man.<br />Putting the writing and the plot to the  side, the juicy bits are delicious little morsels of unadulterated fun. Ladies, your husband will enjoy you reading this book as much as you will!
0439023513|4.0|I read the Hunger Games Trilogy with my 11 YO daughter.  This was the hardest book to get through.  The plot-line moves along very well, just like the other books did.  But with this book, it's like the Harry Potter books.  With every book that came out, me and my kids would read them aloud and pretty soon, the characters were like friends that we'd been missing, but didn't realize it until Mrs. Rowling did us the honor of coming out with the next book.<br /><br />We felt like we knew Katniss (one tough admirable cookie if you ask me!), but we also knew her little sister Prim and how much she loved her (so much that she would give her own life up for her)and the other main characters too, Gale and Peeta.  Chapter 24 is the worst chapter ever and I won't give it away, but it had us both in tears and after that, it was just very, very difficult to finish. This story will break your heart.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish I had read the reviews prior to reading this trilogy. This is the most horribly written, severely amateur, repetitive nonsense I have ever read. Now I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the passion but come on we are grown-ass adults here stop calling your vagna \\"sex\\" it's annoying. I hope for her sake this woman doesn't continue a career in writing.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|graphically beautiful. a little too borrowed story line. still an enchanting occupier of time. deffinately fun but deffinately in need of zoom capabilities for us old folks. well worth the mula.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I find it so hard to put down all of Sparks Books, I read this one in 8 hours! I encourage anyone to get this book, as well as the rest of his collection! Amazing!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is freaking legit I love this game I'm always working on my high score and always have temple run marathon's with my brother and sister!!
B007N8RULO|4.0|I like the game and it works well but the ads drive me crazy. if there has to be ads I think banner ads might be a good compromise. also would like to be able to save as different players.
0393317552|5.0|I've had this one on the shelf sine 2002.  Not sure why I never got around to reading it but knew that I wanted to simply because he won the Pulitzer Prize for it.  I can't believe that it has taken me this long to read such a fascinating book.<br /><br />Diamond takes a different approach than most other others of likewise material.  His approach was to cover the non-western civilizations, or the civilizations as the western world came in to contact with them.  What you have then is all the missing sections, all the how's and why's that you always had (at least I did) when reading history of ancient civilizations or wonder how some things are the way they are.  Diamond details out the migration patterns of the world, shows how a crop moved from location to location, how animals were domesticated and which ones were domesticated on which continents.  He breaks out first contacts in South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii and South Africa (yes South Africa, with a huge desert in the middle of the continent it made it difficult to get to the southern part of the continent).<br /><br />Some nuggets that I came away with was the how of why civilization arouse in the Fertile Crescent and then spread East and West and ultimately dominated all other civilizations.  That there were more domestic animals (in fact the majority were in the Eurasian continent), which were used as a food and power source, which led to population growth.  The importance of the animals than comes in that it was their diseases that infected humans and built their immune systems up so that when they encountered other civilizations, notably the Americas which didn't have any domestic animals (of the larger animals only Llamas, and those were localized) and thus no built up immunities.  Extremely fascinating information that I've always wanted to learn about and if I had only known it was all in this volume I would have read it back in 2002.  Another gem?  Madagascar was colonized by an Asian culture.  Who'd a thought with it being so far away from the Chinese mainland and so close to Africa?<br /><br />There are some dry parts, such as the tracing of crops in certain regions and discussing how they came about to become domesticated.  But the positives far outweigh the drier parts (for although they aren't as interesting they are still interesting enough).  I would most certainly recommend.  Read this with Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything.<br /><br />5 stars.
B005ICHA94|5.0|A five star book, in my opinion. I bought this book for my dad who used to own this book as a child, about 48 years ago. It will be a birthday gift and I'm sure it will bring back memories for him.  As for myself, I fell in love with this book the moment I picked it up. It's surely a classic that everyone will continue to love for many, many generations to come.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Lightweight, yet protective.  My Kindle Keyboard fits securely.  The cover folds back for easy one handed reading.  Looks like an old book when sitting on my coffee table.
B0086700CM|1.0|I love temple run, but lately it has been lagging so much that it is unplayable! I love this game to much for it not to work!
B0086700CM|5.0|its challengeing and its fun and its complicated sometimes I just want to give up but I keep on trying and I get it then I get higher and higher scores
B0086700CM|4.0|very addictive at first but gets a little boring after a while but still very entertaining especially for kids and a great gamec to pass the time.
B0086700CM|3.0|I love this game but it is way better on smaller devices and a lot easier to play on smaller devices
B00785P2QC|5.0|i lovs this game!!! i play it everytime i get a chance!!! you should try it. its like creating your own little world and pitting things where you want them!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps on the kindle fire I love drawing and this is the best app for drawing!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. It's awesome! I mostly like the flies right now. But sushi is pretty fun and so is bomber pigeon.
B005F96URI|4.0|Fun story, great acting, cool action! A good movie to pop a tub of corn and enjoy with a tall cool coke.
B004X80QNG|5.0|This app is great. I mixed up the name of this app with another one and accidentally reviewed the other one as this one and gave it at terrible review because it wasn't what it said it was, lol, and then realized that THIS app is for my purposes COMPLETELY what it says it is. I am unable to delete my review do it later, all I can do is edit my review. I haven't gotten a chance to really use this app, just went through it and messed around a bit, but so far it's just what I thought it was and perfect for what I need. After I use it some more I will come back and edit this again, but for now I think it's perfect. I know some people say that they can't sync it, and I haven't tried that and probably won't because I don't need to because I only use the calendar on my phone, not online so I have nothing to sync. I guess if I needed that feature I would give it less than the 5 stars, but since I don't need that feature I'm not including the lack of it in my review, plus I don't know if it works or not. For my purposes this seems perfect and I'm happy to have found it and even happier to have gotten it for free through amazon. Droid X
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|This is truly an awesome album for any Adam Lambert fan.  The upbeat tracks get you moving and the slower tracks get you thinking!  One piece of advice I wished I'd figured out before I bought though- I wish I would have bought the regular album (which included a digital booklet) and then added the extra songs from the deluxe version.  The cost would have been similar to buying the deluxe version (which didn't come with the booklet??).  I've found this scenario to be true for other \\"deluxe\\" editions as well.  Do the math and buy the regular version and then add the few extra songs separately.  I only wish the remixes were included or available at Amazon!
B007NESBK2|5.0|Brought back memories of a spectacular night. Just like being there, but I have to brag: I had better seats.
B0051GOB26|5.0|Before this movie was released, saw the trailer and knew nothing else. Went, saw it, then went again, and as I get older this film gets better. Obviously most of the characters in the film are really simple folk, one a deadbeat, one a trouble Vietnam vet and then other an associate. The acting is superb on everyone's behalf and the writing, the editing and the directing is top notch. It's a timeless film and it is NOT for everyone and THAT's what makes it stand appart from your typical Hollywood BS!
0307950689|5.0|I absolutely loved reading The Lost Symbol. The moment I opened up the book it was a page turner and I found it really hard to put down. I read the entire book in just over 2 days. It was a definate page turner!
B000WT5IUQ|5.0|I'm a sucker for Christmas music, but have a nostalgic taste.  I don't particularly care for many of the newer versions of songs, but rather like to stick with the songs my Mother played on a seemingly 24/7 loop from the beginning of November through the end of December.  This album was a constant staple, and I was so happy when I found it available for MP3 download!  Every song takes me back, allowing me to rummage through years of wonderful memories.  My favorites are Christmas Waltz, Merry Christmas Darling, Christmas Song, & Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.<br /><br />I love that I can now continue this musical tradition with my little girls, who will be 4 & 3 this year (and a new son who will be 1 month) on Christmas Morning this year.
0385342063|5.0|This is absolutely the best Sophie Kinsella book ever! I've read all her books and love them all but this one is favorite. I rarely read a book more than once but this one really got into me that i read it several more time and every time i can't help but think of certain events and of Sam and Poppy!<br /><br />When i began reading the book I half expected already that Poppy and Sam would end up together and of course i wanted them to(who doesn't?), but the question is how? and all the events that lead to the fairytale ending i wanted was all great, and funny, and romantic and makes me giggly. and those are what makes this book so damn good that i hope there's a sequel to this story!
B0086700CM|4.0|Lags sometimes on the kindle fire but overall really fun game. Now I know why all my friends love this game...
0425221806|5.0|WATCHERS is one of the best novels I've ever read. A thrilling combination of adventure, action, great suspense, awe, respect for the author and his characters, a Cinderella-type romance, adrenalin lifts, empathy, sympathy...  Couldn't put it down.  And, surprisingly, I even cried for the villain who was so consumed with jealousy and envy.  And who could blame him?: he was a victim, as well!  Ah, if I could only find more compelling books like this one.  If you're a dog lover, you'll love this one. It's one of those rare books that I wish I'd written. My next dog will be a Golden Retriever, in honor of Einstein.  Hats off to Dean Koontz, a superb wordsmith.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|At first I thought the style of writing was difficult to follow but as I got into it, it was easier. Found I had to retain the to/from or I got confused but I caught on.<br />I really didn't know what the book was about when I bought it but it turned out to be interesting the way people lived during the Occupation. I had not realized how difficult life had been for them. It was quite touching.
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|This one is a good Archer. The plots in his books are repetitive though, but the author has style enough to keep churning out books that are gripping, entertaining. This definitely keeps me buying Archers, although some of the earlier books have been disappointing, when the author has gone outside his home territory and has not bothered to check local facts. The Swiss story was disastrous - has JA ever been there? So I prefer Archers such as this one.
B006OB3K56|2.0|Character development was a bit sloppy. Also, the plot could have been conveyed with a lesser amount of graphicness. Sometimes it was graphic for graphic sake and didn't seem to lend much to the story line.  This could have easily been created as an R rated film and still have gotten the same point across.  I gave it a few stars because there were parts of it that were pretty good.  However, overall, I think it was lacking.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|As a consulting newbie I find Cheng's book extremely helpful in helping me to structure my thoughts throughout the case interview process. It is a great read and sometimes difficult to put down. I highly recommend it - it has definitely made me feel more at ease as I enter the consulting recruitment period. The book doesn't need to contain cases, it is foolish to rely solely on one book for case prep.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I enjoy a \\"smut\\" book now and then... The usual romantic/sex book.  But, this book is just too much.  You can't read more than 5 pages before they are \\"at it again\\".... Most readers are probably curious about the dom/sub stuff.  Just go to Wikipedia and look it up and save your money.  The book in brief is about a  woman who just graduted from college and is a virgin (yeah, right) and a depraved billionaire who likes rough sex.. that's it in a nutshell.
B006HL9G10|5.0|i love this app great for getting some meditation in when I need a work break. This lets me time a little R&R time during my fifteen minute breaks. Try it really works well. Happy to share my thoughts on this app.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I have found this to be an enthralling read, I am amazed at how some authors can put to paper their stories and have them be such a great read. I can't wait to purchase the rest of the trilogy
0307719774|5.0|Just got this today and I'm loving it! I actually anticipated the book to look as it does on the thumbnail Amazon provided (beige, royal looking almost) but its actually more of like a scrap-book brown.. but I still think its extremely pretty with its gold trimmed pages. I haven't actually started writing in it yet, but I've looked through some of the questions and they seem really interesting. Its really great to keep you entertained everyday.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a really good game. I love temple run its really fun game. get it now. please do it
0374275637|5.0|In the past, people have had to read scholarly journals (which can be complex and boring) to learn this information. This book cuts to the chase and tells us the bottom line.<br /><br />Kahneman, a pioneer in behavioral economics, puts together many years of research and hundreds of experiments in a very easy way to learn.  The book, while long, does not seem so.  It is written for the layman to understand and clearly demonstrates the differences between the brain that thinks fast (intuitive/emotional response) and the slower thinking (thought and effort) - as well as the purposes, strengths and shortcomings of each.<br /><br />An excellent read for people wanting to understand how our brains think and what we can do to improve the way we think about things.  Not overly scientific and certainly not boring.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very kool games and can't stop. playing. The games can be very hard  but the more you play the better you get.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had decided to just get a sampel of this book,but after that i was hooked. I have not been able to put this book down and when i do it is always on my mind. The story line and the sex stories are very,very,very captivating. It makes you want what Ana has and also that Christen loves her so unconditionly,Truly,Truly well written. Almost at the end of book three,savoring it because it is the last volume, I may have to start from the beginning again. Only a woman knows what a woman needs and feels,  BRAVO to  E.L. James, cannot wait for your next installment of Holding My Breath for GREY!!!!!!!! I hope there will be a movie made of this book. I have started to read each book over again ,can not put it down, Absoutly my favorite book.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja is soooo fun! I love all the blades and backgrounds. I finally get to play with my food! LOL! It is so addicting! Slicing fruits.... is so much fun. One of my favorite games! Would give it 6 stars if I could! Download now!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Honestly, thia is one of the best books I've ever read. I am on Book three now ; Mockingjay and I seriously can't put the book down.  The Hunger Games book 1 was very intriguing. The storyline was amazing and i totally fell in love with all of the characters. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
1451629184|4.0|I liked that the book was short, but it messed with my emotions a lot. I wanted to jump through the book and save this little girl who was being raped and abused for so many years. I was taken by the woman she is today and how she refuses to hate because it would eat her up. I appreciate that she can still smile and laugh and takes life to its fullest.
1847879071|5.0|Hurray to the author for a great combination.  Research and stats is not always a crowd pleasurer but hurray to the author for his style of writing this book.  He definitely took the sting out of learning Stats!!!!  Thanks Andy Field
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I watched this movie in theaters--twice. It is one of my all time favorite. It tugs at the truth of the heart and Will Smith and his son portray the characters beautifully!
B007U1FEJE|4.0|The title track is one of my favorite Beach Boys songs of all time - I can't get it out of my head. Only thing I didn't care for was the Mike Love Song ..... boring... If you like the classic Beach Boys and especially Brian wilson - by all means get this album.
0393064476|1.0|The way in which Greenblatt blatantly falsifies his extremely selective historical analysis makes this an extraordinarily dishonest piece of scholarship. The fact that it won a Pulitzer is embarrassing. It is a waste of paper that simply perpetuates Enlightenment garbage about the Middle Ages and Christianity that has been proven wrong over and over again. I will not detail why I feel this way...which I'm sure discounts your opinion of this review. But the fact that people can read this and not realize how self-evidently false and over-simplified it is strikes me as profoundly irresponsible. Do not waste your money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it:). Couldn't put it down.  Had to read the other two books in the series  right after I was done this one. Best I have read in along time
014241543X|5.0|Where has this book been all my life?<br /><br />The rather short synopsis for If I Stay is not purposefully vague. It tells you all you need to know. However, it doesn't tell you everything; namely, how you will feel while reading this book.<br /><br />The feelings and emotions this book evoked in me are almost undescribable. This is truly one of the best-written books I have ever read, and it's not just because the writing is technically correct, or because all punctuation is properly placed. No, the reason why this book is one of the best I've ever read is because I connected, totally and completely, with the characters. If I Stay made me laugh, cry, grieve, and rejoice in equal measure, and most of all, left me wanting more.<br /><br />Mia Hall had it all. A supportive, loving family, loyal best friend, gorgeous boyfriend who was crazy about her, and a promising future as a supremely talented cellist. In one moment, on a snow day in Oregon, all of that is stripped away in the swerve of tires, the crunch of metal, and the deafening silence of the aftermath.<br /><br />Through a series of present- and past-tense narrations, we dig deep into Mia's character. Through her eyes, we see \\"the accident\\" that took her family and left her in a coma, and we learn about those left behind: her family and friends, and the incredible, all-encompassing bond they share. At the end of the story, I desperately wished that the Hall family were part of my own. The character development in If I Stay left me breathless and in awe of Gayle Foreman. Never have characters felt more real to me than they did in this story.<br /><br />Mia's parents are laid-back, loving, supportive, and totally cool. Her little brother, Teddy, is a cute little rascal who has a sweet connection to his big sister. Even her Grandma and Grandpa are involved in her life, tender and loving and honest. Mia's friends are not just friends; they are an extension of her family. An imperfect part of a perfect circle. As she reflected on her memories of and relationships with each of these people, I felt like I knew them.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|While a mildly entertaining story, this book is far from the masterpiece some people are describing it as. The story is ok, but has plenty of moments where you wonder why in gods name would someone act like that. What truly is lacking in this book is writing talent. I actually cringed when my sister told me her english teacher recommended this book. The writing is decent at best. The word choice leaves much to be desired, and while the story can bring you in I was constantly being dumped out of the story by wrutung that made several events boring, not because the events themselves are boring, but because they are described in a pitiful manner. Its worth reading if u want to know about one of todays &#34;hot topics&#34; but I wouldn't recomment it to someone desering a good book to read.
030758836X|5.0|They say it takes compromise.<br />The marriage of Nick and Amy may never have been what either of them truly believed it was meant to be.<br /><br />Celebration of a Fifth Year Anniversary,  what do you get the woman you no longer love?  What do you do to remind him that he loved you?<br /><br />This is a story that started out interesting and innocuous and turns itself on its ear becoming a twisted thriller and sacry commenatary on life today that you won't be able to put down.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book from start to end although can see where people may find problems with the resolution, I feel this is THE BOOK OF THE SUMMER!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The world created by Gearge R.R. Martin is incredible, and the story he tells is truly fantastic.  Neither of these, however, are what make this book a must read for me. The author is a master at establishing characters and creating relationships around them.  What brings me into these books is how I truly become the characters he is writing about.  Plus the author is a amazing writer.  When i read these books I am truly enveloped into the story so much so that it doesn't feel like I'm reading.  For me that requires two things; a good story, a master of writing. This book has a good story and George R.R. Martin is, at least in my mind, a literary genius.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard such great things about this series and was beyond disappointed. Unoriginal, forced, one sad sexual encounter strung together by drivel. And I have to be honest when I say I read the whole thing wondering when it was going to get better. At the end I was angry I had spent $9.99 on this garbage. There are thousands of better books out there to spend your hard earned money on.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great books!  The first one drags a little in the first half but then gets moving.  It's a little amateurishly written but gets better, trust me, stick with it.  The second and third books in the trilogy are so much better than the first and are much better written.  The content has been reviewed as \\"mommy porn\\" but its not so bad, mildly shocking but I don't think its anything that hasn't been seen on TV or in movies.  Highly recommend for a good, easy summer read.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Horrible writing. Vapid story with no real plot. I am embarrassed to have read all three books in hopes that I would find a redeeming quality. I am sad to report the only positive I could say was it ended.
1878424319|4.0|The Four Agreements has some wise points in it.  It makes one, who worries too much, about how others see them, feel much more at ease, that everything is not their fault.  The one big point, I believe, that The Four Agreements leaves out, is that the reader him/herself, is just as capable of hurting the other, as the other is capable of hurting the reader.  It goes on and on about \\"don't let yourself get/feel hurt by...... because it is not your fault\\".  What's missing is somewhere stating that you yourself (the reader) need to be wary of another person, and make sure your practices, attitudes, etc.. are not hurting them.  The reader can be as toxic as the other person, if they are not careful.  That needs to be stated here.  I have had friends recommend this book to me and I see that they act as if everything in life is everybody else's fault.  They don't see that they hurt others in the same way that The Four Agreements tells them not to be hurt.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|I have followed RTF since 1972, and they have made some gems. But this is the most clear example of what they can do. The addition of Ponty and the release of School Days makes this a must have CD for EVERY jazz fan.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|This is an amazing album start to finish. If you really like music, you will like this. This is a true Smashing Pumpkins album.<br />The opening track \\"Quasar\\" is the hard rocker of the album. The rest of the album you will find slower, faster, softer, louder.. up and down, quiet and loud moments.<br />To me there are two songs that have 'single' potential. They would be \\"The Celestials\\", good for alternative radio and \\"One Diamond, One Heart\\", which would work on adult alternative radio if that makes sense. Other stand out tracks for me include \\"Pale Horse\\", \\"Oceania\\", \\"Violet Rays\\", \\"Glissandra\\", \\"Wildflower\\" and \\"Pinwheels\\". The backing vocals by Nicole Fiorentino really blend well with Billy Corgans vocals, especially in the track \\"Pinwheels\\". Mike Byrne, 22 year old drummer does a good job for a first time studio drummer. Jeff Schroeder really holds his own with his guitar solos. I do not see how you can miss the old band after hearing these guys play and especially seeing them life.<br />There is lots of acoustic guitar, synthesizer and loud electric fuzz on this album. Just about everything a Smashing Pumpkins fan can like about the band is here.<br />There is not really a bad song on this album, if you are a fan of all kinds of music;soft, loud, slow, fast...you will love this.. But then again, The Smashing Pumpkins have always been this way.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love this game. I everytime I sit down I play for hours and hours and hours. I would like more games like this one.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|A great effort from the boys up north!  If you're a Rush fan, I think you'll be very pleased- if you have never liked them, this won't change your mind.  Of course, I haven't met many \\"middle of the road\\" Rush fans. I like all the cuts on the album with \\"The Anarchist\\" being possibly my favorite, but tough to call. It's no mean feat to produce an album as original and quality as this after nearly 40 years- all with the original (Sorry J.R., you weren't around long) three members. My sincere hope is that we'll get a few more like this out of them before they decide to hang up the guitars, basses & drumsticks & officially retire. Bravo!<br /><br />EDIT: I have seen a bunch of comments since my original post complaining about the quality of the sound on the album.  No doubt, the recording is dense, but I just don't hear the kind of horrible compression and lack of clarity some people are hearing.  There is a lot of bottom-end, and if I could remix it myself, I might favor the highs a little more, but it is right in line with what they have been producing for the past decade- a denser, darker sound.  I don't hear anything like the digital clipping on Vapor Trails (and even that I think some people tend to blow out of proportion, it is not a good thing, but doesn't ruin the album for me).  My 2 cents' worth...

B004LWZW42|2.0|Okay, okay, I confess:  I've never \\"read\\" an X-Men comic (and after watching this dredge never intend to), but because I can suspend disbelief with the best of them, and because I enjoy the Iron Man franchise (which of course, is also a Marvel offering), I gave this X-MEN version a viewing. . .and was in constant flux between eyeball rolling to hysterical laughter.  How gifted actors with serious thespian chops the likes of Kevin Bacon, James McAvoy, and Michael Fassbender would tolerate being a part of this belly wobbler is beyond me; here's hoping some agents received much-deserved pink slips as a result.  Set during the Cold War/Cuban Missile Crisis of the early Sixties, X-MEN:  FIRST CLASS is the story of how the various mutants came together under two alliances--the Cold War covert operatives, and the greedy gold diggers bent on world domination.  And. . .of course. . .once all the mutants are in one spot flaunting their super genes against one another, the capitalists and commies take advantage by mutually launching missiles to destroy these \\"monsters\\".  And--voila!--the table is set for all the succeeding X-MEN adventures in the franchise.<br /><br />Yawn.<br /><br />Are the special effects terrific?  Absolutely.  Are Rose Byrne, January Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, and Zoe Isabella Kravitz sweet-tooth eye candy?  Is the Pope Catholic?  But the rest of this dreck is beyond salvage, from the cornpone supreme story to the nutbar mutant names Magneto/Beast/Havok to the maddening nonstop superficiality.  Just how superficial?  From Magneto to Sebastian to Riptide to Azazel, there is some serious arrogance going down; this offering is an unabashed Haughtiness Fest (and a very lousy one at that).  No doubt fans of the franchise appreciate this prequel, and I get that; I'm just judging X-MEN:  FIRST CLASS as an Average Joe viewer with no preconceived notions, biases, or prejudices.  But having viewed the film, goodness gracious do I have all of them now.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.ls, Esq.
B000FC10HA|4.0|This was a great read, and short enough that I never felt anything was too drawn out. I definitely recommend it for anyone interested or involved in marketing, however I will advise to read it with the fact in mind that times have changed. I don't believe all the \\"laws\\" are immutable. I think the internet age has changed the game. You can refute several of the laws with real-world examples. Google was not at all first in the game of search engines yet now it owns most of that market share. Microsoft deviated from its \\"line\\" and creates all kinds of software and technology (MS office, Bing, etc) and while not all have been successful, it definitely has achieved success by \\"violating the law\\" of line extension. Still a great read, just be critical.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|The book itself is good, but to get the full glory from this piece you must abandon the written word and go straight to the audio book which is delivered with perfect timing, tone and nuance that one expects from Tina Fey. When reading a memoir, you really have to put yourself in that person's shoes, in their head and in their voice. Clearly, many reviewers don't believe that comes through in the writing, and it's the major drawback of most memoirs. Speaking of which, I'm not sure this really counts as an autobiography.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Derek had a great story to tell and I'm sure it's because of his different \\"background.\\" He isn't the typical entrepreneur who decided to start a company because he \\"wanted to be an entrepreneur.\\" Instead, his passion turned into a startup making him an entrepreneur. And he was damn good at it. If you've been reading a lot of entrepreneurship books lately (like I have been) I highly recommend reading this book for a different flavor. It's a different approach to building a company and very effective. Derek gets really personal that you feel like you get to know him. An inspiring way to sell the company as well!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|OK...So I am a gay male who likes the medical mystery kind of books. However, after much hype from other friends, I decided to download this series to my Kindle! OMG! I could not put it down and was up way into the night reading. It is addicting!! I may not be into the scenes that are depicted here, but I can say, it may my thought process go into overdrive. Not saying I would try some of the things, but not saying it didn't make me think about it. It was very erotic to me, though I do have to admit, that by the third book, you get tired of the same sex, sex, sex. But I learned to skim past some of this and found it to be a book that made me smile, made me gasp and definitely made my thoughts go into overdrive. It helped open my eyes to different things. Who knows what I will ever try in the future, but I can say that my eyes have been opened, and the possibilities are exhilarating!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was amazing!  Literally couldn't put it down!  Others that are saying that there are other and better \\"raunchy\\" books out there completely missed the main idea of the book!  This series of books really opens up as to who Christian Grey is and what exactly happened in his traumatic childhood.  Once the reader realizes this book is not just about the sex, it really becomes interesting to see what exactly happened in Christian's past.  I was not disappointed in the book but I was disappointed in Amazon.  This was the first book I had read with the kindle app on my ipad and I DO NOT like the fact that I cannot 'lend' the book to other people.  Since I bought the book i feel I should be able to lend to book to whomever i want.  I understand now that the publisher has not made the book available to lend by book owners.  Next time I will definitely be purchasing a hard copy of my books!
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This is a great book. Written in a straightforward, dry manner, it never breaks \\"character\\" and is all the better for it.

B004SOR4H6|5.0|there is hardly a difference between this app and the real site. I can tap a tweet, read the article, share the article, return to the twitter app right where I left off. IDK what others are talking abt. (shrugs shoulders)
1572814136|4.0|*This review treats only the Radiant deck with some comparison to the US Games Universal Waite. It's quite long enough without adding in other versions of the RWS deck!*<br /><br />As many folks have pointed out, these cards are brilliantly, beautifully colored--they are jewel-like and lovely from that standpoint. But when I first bought mine and laid them out, I also noticed two other things:<br /><br />(1) Yep, they were stinky! As others have noted, a little airing-out quickly solves this problem.<br /><br />(2) They just seemed *different* somehow. The first and most obvious difference is that the original hand-lettering of the card titles is gone, replaced by a clean type font on wider white borders, which lends the cards a more modern feel. The second difference, which took me a few moments to realize, is that these drawings are *not* those of the \\"original\\"-style Rider-Waite decks. Pamela Colman Smith (\\"Pixie\\") drew specific facial expressions and informed many of the characters' poses and attitudes with subtle line choices. This deck has been redrawn and simplified -- to my eye, it has an almost cartoonish look. (One could perhaps more charitably equate these as similar to a stained-glass rendering; outlines and figures are simplified, and many subtle line nuances are gone, in favor of the boldness of the coloring.) In quiet acknowledgment of the alterations, US Games has removed Pixie's signature from each card and has noted that the deck is \\"based on drawings by Pamela Colman Smith.\\"<br /><br />I point this out only because I think it's important to note that the coloring is *not* the only alteration made to these cards. If you have an earlier edition of this deck, you will notice the differences -- you may love them or hate them depending on your attachment to Pixie's original work. If this is your first Rider-Waite-Smith deck, you will be working with a different artistic style than the originals, although as others have pointed out the symbolism remainspretty much intact and, if you like the art style, the deck will be perfectly suitable. If you're not sure which version of the deck you'd like to purchase, I'd suggest looking at examples side-by-side online, or if possible, at your friendly local tarot shop. The differences in the drawings are noticeable throughout the deck, but specific cards for useful comparison are The Empress, The Emperor, The Lovers, and Justice. Take a look and see which style you prefer before you buy.<br /><br />A final note on color: There are of course many versions of the RWS deck, and about 20 years ago US Games came out with the \\"Universal Waite\\" colored by Mary Hanson-Roberts. Early printings of this version are quite softly shaded, almost pastel, and some tarot enthusiasts find them too \\"wishy washy.\\" I recently bought a more recent printing because I am away from home, and found that this new printing has much brighter, more emphatic colors -- I consider them closer to those in the Radiant deck than to those in the earlier pastel Universal deck. If you like the drawing style of the \\"original Rider-Waite\\" deck but prefer brighter colors, the Universal might be your thing. Its colors are *not* quite as rich as the Radiant deck (the Radiant's yellows have a lovely infusion of deep orange, and its reds and blues are much deeper), but it *is* much richer than the old Universal printings. I hope this makes sense. Again, in-person comparison is probably your best bet.<br /><br />I enjoy my Radiant deck -- the colors merit the name and beautifully so. But I love my Universal decks -- Pixie's drawings are faithfully represented and Hanson-Roberts' recoloring draws the eye into them, highlighting symbolism and providing an aesthetic touchstone that earlier editions could be argued to have lacked. I hope this helps you as you decide which version to adopt as your own.
0812973992|2.0|Irish writer Colum McCann has a nice 'James Joyce-ian' stream of consciousness style to his writing.  An early scene, weaving the car rides of two brothers through New York City streets, was engaging.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as a veteran who has friends that served in Vietnam, I stopped reading when Mr. McCann introduced a character who was supposedly stationed in country by orders of the president to get accurate number counts for our dead by computer hacking.  US fighting forces have a history dating back to the Civil War that we don't leave our dead behind.  That tradition, along with payroll records, pretty much gives a good number count for our casualties. Additionally, McCann has his character take frequent trips outside to cool off from working on the computer equipment room.  Having worked for a mainframe computer company in the '70's, and subsequently installed and maintained control equipment for decades, the one place a body can be sure to cool off is the equipment room.  There,temperatures are kept cool and brisk to prevent equipment from overheating!  Here's one last fine point, the Communications people in Vietnam usually maintained equipment in special truck convoys -- to keep mobile and to control the temperature with aux generators.<br /><br />Great works of fiction are great because real people can relate to the environment and circumstances of the story. It would seem as if Mr. McCann didn't bother to check with a Vietnam vet with regards to the circumstances of that character's situation.  Too bad, there are still a lot of them kicking around.
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|It is a good intriguing read but I am left with the impression that the author goes for too much complexity to the extent that it affects the credibility of the story.

0345803493|4.0|Yes, well. My daughter's mother-in-law recommended this book though, when challenged about it later she coloured up and claimed she had not recommended it - just mentioned it! She described it as 'raunchy' though, I would have to say it is somewhat beyond 'rauncy' and well into the pornographic.<br />I had read the first volume[Fifty shades of Grey] and couldn't put it down - that says something about me!<br />I instantly bought the second volume 'Fifty shades darker' [I was buying on my Kindle] and read through it as quickly as the first volume. Personally, I have difficulties with being controlled to this extent though, the sexual aspects might have their possibilities.<br />However, I didn't feel inclined to buy the third volume. The sex scenes in, especially the second book, seemed too voyeuristic for me and I couldn't really see where it was going to go next except with more over-the-top explicit sex scenes. Sorry, not for me. I need more of a challenge in my reading

0143119788|4.0|George Smiley is trying to stave off the \\"atrophy of retirement,\\" memorizing the number of paces on his street or the number of stairs in his home and fussing over the pile of bills racked up by his prodigal wife. Smiley is an out-of-work spy, swept out of the British secret service by the \\"new broom\\" of a new administration imposing new policies. His struggles to adjust to the staid life of a cuckolded civilian are interrupted when his former colleagues from \\"the Circus\\" come calling. A defection from Moscow Centre has gone wrong, the would-be defector has been spirited back to Russia and the British suspect there's a mole in the Circus. Smiley had voiced similar suspicions after a disastrous operation in Czechoslovakia ended in debilitating gunshot wounds for \\"scalphunter\\" agent Jim Prideaux and the toppling of the previous Circus administration. Smiley was ordered to desist, then dismissed. But the Circus wants him back as an outsider spying on the spies, some of whom were recruited by Smiley himself.<br /><br />Ensconced in a shabby hotel room, Smiley excavates through illicity snatched records and his own memories of Operation Witchcraft, based around Source Merlin, a mysterious font of suspiciously juicy information about the Soviets. Merlin and Witchcraft popped up as the Circus was destroying itself amid the jealousies and infighting that followed the Czech disaster. Witchcraft gave the upstarts at the Circus a perfect opportunity to make their move to shove out the old guard and take over.<br /><br />Like Smiley, Jim Prideaux is also trying to put the Circus behind him, getting on with a new life as a substitute teacher at Thursgood's, a fancy lad prep school where the boys are delighted to have a hunchback in the classroom. He befriends Bill Roach, a lonely child of divorce. As \\"the best watcher in the unit,\\" Bill is assigned the unofficial job of sentry for Prideaux, to keep an eye out for shady characters snooping around the school grounds. And sure enough, Bill spots one. It's Smiley, there for Prideaux's memories, for the real story of Operation Testify, \\"the biggest sucker's punch in the history of the trade.\\" Testify crippled Prideaux, wiped out his networks in Czechoslovakia, nearly triggered an international incident and left the Circus in a shambles for Operation Witchcraft to conveniently save. Somewhere in the wreckage of Prideaux's life and career, Smiley knows he'll find the key to the mole who gave up Testify and left the Circus door open for Witchcraft.<br /><br />Underneath the Cold War intrigue runs a subtext of class warfare: the British vs. the colonials, the titled gentry at their estates vs. the hard-scrabble working man, the man in the office vs. the man in the field. For all his professed contempt for his country's upper classes, John LeCarre writes like a toff to the manor born. His books are dry, cerebral and veddy veddy British -- the espionage equivalent of the mystery \\"cozy.\\" And there is nothing so vulgar as conventional thrills. Those readers coming for gunfights, car chases, pliant babes and super magnet watches may leave disappointed by all the fusty old men sifting through piles of documents and talking circles around each other. Truthfully, \\"Tinker, Tailor\\" could use a little more red-blooded adventure to temper all the blue-blood reserve. It's an interesting book, but not exactly \\"heart-stopping,\\" as the back cover promises. My pulse remained steady throughout, and I even drifted gently off to sleep once or twice. It's a good fireplace read, so if you have the patience for it, throw a couple of logs on, curl up in your Snuggie (yes, we all know about your Snuggie) and enjoy a few hours of trenchcoats, fog and skulduggery.

0143121316|5.0|The book shows a unique privileged, if not classified, insights into USA Chinese and Russian diplomatic positions of recent history. It's not so much a look behind the scenes as Kissinger's realistic analysis of diplomacy past and present. His clearly anti-communist leaning doesn't prevent realistic admiration of Mao's diplomacy involving skillful exploitation of weakness and errors of Nationalists, Soviets and Americans. There is a metaphorical relationship to ancient China policy of dividing barbarians and to the military philosophy of Sun Tzu. The metaphor of wei qi (Go) doesn't quite work. The book provides a continuum of Chinese diplomacy starting with the first attempts to open China with British ambassador Macartney's negotiations in 1793. We see the Irony of China's Most Favored Nation status, a mirror image of the European and American MFN and Hay's Open Door Policy of the 19th century.<br /><br />There is a reminder that China came out of a position of weakness to challenge America in the Korean War in 1950. There was a realization that neither Stalin nor America would allow China to fail as Mao and Zhou outmaneuvered both Stalin and Acheson. Jong Il Sung's actions caused China to redeploy troops from attack on Taiwan to support N. Korea.Chinese preemption trumped western deterrence. Kissinger tells how Mao advised the US to stay in Saigon, subtly giving the lie to LBJ's claim of Chinese aggression. There's an interesting reminder of the third VN war where China invaded and withdrew in a matter of 6 weeks.<br /><br />Kissinger credits Mao and Zhou En-Lai with and normalizing relationships with the USA along with Nixon. He gives Deng Xioupeng credit for modernization of China. He clarifies to a small degree the inscrutability of Chinese diplomacy, which is currently a doctrine of cooperative coexistence with capitalism an aspect of human nature rather than ideology. Do they still anticipate and seek to facilitate a world communist revolution?

Do they still anticipate and seek to facilitate a world communist revolution?<br /><br />This is a great look at triangular diplomacy of past and present. However for all his perspicacity Kissinger leaves a lot out. There's no help in understanding the current economic balance between the USA and China. What is the prognosis for dependence of China on the USA for growth versus USA dependence on Chinese savings and credit. Who will drop the rope first? Today's China diplomacy is largely economic as Obama and Hillary desperately try to get China to increase domestic consumption, revalue the renminbi, and keep financing American debt. Conflicting objectives to be sure as it's now the USA that proves inscrutable, or is it incompetence? It would be good to get Kissinger's insights into the importance and prognosis of economics as we are currently dependent on stockbrokers and sophomoric China bashing as in 'Death by China' by Navarro and Autry where American problems are attributed to evil intentions behind China's mercantilism.<br /><br />This is a great look at triangular diplomacy of past and present.

I wonder what he thinks about his basso role in the John Adams opera 'Nixon in China'.
0061692042|2.0|I am of the opinion that every male should read \\"Independence Day\\" as a rite of passage, and I very eagerly anticipated \\"Canada,\\" expecting, well, something more than is delivered.  There are incredibly lyrical, in-depth, knowing passages, but the work as whole is strangely flat and repetitive.  And frankly, I found much of Part 3 to be almost gratuitous.  I would have given the book 3 stars (\\"It's OK\\") but this IS Richard Ford, and I really just wanted more to hang onto.....

B005LAIGW8|2.0|I was a fan of the first GHOST RIDER film that starred Nicholas Cage as the motorcycle rider who sold his soul based on the Marvel comic character. Not many were fans of the film and were disappointed in the direction the film chose to follow. But then fans of an original piece of fiction seeing it come to life on the big screen rarely find it satisfying. Never having been a major fan of the comic, I found the movie well made and entertaining. I can't say the same for GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze (Cage) is still possessed as the devil's spirit of vengeance, a wraith like character that searches the globe to collect the souls owed to the demon. Looking for a way to void the contract he signed when he was young, a contract that tricked him as the devil is wont to do, Blaze is told of an opportunity to break free.<br /><br />Approached by a monk named Moreau (Idris Elba), he's told there is a young boy who needs his help. For his protection Moreau agrees to assist Blaze find release from his contract and the chance to be completely human once more. Of course he takes the offer.<br /><br />The story follows the two trying to protect the boy along with his mother. Along the way we get bits and pieces of just who the boy is and why he needs protecting. Comic fans will know right away that this character is important to the Ghost Rider mythology. The boy's name is Danny Ketch and in the comics he too became the Ghost Rider. But none of that comes up in this film, just that he is the offspring of someone completely evil who has come to collect before his next birthday.<br /><br />So what's good about this movie? Some of the special effects are good while others are lackluster. The story seems weak. The worst of it all is twofold. First there is Cage's acting. I like Cage. I've enjoyed many of the movies that critics have hated. But here he overacts to such an extreme that it's noticeable. It's as if he showed up and staggered through the role just to get a paycheck. Watching this made me realize just how bad he could have been had they chosen him to play Superman like they considered some years ago.<br /><br />The second worst thing is the direction. A director should be able to coax a decent performance from each and every actor in a film. Here the acting is negligible. But worse than that are the attempts to show action that don't work in the least. I'm not a fan of the whole hand held camera that gets tossed around technique. It's used to extremes here. A word to all directors and cinematographers: if you just make a camera jump around and look sloppy it doesn't make a scene look like its action packed. It just makes it look like you can't hold a camera steady. Stop doing it. We paid money to watch a movie and would enjoy being able to tell what we are looking at rather than some stupid attempt to look artsy.<br /><br />There is no way I can recommend this movie, even for Cage or Marvel Comic fans. The best moment in the movie revolves around a rather tasteless joke that is still funny. When asked what happens when he pees while being the Ghost Rider we get a glimpse from behind of him shooting out flames. If that's the best thing to be found here, you can imagine just how bad the film is.st to get a paycheck.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|There are plenty of films turned into franchises in this world whose end results offer lackluster movies that don't make you want to revisit the characters and events unfolding on screen. And then there are movies like this one that make you wish they'd just get on with it and start filming the next one so you could enjoy it just as much.<br /><br />The film opens with Tom Cruise's character Ethan Hunt in a prison in Russia. His team breaks him out along with a contact he made in prison only to drop him off and then find out what they're next assignment is. Of course it's a near impossible job for them to pull off but that's what they do. A terrorist has the means to launch a full scale nuclear attack on the world if he gets the launch codes. These codes are locked up in the Kremlin and Hunt and his team, should they decided to accept their mission, is to get hold of the launch codes first.<br /><br />Of course they accept the mission. Would there be a film any other way? Using disguises and some nifty new tech toys, Hunt and compatriot Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) make their way into the Kremlin only to discover the codes have already been lifted. Not only that, Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) the terrorist, has set a bomb inside the Kremlin that explodes just as Ethan and Benji attempt to escape.<br /><br />Ethan is knocked out by the bomb and wakes to find himself captive of the police who blame him for the attack. He escapes custody and finds himself picked up by the IMF Secretary (Tom Wilkinson) and his assistant William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). The Secretary tells him he will have to turn him over to the authorities. That is unless he suddenly escapes and heads for a secret train equipped with the tools he'll need to find the real culprits. Of course this mission is off the books and unauthorized which is where the term ghost protocol comes up. Before he can finish, the Secretary is killed in the car and Hunt and Brandt escape to head to the train car where they meet up with Benji and Jane Carter (Paula Patton).<br /><br />Hunt explains the situation to them and offers them the mission. Yes, they accept and things begin to move forward as the team heads to Dubai where they know Hendricks is about to purchase the last of the equipment he needs to launch his attack. In the famous sky reaching hotel located there the assassin who killed the agent with the original codes (and Carter's boyfriend) is about to make her exchange with Hendricks. But the team has a plan to make con both parties and retrieve the information. Of course things don't go as planned and suddenly we get the chance to see Ethan scaling a glass windowed building in an attempt to over ride the hotel elevators.<br /><br />So you get the idea here? To give all the rest away would be to spoil what happens and the thrills and spills that the makers of this film obviously worked long and hard to bring together. The details offered so far are nothing more than the set up that makes the action sequences that follow all that more spectacular. They ruin nothing so don't fear that a spoiler alert was needed. Much of that information could have been gleaned from the trailer.<br /><br />With all the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE films the thing is to get into it, to enjoy it, to toss out any concepts of reality and believability and just have a good time. This film offers a fun time at the movies in spades and will make you tear up at the right times, clench your fists when the bad guys seem to get away with things and make your palms sweat as you watch the team almost blow the whole mission on more than one occasion. On top of that you have two underlying stories fomenting beneath the obvious one that wrap themselves into the main plot and then find themselves resolved before the end.<br /><br />One of the best things is that the film ends without a clue as to another film being made or even considered but left open enough that should they decide to do one they can. As a fan of all four films this is once when I hope a franchise does continue. The films have all offered great entertainment value and enough mystery to keep you guessing until the end of each. GHOST PROTOCOL falls right in line with the earlier offerings.our films this is once when I hope a franchise does continue.

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|If you're like me you grew up watching horror films made by Hammer Studios. These were not your run of the mill horror films but classily made films that featured some of the classic horror icons like Dracula and Frankenstein but in more of a gothic location. This was a world of castles and mansions, of men dressed in fine clothing and women in low cut laced gowns. The horror films made by Hammer had style and class and a certain amount of eeriness to them instead of gore. The studio fell on hard times but is in the midst of a return and their first major entry is a grand one called THE WOMAN IN BLACK.<br /><br />It's the turn of the century and Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is at his wits end. A solicitor by trade Kipps has fallen on hard times, having great difficulty in dealing with the death of his wife several years earlier during childbirth. His son has grown but Kipps' melancholia remains these years later. So much so that he's fallen on hard times. The firm he works for gives Kipps a last chance to redeem himself by sending him to the small town of Cryphin Gifford to the Eel Marsh House where the estate of Mrs. Drablow, a recently deceased woman, must be settled. Kipps heads out hoping to reunite with his son and his nanny on the weekend.<br /><br />On his train ride to the town Kipps meets a gentleman by the name of Sam Daily (Ciaran Hinds). Sam is also en route to the same location and offers Kipps a ride to the local inn. But what greets Kipps when he enters is not what he expected: a cold shoulder from all but the inn keeper's wife who offers him a small room in the attic. He receives more of the same when he contacts the local solicitor who's been handling the affairs of the estate. Given the brush off and a carriage to take him to the train station, he pays the man to take him to the estate itself.<br /><br />If the creepy factor weren't already oozing off the screen it does so in spades as Kipps makes his way to the estate. The mansion is located on a small island with a causeway that twists and turns up to it. All along nothing but the marsh can be seen, a gooey water trap if ever there was one, with plenty of sea beyond. The tides rise and close off the causeway throughout the day and the carriage driver agrees to return later to take Kipps to Sam's house for a dinner invitation.<br /><br />Walking on to the house Kipps is greeted by the best of gothic sights, a mansion in disrepair covered with vines on the outside and cobwebs within. He lights some candles and gathers what paperwork he finds and begins working. But noises within the house cause him to stop and seek what is creating the sounds. As Kipps passes from one room to another, we have the chance to see the woman in black as her spectral image lingers over Kipps without allowing him to see her. She's everywhere yet nowhere in this house and the director of the film does a fine job in creating the atmosphere of her presence without seeing her at all times.<br /><br />Kipps eventually goes to dinner at Sam's and meet's his wife. She begins to tell him things that will lead him to discover the truth behind the town's fright and the reason they want him gone. Her tale and other clues lead Kipps to find out about the sister of the Mrs. Drablow who was sent away while her son was adopted by Drablow and her husband. On a trip home one night, their carriage slid into the marsh and the boy was drowned, his body never recovered. Now when the woman in black is seen a child in the town dies.<br /><br />Kipps continues his work, dealing with both the house and its foreboding inhabitant and continuing to deal with the loss of his wife. The intrusion of the woman in black in his business as well as the lives of others becomes too much and he seeks a way to appease her and put her soul to rest. This becomes all the more important as he has no way of reaching his son en route to the town to possibly be her next victim.<br /><br />The movie does a wonderful job of offering us teasing scares that never go over the top. The chilling moments are found from start to finish, the locale's offering the feelings that something bad is going to happen and the acting complements the storytelling that delivers chills rather than one jump scene after another (though there are those). Best of all is seeing Radcliffe in a role other than Harry Potter, proving that there is a chance of his becoming an actor that can handle more than the namesake that brought him to attention.<br /><br />The movie is one of the old time scare films that doesn't rely on gore, doesn't rely on a hatchet wielding menace or a nightmare creation that sucks out your soul as you sleep. This is good old fashioned ghost story that makes your skin crawl while you wait for the next scare and that's a good thing to see.

B001P3SA8U|5.0|Whether or not you like the story line of this movie,and if you can accept some chronological and factual inconsistencies, Cadillac Records is a very significant work in that it illustrates some important history on Blues music and it's influence on Rock 'n Roll. Played against the backdrop of race relations in American society of the 1950's, the movie provides insight on the inner workings of the music industry and how talent was not always all that an artist needed to get play time on the radio. One wonders what path the Blues and it's transition and effect on popular music would have taken if not for Chess Records. For those who have any interest in the origins and development of the music of both genres, Cadillac Records is a must see!
B005LAIGPA|3.0|What would you do if you suddenly had powers that no one else had except two friends? Would you use those powers for good or abuse them? Such becomes the question by the end of the film CHRONICLE.<br /><br />Andy Dettmer (Dane DeHaan) is the typical high school loser in the midst of his senior year. Abused by his father, he chooses to buy a camcorder and shoot everything that happens in his life including the attacks by his dad. Of course walking around all the time with a camera on your shoulder does little to make him any more popular at school.<br /><br />The only friend Andy has in his life is his popular cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell). Matt gets along with everyone and though he and Andy haven't chummed around for a while, he still tries to involve him. The latest event he talks him into is going to a rave on the outskirts of town. There Andy discovers that the popular kid in school, Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan) actually knows who he is from their time in school together and because he's friends with Matt.<br /><br />The three of them leave the rave when Matt finds something, a hole in the ground nearby that seems fairly deep. They do a little investigating and find a glowing crystal deep in the ground that seems to have tendrils moving inside of it. As they touch the crystal the camera jerks around and suddenly it's the next day. To their surprise they discover that they have telekinetic powers now.<br /><br />Their powers progress and where they first start off doing goofy things like making baseballs sway when tossed to hit one another ala JACKASS, they soon discover that by careful manipulation they can fly. Apparently none of them has read or seen Spider-man or they would realize that with great power comes great responsibility.<br /><br />As the film progresses, we watch Andy's slow collapse. While he has this enormous power, perhaps more so than his two friends, his fragile mind can't handle it when coupled with the abuse he's endured by both his father and the kids at school. He becomes a time bomb waiting to be unleashed and when he does there is no telling what will happen next.<br /><br />As I watched this film I was reminded of AKIRA, the classic Japanese animated film where a youngster suddenly gains power and has the potential to destroy the world. But instead of a film that spends most of its time showing the main character overflowing with power, this movie tends to uncoil slowly as we watch these characters go from normal teens to potential monsters. You can feel nothing but sympathy for Andy after the physical and mental beatings he endures and at the same time fear him in what he becomes.<br /><br />The effects are well done and make the whole concept believable. The joy that these three have when they test out their powers makes for moments that are amusing and then fearful. Best of all they seem real.<br /><br />One note for those who are not fans of the genre. The film is another of those hand held camera movies where the camera jumps most of the time like BLAIR WITCH or CLOVERFIELD. But as Andy's powers increase he begins to stop holding the camera and guide it with his mind instead offering a more fluid movement to the scenes, making the camera motion almost a character as well.<br /><br />Some will hate this movie while others will love it but on the whole I think it falls into that medium area of being a good movie that you won't watch over and over again. It is worth seeing at least once, but as for multiple viewings I just don't see it happening. Well made, well acted, well directed, but ultimately just a fun film for the moment.his father and the kids at school.

B005MW8CUG|1.0|Someone stated that this remaster \\"is not a victim of the loudness wars.\\"  They could not be more wrong. One look at the waveforms reveals that it is loud and even contains clipping!  It isn't as loud as some recent masters, but it is still loud enough to not even come close to the dynamics of the original, and loud enough to clip. On first listen, many would think that it sounds clear, and this is where the deception lies.  It may not have enough clipping to be audible to some, but what is audible is that it has a lack of dynamics.  All those little soft then loud parts are just loud now and no change in volume.  I have not heard the remastered vinyl, so I can not vouch for the quality of that release, but anyone who compared the original vinyl to this new cd remaster would be able to tell that it blows away this remaster. Hell, even the original cd blows this away.  People who think this remaster sounds good are too jaded from hearing too many modern brickwalled releases to remember what real dynamics sound like.  I have to give Corgan credit for the nice packaging and the bonus dvd, but the remaster itself is not worth owning if you have the original, and if you don't have the original, I would recommend buying it instead.  In conclusion, making an album louder and more distorted is not remastering, but sadly that is all that is done with most modern \\"remasters.\\"
B00846REIS|1.0|I agree with may others that this is a poor knock-off of FSoG.  FSoG was intense, complicated, and interesting.  This book has many plot similarities without any of the depth.

Buying this book is a waste of money.

If I put anything at all in the pocket, even flat screen wipes, it gaps even worse.  It's either a product inconsistency or the other reviewers know something I don't. I'll say I'm pretty disappointed with this purchase and am considering returning it.

B006TVQTHW|4.0|I have a computer with the Antec Three Hundred One, and I like it a lot, so when I saw the Three Hundred two, naturally I got it for my new build.  My first impression is that they have improved a lot... but...<br /><br />Pros:  big enough for whatever I want to build, sturdy, solid, nice looking case, lots of cooling options, USB 3.0 on the front, although, make sure your motherboard has the USB 3.0 header on it, or you will have to get an add on PCI card for extra $$.  Tool-less drive bays are nice, and seem sturdy enough to hold everything well.  they have improved the case fan controls to be accessible on the outside of the case, as well as adding a 4 pin connector for the motherboard.  The inside of the case is improved for wire management, and they added in a filter for the power supply fan.<br /><br />Cons:  Case Seems almost too big, at least for me.  They removed the medium fan speed on the controller.  The Case only came with 4 standoffs for the motherboard instead of 8 or more... I had to go to the store and get some more. The placement of the water cooler grommets are bad (right on the top), I am not using water cooling, so they are just an eyesore for me.  It was a bit difficult to get the power supply in just right, they made it quite a tight fit...  which is actually a good thing once you get it in there I guess.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Overall the case is a nice case, and would make a great budget case for whatever you are doing. It looks good and it is sturdy.  And for the price you can't beat it.

GREAT GAME.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of ICO but hey it came along with the package so I'm not complaining, I started playing it but got really bored by it and stopped.<br /><br />I gave it a 5 star rating just for SotC.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this trilogy! The first was my favorite because it is so shocking how hot Christian is in his SKILL SET. The love story develops deeper in this one as well as the love scenes. Super hot. I read through it super fast, as I did the first and you just must keep flipping the pages till the end. So addictive. I am definetly reading the third. Don't pay attention to the harsh reviews either. THis is a fantasy romance book. There is no 27 year old man in the world who is a beautiful, rich, talented, and sexually pleasing as our Christian. Thats why we keep reading because we must go to bed with OUR husbands tonight, haha =) I think Ms. James did well and she draws me into to Christian and Ana's world and I absolutely HATE putting my book down to eat and go pee, lol.
B005L38QHA|1.0|At first, these mice worked great. My roommate and I purchased them at the same time for WoW, and the install was super-easy. They're very comfortable, and the customization is cool.<br /><br />About a month ago, buttons on his mouse would randomly stop working until he reinstalled the drivers. Then, the right mouse button stopped working on his entirely unless it was pressed VERY firmly.<br /><br />Thinking it was a one-time issue, I continued to use mine while he purchased a naga. Just today, my right mouse button also stopped working unless pressed very firmly.<br /><br />Long story short, that's two of these mice that have experienced the same problem. I would not buy another one of these and I'll probably never buy from this company again. When you pay a premium for a product, you expect to get a premium product.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|ALot of people are making negative comments about this book and I have tO DISAGREE. I am a Twilight reader and this read very easily just like the twilight books. I'm not a big reader, but I got excited about reading these books. Come on people, calm down on the harsh negative reviews. Don't take the story literally, this is a FANTASY. This is ultimately a HOT HOT love story without a ton of depth. These characters were created for our enjoyment, not be analyzed so harshly. Some are calling these books just trashy, but the sex scenes are hot people. Come on admit it. What woman wouldn't want to live in a world with a beautiful, rich boyfriend who satisfied her sexually day and night? ITs a fantasy book, not a Jane Austin Novel. I think Mrs. James is a great writer and full of potential. IF you don't like it, put it down and head to another isle in the book store. I don't read the trashy romance novels and I wouldn't put this book in that section either. It is ultimately a love story and I read all 3 books within a week. The first book is the best and I thank Mrs. James for sharing her world with us. I want more please.

0345803507|5.0|IT is so bad, its good. While the story line in this book is the weakest I think, MRS. James does aim to please with Christian. People are reviewing this book so harshly because it has so much sex and immaturity in it, but come on people, how exciting is it to watch a middle age couple who are cautious and reasonable, only have sex once a month. No one wants reality. We need the fantasy. This book doesn't have alot of cake but a good deal of icing and thats fine with me. While Christian is over the top with his controling character, ana melts away some of that in this book. I am surprised to find they end up together. With Christian being so depressed, I almost assumed it would be a sad ending. Great sex 4 times a day at least, a live in maid/housekeeper, sexy husband, endless money, and great inlaws; thats my dreamworld people. I had no idea about this book but was curious and almost didn't buy it for the negative review but took a chance and so should you. Love stories never go out of style.
0345803507|5.0|I just LOVE theses books. This had me on the edge of my seat one minute, crying next, but always in love with Christian and Anna!<br />I never wanted the story to end.
B004LWZW6U|3.0|I waited for this movie in June, then November and no word. I loved the first one, it has become one of my favorites. I was so looking forward to this one, granted I didn't expect anything to much like the original remake. This wasn't playing anywhere near me which made my cravings grow even stronger. I just saw this On Demand tonight and I, ummm...yeah so...it was a letdown. All the first film had, the humor, the amazing soundtrack and fantastically ferocious little fish are gone. I expected more from some of the actors, but they never got very far. This could have been a blast, but came up short. Close, but no severed finger. C-
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really liked this game it keeps me occupied when I have nothing else to do and its always a challenge
B0086700CM|3.0|this is an awesome game but it stalls and by the time it straightens out your crashing... very frustrating. if that were fixed, then this would be an awesome game. its very fast paced
B008B92U32|1.0|It seems like it would be cool but I couldn't even figure out how to work it and there are no instructions so I wouldn't waste $.99 on it
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush's \\"Clockwork Angels\\" album makes me sad. I'm sad that no radio stations will play any music from this masterpiece, thus making sure that very few people will hear one of the greatest pieces of musical artistry ever. I'm sad that only true Rush fans will hear the astounding work on this incredible album. This is the best album by any musician or band in ten years. This is as good as any album ever. The thought and work that went into making this masterpiece are apparent throughout. This is the follow-up to the incredible \\"Vapor Trails\\" that I wanted \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" to be. This album is beautiful bombast. I'm blown away at how good it really is. The more I listen, the more I appreciate what was accomplished here. I won't review each track, as it has already been done here ad nauseum. Suffice to say I wish everyone could experience this work of art. The musicianship is incredible as always, but the songs are all intense, hard-rocking songs filled with technical soul, and the whole thing revolves around a fantastic story that entertains and makes you think. This album is a true joy. I just wish more could enjoy it.
0385344228|2.0|I had ordered this book in the large print and looked forward to it-but-it is a big disappointment.  It is written in the form of the Dad talking all the time or telling a story.  I didn't find the family likable and found it to be more on the boring side so much that I'd put it down and read another book then get back to this one until finally I just skimmed through it to find an interesting spot and I never found that spot.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you find it at a garage sale for 50 cents.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This story had so much potential but by the time I finished the book I felt cheated.  It's difficult not to give anything away so I will just say I do like Gillian Flynn's writing very much and Gone Girl had the potential to be a great book.  It's a clever idea but it is completely mucked up by the way the author chose to end the story.  The wrap up (very important to fans of the mystery genre) is almost non-existent.  This was one of those books you can't put down, a real age-turner, until you read the last page and say, \\"that's it?\\".  Now I feel like I wasted my time.  It's like watching a television series, you catch all but the last episode and are left wanting.  Unfortunately there are no re-runs of a book so I will never \\"catch the final episode\\".  I was enjoying the book so much that I almost recommended it to several people while I was reading it, now I'm glad I didn't.  I will try another of the authors books because as I said I like the writing very much, I just hope the next one does not make me feel cheated.
B0086700CM|5.0|my favorite game so addicting. me and my bf have competitions on who can get the most points so far he is winning haha!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a great dictionary both online and off. Remember to doenload the offline dictionary by switching to offline mode BEFORE losing your internet connection. Works well. Hasn't glitched out on me yet.
B0086700CM|5.0|ITS. SO FUN!!! I cant stop playing when I start. so really its addictive to me. Is it to you?
B0086700CM|5.0|Once I first heard about it, I thought everybody was making a big fuss about it for nothing.But then I got it and played it for a while, and then I thought \\"WoW, they were right\\". Simply Amazing. Its a really fun app.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is tons of fun. The entire family enjoys playing it. Just be ready to run, jump and turn.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Have had this app for awhile, works fine for me.  Noticed the update today, the changes to the permissions are ridiculous and the app is now accessing things an &quot;office&quot; program has no need for or business accessing.  Will NOT be updating until the permissions are addressed.
159448385X|5.0|One of my FAVORITE books of all time. I do not have the best memory, certainly not with book titles, especially remembering names of the writers and I find myself recommending this book by title and author. I loved how easy it was to keep track of the different characters and the turn of events. And how the book ties together at the end.<br /><br />One of my favorite picks to date.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|This is an amazing series but was canceled way too prematurely.  The SyFy channel is being ruined by canceling some of,their best shows.  I will not buy this and support this channel.  What a shame.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First review I am writing. I was looking for a book I could engage in discussions with my 15 year old and ended up loving the book and purchasing the series. He hasn't read it yet, but I couldn't wait for him. It was fun and an easy read. A change from my normal readings.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Very happy to see this added to the kindle fire app library! Great game, love it. I have had no issues playing on my fire.
0439023491|5.0|Even though it is the second book in a series, and you know what the story line will be, I found it profoundly interesting. I rushed to finish, as i did with the first, to get the the third.
0525478817|5.0|I was laughing as I was crying when I read this book. It tore so completely at my emotions and made me think about what it means to be human.
0743289692|4.0|I really liked this book. I liked to learn about her culture and her struggles. I loved that she included pictures. I am disheartened by Theo's murder and want to watch the documentatary, I believe of \\"Submission.\\"
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is so great! Om Nom is so cute, and there are HUNDREDS of ADICTING levels. i recomend this to EVERYONE
B00881VLCE|5.0|Magic puzzles is relaxing and helps me unwind. I like the pictures. I haven't been able to make a puzzle inns long time. Now I can do it anywhere.
0743487486|4.0|I have to commend this book and recommend it. It really opens your eyes and makes you think about parenting in a whole new light. I really enjoyed the read and liked the amount of research that Kohn had to back up his claims. The only thing I would like to see changed is that he doesn't offer a lot of guidance. You read through the whole book really motivated and inspired to make a change and then I feel that he only lists a few bullet points of things you could try but without concrete examples. I think this book could benefit from some more practical examples of every day parenting. Otherwise, fantastic book!
0767830555|5.0|The last film ever made that examines realistically the nature of man, the pain of loneliness and the seedy streets of New York circa early 1976. It also has the last greatest Soundtrack written By Bernard Herrmann. It is a masterpiece of film making and acting.  The DVD gives you every special fea?ure available. It is a MUST own. The only negative is that Scorcese does not have the original negative 35mm film of the last 12 minutes or so which feature (at the time) a very bloody chain of events. So the footage is a bit dark and red during the restored sequences but it is the only surviving footage. He had to cut the original negative for distribution to ABC. TV and network never thinking about the possibilty of the DVD genre. Such is life. Whatever happened to all these tenements and X rated palaces on 8th Ave and 42nd Street.
B000OCY7JE|3.0|I knew nothing about this film and when it started I was instantly drawn in by the strange but moving presence of the young European man working in an orphanage in India.  We soon learn that a benefactor in Denmark, where, it turns out, the young man. Jacob, is from, has offered a huge sum of money to the orphanage and Jacob goes back to Denmark to get it. It's the first time he's set foot in Denmark in twenty years and he is somewhat hostile to the whole scene, but is doing it for the money.  The older man, Jurgen, is an extremely successful, self made man, very Type A, who expansively invites Jacob to the wedding of his daughter, Anna, which is being held that weekend.  Jacob doesn't seem like a party guy but, having nothing else to do, and really wanting that grant, he shows up at the wedding.<br /><br />Here's where the plot thickens.  There are strange looks passing between Jurgen's wife, Helene and Jacob and soon we realize that Anna might just be the product of an affair between Helene and Jacob back in India.  It's a very interesting set up and I was really eager to see where the plot would lead us.  I think that, in the hands of a better director it might have been very good.  As it was, it was terribly melodramatic, really over the top performances in some parts, which made the characters lose any credibility.  The actors tried valiantly and there were some parts that I found genuinely moving, but much of the second half of the film was tacky.<br /><br />I found the Danish countryside nice to see, especially the well appointed house of Jurgen and the interesting countryclub where the wedding party was held.  There sure were a lot of stuffed animal heads on the walls, though, and the occasional close ups of these beasts was supposed to symbolized something important, I guess, but to me they just looked creepy.  Likewise, the many close ups of peoples' eyes.  It was an attempt to be arty that really failed and further cheapened what could have been a much better film. It seemed that the director was trying to imitate Ingmar Bergman.<br /><br />I think that if the director had cut about a half hour of the excessive emoting, that a fine film exploring some complex human relationships might have emerged.  It seems like it was a good idea that got carried away with itself, and like so many opera plots, death just seemed like the only way to wind it up.  Too bad.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|If you like sudoku and logic games, you will love this.  I am way too addicted and am happy to see so many levels!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I will admit that the first few chapters were entertaining while the characters first encountered each other.  Then you realize this is a innocent woman getting involved with a freak.  Why anyone would want them to end up together is beyond me.  The rest of the book is crazy boring.
B004UID2LC|5.0|If you already have the authentic YouTube app, then FREEdi is a MUST HAVE. Select any video in the YouTube app, select the share icon and then select FREEdi. FREEdi will then ask whether you want to download it as a video or mp3 (sound only). Make your selection and it downloads in the background while you do whatever you want. Couldn't be more simple or more awesome.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is a great game very addictive it needs more of a challenge though some of the boards are way too easy.
125000568X|5.0|Order it from Bloomsday Books and you'll have it fast! They protect it from mailing damages by using 2 padded bubble envelopes and they include a nice thank you note for purchasing from them. Now...to this book...it's totally amazing! It weighs over 2 lb. and is full of souvenirs in pockets. Measurements are 10\\" X 11.5\\" X .75\\" D. The black matte cover (extremely thick - never seen a cover like it!) with Queen's logo in glowing white and silver, are very high class, just as the band was and still is. I've been a fan since their beginning and bought this and the new \\"Queen The Complete Illustrated Lyrics\\" book. This book could have easily sold for twice the price. Get it and their lyrics book and you'll have 2 of the best books, ever about Queen! Long live Brian, Roger and John! We will always miss you Freddie and your voice was THE MIRACLE.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I love this show (as everyone does and should) and thought this season was great, my views reflect what others have already written so I won't go into detail. I just wanted to point out a small complaint I had with the scenes that're in Spanish; there are no subtitles for the Spanish scenes which can be discouraging and make things confusing. Fortunately, I remember most of the dialogue that's in Spanish from watching it on TV, however, this may be a problem for first time viewers. That being said, I didn't actually check the language/subtitle menu for any options. Please excuse my ignorance if that is the case. Anyways, that's all. An amazing season for an even more amazing show. I'll be sad to see it go once the next season ends. But I guess all good things must end at some point.
0345803507|5.0|This book has everything! I couldn't put it down. Once you start reading you get wrapped up in the suspense. ( No not just the sexual kind.) This had everything from car chases, fire, romance, to gun shots. Its a must read, just don't start it before bed or you'll end up pulling an all niter just to finish. :)
B0079J28NW|5.0|What a pleasant surprise. Put simply, the picture and sound on the Blu-Ray are top notch! The entire 5.1 sound field is utilized with lots of surround effects. Dynamic range is pefect with lots of deep bass and clean highs. The picture looks flawless and sharp. This disc is reference material to show off any home theater system. Crank it up and enjoy the music!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very good. For the people who don't want to &quot;earn&quot; money to unlock games, don't even comment on the game, Ya know its the whole purpose. Anyway the game is cool.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After all the hype and great reviews I was very excited to jump into reading this book. What a disappointment. There was so much sex and so little plot that I began skipping pages and pages out of boredom. I did finish reading it but was left thinking that I wasted my money.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book sucked me in from the beginning and I gasped out loud with each new plot turn.  I don't want to give away the details, but I was surprised several times!  Unfortunately, it seems as though Ms. Flynn got tired at the end and needed a quick way to wrap up the book.  I found the ending completely unrealistic, bizarre, lackluster, and disappointing.  This was a 5 star book until the wrap up.
0743455967|5.0|My father was a writer.  He wasn't a very good writer but had a short story published in \\"Cavalier\\" and published a Western short novel that was probably vanity press.  He used to talk to me about writing and, in particular, about Stephen King's artistry.  I read King for a long time because of Dad's interest but tired of the subject matter and quit.  \\"The Stand\\", however, remains my favorite distopian novel.  I purchased \\"On Writing\\", not because I plan to write, but to, perhaps, examine King's art and craft that so intrigued my Dad. I loved it.  I have come to believe that reading free Kindle books will cause brain damage and so, instead of writing scathing reviews, will recommend this book to these wretched writers who have no idea what constitutes literature. I persist in this dismal reading hoping to find some nuggets of promise but those are few and far between.  Any aspiring author would do well to read it and to heed it, adapting as suits one's style.  I also enjoyed reading something about King's life and how he came to writing.  I recommend the book both for King fans and for writers as well.
B00881VLCE|4.0|it is ok.. i like the pictures from the cities. best you can do big puzzles in matter of time
B001BTG3OQ|1.0|I purchased this in September of 2011.  After some initial testing I ended up using my older flash for most of my shoots.  I pulled it out after 3 months and it no longer works.  I have changed the batteries and tried fiddling with it but it no longer works.  Very upset with the quality.
1451608659|5.0|I read this entire book the day it came out. It was a great story of things in her life that I never knew or even imagined that happened to her. I recommend it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is really cool except it save all nh music under one thumbnail. I'm not sure how to change tht but over all this app is awesome!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Such a convenient way to carry around the word of God.  I would love to see some of the versions (NIV, NKJV) available offline to use when Wi-Fi or internet connection is not available.
B00884GR0W|1.0|To tell the truth, i'd been searching for at least a substitute for minecraft like many others, and was thouroughly dissapointed with this game. The game idea was great, with the adding of rpg elements and the graphics were stunning to say the least. On the bad side, the controls were shaky at best, and I found many grammar mistakes that I wouldn't expect to find in a five dollar app, though I guess you could call me a grammar Nazi. Overall, I was expecting a lot more from this game than what was offered, and I wouldn't reccomend this to my friends.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|This film kind of lost me at the train wreck...I've seen a train hit a truck, in fact a box truck not a pickup.  The train just swatted the truck aside (destroying it in the process) and continued on, with out derailing a single car. This crash was as though the train had hit an immovable wall, propelling huge freight cars through the air as though they were weightless, at least until they hit the ground.<br />Speilberg does love his CGI....but it doesn't make a movie.
B001C3I4UM|5.0|I own this record, 33.3 rpm. I couldn't believe I could get it on my Kindle Fire.<br />It has brought me great memories, when I was a teenager. The sound is fantastic, better than the scratchy sounds. I highly recommend this recording.
0547569653|4.0|Scott Jurek combines a memoir, guide to running, and introduction to vegan living in a single book, and serves each topic well. As he recounts his many running victories, whether he crossed the finish line first or not, he shares techniques that the average runner needs to become a long distance runner. Scott attributes a lot of his success to his close-to-the-earth diet, which is vegan and often raw. He's adapted that lifestyle to his training and shared his favorite recipes, once noting that sometimes \\"chewing takes too long\\". I've heard similar advice, such as the use of miso, from other runners, so I'm curious to try some of his long-distance fuel recipes. In the end, he gets back to \\"free running\\" just for the joy of it.<br /><br />If you're a runner, you can use this book for motivation, and perhaps a reality check for ultra marathoning. Even if you don't want to do those distances, perhaps you won't think your six mile run is such a chore.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is so much fun you can make colages and get the pics off google and other websites ive made about ten and i just got it today i really recomemd this to 10 or older
B00028HBKM|4.0|Do not understand the charges of anti-semitism leveled against this film. In my lifetime I've seen this story filmed countless times. From the 1961 KING OF KINGS to George Steven's gargantuan THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD to THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW to JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR to Zefferelli's JESUS OF NAZARETH and Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST all telling the same story with the same cast of characters. While some of them created controversy over political or creative thinking, others generated criticism over casting choices, none of them had charges of anti-semitism hurled at them. All the good guys are Jews, all the bad guys are either Roman, Jewish high priests or non-believers. What made Mel Gibson's film so different? And why did so many people jump on the bandwagon? Except for the violence, Gibson doesn't do anything the other films didn't already do. So what lies behind all this?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couln't wait to read this second book in the trilogy.  I enjoyed the relationship part and how it developed. You could see that a love story was growing. My kind of story..Loved it.  Purchased on Amazon, Kindle books.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|game is really fun. not going to buy glu credits because of problems people have been having. otherwise great game! waste of space to post review
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a great book and I learned many things that I didn't know went on with sex.  The book held my interest and as it went on a story developed. I also read the next two books, which I also enjoyed.  I purchased all three books on Amazon..kindle book
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|The Album is really good, DVD is only three songs, didn't expect much from it and its not really much, but the album is still very good.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Recently read this book, curious after all the hype.<br /><br />The bad reviews on hear made me smile.  I think people are trying to think too deeply.  It's the reason why OK and Hello are so successful. Female worker comes home after a hard days work and wants to read a bt of trash :-)<br /><br />I don't normally read fiction.  I'd rather get my head in a text or reference book but it kept be gripped but I don't think it is a literary great.  Yes I am target group of a 40 something mummy and it takes a lot to make me blush these days :-) I think it's great that a book like this has gone viral because hopefully will pave the way for more of this genre.<br /><br />To me this book is a modern day Jane Eyre (albeit badly written) with whips and cuffs.
B007R41E8O|5.0|another great hidden objects game.  storyline is fun and entertaining.  graphics are fantastic as usual.  alawar you did it again...many,  many thanks.  please keep 'em coming!!!!
0793518326|5.0|I can't begin to describe how great and essential this book is for any musician to own, whether you play bass, guitar, drums, keyboard, or sing, I highly recommend this book to you. The Beatles are one of the greatest rock bands of the past century and by far, one of the most recognizable and significant. This book includes every single song the Beatles released in their 7 year run, which means over 300 songs are in this book. It includes all the parts, played by the Beatles, and even adds the orchestra arrangements like saxophones, clarinet, trumpets to the songs that have them. It includes every instrument played on every Beatles song transcribed the way it was played on the studio version of the song. This alone makes it a must own, but besides that, it is pretty accurate. There are a few errors here and there that can easily be sorted out if you are enough of a Beatles fan and have an ear for music. This book is overall accurate and includes everything to fully learn and play every known Beatle song. It is great for reference if you are studying the Beatle's chord patterns, or if you are in a band and want to cover a few Beatles songs. The only problem I have is the music print is a little small, but aside from that, its a great book. Its the only book of its kind and essential for any up and coming musician wanting to play good music.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I have had draw something for quite a while on my kindle fire but now everytime I click on the app it just shows a black screen and then brings me back to my home screen. I just deleated the app and I am installing it again.  Do my friends have to friend request me again? Do I have to start the game over again?
B000VZBCWE|4.0|This is a pretty great Queen live performance with some rare gems like Dragon Attack and Jailhouse rock, plus some incredible improvisations and solos by Brian May and Roger Taylor that can be found nowhere else. Taylor breaks into a 3 minute drum and tympani solo which leads to an incredible 5 minute guitar solo by Brian May, while everything else is silent. Queen like usual, is a very fun band to watch live because Freddie Mercury keeps the show exciting. He is constantly goofing around on stage and making weird body motions, while placing the microphone in awkward positions. Plus for a few songs, Freddie Mercury strips down to nothing but tight booty shorts and a scarf. This alone, is worth checking this performance out, its hilarious, especially how he goes right the the edge of the stage with all his fans starring at him. The songs Queen performs are all performed very well, and some songs even get improvised and have solos added to them that can't be found anywhere else. Some of the songs do feel a bit rushed, and some songs aren't as memorable as the studio version, and this performance is nowhere near as incredible as Wembley but  So if you are a Queen fan, you will definitely want to check this out, as it includes some rare solos and versions of songs, but it isn't something you'll want to watch over and over, just something to take out once a year or so and get a few laughs out of Freddie's antics and fashion, plus its always fun to watch this around girls and older adults.
0385491026|4.0|Margaret Atwood has definitely written a book that will not soon be forgotten.  Elaine, the main character, begins her life traveling in the back of a car, and living in remote Canadian locations while her father researches rare insects.  She does not have meaningful interactions with others, besides her mother, father, and brother until she is approximately 9 years old.  At that time, her family moves to Toronto and moves into her first permanent residence.  She enters a school and befriends a few girls her age.  Elaine's relationships with those girls appear ordinary and do not become extraordinary until a girl, Cordelia, joins Elaine at school.  Cordelia teases, ridicules, and torments Elaine for numerous years until Elaine faces a near-death experience.  From then on, Elaine manages restore confidence in herself and move away from Cordelia's influence.  While the two girls resume their friendship in high school, the dynamic of their childhood friendship never returns and the balance of power even shifts, over time, so that it favors Elaine.<br /><br />Despite Elaine's success in art and love, she has never come to terms with her relationship with Cordelia.  \\"Cat's Eye\\" follows Elaine's search for Cordelia and the path that Elaine follows as she tries to understand their \\"friendship.\\"<br /><br />Elaine herself is a dark character, as she tends to have a solemn outlook on life and never seems to display happiness.  Her pensive nature leads to interesting observations on the meaning of her art and how the avant garde work resulted from her early childhood experiences.  Elaine's reflections also allow the reader to follow the interactions between Elaine's parents, brother, and herself; her introduction to religion; her first experiences with art; and her experiences with the opposite sex.  While this book isn't easy to read, as Atwood writes in great detail and the pace of the book moves slowly, Elaine's reflections are interesting and the way she overcomes Cordelia's evil spell leads one to believe that good can prevail over evil.'s evil spell leads one to believe that good can prevail over evil.

B007XWFZSA|5.0|This is a mindset changing book! While you read it you notice that Victor took a time to grasp all major issues a candidate goes through in the preparation process. He highlights very clearly what consulting firms are looking for in a candidate and always, always explains WHY. I really believe that whoever reads this book will at least change their mindset to a correct problem-solving orientation one.<br />Thank you, Victor!

0307730697|5.0|From the first pages of Eric Blehm's book Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown, which tells the story of Adam Brown, a member of the elite SEAL Team SIX, I was hooked. Adam's personality, from his fearless nature on the football field to his caring way of dealing with students who were bullied, immediately made me think he was the type of person I would have liked to have been friends with in High School. Although Adam was a very charismatic man, he found himself involved in a life filled with drugs and alcohol in his early 20s. He seemed lost and needed direction in his life. Although he recommitted his life to God, he was still struggling with maintaining his sobriety. With that in mind, and childhood memories of seeing the brave acts committed by Navy SEALS, he decided to enlist.<br /><br />The book is told in both the words of the author and through the interviews of those people who were involved in Adam Brown's life. This made the book especially poignant, as the feelings and stories from his wife, family, and friends displayed the kind of character Adam possessed even as he gave up his life to save those in his unit.<br /><br />I am going to recommend this book to my family for reading, as I think the story of Adam Brown's life is one which should be read to not only remember the sacrifices those in the military make, but also the forgiving nature of God. Although many people would have given up on a person with a background like Adam's, he is a shining example that even those who had problems in their past can overcome them.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Waterbrook Multnomah.

B003MC5N28|4.0|I love reading dystopian stories. Although they seem like paranormal stories in a sense, they also have this feeling of \\"My God, this could actually happen.\\" That's how I felt reading The Giver. I was surprised with how monotone the Community was, and as I read along and found out the people chose this life, it felt real to me in a sense. If this life was a possibility, I wouldn't be surprised that people would chose it: It's a life with no hurt or pain, no anger or sadness, nor any negative feelings/emotions of any kind. The sacrifice is that people also feel no happiness, love, or any positive emotions. That was the choice. To live in Sameness.<br /><br />Because this was a book club read, my head is chocked full of questions with half-answers, and debates about the book. We had a lot to talk about with this one. It's hard to give any examples without giving spoilers, so I apologize that I can't really explain. I will say that it is definitely a book that will get you thinking, if you allow yourself. If you really think about the world they live in, how they function on a day-to-day basis, and then how Jonas shown the \\"way things once had been\\" and has to take it all in stride, it will have you feeling some strong things.<br /><br />As for the characters themselves, I thought that Jonas and the Giver were deep, thorough characters, while the rest were all the same. Considering the fact that the Community's number one goal was Sameness, I have to say that the characters were written perfectly. Aside from the two main characters, there were maybe 1 or 2 other characters that I felt anything towards, and that was because of the way Jonas felt about them. Lois Lowry definitely did a good job writing her characters so that you felt what Jonas felt.<br /><br />Whether you have to read this for school in Grade 7 or choose to read it years later, The Giver is a great dystopian that will open your eyes to the way things might be if we finally break and are too afraid to be different.different.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is completely worth buying.  One of the only games my 4 year old will play that I'm just as interested.
0545259096|5.0|For starters, I loved the prologue: the little snippet of Shelby's mind. It had me wondering throughout the novel who it was that Shelby had encountered and what kind of consequences it would have for the characters. I was also really excited to see that Cole and Isabel were back as narrators again, because I love both of their voices, especially Cole's. Their experiences and relationships both past and present are so drastically different from Sam and Grace, that it adds a whole new level to the story. I'm always excited to see \\"Cole\\" or \\"Isabel\\" at the beginning of a chapter. That's not to say that I don't love the Sam and Grace parts. I absolutely, 100% feel connected to them and their relationship. I feel what they feel, and it's frequently heartbreaking (you'll see why).<br /><br />That's one of the things I love about Maggie's writing. She makes you feel what her characters feel, whether it's anger or love or jealousy or nostalgia. Also, her writing has a way of grabbing your attention and holding it with her captivating lines that flow so easily. To add to that, there's the poetry and lyrics, the quick chapters and changing viewpoints, the plot line! Roll all of that up into a nice little package (or a book and call it FOREVER), and you've got a story that people can't - and don't want to - put down.<br /><br />On another note, I won't lie to you and say I didn't cry. I cried several times. It was that silent, tears welling up in my eyes before falling, crying. So be prepared. It's the last in the series, so of course it's a roller coaster of emotions.<br /><br />That being said, I need to talk about the ending (no spoilers!). Starting about 50 pages from the end, everything started to snowball. It was really a great climactic ending, I loved it. It was after that that disappointed me. Since it was the last of the series, I was expecting more of a \\"where they go from here\\" type roundup, but it kind of ended abruptly. That was the only thing that I didn't really enjoy.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy this book is finally out and that I know how the series ends! On the other hand, I'm so so so sad to see it end. I wish we could hear many more stories of the Wolves of Mercy Falls. But I'll take what I can get, which is - just like everything else Maggie - awesome.ly enjoy.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy this book is finally out and that I know how the series ends!

B007MDB71O|4.0|By now most everyone knows that Disney's John Carter, after a long history of on-again, off again adaptation to the big screen that spans almost as many years as the stories themselves, was pummeled at the box office. However, as some correctly predicted, it was a big hit overseas -- and premiered at #1 on Blu-ray and DVD last week.<br /><br />One must wonder how many formed their opinions about the film based on the widely reported lack of ticket sales. There has been lots of finger pointing for the losses, but perhaps the fault wasn't the film so much as with the timing. Did theater audiences want another scifi-fantasy epic franchise? Who knows?<br /><br />John Carter is not a perfect film, but it is very far from a catastrophe. Visually, the stunning imagery, especially on Blu-ray, cannot be denied. The years of work and the big budget shows on screen. Meticulous details abound that make the film very rewatchable. I was struck by the clear glass in the air ships -- it was uneven, as if the glass was hand-made. The look combined high tech with the 19th century (which did remind my wife of Treasure Planet, another very good Disney feature that fizzled in theaters).<br /><br />The film's shortcomings are so well-documented, you don't need me to recount them. On the positive side, there is some humor, especially the \\"Virginia\\" running gag. One of the best characters in the film is James Purefoy as Kantos Kan (yes, it's hard to keep track of the names and I had to look it up), who amusingly forces his own capture in a climactic battle scene.<br /><br />The toughest roles are the leads, and Taylor Kitsch fares no better than the more well-known Jake Gyllenhaal in Prince of Persia. Neither actor can be held totally responsible when they're shouldering such a massive movie. The princess role, which proved problematic to the filmmakers, who had trouble reconciling her 100-year old persona with contemporary expectations, is handled with deft skill by Lynn Collins.<br /><br />The film has some great shape-shifting villains offering lots of potential for future adaptations. There is also a fascinating parallel narrative centering on Edgar Rice Burroughs as a character in the 19th century, learning the secrets of Carter as he unknowingly dodges the bad guys (I would have liked to have seen more of this story thread).<br /><br />The point is, John Carter is a rousing spectacle that is a must-see for action, scifi, fantasy and adventure movies in the Spielberg/Lucas style. Whether we'll ever see more of this world, in perhaps an animated TV version, is certainly unlikely from where the property stands today.<br /><br />But the same could have been said for Tron and Newsies. Just by reading the many amazon reviews, a lot of passionate fans are already championing the movie. Maybe more time will tell.../>The film has some great shape-shifting villains offering lots of potential for future adaptations.

1594202842|1.0|Few books have caused me to grit my teeth throughout, nay, I think this is the first one I have ever found so aggravating.  Ms. Chua seems to think it is not only acceptable but laudable to denigrate and browbeat her children to fulfill not their, but HER desires and goals.  Is it really worth the damage to a child's psyche and sense of self-worth by belittling and ridiculing her in order to \\"encourage\\" the child to achieve goals that are exceedingly important to the mother?  I think not! I don't think there is any reason that ever warrants such verbal abuse, no matter how wonderful the goals or end results might be.  There is just no excuse to ever call your child names and belittle them.  Ever.

B0016OLC5Q|1.0|This movie is not about a young man leaving worldly possessions behind to live in the wild.  It's about a spoiled kid who wanted to hurt his parents by giving away his inheritance and disappearing for over a year without even telling them (or his sister who loves him) that he needed to \\"find himself\\" and be \\"independent\\" by going travelling.<br /><br />If his family had known that he wanted to disappear, they wouldn't have suffered for so long.  But it seems he wanted to punish them for giving him an easy life.  And it's easy to give away your inheritance when you know your rich parents are a safety net that will just give you more money if/when you finally decide to return.<br /><br />Many young people need to break away and explore the world for adventure and self-discovery.  But in this movie, this kid sponged off everyone he met, and the most \\"into the wild\\" that he got was that he found an abandoned bus a couple miles off the main road in Alaska, and he lived in the bus.  This broken-down bus was already decked out with a mattress for sleeping and a stove for cooking.  And how far away from civilization could he have been if a BUS managed to get there?  This was not living wild.  This was a selfish kid who didn't care that his sister and parents were distraught, every day not knowing whether he was dead or alive, since he didn't even say \\"bye\\".
6305127646|3.0|My ex-girlfriend was in love with Val Kilmer.  She was his Brad Pitt.  We watched like every Kilmer movie together, and her favorite was `The Saint'.  I probably saw this movie fifty times in the two years that we dated; seriously.  Now, this was YEARS ago (god, I feel old now) and so I wasn't even half the cinephile I am today.  My taste in film generally consisted of explosions, sex and fight scenes and so I was more than fine with watching `The Saint', since it has all three to a degree.  A few months ago I happened to catch this film on television and it brought back memories of my teenage years and `the one that got away' (we're both married with children now and keep in touch, albeit sparsely).<br /><br />I have never seen the original television series, and I never read any of the novels, so my opinion is based solely on my feelings on the film itself.  Watching it now and pulling it from the context of `yesteryear memories' was a different experience.  The 90's were a big time for spy films and `The Saint' was then and is still considered one of the shallower attempts at the genre.<br /><br />I blame a lot of that on Kilmer.<br /><br />I am personally a fan of his work.  I used to really like him as an actor, but even now in my newfound view of film I see greatness in a lot of his work, namely his 90's turns.  He should have been up for an Oscar for his flawless performance in `The Doors', which was just uncanny and still haunts.  He has a great knack for comedic timing, as he's shown as recent as 2005's `Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.  It's sad to me that his star persona has diminished and he's basically become a washed up joke of an actor.  His performance here is too calculated for its own good.  He just cannot get the persona of a spy down without feeling, well, like a guy trying to pretend to be a spy.  I understand that the character of Simon Templar is far different than that of James Bond, and so you can't expect the same suaveness about them, but Kilmer just can't convey anything outside of cold calculation.<br /><br />You have to suspend disbelief with a film like this because rarely do spy movies remain logical throughout.  With the amount of `cool gadgets' and `improbably action sequences', this genre is corroded with aspects that can be deemed `stupid' by the literal mind.  I have no problem suspending disbelief and even forgiving preposterousness if it is handled in a way that makes me wish that it were possible.  `The Saint' never gets there though.  It doesn't grab me by the shirt collar and thrust me into perpetual daydreaming.  It just kind of made me shrug.  Shue is also a disappointment, but she is like the epitome of a one hit wonder (looking at her string of mediocrity, it still baffles me that she delivered something as sincere and moving as her performance in `Leaving Las Vegas').<br /><br />In the end, this is a film that I remember fondly and maybe that is why I forgive it for disappointing me recently.  It isn't that great of a movie (although the soundtrack is KILLER) but I still like it for reasons not entirely related to the movie itself.st can't convey anything outside of cold calculation.<br /><br />You have to suspend disbelief with a film like this because rarely do spy movies remain logical throughout.

B000JIHP88|1.0|We read the reviews for this product and noticed that some people had listed mechanical problems as one of the primary risks for this product.  We ordered it anyway thinking that many of the reviews did not encounter the problem and that we may therefore be okay.  I can assure you that this problem occurred rather quickly with casual use on our part.  We play it for our 4mo old son before he goes to bed on most nights, but certainly not all.<br /><br />This problem having shown up so quickly with casual use on our part make me suspect that the quality is inferior for the drive mechanism.  The music and speaker portion still work.<br /><br />Overall, the quality of this product is obviously lacking and you should be aware that you are taking a reasonable sized risk when purchasing this product that the drive mechanism will stop working.  You have been warned.

The surround capabilities are superb, and you'll think the sound is coming from the room you're in. When a wolf howled in the game, I thought it was coming from my backyard for a minute. Bass is strong, mids are clear, and highs are crisp. 5/5 stars.

B0088WK6CE|5.0|The front man for The Frames and The Swell Season drops his first new music since 2009 and his first proper solo album. A musician and artist first, Hansard has struggled to come to terms with the success and higher profile that a starring role in \\"Once\\" and an Oscar win for \\"Falling Slowly\\" brought him. After laboring for years with his highly regarded band, The Frames, he rejected the notion that he should be defined by a night at The Oscars. This doesn't mean he's been able to avoid the spotlight despite struggling for normalcy in his life. The documentary \\"The Swell Season\\" documented the struggles that he and Marketa Irglova went through dealing with sudden success and the quiet slow end to their romantic relationship. They managed to redefine their relationship and revel in the joy that making music together gave them. The Swell Season went on hiatus but the task of helping transform \\"Once' into a Broadway musical and retain it's musical integrity has kept the past very much in the present. \\"Rhythm And Repose\\" found it's inspiration in Hansard's time living in New York and helping bring \\"Once\\" to the stage. It's unusual in it's restrained presentation which should not be taken as the idea that Hansard's passion and intensity have been dialed down. It's just that the album seems to be written in the clear eyed light of day instead of the emotionally raw, late night hours. Hansard is still a man struggling with the complexities and perplexities of the human heart. He continues to stare unafraid at the emotional wreckage of failed relationships to find the truths they reveal. They give him the strength to deal with the here and now and the determination that tomorrow will be a better day. Hansard has always been a fearless warrior of the heart. He goes deep and gives a voice to experiences and emotions that few songwriters can even manage to put to paper. \\"You Will Become\\", \\"Bird Of Sorrow\\" and \\"The Storm, It's Coming\\" are stellar tracks. However, \\"High Hope\\" and \\"Song Of Good Hope\\" will stand with some of Hansard's finest works. \\"Song Of Good Hope\\" was written for a friend struggling with cancer. The gentle urging from Hansard to fight on, move forward and reach out for the help and warmth and love of a friend will have you drying your eyes and smiling at the same time. Glen Hansard is one of the finest songwriters working today if not of all time. Marketa Irglova and her Broadway counterpart Cristin Milioti contribute vocals to the album with musical support also coming from Nico Muhly, Sam Amidon and David Mansfield.\\"Song Of Good Hope\\" will stand with some of Hansard's finest works. \\"Song Of Good Hope\\" was written for a friend struggling with cancer.

B001609SQA|5.0|\\"Aliens\\" is the sequel to [[ASIN:B004RE29T0 Alien [Blu-ray]]] (which you really should watch first) and, while I really like the first one, this is actually a more enjoyable movie. The Alien movies are generally well done, exciting, and well acted, making them stand out from others in the genre.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: This picks up some 50 years after the events in Alien, but almost immediately from Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) point of view. This installment has slightly less of the creepy feel of the first movie, but makes up for it with strong character development and action. The acting was on par or better than the first one, with Weaver really owning the Ripley character and the supporting cast generally holding up their own as well. The special effects are very good, even somewhat subtle and contribute to the realistic, industrial feel of the settings.<br /><br />This is one of those movies I can watch whenever it comes on and we occasionally have an \\"Alien\\" marathon once a year or so where we watch all of the movies in row over a weekend.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

B006XF5BTG|4.0|I recently purchased and finished reading Bigger Leaner Stronger by Mike Matthews.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great book. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who spends a lot of time at the gym, or is thinking about strength training.<br /><br />The three strengths of the book, to me, are:<br /><br />1. It clearly explains how many sets, reps, days to work out, etc. that everybody asks themselves. It also explains the best exercises for building muscle in each muscle group.<br /><br />2. Mike Matthews simply explains how to either cut weight, or gain muscle, which are the two most common goals associated with weight training. You'll no longer remain in confusion about how to achieve either of these goals.<br /><br />3. Lastly, he sets the record straight about what supplements are useful, and what others are nothing but a waste of money. The information about what to eat is also very useful.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of this book, and it was mentioned in another review, is that there's no citing of sources. A lot of his arguments are \\"trust me\\". Which, after Internet searching the author, he doesn't seem to be hiding anything. I do think he honestly believes what he is writing in his book.<br /><br />Having said that, I have already began applying what he has written in his book. The reason being is that despite the lack of cited sources, to me it just all makes sense. I have a background studying health sciences, so from what I can see, there's no claim in this book that is ridiculous or extreme.<br /><br />Also to note, Mike Matthews will email you if you register your email for the Bonus Report. It was nice because I emailed him back with a specific question that I had after reading his book. Within a few hours, I had an answer specifically for my question. Talk about customer service and an author really caring for those who read his book. It definitely gives off the impression that his overall goal definitely isn't money, but rather to really help people achieve their fitness goals.

B001QXCYZY|4.0|At first when i plugged it in, i had problems but that was because ableton would not recognize it but then it worked perfectly fine. I noticed the light was green instead of blue like its supposed to be but i looked in to that problem and found out that my computer wasnt giving it 48v phantom power like it requires. Also after around 15-20 minutes of it being plugged in, it starts making this static noise. i suspect because of the lack of power from my computer. so none of that is the microphones fault. also people are complaining about the levels. well their pretty easy to change. the only thing i did not like about this microphone was the amount of background noise it picks up when your not talking but then again, its a $55 microphone. so all in all, its a good microphone for beginners and good to start out with. but if you want more professional results, get a good $200 microphone. I was just on a budget so I bought this. And go with XLR over USB. to many problems with usb. once i get the money, im getting a rode nt1a [[ASIN:B002QAUOKS Rode NT1A Anniversary Vocal Condenser Microphone Package]]with a nice audio interface [[ASIN:B002R9ILOY Focusrite Saffire 6 USB Audio Interface]]and thats all you need to get great results. thanks behringer though for a product well worth the money.

034580404X|1.0|I was so thrilled to receive the order because of the reviews. I thought it was a book worth reading.  The first few chapters were endearing and I found myself staying up till 2am just reading the book.. then it became just too weird for me.  I think It's a little but too much for my taste of romance.  It was not until I checked the back part of the book and saw its classification as EROTIC ROMANCE.  Definitely not for teens and for the soft hearted, romantic kinda people. This book is too hard core ..not appealing at all.

B004EPYZQ2|1.0|Have you ever witnessed (no, not seeing a video with little perspective) of a fast moving freight train hitting a vehicle?  I have long ago while working for the Union Pacific;  I was working for the U.P. and sitting trackside on a \\"ballast machine\\" knowing that the freight was about to come thru....thus making it requisite to pull into a siding which was there for such purposes.  A truck driver<br />with suicide on his mind pulled onto the tracks just as the freight was approaching.  Yes, there is debris flying through the air ahead of the impact area but any normal freight (75 to 100+ cars) will just slice right through the vehicle....there is no threat of a derailment under normal circumstances (such as an improperly maintained trackage) and will continue to pass through while the engineer attempts to stop the train.  It is a horrendous event to witness (the driver was killed immediately) but something with the tonnage of a freight train is not going to go flying in all directions.  J.J. Abrams has a wild imagination as shown in his earlier works....but the premise of a derailment is simply ridiculous.  And be prepared to describe the events before a Coroner's Jury!  Nothing more, nothing less.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked the game it was really fun until the update and I lost all my progress. I still play the game for entertainment and fun.
0547569653|5.0|I thought that this book was great, but fair warning that if you're not a runner, it's probably not going to be as exciting of a read for you. But even being a casual runner who has never done a marathon, let alone an ultra, I still found amazing stories, tips and motivation from reading the book.<br /><br />I, like many novice runners I'm sure, learned of Scott Jurek by reading Born to Run. So the opportunity to read even more on his story was great. Definitely motivational in how he grew up, the struggles with his father, and for his mother, but then the camaraderie between he and Dusty, and he and others in book, which I think just illustrates that when you're that committed to a lifestyle, and that driven for your goal, you need a great support staff around you. Nothing illustrated this more than when Scott (and others) dropped everything to go search for Micah True when he was missing.<br /><br />I guess my only regret is that the story isn't complete. Not even 40 years old, Scott may not be the exactly the top competitor that he once was, but he's still got a lot to provide to the running community, both through racing and words of wisdom.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a lot of fun.  some games are tough at first but keep trying and you'll pass them.  would recommend this game.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I love Liam. Taken was superb. Rob Roy was excellent. But I am a fan of Justice (See Die Hard 1 where Mclean empties a magazine into 1 guy; or - case in point \\"Taken\\" the scene with electric diaodes in the perp's thigh), and happy endings. But an ending where everybody dies? Ah jees! What a waste of my time ...<br />Nice scenery. Nice philosophy. But then if I wanted this I'd get a screen saver or a copy of Nietzche ...
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have no complaints with this app. I only wished I bought it directly from the Google Play Store. It's not a problem with this app as you need an internet connection for it to work but why does every app purchased from Amazon need an active internet connection to start? Many people probably don't even know this.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I had downloaded this shortly after it came out, played a few of the levels but opted to finish original angry birds first.  A couple days ago I noticed there was an update via the amazon app store so I downloaded and installed it.  Now it no longer works! Tablet is a toshiba thrive running Android 3.1.  The original angry birds update was loaded and is running fine.  angry bird seasons no longers runs on tablet...<br />[UPDATE]<br />January 12, 2013 - After a couple updates to Angry Birds Space, this is now working on my Toshiba Thrive.  Rating has been updated from 1 star to 4 stars.
B005LAIHIQ|5.0|I love this version of Dark Shadows! It's a twist to the original Dark Shadows which I absolutely love watching too!!
B005SJIP2S|3.0|Love YES.  I've loved them for decades.  I think David sounds a lot like Jon Anderson, and the songs sound great (if a little slow) on the CD, but the DVD is pathetic--other than the interviews.  I tried every setting on my receiver to get the best sound, and there just was NO best sound.  Howe, White, and Squire all looked tired, but they seemed revived when \\"Machine Messiah\\" came up.  Then there was some energy, perhaps from not being to play anything from Drama while Jon Anderson was there (except for \\"Cinema\\").  That decision could only have come from Jon Anderson (notice Steve Howe play's Rabin's stuff; White plays Bruford's stuff).  They've got to be tired of playing some of those things from the late 60s, but always, YES played professionally and looked like they were having a great time.  the stage looked a bit dark.  Just no excitement here...for the most part.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini series is a really good depiction of war. It is by far the best war movie I have ever seen. The 10 part series is really accurate at giving you that war feeling and realizing that everyone is a target in war. It surely isn't like other movies when it comes down to realistic sequences. Band of Brothers is really good at drawing you in and making YOU feel like you are in war. I can never really say I have seen another movie like this. I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was very interesting......made me begin to look for my 50 shades.......but kinda got bored with the constant sex.......overall very good
B007BZM30M|5.0|Love the song, very catchy and stuck in my head when I listen to it. Upbeat tempo and light but overplayed too often on medias now.
0345522303|5.0|I loved the first three books, but Shadow's Return and White Road were actually pretty dull. This made me hesitate to purchase this book, but I am very glad I did. I throughly enjoyed it and I hope she continues on with the series.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|IS this one of the super scary, gory ones?  No.  It's more of the traditional kind that leaves you on the edge of your seat and anticipating what's coming next.  It is rather predictable but that doesn't lessen the enjoyment of it.  And I did enjoy it a great deal.  It didn't live up to the fully, out and out scary I think it was going for but it's good nonetheless.  Daniel Radcliffe did give a wonderful performance in it and the acting was quite good.  My only real issue is a problem that some of us older folks have; the really dark scenes (as in lighting) were hard to see and to be able tell what was going on.  Even watching during the day I had a hard time seeing what was going on in some of it.  That, most assuredly, does affect the enjoyment level of things.  I understand what they were going for with some of it and to set the mood but that doesn't help when you can't see enough of what is going on to tell what they are doing or see something they are reacting to.<br /><br />Overall, though, it was a decent movie.  Far better than what Hammer usually puts out.
B007P6VM04|5.0|[[ASIN:B007X10OLE The Music Of SMASH]]This CD is so Great. My husband and I listen to it in the car all the time when we go on our day trips. The singers couldn't be better. Will buy another one and can't wait to see the new season program this year.

Mr. Sparks, please write more books!!!!  I'm almost through reading all of your published ones and waiting anxiously for your new one:)
030746363X|3.0|The book was recommended to me by a client and I think some aspects are head on common sense but others are a bit of a stretch for me.  I suppose it's worth reading just to gain a new perspective but I could never really follow a lot of what the author suggests.
1451608659|5.0|Throughout my child and teenaged years, I was huge gymnastics fan. Shannon Miller, who was the same age as me, was my idol and I eagerly followed her career in the same way my friends would follow their favorite movie stars. I remember being 19 and watching \\"The Magnificent 7\\" in Atlanta. Dominique Moceanu was the youngest and was already being touted as the next Nadia. She was adorable, but even then I got the impression that this was a kid under way too much pressure by her pushy parents and coaches. Unlike, say, Miller or Kerri Strugg, I didn't get the impression that this was entirely her dream but rather one that was foisted on her. Turns out I was on to something.<br /><br />While reading Moceanu's tale, I was reminded a bit of the late Michael Jackson: Both were child prodigies born to families of modest means and both sincerely enjoyed performing before an audience. And both had abusive fathers that would stop at nothing to make them stars. As it turns out, they eventually became stars in their respective fields, but it came at a steep price.<br /><br />Moceanu talks in length about the respective backgrounds of her immigrant Romanian parents. They each wanted to be gymnasts but didn't have the opportunity. (Moceanu's mother, Camille, actually had to turn down a spot at prestigious athletic academy because her father refused to let her go.) Thus, it seems when Dominique was born her future was already decided: She was going to be a gymnastics champion.<br /><br />Luckily for her parents, she was a natural. Sacrifices were made and at age 14, Dominique was already a World Champion and a member of the '96 Olympic team. However, life was far from perfect off the mat. The two most important men in the young girl's life, her father and legendary coach Bela Karolyi are painted as cold, dominating bullies who pushed her to the limit and made her feel that nothing she did was good enough. While the tales of Bela Karolyi and his wife, Marta, pushing young gymnasts totheir physical and psychological extremes abound, Moceanu's first account is nothing short of riveting. There is a strong case that what she went through at the hands of these two classifies as abuse. Also, even more shocking than how they basically dropped her after the Olympics when she did not take an individual medal in any of the events is how they dealt with the coaches who worked for them. In fact, the person that Moceanu most credits for her pre-Olympic success is not Bela or Marta, but a Russian coach who knew her mental and physical limits and treated her with warmth and compassion. While some may argue that the extreme style of the Karoylis is worth it because it results in champions, Moceanu is quick to point out that many of her teammates including Amy Chow & Shannon Miller had coaches who did not coach this way and they went on to do very well as Elite gymnasts. (In fact, as Moceanu points out, Miller remains the most decorated gymnast ever-male or female-after more than a decade after she retired from the sport.) Moceanu also gives a rare first-hand insight to the politics behind gymnastics. She isn't afraid to name names and burn bridges which is quite refreshing in this day and age of everyone trying to say something nice or risk being sued and/or blacklisted.<br /><br />While not surprisingly Moceanu admits to a period in her life where she experimented with drugs and sex it really is amazing she did not have a complete meltdown after all she went through. Without giving everything away, her story ends on a happy note with a loving husband, kids, and a reunion with a long-lost sister she never even knew she had. (Indeed, the sister's story alone would make for an interesting memoir.) All in all, I recommend this to everyone but esp. those with a child who harbors dreams of making it big in sport, showbiz, or any high-profile profession.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so dang fun I'm so glad that I can get it on my kindle fire here's. a secret glitch in the game, turn the tutorial on and when you turn swipe your finger twice and it does a u turn and you keep on going straight without any jumps or anything

B000024IJV|5.0|Gris Gris, Dr. John, 1968<br />Years before the feel-good hit \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", John \\"Mac\\" Rebennack, Jr. was known as Dr. John The Night Tripper and had a sound unlike anyone else at that time.<br />Rebennack, originally from New Orleans, had been a session musician in Hollywood since the early 60's, appearing on albums by Sonny and Cher, Canned Heat and the Mothers Of Invention. Naming himself after and copying the persona of a real life 19th century New Orleans hoodoo man named Dr. John, he released his first solo album, Gris Gris (pronounced gree-gree) in 1968.<br />Dressed in dashiki's, feathers, carrying a staff and appearing as a voodoo shaman, Dr. John's Gris Gris seems to come from another place and time. The opening track \\"Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya\\" is as slow moving as a medicine man's smoke and as authentically creepy and bizarre as anything ever recorded. With hip hop-esque spoken word boasts and incantations from a bullfrog voice seemingly coming from a nocturnal shadow, Dr. John promises \\"cures for all yall's ills\\".<br />The backdrop music is a stew of traditional Afro-Cajun New Orleans jazz, mixed with rhythm and blues and Creole Zydeco; the studio reverb making it seem as if it is drifting down alley ways on a stroll through the French Quarter.<br />The entire Gris Gris album could be on the soundtrack to True Blood or any Southern Gothic tale, but it does offer a couple of upbeat songs in the breezy \\"Mama Roux\\" and the classic R&B sound of \\"Jump Sturdy\\".<br />The album closes with the extended jam (or ceremonial ritual?) of  \\"I Walk On Guilded Splinters\\" which will stick in your head for days with it's haunting melody, bongos and call-and-response back ground vocals randomly repeating, \\"Ti' Alberta!\\"; while The Night Tripper speaks in strange Creole tongues.<br />But don't let that scare ya. If you're wanting to get into something a little deep, Gris Gris sounds perfect on humid, swampy summer nights. With the sound of tree frogs in the background. And maybe a little bonfire.<br />Stand Out Tracks:<br />* Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya<br />* Mama Roux<br />* I Walk On Gilded Splintersound. And maybe a little bonfire.<br />Stand Out Tracks:<br />* Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya<br />* Mama Roux<br />* I Walk On Gilded Splinters
B001AQR3IU|5.0|This one of my favorite movies.  It has all the elements of a childhood fairy tale, but with much more adult themes.  I definitely recommend this movie if you loved grimm's fairy tales as a child.  It has the same dark elements as those stories.
B007CKNX28|4.0|Just when I was about to lose faith in Jack White he surfaces with a stellar new record that should be nominated Rock Album Of The Year.<br />In some circles there is an understanding that Jack White is the closest equivalent to our generation's Kurt Cobain in the sense that he's been a one man embodiment of innovative underground music brought to the mainstream.<br />Just as Nirvana did a decade earlier, the White Stripes somehow popped up on the the radar in a cesspool of garbage (Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Staind) and brought with them a hope of returning to a simpler and more real sense of rock music.<br />Along with the Strokes and a few other bands embracing the garage and punk ethos, the White Stripes ushered in a short-lived tide of roots rock and retro punk that threatened to crush the left-over pretensions of 90's rock.<br />Although watered down, homogenized post-grunge won the battle of the airwaves and many of the garage bands that promised a revolution faded away into the one-hit-wonder category, Jack White stood his ground and showed that his talent was made of stern stuff.<br />He continued on with two new bands, the Raconteurs and Dead Weather who were both good but never fully caught on and reached the heights of the White Stripes.<br />After moving to Nashville with his own studio he possibly has perfected the sound he was after all along.<br />With influences  on Blunderbuss ranging from old school rock and roll to country, Nashville's effect is apparent.<br />Piano driven ballads, lap steel guitar, upright bass and female backing vocals make Blunderbuss a solid and focused fusion of the rock Jack White has been playing for years and timeless Americana.<br />Buy Blunderbuss for a strong shot of modern but traditional music from one of rock's very few relevant mainstays.<br />Stand out tracks:<br />Freedom At 21<br />Love Interruption<br />Take Me With You When You Go
0984183523|5.0|I am a case study novice and have found this book very helpful to understand how to go about solving a case study. A very well structured book that provides useful and easy to follow examples which should be the first point of reference for anyone trying to master case studies.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I'm not going to dive into all of the technical aspects, or what Ged's voice is/isn't, anymore. I've been a huge Rush fan for the better part of thirty years. I was even fortunate enough to win a local radio contest back in '87, and got to meet the guys during the 'Hold Your Fire' tour. That said, I really like Clockwork! The more I listen to it, the more I'm liking it. Clockwork, to me anyway, reminds me a lot of 'Counterparts' with some 'Test For Echo' thrown in. So far, my favorite songs are... 'The Wreckers' 'Halo Effect' and 'The Garden'. Maybe Ged can't hit the high notes like he once did. But, he's still got that magic in his voice. If you're a true Rush fan, you won't be disappointed. Clockwork's a winner!
B00005V9HH|5.0|This looks just like the original 1955 film & stars many of Britain's best actors.  It's an interesting contrast to the 1995 version (also excellent) that is set in a Fascist England of the 1930's & has a terrific preformance by Ian McKellen as Richard.  The play itself is as easily understandable & likeable as it was in 1600.
B0086700CM|1.0|this game is so overrated and boring... I do not understand all the fanatical love for this game... just because it has 7000+ 5* reviews does not make it a must for everyone. if you get this game due the childhood it has at the top slot and all the lame reviews... then you are a sheep going to slaughter. boring game. I want to see other games worthy of the number 1 slot than this sludge which only everyone wants because they never could have it... I hope the boring novelty of this dull game will cease eventually and the fanatics will stop praising and masturbating over it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I fully understand what Suzanne Collins was trying to communicate... however for me it was a little jaded.  And I'm not someone who needs a fairytale ending either - some of the tragic things that happened - I actually could appreciate.  It seemed like the writer has lost faith in America...when sometimes I wonder who pays who to say what... and who is really corrupted.  But that depends on if the political platform I saw in this book was real or imagined.... :)  Other than that big beef I had with it - some minor &#34;cosmetic&#34; complaints.  Katniss acted vastly out of character for me that the tragedies of war did not merit.  And justice was not done to Katniss's friendship with Gale either.  But the Coin plot twist (assuming she didn't represent someone in real life) was spot on because that lady based on her personality presented in the book alone...was a villain.  Basically the whole thing was not quite what I expected.  My best friend however thought it was great so don't take my word for it!  :)  To it's credit the whole series is a great way to debate the world and it's injustices. I think everyone has a different viewpoint on this one.  Some like it, some don't.  And I think it has a lot to do with whether you agree with Suzanne's political bend...unless you couldn't find it.  :)

B000FCK65W|5.0|Although this appears under my husband's account because he gifted me the Kindle and set up the account, I am the one who read this book as a young girl of approximately ten years old.

I encourage others to experience the story of a young girl coming of age in NYC.  Peggy

I was hesitent to read this one too, thus i opted for a rented copy and waited several weeks.  Then... I read the first 40 pages or so of fifty shades of grey...and I'm now going to be scarred for a few months. The dominant, controlling, masochist nasty made me want to vomit.

B00756GKBA|4.0|As a very long time fan, I must say that I was a bit disappointed with MDNA. \\"Masterpiece\\" has given my review the 4th star.<br /><br />It is a well-written, perfectly produced and polished pop album. The winning combination of lyrics with meaning and a killer rhythm is Madonna's specialty. However, it gives a feeling that she is trying too hard in this one, as if she is intimidated by the younger pop stars and trying to approach a younger audience, as if she is afraid that her crown will be taken away from her.<br />This is purely my opinion: I wish that there would be more songs like \\"Masterpiece\\", and less like \\"Gang Bang\\" and co. I wish there would be less effects, more actual instruments, more natural Madonna's voice. She does not need to prove anything to anyone. Unfortunately, the younger audience is not very familiar with older Madonna's songs (I am talking about early 20's and teens), so they have no particular reason to listen to her. To them she is just a middle aged woman who tries really hard to stay young and relevant. The older audience, who knows what she has done in the past, I think, would love to see her peaceful with her experience and age. She is still kicking ass on tours (been to the latest two, that woman is in AMAZING shape), showing that physical strength has nothing to do with age, she is not slowing down, working like crazy, etc, and that is good for her.<br /><br />But the music needs to grow up and soften a bit. We will still love you, Madonna, we promise.<br /><br />To sum up: a good pop album. Since it is Madonna, I wish it was softer and less produced. Get it, whether you have been a long time fan or a new fan.
B0070066DI|4.0|This is a great fan for small form factor mATX chassis. It is moderately difficult to install as it is not able to utilize the connectors that come with the motherboard. If you are adding this fan after the fact, you will have to remove the mobo and replace the existing CPU heatsink backplate with the one that comes with this heatsink. Next, you must tighten the heatsink with screws from the back side of the mobo. All in all I am happy with the end result but getting there was a bit of tedious work. The company that I purchased this item from (Platinum Micro, Inc.), was stellar and I would certainly recommend purchasing from them. Their dedication to a high level of customer satisfaction is apparent. I would have given this item 5 stars if had not been so difficult to install.

B00005UT84|5.0|Ce live de 1974 à d'abord pressé en vinyle (En 1980!)sous le titre Best of CARAVAN Live mais seulement en France et en Allemagne !! Cette remasterisation de 2002 est vraiment excellente au niveau du son et de plus les titres sont joués dans l'ordre du concert.<br /> C'est vrai que la voix peu surprendre au départ , très légère, fluette mais je ne considère pas celà comme le maillon faible du groupe bien au contraire il suffit d'écouter le début du chef d'oeuvre 'For Richard' (un hommage à Richard Sinclair) pour constater le talent de Pye Hastings. Geff Richardson au violon est tout simplement Divin.<br />Passer à coté d'un Live de CARAVAN de cet époque c'est passer à coté du groupe tant sur scène ils donnaient leurs pleines mesures
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The romance started out slow. It is rare to have handsome mixed with rich. Yes, this is fantasy for sure. I liked that the story went in a direction that I was not expecting. I like for fantasy stories to connect to me in some way but this did not because of the rich handsome guy. I guess I could relate to being a student but that was not what the story was about. I just wanted to say that I read this hot romance.I am glad she made the choice that she made at the end.

0765316994|4.0|I've sifted my way through many of the reviews on Amazon of this book, and I was continually surprised at how the majority dismissed the three codas or completely denigrated their inclusion.  Scalzi has taken a conceit that clearly has appeal- a parody of Star Trek and the entire history of science fiction itself- but he turned this novel into a strange love story that simultaneously becomes a metanarrative about the process of writing and the nature of fiction. As an intelligent reader of science fiction, in many ways I can understand the frustation that some of the reviewers had- wanting the book to end at the 2/3 mark- because the book was published by Tor and marketed as a science fiction novel, and is dependent on the genre of science fiction itself, but I still wish that scifi fans would look beyond their own limitations, and that more \\"literary\\" readers would look beyond theirs, and see this as a book that fits into two worlds rather neatly. This is not a book that is going to succeed at bridging the gap between scifi/fantasy and serious literature (I keep hoping for Pratchett to be recognized as accomplishing that stupendous task), but it was a worthy effort. Unfortunately, it's also a worthy effort that, more than likely, is going to end up in the remainder bin because of the inflexibility of its readers (who would never pick up Dostoevsky's [[ASIN:0374528373 The Brothers Karamazov]] or Turgenev's [[ASIN:B005JFBFFU First Love]]) and non-readers (whose noses are so far in the air they wouldn't deem to read such immature silliness).<br /><br />Redshirts is not without its flaws, especially when it comes to character development in the first 2/3s (I had a hard time keeping track of who was who), but it definitely aspired to be greater than the sum of its parts.
B00447L4KA|5.0|Only seen this movie on T.V. and just loved it. It is funny and touching and I wanted to see the movie unedited.
B007VTVGAQ|3.0|When we last heard from Fiona in 2005, she belatedly released a fantastic album called \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" , which itself took 6 years to be made/remade and released. Extraordinary indeed. As it turns out, it would take even longer for Fiona to get her 4th album released. The pre-release anticipation knew no boundaries among Fiona fans from the first hour, myself included. Now finally, the wait is over!<br /><br />\\"The Idle Wheeler\\" (10 tracks; 43 min.; not the full title but you knew that already) starts off with \\"Every Single Night\\", which has been widely seen/heard since Fiona debuted it at the SXSW festival in March. Now hearing the studio version, it is an even more eerie song, with basically little or no instrumentation. If you think that the album's overall sound would be different, you are in for a big surprise. Indeed, every single song on here involves mostly Fiona on piano, with some percussions here or strings there, and that's basically it. In that sense, the album almost feels like an exercise in style, although you will immediately pick up on some familiar jazzy hooks here and there from earlier albums as well. Just to re-emphasize the point: there is nothing remotely rocking on the entire album. If you like Fiona primarily for songs \\"Limp\\", \\"Fast As You Can\\" or \\"Get Him Back\\", just to randomly pick those faster tunes, you will likely be shockingly disappointed with this album. The album gets a bit stronger as it plays on (check out the snappy \\"Periphery\\"), leading to the very best song, the closer \\"Hot Knife\\", in which Fiona's vocals are overdubbed multiple times until it creates this magical sound of its own.<br /><br />In all, \\"The Idler Wheel\\" is a SIGNIFICANT departure from Fiona's sound on the earlier albums. Thematically, it still covers familiar territory (love gone wrong; regrets; hoping for the future; etc.), but musically if the earlier albums were from Venus, this album is from Mars. I've seen Fiona in concert a number of times over the years, and her live shows are as mesmorizing as anything. I've got tickets to 2 shows on the upcoming tour. Can't wait for that! Meanwhile, \\"The Idler Wheel\\" is definitely a left turn in the musical journey of Fiona Apple. To me this album is a pretty big disappointment, to be honest.<br /><br />*UPDATE* (July, 2012) I just saw Fiona in concert this past week in Indianapolis, and she put on a fabulous show, just trilling from start to finish. She brought a nice mix of songs from all the albums (more from \\"Extraodinary Machine that any other), and the new tunes rocked harder than what is on the album. If you have a chance to see her on this tour, DO NOT MISS IT! I've already got my tickets for her show here in Cincinnati coming up in October.e years, and her live shows are as mesmorizing as anything. I've got tickets to 2 shows on the upcoming tour.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|Halfway between cozy and mean streets, this mystery kept my interest with its believable main character and its vivid description. The plot is excellent, and its final twist will amaze you. I too await the next one, and will even pay for it.
030758836X|1.0|Although the first half of the book was interesting and intertaining the second half was mundane and slow moving and not at all believable,which a mystery who-dunit should be.  The book was 100 pages longer than it needed to be and the detectives were made out to be idiots on both cases.  I do not recommed this book.
1468161660|5.0|I love the love story and I love that it wasn't overwhelming.  It focused on serious issues that people face such as love and death and losing a parent.  This book was really good. I'm truly lost for words. I cried and I couldn't put the book down. I love the poetry in the book as well, it was very fitting to the situations that were going on in the story. I think the author did an excellent job developing the characters and she did an excellent job getting the readers to fall in love with them. Layken's reaction to death of a love one as well as her reaction to not being able to be wtih Will was very realistic.  Anyone in her situation would act the same way and I like that she appeared to be like a real person.  Also, Will was so lovable. Young, tall, handsome, and overall good guy who is trying to do the right thing but admits his feeling at the same time. You have to love that.  One thing one reviewer mention that I totally agree with was about the young boys.  The young boys in the story were about 9 years old but it felt like they were five or six years old. That may have been the only flaw but definitely not a deal breaker at all. I think anyone can truly love the story and look forward to the second book.<br /><br />I have already started reading the second book and I must say, I'm loving this one just as much.  This time Will and Layken's little brother are about 10 to 11 years old and they are definitely acting their age. It's so cute. Layken and Will are as I expected, adorable, and handling the situation as it comes.  I love the poetry. I haven't been able to get my head out of book 2 and I can tell that I may just like this one better than the first.<br /><br />I would totally recommend this to anyone who likes a good story.

B002L4QP0M|2.0|I will give this book two stars only for the storyline.  It was clever, but such a laborious chore to read and try to edit at the same time.  Errors included switching main characters names so that it changed the authors meaning.  So unprofessional.  The author should not have allowed this unedited version to be published digitally.
B0086700CM|5.0|people will really this game.  you can learn apothegm fromthis game . your kids will enjoy this game on the road. if you are bored this a great time saver.

B004QL7K8E|1.0|This might be ok if you cared about the characters at all. But they are annoying whiners and this flick is just another flick about teens wanting to party. Only unlike other party movies that can be sorta fun this one is about these guys wanting to be BIG SHOTS. This was a huge bomb coming from a major studio and it doesn't have much humour even as compared to the hangover. Which is just as dumb and about partying too. This one though would annoy teens even as there is NO plot really. just a extended party video or just a music video with no reason to call itself a movie,  and teens  avoided this movie as much as everyone else did so even they realized this one was not a movie.  The blu ray looks good but it's not staying in my collection that is for sure. I did keep the hangover films though. Those are good dumb party movies.
0345803493|3.0|After reading fifty shades I was eager to continue reading, yes I'm a sucker for the love story but was expecting more of a 'shocking' story line given this was suppose to be darker, I was disappointed and got bored with reading the same old 'love' scenes.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|I just finished watching \\"The Grey\\" on DVD.I must say that this is a pretty decent action flick.The scenery is stunningly beautiful and the CGI wolves,although larger than their real-life counterparts,look awesome.Everything was done very well with this pic.I've read some reviews that indicate that viewers are unhappy by what is apparently an ambigious ending,and judging by the final scene before the end credits roll, it does look that way.However,if you scroll through the ending credits you'll see a final very short scend of what appears to be the black alpha wolf laying on it's side,perhaps breathing its' last.The camera pans along the length of the still breathing body and stops on a shock of black hair raising up from the wolfs' body.If you look closely you can see that it appears to be attached to a human scalp as pink skin can be seen underneath the shock of hair.This final scene would seem to indicate that the battle is just ended and John Ottway and the wolf have killed each other.I may be wrong,but I think that this is a reasonable conclusion judging by that final short scene,which at least for me ,brings the movie to a final conclusion.I reccomend this movie to anyone with a taste for the outdoors and outdoor adventure.We need more movies like this!
1612130283|4.0|Fifty shades of grey is a good read if you don't take it too seriously.  I don't agree with the reveiws that state it could have been written by a teenager (frankly a teenager shouldn't know about all the kinky ~****y)!  Rest of trilogy is disappointing and predixtable though.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I liked the movie!  It really did not take itself too seriously, although there were moments that were kind of ridiculous.  But hey, this is just a fun Sci-Fi action flick, so really what were the 1 and 2 star people (probably hated John Carter as well) expecting?<br /><br />This movie does however has one of the WORST (IMO) endings ever! That would be that stupid thumbs up scene right at the very end.  I mean who in their right mind would ruin a movie that way! Hopefully, if there is a director's cut that part will be cut out.
0345803507|3.0|Grey..good, darker..ok, freed...so predictable, the 'Hyde' storyline could have been so much better, its ok if you love a soppy love story!
0345803485|5.0|Ok so the book talked about sex 24/7 and was really graphic and not something for teens to read. BUT it was a really good book and there was a wonderful love story to be told about a couple trying to over come obstacles. Loved reading it!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the kwlest game ever i play it on my friends fone and now it finally came out for the kindle!!!gtg playin temple run;)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book on a whim and I'm so glad I did.  It kept me riveted the entire time.  It was such an interesting take on the whole \\"post-apocolypse\\" genre.  Very well written and an easy read, I would highly recommend it to anyone.  If you like sci-fi and a good post apocalypse story then this series is for you!  Read it!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This whole energy thing is ridiculous. Who waits 100+ hours to get anything done!? I can't believe I have to give this thing a star just to say this. I'd give this -5 stars if I could. Don't get this game, EVER!
B0086700CM|4.0|I would give it 5 stars if it was not laggy at all cause sometimes I would be doing really awesome but it lags and I die but all in all its really cool and u should get this game
B0079XPUOW|1.0|I was looking forward to this book.  Very disappointed.  Thought Agent to the Stars was great, that's why I ordered this one. Sorry to say that second time around for me with this author was a let down.
1846554055|4.0|There isn't as much happening in this story as in books 1 and 2 but it still has action, suspense and wonder, and there is the same style with interludes in the story line that describe the thoughts of the main actors and even ask the reader to consider \\"what if it had been like that instead of like this?\\", and finally an ingeneous and highly satisfying tying up to the story started in book 1.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|At the risk of sounding objective, I think the new Smashing Pumpkins album, Oceania is rather good. Interestingly, the more important word in that previous sentence is new. Once I let go what history I have had with Smashing Pumpkins and listen with current ears, it sounds pretty darn good. I can no longer hold Billy Corgan's feet to the fire to make me feel like he did when I was younger. Heck, we are both in different places. Those previous efforts will have a place in shaping what I am today and what I think and listen to, but a new album should be looked at as having that potential as well. All in all, the delicate balance between heavy and soft, which defined the band in the beginning, is here and well worked. Go into this new release without and expectations, as hard as it was for me, and listen with new ears. You might be surprised at how the songs really may be a new classic and soundtrack for the new you as well.
1933952806|3.0|There isn't much about about this rather complex camera that isn't dealt with in Mr. Young's book. I got the book the same time as I bought the D7000 camera and read it in place of studying the Nikon User's Manual. In a way, I regret that choice. Not the buying of the \\"Mastering\\" volume. But in reading it first instead of the official literature.<br /><br />Here's why. Having had experience with training professionals in complicated skills -- flying 747s -- I should have known that the fastest and surest way of learning would be to \\"let my fingers do the walking\\". Young's book is abstract. As it has to be, I suppose. But getting out with the camera and trying every button and dial, making mistakes, trying over again are better learning strategies. I spent 3 weeks with the Young book on a couch and my eyes glazed over. In that time, I took less than 40 images and the camera felt like a stranger in my hands.<br /><br />The official User's Manual has you shooting pictures within 20 pages and gives just enough facts to anchor your understanding. To their credit, Nikon's writers don't go into long-winded discussions of digital photography. The User's Manual is action orientated. Subjects and camera functions are dealt with in a direct, succinct manner. And thus they are easy to remember.<br /><br />Now, after two months and a little experience, I can go back to the \\"Mastering\\" book for fuller explanations. So, to the reader I would suggest mastering the camera rather than trying to master the book first. It will save you time, and does not diminish the depth of Darrell Young's vast knowledge. It's a matter of prioritizing.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I had to use my brain a little for a few minutes to put it together, but it wan't too bad and it worked very well.  I had a near perfect cut on my first wine bottle and this was the first bottle I ever attempted to cut.  Well worth the money to make it so easy.
1451627289|3.0|I just finished this book today. As I was reading it, I wrote a brief note to a friend about it and about reading King's work in general: when I don't mind ingesting a tale told in 800 pages that might've been told in eight, King is the man. I've been taking in the man's work since the mid-eighties, have to date read between ten and fifteen of his novels, and this is inevitably and reliably true. He gives you a yarn, he engages you for the most part, and his characters, though often embarassingly black or white, are usually easy to visualize and/or relate to.<br />Where he falls short, I've always found, is in resolution or third acts. I have so often found myself thinking, on page 787, \\"is that really it?\\" He does not surprise and his resolutions do not fulfill. That used to annoy me a great deal, but now, having come to expect it, I just read to kill time and to get from his writing what it gives.<br />If you can roll that way, read on and enjoy. You know, before Maine becomes a province.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading about how amazing this trilogy is, I had to see what all the commotion was about.  I'm an avid reader; have been since I was a pre-teen.  Thank goodness I only purchased the first book.  Complete trash, poor writing, ridiculous story, no plot.  I had to stop reading after a bit.  This is nothing but pollution of the mind & soul. Is this what we, as Americans, have come to?  Really?  I'm embarrassed that so many actually praise this pornographic material as a good read.  I would have liked to given it zero stars, but that was not a choice.
B0034G4P8A|2.0|I really love super hero movies, and after we saw the avengers and this movie showed up on our Netflix, I decided to give it a shot. Even just five minutes in, I decided it was just... really mediocre. Not terrible, not great, it just exuded this feeling that not a whole lot of effort was put into it. As a friend of mine succinctly put it, \\"The legends were cooler.\\" And no, this is not just my opinion, I watched it with seven other people and we all couldn't stop laughing through the entire thing. The plot was rather boring, the villains underwhelming at best, and the hero so completely unsympathetic, plus the special effects and editing read like a movie from five years previous. At one point, a car flips over and you can actually see the lines from the wire that weren't edited properly. They could have done so much more with the mythology and played on the elements of a god that once worshipped by us journeying to a world that no longer believes in him, or even just some more prods to the actual myths, but there was little there. It could have been a lot worse, but amidst movies like The Dark Knight, Captain America, ect, it just felt so... underwhelmed.

0765316994|4.0|Of course Star Trek fans immediately recognize the \\"Redshirts\\" reference, but this is not a spoof as some might think. If you want a spoof, it's hard to beat Galaxy Quest anyway.  Instead, Scalzi has created a similar universe to Star Trek (where the redshirts are seemingly expendable to the point of absurdity) with a metafiction twist. The flagship of Universal Union (or Dub U) is the Intrepid, a ship where all the crew members are terrified of away missions and mysterious and all-too-convenient technology that comes in handy in dire need. But the command crew seems oblivious to the extreme situations surrounding them on such a frequent basis.<br /><br />Anyone who has watched Star Trek will appreciate the humor and reflection that follows. The science fiction stretches into fantasy-like alternate realities and takes a suspension of disbelief beyond just an exploration of space.  I'm finding it hard not to give any spoilers!  While not what I expected or was hoping for, the big twist was surprising and quite funny.  This was certainly a switch from Scalzi's other science fiction stories. Redshirts is full of continuous light-hearted humor, amusing (though not overly complex) characters, and a heartwarming drama. While it seems necessary to have at least watched several episodes of Star Trek to at least appreciate the humor and many references, readers do not need to be Trekkies to enjoy this latest inspired release from a talented writer.
1250000971|3.0|While this is a nice story, the author did not work very hard to make it historically accurate or to pull readers into the time of the setting. In 1941, Coca-Cola was still called \\"Coca-Cola,\\" not \\"Coke,\\" New York City was not popularly called \\"The Big Apple\\" until the 1970's, and young English ladies did not take \\"a quick shower;\\" they bathed. And people like Maisie Clifton did not have telephones.  Half the time I was reading this book I had to remind myself that it was not set in contemporary times. But it is the author's job to make sure I know all along that this is 1941.  This laziness definitely impaired my enjoyment of what was a pretty good story, even if a bit too formulaic. No stylistic or plotting genius here. Which is a shame because Jeffrey Archer is capable of better.  It feels like he's trying to make a quick buck churning these out. Worth reading, but not worth full hardcover price.
B000JLSLZQ|3.0|Although the movie works fine, I thought I was ordering a new, unopened movie which was not the case. I wouldn't care except this was a birthday gift for a friend's daughter. This issue may very well be my fault, but it is not clearly stated on the site. Even as I looked back before writing this review, I can't find anything that states new or used. The new and used \\"starting at\\" prices are too similar to decide by that as well. Please note that this is my first purchase off of Amazon.com.

B007I2BZIE|4.0|Ah, Rush fanship, a sort of shared rite of passage among white, nerdy outsider types who grew up in the 1980s or 90s. We bond over how awesome Moving Pictures was and still listen to it through headphones every so often, transported back to a time when the signal telling guys like us (for we were mostly guys) that we weren't alone in the universe was coming from Canada, and contained instructions to rock.<br /><br />To my high school self, they were the one band that made music about serious things (well, them and U2) in a teenage wasteland of brain-dead jock rock, pop cheez-whiz, and low pants hip-hop. Of course, I learned as I grew older that there was other music worth listening to, but faithfully continued to buy all of Rush's new releases. And to *like* most of them, while still hoping that the next one would feature a little less of the alternative rock crunchy granola and a little more of the rocket sauce (to quote Jack Black) that had made the classic stuff so addictive.<br /><br />Maybe it's the fact that geekiness is now in and you can openly play 2112 to your heart's content (if not your girlfriend's) with your friends in Guitar Hero, maybe it's that no one wants to hear old guys trying to sound hip -- in any case, Rush has decided that they might as well embrace the past, kimonos and all, and make another old school science fiction concept album.<br /><br />And, man, the result is the closest thing to \\"classic Rush\\" since, well, classic Rush. This time, they play with the considerable musical athleticism that they still bring to marathon concerts. This time, Geddy Lee doesn't try to do annoying extra things with his voice, but delivers spot-on vocals. They make extensive use of strings, echoing the lushness of several of their mid-career releases. The energy of the songs reaches all the way back to the big laser show arena rock spirit of the early 1980s, blissfully free of any pretenses at a \\"current\\"-sounding record (not that anything \\"current\\" isn't apastiche of things from the past's garage sale), and it's fantastic.<br /><br />Among the instant winners for me were \\"BU2B\\", whose driving, double-edged contemplation of the idea of an intelligently-designed universe speaks right to an ex-Catholic Rush fan like me; \\"Clockwork Angels\\", whose soaring vocals, martial drums, and ethereal guitar are a strong echo of Hemispheres; \\"The Wreckers\\", in which Geddy delivers one of his most emotionally-charged vocal performances ever, to a dramatic string backing; and \\"Headlong Flight\\", simply a soaring, all-out rocker.<br /><br />Other songs offered up their rewards with repeated listenings. \\"The Anarchist\\" and \\"Carnies\\" feature furious guitar work from Alex and some theatrical atmospherics. \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" constructs a winding, wandering-in-the-wilderness vibe with some tripped-out, La Villa Strangiato-sounding passages. \\"The Garden\\" is so achingly beautiful, it overcomes somewhat cheesy lyrics.<br /><br />Is there sand in the aural picnic? Well, isn't there always. The song \\"Wish Them Well\\" makes me marvel that a guy who is friends with the creators of South Park AND name-drops both Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" and David Foster Wallace's \\"Infinite Jest\\" in another song can sometimes manage to crank out such preachy, self-help pap. The fragments of story in the liner booklet are somewhat of a disappointment, too, being kind of clunky and cliche-filled. Then again, Peart emphasizes larger themes over plot detail in the actual songs, so it's not a big deal. Finally, the recording sounds a bit muffled and flattened to my ears, particularly the drums. Not Vapor Trails bad, but not quite ideal.<br /><br />Hardly fatal flaws, though. All in all, I think this album will stand as a fine homage by Rush to its own glory days, containing plenty of bliss-out moments for long-time fans -- and perhaps a few younger ones. If it's to be their last studio effort, it's an impressive final hurrah for a now-legendary group.
B001QWBM62|4.0|I have used this recorder many times, its as good as they say it is. HOWEVER, The description brags that it is the only handheld recorder that records in 4 channels simultaneously, this is FALSE, the TASCAM D-40 also does, its very similar, and is the one I personally own because it is cheaper. Both are great and will serve your application. My friends from the film school prefer the zoom, but they don't question my D-40 mounted to my DSLR.  Do your research, and pick what fits your application best!
B007MDB71O|5.0|As a life long Edgar Rice Burroughs fan, I waited over 40 years for a Barsoom film adaptation. I could nit-pick over this film, but overall I found it wonderful. The problem with the film is not the film itself but how the studio marketed the film. They should have made a big deal out of the story turning 100 years old and how it inspired modern fantasy writing. People unfamiliar with John Carter felt it was derivative instead of being the original. The title of the movie \\"preaches to the choir\\". It should have been titled in a way that the mass audience could get a handle on it. I had a friend ask me if the movie was about Johnny cash's family!

B005FRF6PC|5.0|I had moderate expectations of this book when I checked the eBook out of the library.  I hoped for some idea who this guy is who I cheer for.  His dogged determination is an inspiration to me.  So I thought I'd read about his life and see if he had anything interesting to say.  I'd read some reviews here and some called it a page-turner, which I thought was pretty laughable for an autobiography.<br /><br />Short answer?  Read it in 6 days.  Pretty quick, for me.<br /><br />Longer answer?  This book is one I almost wish he'd waited until he retired to publish.  It is maybe a little too revealing of what is going through his mind in a match.  How his opponents can use that information, I don't know.  But he shares a lot of his inner thoughts during a match.<br /><br />I loved it.  If you love Rafa, you will, too.

B007O8VJBU|4.0|In the NME, frontman Ricky Wilson recently acquiesced to KC being a 'singles band.'<br />\\"People like to refer to us as a singles band and I guess we are a singles band. It's not something we set out to do. We wanted to make albums, but people don't think of us that way. Albums these days seem to adverts for singles with some tracks to bulk them out. It used to be the other way round.\\"<br /><br />It's not so bad, really.  The Smiths had plenty of singles, so did The Jam, so did Blur, so did Oasis, so he is at least in good company.  This is aimed at folks who either don't know the band, or haven't been keeping up for the entire time.<br />So what do you get?  Well, you get:<br /><br />'Oh My God'<br />'I Predict A Riot'<br />'Every Day I Love You Less and Less'<br />'Modern Way'<br />'You Can Have It All'<br />from the debut album Employment<br />'Ruby'<br />'Everything Is Average Nowadays'<br />'The Angry Mob'<br />'Love's Not A Competition (But I'm Winning)'<br />from the sophomore slump album Yours Truly, Angry Mob<br />'Never Miss A Beat'<br />'Good Days Bad Days'<br />from the underrated third album Off With Their Heads<br />'Little Shocks'<br />'Man On Mars'<br />'Kinda Girl You Are'<br />from the most recent new-wave/post-punk effort The Future Is Medieval<br />'On The Run'<br />from the USA version of The Future Is Medieval ('Start The Revolution Without Me.')<br />and 'Listen To Your Head' which is the latest single.<br /><br />There are definitely some album tracks that are at least as good if not better than the weaker singles here, so I wouldn't call this a \\"Greatest Hits.\\"  But it's definitely something to wet the whistle of the uninitiated, or expand the range of the folks who remember I Predict A Riot.

B0086700CM|4.0|Okay I got it and the first time was fantastic but then it started working bad and freezing up! I was very disappointed. then I decided to delete it and add it back later. after that it worked great and its very addicting and fun!(:
030758836X|5.0|Reviewers frequently talk about books they just couldn't put down.  I hated that this book was so enthralling that I got nothing done for two days.  I finally made myself go to bed, but was so excited by the intriguing story, fascinating characters, and stunning writing that I couldn't sleep, so had to get up and read some more!  I like mysteries, human dramas, and books of that ilk, but was immediately blown away by just how good a writer Flynn is.  For a story to be this enjoyable AND well written--that doesn't come around very often.  I am delighted that she has two more books for me to read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game!!! It's so addictive and fun.... and I love all the cute animals it has and getting to play scrats mung tu challenge!!!!

B005OOSPZO|5.0|Meticulous account of the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 from both the American and Japanese points of view. The blunders that were made as the enemy approached Oahu could have been avoided, and many lives would have been spared. But that's the way it wasn't. Many good and familiar actors, like Jason Robards Jr., Joseph Cotten, and James Whitmore,among others, assume the real life characters who participated in the event. I saw very little difference between my copy of the DVD and the Blu-ray edition. Both are sharp and clear. This is a disc that should be played every December 7, to commorate the memories of the many who were killed defending Pearl.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am so impressed with this CD. Adele has an outrageous voice and the music is fantastic. I always listen to it on my way to work and it sets the tempo for my day.I will be purchasing all of her CD's past and future. On this CD at least 3 of her songs are being played on the radio. I believe she has another winner!

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Many thanks to Amazon's Kindle staff for putting together \\"Building Your Book for Kindle\\". It made creating [[ASIN:B0086CO262 Never Judge A Book By Its Cover (or Title)]] extremely smooth. This is an excellent and easy to use resource, especially for first time Kindle authors. The step by step instructions are clear and concise. Using this guide, I was ready to upload my first e-publication before I even realized it! I sat at my computer thinking \\"Neah.... It can't possibly be this easy! There has to be more to it than this.\\" But there wasn't more. I was done and my publication was online about 12 hours later. I've read other similar books on building Kindles, but this one is the best. I'll be using it repeatedly.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoyed the series, and didn't want them to end!  It was wonderful experiencing the lives of the servants as well as the main household characters.  Great actors through out!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I don't really know who 's review to believe,  they either say its amazing or disappointing.  I like that it works on my kindle fire but will it cause it to stop working? I don't know. but so far I like it a lot.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Sherlock 21st Century Style is absolutely brilliant!  Yes, it is Sherlock Holmes but the producers must have been scouring Great Britain to get the raw and visceral feel that these two actors were going to wield.  They have risen to the ocassion and Cumberbatch and Freeman have outdone themselves and again prove that England produces some of the greatest actors in the world.  The link between these two is simply perfect and they do not disappoint in this series.  As a monster fan of Sherlock Holmes I have been watching this series and I am terribly impressed with the way Cumberbatch and Freeman interact.  They work very well together in this series as Freeman plays a much tougher version of Dr. Watson. I know many people who can't wait to see the next episodes to continue with the 21st Century rendition of the most celebrated detective the world has ever known. This is another winner !
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app it is so fun and entertaining. I love playing it with my friends and family. Have fun

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|In an age where the idea of horror is suppose to be one bloody gruesome scene followed by another more bloody and gruesome scene, there is a horror movie out there that relies on the old fashion way of scaring the crap out of you. With suspence and excellant film editing that will make you jump out of your seat. That movie is \\"The Woman In Black\\". It harks back to 40, 50 even 60 years ago to the golden age horror movies. I love a good horror story as much as the next person but over the last couple of decades I have found the horror movies made during this time to lack imagination and have no story or plot to it. They just try to gross out the audience with more blood and guts with every scene.<br /><br />\\"The Woman In Black\\" has restored my faith that there are people out there who still remember the way to make a great horror film. I won't bother to get into the plot of the movie. There are plenty of reviews written here on Amazon that go into what the story is about. There is nothing I can add there that hasn't already been mentioned. I just want to add my 5 stars to this movie and say to all those out there who like me have longed for a good old-fashion thrilling spooky movie like the days of old but had grown cynical that such movies could even be made anymore to go see \\"The Woman In Black\\"! I am sure your faith will be restored like mine has. This is a movie I can watch again and again and not tire of it. if you're a horror movie fan too like me I bet it will be the same for you as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed the first book (Fifty shades of Grey), but the second book (Fifty shaded darker) was AMAZING!!!<br /><br />The way the characters developed, the drama, the tears, the joy, the madness, etc.<br /><br />I am giving myself a break before I read the third book (Fifty shades free) because I don't want the series to end :(<br /><br />Love this series and the love story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|only problem is the bonus points you get for downloadingnother games is not for the kindle fire. so were getting CHEATED.BUT still a good app
B007O4XX9K|3.0|I fully expect to be ripped for this review by die-hard Eagles and Joe fans (of which I am one), but here goes.  Analog Man is sort of a tale of two albums.  It gets out of the gate pretty well but it bogs down significantly after track 3.  There is truly only enough worthy material here for 2/3 of an album<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail on the production quality (or lack thereof) since others have already done so.  Just know that for anyone listening on a set of headphones or desktop speakers, this album will probably sound fine.  For anyone else, it's just an awful, clipped, muddy mess.  I find it ironic that an album titled \\"Analog Man\\" should suffer so greatly from chronic digital production disease.  Clipping is rampant throughout, mastering is inconsistent from song to song and the listener is fatigued very quickly.<br /><br />Now on to the music itself...<br /><br />1.  Analog Man is classic post-Eagles era Joe.  Great main riff and funny lyrics.  A good opener and title track.  Will play great in a live setting.<br /><br />2.  Wrecking Ball is a lot of fun and is a successful little sing-along tune.  It sticks in your head and bears repeat listens.<br /><br />3.  Lucky That Way is a sentimental, country-ish retrospective that while a bit sappy, mostly works and I personally enjoy because, like Joe I'm getting older too.<br /><br />4.  Spanish Dancer (This is where the album goes south for me and quickly...)<br />Specifically, it's a schizophrenic, cut n' paste train wreck.  The \\"Spanish\\" portion of the song is woefully underdeveloped and utterly pedestrian in compostion.  The middle talk-box guitar jam section is pretty cool and would have been very welcome on the album as an instrumental song of its own.  But instead it serves as a ponderous right hand turn in the middle of what starts out as an ode to a Spanish dancer.  Eventually the song returns to the Spanish dancer theme for reasons unknown.  The entire song makes no sense and I can only attribute the song structure to a misguided use of ProTools.  If it had to appear on the album, it should have been buried at the end.<br /><br />5.  Band Played On is Joe's global warming opus.  While I agree with his politics in this case, the lyrics are far too trite and the melody forgettable.  At this point the album starts to take on a \\"front page headlines\\" feel.  Not a good thing in my book for a rock album.  Come on Joe, we get environmental awareness pushed in our faces 24/7 by the media and in advertising.  We buy rock albums to have fun, rock out and escape.  I think one \\"current events\\" tune is more than enough on any rock album and track one already filled that role.<br /><br />6.  Family is a song that has a sweet message but just isn't fully developed.  Yes, family is great.  It is nice to love and appreciate each other.  I don't need a song that states the obvious without something more unique to offer.  The song goes nowhere.  This is really greeting card drivel that isn't album worthy and is a major filler tune.<br /><br />7.  One Day At A Time is one that most Joe fans surely have heard before.  Not a particular favorite of mine, but understandably resonates with many fans on a personal level.  I do enjoy the song and don't have a problem with it being on the album even if the message is pretty tired.  Within the context of this record, it is a pedestrian offering that does not serve to propel the flow of the album at all.<br /><br />8.  Hi-Roller Baby is a light hearted love song that would have been right at home in Joe's catalog of the 70's.  It has a timeless feel and lyrics that can stand up over time.  This is where the album starts to rise up from the ashes a bit.  Two thumbs up.<br /><br />9.  Funk 50 is the latest in a series of \\"Funk\\" tunes by Joe.  It's precisely what you'd expect - a Joe \\"funk\\" tune with a modern twist.  I've always loved Joe's stabs at these and Funk 50 is no exception.  If I were to offer a criticism, the song is a bit short and leaves me wanting much more from this jam.  But a solid rock addition that belongs.<br /><br />10. India is a lively guitar instrumental and further serves to somewhat pull the album out of the fire.  Although oddly placed as the closing track of the album, it is an upbeat jam and shows Joe still has his chops.<br /><br />If there were a few more fully fleshed out rock ideas on this album and better production it could have been excellent.  As it is, Analog Man is very much a hit and miss affair.  Many die-hards and completists will love it, but I think objective ears will find it less loveable.
1451673442|5.0|I just finished reading this book, I am very pleased with it. It forces you to focus your mind on what is optimistic in your life and being appreciative of those little things that are good, as opposed to mulling over ceaselessly about your misery.<br /><br />The 28 days of practicing adding magic in your life is a good start to training the mind to allow goodness to put down roots in everything that you do; and I think that this exercise is a more correct way to focus on your goals and strive to achieve them than by worrying.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it was just really fun I played it on school all the time!! I love this game and had no prov with it
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I couldn't finish this book, I purchased it the other day, after looking at the reviews and thinking it would be good with all the sex and well sex:) but the main male character Mr Grey, is into the painful, rough kinda sex, which can be kinky when it's written right. But after I read the chapter where he hits her repeatedly and she realised she doesn't like it. I couldnt stomach it, knowing that he would do it again for his pleasure. I wanted to keep reading it to see if the main female character, Anastasia is able to, I suppose, change him and his ways, as she believes that there is more to him then just his painful, sex methods. But, why would you bother?! They have known each other a total of three weeks and he has her signing contracts to that she doesn't tell anyone about his habits and she knows that he isn't after an actual girlfriend boyfriend relationship, then after continuing the relationship she puts up with this.<br />I get that some people do this kinda of stuff and whatever floats your boat is how I think of it but I dont think that this kind of sexual relationship was written all that well, as I think that it could have been so much better with the sex scenes and Christians behaviour but it wasn't.  Through out the novel, I just got the vibe that Anastasia isn't into his kinky ways at all, but she continues because she is head over heels for this guy and can't say no to him.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read anything BDSM and that is NOT what kept me interested in this series. The love story is over-whelmingly good and keeps you glued to the pages. I read through this book the fastest I have ever read anything!! It is so addictive and sometimes even disturbing.<br /><br />Not great writing, so don't expect literary magic... but expect to want to read the next book...and the next!!<br /><br />FIVE STARS.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|While it is a bit on the gory side I really liked the story line. This is a story of true conviction and holding onto what you believe is true. I watched this with my 16 year old son and even he thought it was a great movie. If you don't like religious undertones then this movie is not for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book! Could not put it down I would recommend this book to all women! Wish there were more then three books to read
B0015HOFZI|3.0|I bought this turntable Sept. 2011.On Sept.23 I returned the turntable to the company. The turn table would not shut off with the switch.When I pushed the play button the arm would move to the record and hesitate ,then return to the cradle.The turn table would continue run until I unpluged it from the power source.I have had no problems since I got it back.  I LOVE IT!!!!! But now I have another problem:: My computer crashed and I lost everything on the computer. I bought another computer ,and I was going to install the turntabe on this computer.I  could not find my instalation software disk .I called Sony Company- Distribution center ,and Dealers. This instalation software is not available ?? So now I got a turntable that is collecting dust.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I really liked this album. I first found out about this band through their song \\"Little Talks\\". This band is similar-sounding to Mumford & Sons so if you like them, you'll probably like Of Monsters & Men. I was disappointed however that most of the songs in \\"My Head Is An Animal\\" were pretty slow. I feel that Mumford & Sons is certainly more upbeat in comparison.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|this is true spirit of the Beach Boys music. I really enjoyed it. It is the mellow sounds from days gone by. If you love the Beach Boys you will want this in your collection.

0385535139|5.0|When reading this book, you had to read almost every word to follow it.  That's o.k. because it was still true Grisham style.  You can almost see the characters yourself as you read, which makes it even better.<br /><br />The only time I have to read is in waiting rooms, due to my work schedule; I am still one of those who likes to actually hold the book in my hand. I may give in to my husband's Kindle Fire and read one on there one day; until then, let me mark my place with a bookmark or turned-down page.
1451608659|5.0|As a close friend of Dominique I was taken a back by the depth of the book.  I know a lot of her past but was completely in shock of some of the details and how amazing it is to see the wonderful, beautiful and strong woman her and her sister have become.  I applaud her for going where she went with the book and hope she can one day make a difference in the way the gymnastic world has allowed Marta and Bela to rule.  Congrats and my love to Dominique!!!!
B007P6VLRS|4.0|Is this a Smashing Pumpkins album?  Or is this a Billy Corgan album?  Jimmy Chamerlain, the band's only original member (asides from Corgan) left in 2009, and all of the original members have been replaced with a new band.  Given that Corgan has been the leading creative force of the band since its inception, would it even make a difference if he were the only surviving member of the band?  Nervous fans can relax -- this latest album, OCEANIA, is a return to form for the band and is better than 2007's [[ASIN:B00122J30S ZEITGEIST]] by leaps.  OCEANIA is compiled of tracks that came from the 44-track TEARGARDEN BY KALEIDYSCOPE project that Corgan has been working on, so this an \\"album-within-an-album\\" in many ways; even though this album is part of a larger whole, it is distinctly its own entity.  This album feels more like a comeback album than ZEITGEIST ever did, and it's been worth the wait.<br /><br />Opening track \\"Quasar\\" reminds us of \\"Cherub Rock\\" and its own blistering introduction.  Many of the tracks on OCEANIA recall the past Smashing Pumpkins songs, but don't confuse that as being unoriginal.  Instead, it feels like this album was made by a man who now embraces his band's past, unlike ZEITGEIST, which tried to blaze its own trail.  The guitar instrumentation here is exciting, but Corgan keeps us on our toes by including a variety of instruments in the mix (synthesizers, cello, piano, acoustics, etc...) The addition of bassist Nicole Fiorentino proves to be a great addition to the band, providing a solid bass and a great harmony.<br /><br />\\"Violet Rays\\" is a slow-burning synthesizer-tinged ballad that melts into its own fading distortion.  This same timbre is used later in the introduction to \\"Pinwheels.\\"  \\"My Love is Winter,\\" seems to be an early fan favorite: a song reminiscent of Corgan's work with Zwan on [[ASIN:B0022WG2N8 MARY STAR OF THE SEA]].  The title track \\"Oceania\\" is a multi-song medley, reminiscent of something a band like Porcupine Tree would try to pull off; it's spacey, and it leads us in strange unexpected directions.  The final track \\"Wildflower\\" is a quiet track, marked by sampled-loops of strings before giving slightly to electronic fuzz.  It brings a good close to an album that works as a coherent whole.<br /><br />Corgan reminds us of all the elements that made the Pumpkins so great: blistering guitars, creative songwriting (breadth and depth), heart-on-the-sleeve lyrics, and wild dynamics.  The only real disappointment that OCEANIA carries is its lack of catchy, melodic hooks.  While this album is consistently good, there's no single song that feels as enduring as \\"1979\\" or \\"Bullets with Butterfly Wings\\" for example (not that I'm asking Corgan to rewrite those songs).  Instead, OCEANIA works great as a cohesive whole album.  It feels as if instead of trying to reimagine his band for a new generation, Corgan has created an album that remembers the past but pushes forward to new territory.<br /><br />Fans of the Smashing Pumpkins (even if its just a handful of their songs) should love this release.  I would recommend this album to anyone with an interest in early 90's alternative rock music.  Highlight songs to sample: \\"Panopticon,\\" \\"The Chimera,\\" \\"Quasar\\" and \\"Violet Rays.\\"  OCEANIA is the Smashing Pumpkins album we've been waiting for, and it fits well along the likes of SIAMESE DREAM, GISH, and MELLON COLLIE.ld try to pull off; it's spacey, and it leads us in strange unexpected directions.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|So I didn't know anything about these books, or the author.  I was perusing the Kindle sci-fi section, and looking for highly rated books, and stumbled on the Wool Omnibus edition.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I think these stories are really facinating.  Hugh Howey really creates an interesting world, and does a spectacular job of slowly unfolding the secrets of a mostly destroyed future earth.  It's easy to get attached to the main characters, and the tension created amongst the characters makes you not want to put the book down.  I read that Mr Howey is self published, and to that I say \\"bravo!\\"  I hope your finally doing well after creating some really riveting stories.  I look forward to reading more of your books!
B0086700CM|5.0|My entire family loves this game. I have enjoyed running the course, sometimes I find myself turning my body like am in the game.  Good way to pass time for sure. Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I saw this on Youtube by chance and after seeing how it's played I gave it a shot, once it shipped it got here fast and I gave it a few goes. I gotta say it's fun,quick and simple, so simple my grandma who has trouble keeping up with all the new games and things I'm into can play it with me so that's something to say since we can't play alot of games together that aren't board games. It's also slightly educational in the fact that it can help teach addition by adding up shotgun blasts and brains. Good going makers of this one, I look forward to the add-on I bought to go with it.
B0083VE37Y|4.0|Kylie Minogue has been around for a long time.  Her first single, \\"The Loco-Motion\\" was released in 1988, and similar to Madonna, she has stuck around.  Her most recent single, [[ASIN:B0087DVGMS Timebomb]] isn't represented in this compilation, but most of her other modern work is.  This collection marks her career's 25-year anniversary, with a Greatest Hits tour coming soon.  Interestingly, late 2012 will include an \\"anti-tour\\" where Minogue plays B-Sides and rarities -- I expect we will see a B-Side/Rarities compilation to launch that tour as well.<br /><br />After completing what EMI calls \\"an exhaustive marketing survey,\\" the label created this Greatest Hits collection based on what the public wanted.  Accordingly, many of the songs here have been culled from more recent times (rather than her early work in the 80's).  Many early hits (\\"Hand on Your Heart\\" for example) are absent here. Songs from her DECONSTRUCTION album are conspicuously missing (represented only by \\"Confide in Me\\").  Because these songs were taken by public vote, fan favorites like \\"What Do I Have To Do?\\" \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow\\" (the duet with Nick Cave) and \\"Shocked\\" didn't make it on to this release.  Because this is the most current Greatest Hits (and the songs were picked by a more modern audience), THE BEST OF KYLIE MINOGUE serves as a fantastic place to start for new listeners.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  There is another edition of this release: the CD/DVD combo edition.  The content is largely the same except for an additional DVD that captures each song's respective music video.  If you like that kind of visual bonus, I'd recommend people to check it out: [[ASIN:B007WA56SC The Best of Kylie Minogue (CD/DVD)]].

B005SZNZAY|5.0|Wow! What a singer, I just think this is an awesome performance by Chris Cornell. As mentioned above We need another disc of this awesome performance. Probably the only thing that I did not like was the stops in between songs. This is probably because this is a culmination of multiple shows. I am ok with that anyway. The album makes up for that any old how!  And what a set list. Love his Lennon song Imagine! Thanks Chris, you found another huge fan my friend! Good Day..........

If you aren't interested in the music videos, check out [[ASIN:B007WA56OQ The Best of Kylie Minogue]]; it's a bit cheaper.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game because you can play all types of games almost at once. But what I don't like is that you have to get a certain amount of points to get new games.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Fun, challenging, diverse. This is a great puzzle that keeps your brain working the whole time. I can play for five minutes at a time or for an hour-either way this is a great time killer!
1401223176|5.0|Jeph Loeb once again does a great job of writing an epic Batman tale and Jim Lee's artwork is nothing short of beautiful. If you liked the old the story lines of Batman: The Animated Series and the graphical art from any of the Batman Arkham games then you won't be disappointed with this phenomenal graphic novel!

B005IZLPMY|4.0|Captain America (created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby) has long been one of my favorite superheroes. As a matter of fact, I would go as far as to put him up there with the \\"Big Three\\": Superman, Batman and Spider-Man. So, needless to say, I was quite stoked when 2011's \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" was first announced.<br /><br />Still shots released in March of 2011 in \\"USA Today\\" only further whetted my appetite to see this movie. Even before the still were released, the news that actor Chris Evans had signed to play the lead role had me excited about this movie; Having seen Evans in \\"Cellular\\" and the two \\"Fantastic Four\\" films, I have always believed he was \\"the right role\\" away from being an A-list actor in Hollywood. \\"Captain\\", and this year's \\"Avengers\\", have brought him (in my opinion) even closer to the aforementioned status.<br /><br />Evans is surrounded with an exceptional cast. The lovely Hayley Atwell is Peggy Carter, Cap's superior office and love interest. Academy Award winner, Tommy Lee Jones is Col. Chester Phillips (Cap's CO). Sebastian Stan and Dominic Cooper play Bucky Barnes (Cap's best friend) and Howard Stark (Iron Man's dad), respectively.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci (Dr. Abraham Erskine), Samuel L. Jackson (Sgt. Nick Fury) and Hugo Weaving, as the film's villian: Nazi Red Skull, round out this exceptional cast.<br /><br />The film is set in the midst of World War II. The Nazis have a secret organization, HYDRA, that collects and analyzes mystic artifacts in order to use them as weapons against the Allied Forces. A glowing blue, cubed object, known as the Tesseract (and, as we know from the other Avenger movies, was once owned by the god Odin) is Red Skull's mission: to harness and control the unimaginable power of it for the Nazis.<br /><br />Captain America's mission is to stop him.<br /><br />But, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Captain America is Steve Rogers. A young man from Brooklyn who wants more than anything to join the Army and fight the nazi menace. But he is too frail to join: he attempts to several times but keeps getting the dreaded 4-F (unfit for combat).<br /><br />However, what he lacks in size, he more than makes up for in heart, courage and intelligence. This is recognized by Dr. Abraham Erskine, creator of the super soldier serum, who handpicks Rogers as the soldier to receive it. Dr. Erskine gets Cap, er, Rogers admitted into the Army and after Rogers shows his bravery and intelligence, he receives the serum.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a nazi intelligence officer manages to kill Dr. Erskine and destroy the serum, so Captain America is destined to be the only recipient of it. With this powerful soldier under their command, the US Army decides to keep him off the battlefields and use him instead to raise money at home for the war effort.<br /><br />Cap finally gets a break. While overseas, \\"entertaining\\" the troops (they aren't buying: \\"bring back the girls!\\"), Cap sneaks away with a regiment and safely brings back a captured United States squad.<br /><br />Now, with the powers that be, and the US soldiers firmly behind him, Cap leads successful assault after assault, all throughout Europe, on the Nazis...leading to a dramatic confrontation with the Red Skull for control of the Tesseract.<br /><br />I will not reveal what happens in Cap's confrontation with the Red Skull...but I will say this: The movie ends with Captain America standing in the midst of Times Square, in present day (2011) America. Sgt. Nick Fury shows up to explain just how he got here.<br /><br />Furthermore, I'll say this...the beginning of the movie also gives away the fact that Cap is going to be transported from the 1940's into present-day America...even the movie's trailers show Cap in Times Square talking to Nick Fury.<br /><br />This is my main concern with this film. It is quite entertaining, but because you know Cap is going to wind up in the present day, it is a bit deflating. Cap has a blossoming romance going with Peggy Carter, but you know it isn't meant to be...unless somehow she also ends up in present day America for 2014's scheduled, \\"Captain America 2\\".<br /><br />The movie's other problem is that its ending is rushed, which is a shame because the movie's pace builds very well (they particularly do a great job of pacing with Cap's origin story) but then, boom!--The movie's over. Due to this, I have to rate the movie at 3.5 stars, and I'll round to four for my official rating. If this had been a \\"stand-alone\\" movie with a better ending (and not just a vehicle for Marvel to introduce Captain America's character for this year's mega-blockbuster, \\"The Avengers\\"), I think its score might have been somewhere along the lines of 9 out of 10.<br /><br />At least, thankfully, the movie does keep Captain America true to his roots: God and country; and VERY patriotic...and does so in a way that does not come off as \\"cheesy\\".  Because of this (and because of an exceptional performance from an equally exceptional cast), in spite of the movie's one glaring flaw, it still can be termed a success. And, worth a look.<br /><br />A few more notes:<br /><br />The visuals in this movie are stunning. The streets of Brooklyn have a grainy, \\"browned page,\\" pulp-ish look to them. Also, early on in the movie, Steve (pre-Cap) and Bucky, along with their dates, visit the World's Fair and it looks nothing short of beautiful as it smoothly melds together a futuristic and 1940's look. On the big screen, I thought the firework filled sky at the World's Fair looked nothing short of breathtaking.<br /><br />The scenes of Captain America in action in Europe are nothing short of spectacular, too. Cap, in his powder-blue suit--which blends so well into the snowy fields and woods used for battle backgrounds--looks very, very sharp. In particular, there is a scene where Cap and his men rappel onto the top of a speeding Nazi train (again, with the same snowy background) that only the big screencan do justice to.<br /><br />Kudos to Director Joe Johnston, a George Lucas protege, for doing an outstanding job with the look and feel of this movie...I only imagine what he could have done if the material given to him hadn't been limited...<br /><br />Thank you for reading.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Special Features<br /><br />Disc One includes the Blu-Ray disc; a short with the \\"Avengers' \\" Clark Gregg (very funny in this as well) entitled, \\"A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to Thor's Hammer\\"; An \\"Avengers\\" featurette; Six more feaurettes; an excellent commentary with director Joe Johnston, Director of Photography Shelly Johnson and Editor Jeffrey Ford.<br /><br />Disc Two contains the film's dvd version plus a digital copy for your computer or portable device.<br /><br />From the blu-ray case: Disc 1: Blu-ray Feature Film-1080p High Definition-English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio-French 5.1 Dolby Digital/Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital/Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital-English Audio Description-Subtitles: English, English SDH, French Spanish Portuguese<br /><br />Disc 2: DVD Feature Film-Widescreen Version Enhanced for 16.9 TVs-English 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround-Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese-Closed Captioned-Digital Copy Feature Film-English<br /><br />Captain America: The First Avenger<br /><br />Directed by Joe Johnston<br /><br />Released in 2011 by Marvel Studios; 123 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 \\"For intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action\\"
B007SPN5MA|5.0|Just because the Swell Season is taking a break doesn't mean you shouldn't expect its members to keep making music.  Marketa Irglova released her solo album, Anar, in 2011, and now it's Glen Hansard's turn.  RHYTHM AND REPOSE offers a lot of what Swell Season fans love: heartbreaking lyrics, beautiful vocal delivery, and confident instrumentation.  The biggest difference with this solo release is Hansard's delivery; this record is much quieter in its tone than the past two Swell Season albums.<br /><br />RHYTHM AND REPOSE is an exercise in constrained, quiet beauty.  The emotional, acoustic/stringed pattern that opening track \\"You Will Become,\\" begins is a throughline that the album follows from start to finish.  The song \\"High Hope\\" (along with the climax of \\"Bird of Sorrow,\\") showcases Hansard's raw vocal intensity.  Irglova even appears on a handful of tracks to compliment with harmonies.  This album isn't great become of what it adds, but rather, it's from what it's missing.  By lending itself to a minimalist style, this collection of songs sounds confident and tasteful.  The penultimate track \\"Philander,\\" for example, has scarce instrumentation in the verse, making Hansard's quiet verses even more effective.  If anything, RHYTHM AND REPOSE is remarkably consistent - there's not a bad song in the mix.  This album further solidifies Hansard's stature as one of the best songwriters currently working.  Like the Swell Season's catalog, Hansard's solo outing deserves more than one listen - repeated visits to RHYTHM AND REPOSE reveal nuance that go unnoticed the first few listens.  It's a great album to close your eyes and drift away in.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the Swell Season (or any of Hansard's other work), Neutral Milk Hotel, M. Ward, or Damien Rice.  Highlight songs to sample: \\"You Will Become,\\" \\"Maybe Not Tonight,\\" and \\"Philander.\\"  This has been one of my favorite listens of 2012.  RHYTHM AND REPOSE is a great solo album - let's hope it finds the audience it deserves.dience it deserves.

B0080R7P8A|5.0|This collection of \\"lost music\\" from many hours of unreleased tapes is aimed squarely at fans of CAN, and  \\"...what was distilled presents a secret, psychotropically-charged history of this most legendary of groups...\\".  All the dark, spacey, magical, funk sounds  the band is known for run all through this collection.  Beginning from the band's early years-both \\"vocalists\\" Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki, are here.  Mooney shows up on a number of early tracks until he left for the U.S. in late 1969, whereupon Suzuki enters the picture.  As usual, their voices are more of another instrument used to help color the band's sound.  And these unreleased tapes (taken from 50 hours of recordings) of the band at work (something like intuitive jamming)) show that CAN never lost it's edge.<br /><br />This set is a combination of unused soundtrack music, live tracks, and rehearsal tapes.  And everything has been put together (especially the soundtrack stuff) to create an impact of sound and feeling.  This collection of tracks  isn't like other box sets from bands from the past, with the usual alternate takes and demos.  This is, for all intents and purposes, a \\"new\\" release from CAN.  Even live tracks  \\"Spoon\\" and \\"Mushroom\\" are different from what we've heard before.  And the impact of the music has the feel of something new.  The sound is very good-clean and clear from the low end of Czukay's bass to the upper reaches of Schmidt's keyboards-and typically intense when needed, with that deep cosmic funk of the rhythm section underneath almost everything.<br /><br />The outer, stiff, hinged lidded cardboard box (that looks like an old studio recording tape box) measures 10\\"X 10\\" and lists the tracks and recording dates on the back of the box.  The 26 page booklet is just a bit smaller than the box.  Each disc sits (unprotected) in a cutout underneath the booklet.  But at least there's a \\"fingerhold\\" to help get the discs out of the individual cutouts.  The liner notes are by Irmin Schmidt, and are in both English and German, and have the look of an old typewriter style font-helping to create an atmospheric whole-along with the outer box graphics.  There's also an essay by Ian Harrison on the \\"lost tapes\\".  Of great interest is an analysis (usually just a few sentences) of the music by Schmidt, which adds to the understanding of the various tracks.  One page is devoted to \\"Recording Information\\", which is helpful if you're so inclined.  The graphics in the booklet are very similar to the outer box, but include photographs of the band and parts of their studio.  For whatever it means (if anything) there's a sticker that says \\"Limited Edition\\" on the front of the box.<br /><br />The 30 tracks (from 1968 through 1977) begin from the band's early days (\\"Millionenspiel\\"), and show the band (still named INNER SPACE) even then had that deep, throbbing, rhythmic sound.  The free jazz style drumming of Liebezeit, and the deep bass sounds of Czukay are already in place, and you can almost feel their combined sound.  Helped along with some saxophone playing from Gerd Dudek (from the avant garde band of Manfred Schoof), this is \\"CAN music\\" as fans know it before Mooney joined the band.  Early CAN member David Johnson is on flute.<br /><br />And listen to the \\"spontaneous live composition\\", \\"Waiting For The Streetcar\\", which is an extended, almost brutal track with the spontaneous vocals leading the way into the band's intuitive style of playing.  Likewise \\"Deadly Doris\\", another \\"spontaneous composition\\" that shows CAN in their element-playing almost intuitively.  \\"Obscura Primavera\\" proves the band could play delicately (\\"we were just plain nice\\") with the band using Schmidt's keyboards and Karoli's guitar in a more ethereal style.  But there are many examples throughout this set of their \\"magical\\" playing abilities.<br /><br />Personally I was hoping for more live tracks (as opposed to live in the studio), but they're great examples of the live CAN experience.  \\"Spoon\\" is here, along with another well known composition, \\"Mushroom\\".  And from 1973, \\"One More Saturday Night\\" is also heard live.  As the band often does, they take a familiar composition like \\"Spoon\\", and reconfigure it (\\"themes, riffs, and melodies were barely recognizable\\") in the moment.  \\"Mushroom\\" finds the band in typically fine form, playing in and around this CAN highlight.  But equally visceral is \\"Abra Cada Braxas\\" (among other tracks), with the band upping the intensity with their intuitive way of working spontaneously.  With \\"A Swan Is Born\\" (\\"a fragment of the work on Sing Swan Song\\" with Suzuki) the group turns down the intensity, and uses (once again) Czukay's bass and Schmidt's keyboards to weave a melodic pattern of sounds that has a certain, gentle beauty to it.  This is where CAN proves that their music isn't all about intensity, but using a gentle melody (with Suzuki's voice as an another instrument) to deliver something of great beauty.<br /><br />\\"Dead Pigeon Suite\\" is an edited (and satisfying) fragment of a track from the band's soundtrack work, with ethereal flute and a typical funky rhythm pattern from Czukay and Liebezeit.  \\"On The Way To Mother Sky\\" (another fragment), which fans have heard previously on the album \\"Soundtracks\\" (as the 14 minute  \\"Mothersky\\" from the movie \\"Deep End\\"), makes good use of Karoli's guitar and Liebzeit's drumming.  \\"Messers Scissors, Fork, And Light\\", another piece of soundtrack work,  makes good use of Schmidt's lighter keyboard sound.  The soundtrack pieces have more of an impact collectively rather than as stand alone pieces, and this track has several pieces combined into a suite.  Like other tracks here, these soundtrack pieces are taken from longer jamming pieces-which is how much of this collection was put together-aimed at maximum impact and a kind of cohesiveness.  In some respects the soundtrack pieces work better than other stand alone tracks with the band showing their use of space and an aggressiveness that's very satisfying.<br /><br />Apparently this is the last release of period CAN music.  Even when rehearsing/jamming, the band would take out portions of their recordings that they felt had worth, and disregard the rest.  And that's what they've done here.  Out of many hours of music, these pieces have been shaped into a good representation of the band's sound.  If this is to be the last we hear from CAN, they've left us with some of their best, deepest, throbbing, visceral yet sometimes gentle  music.  Listening to all three discs in one sitting can be quite an experience-especially the first time through.  That their music is still contemporary, still exciting and important shows that they were indeed ahead of their time.  And playing \\"catch-up\\" with these lost tapes, makes for an exciting, satisfying trip deep into someplace only CAN would go. Longtime fans buy with confidence.perience.  \\"Spoon\\" is here, along with another well known composition, \\"Mushroom\\".  And from 1973, \\"One More Saturday Night\\" is also heard live.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Short Review:<br />For fans EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE's darker side (perhaps more so of the leaked Jon Brion mixes), Fiona Apple's newest release will not disappoint.  It continues the strange, creative journey that Apple started in the 90's but offers unexpected twists and turns.  It may not be pretty, but it is sincerely and beautifully crafted.  This album is one of the best of 2012.<br /><br />Long Review:<br />Fiona Apple's instrumentation has always been minimal, usually consisting of pianos, bass guitars, drumkits, and a few other accompanying session players.  This album however, feels bare-bones.  While critics of EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE point to the album's production interfering with Apple's original intention, THE IDLER WHEEL.... feels like an open response to it.  It feels like everything unnecessary has been stripped back until the only thing left is raw emotion and artistic intuition.  Compare this with EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE, an album that sounded slick, polished, and glossy.  This album isn't always pretty, but it sure is powerful.  While she's never been known for her shyness, THE IDLER WHEEL... feels like her most confident and sure-handed album to date.<br /><br />THE IDLER WHEEL.... (42:39) opens with the lead single \\"Every Single Night.\\"  This song, much like EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE's opener, feels like a mission-statement of sorts.  \\"Every Single Night\\" sets the mood for the album.  It's tribal, primal, minimalist, and dark.  In the lyrics, Apple describes her creative process being a source of pain, uneasiness, and insecurity.  \\"Valentine\\" is a dark and seductive love (or out-of-love) song, complimented by low strings -- there's a sense of urgency in this song (as well as others) that makes what feels like an accessible song into an uncomfortable squirm.  \\"Regret\\" is dischordant and atonal at times; Apple unexpectedly turns to yell a guttural rasp in the chorus.  THE IDLER WHEEL is full of these moments; the songwriting never feels sloppy however, her anger manifests itself starkly in these shifts away from convention.  Most of the songs here are minimalistic; often, songs consist of only vocals, a piano, and jazz drumming.  This stripped down approach makes THE IDLER WHEEL feel even more personal than previous Apple records.  The album ends with \\"Hot Knife,\\" a song that defies any easy genre.  Mostly an acapella arrangement, it's catchy, bizarre, and sexy -- it wraps up the spectacular album on a note that is both completely unexpected and completely necessary.<br /><br />You can currently find this album available for streaming in its entirety on NPR's \\"First Listen\\" section.  Fans of Tori Amos, Ani DiFranco, Patti Smith, or Regina Spektor will find a lot here to love.  Recommended tracks to sample: \\"Every Single Night,\\" \\"Hot Knife,\\" \\"Jonathon,\\" and \\"Valentine.\\"  These tracks will give listeners a good idea of what to expect from THE IDLER WHEEL.  For an album that's been in the making/shelved for 7-years, it feels remarkably fresh - this is one of the best albums of 2012.<br /><br />This album also comes with a Deluxe Edition.  The Deluxe Edition of THE IDLER WHEEL ( [[ASIN:B007VTVGFQ The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do (Deluxe Version)]] ) comes with the album, an additional DVD of 5 live videos from South by Southwest (only two of these songs appear on the album), a poster of the album, and a small book with lyrics and doodles from Apple.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. It is fun, challenging, and addicting! It is great game for all ages. Can keep a fiddler busy for hours!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Does everything it promises and more, with style! I look forward to every update to see what new feature they have included.
B0080R7Q70|4.0|After a long hiatus and a couple of slightly disappointing albums The Flower Kings return with a strong effort. Not least thanks to the fact that they finally have found the perfect substitute for Zoltan Cs&ouml;rsz on the drums. In the form of the young German Felix Lehrman who is nothing short of brilliant. Dancing around the odd metres and a perfect combination of prog and fusion drumming.<br /><br />Ofc we all know that Roine Stolt, Jonas Reingold and Thomas Bodin are world class virtuoses and if anything they have only become better - taking part in many different projects like Karmakanic and Agents Of Mercy - during the 6 years break. And also the vocal parts have improved, the harmonies tighter and more varied.<br /><br />A 25 min.long suite in classic F.K. style, \\"Numbers\\" and a bunch of shorter songs. The usual Stolt lyrics with their (understandably) gloomy outlook of the world of today though sprinkled with some hope of healing and inner transformation. Influences from Genesis, Yes and Procol Harum and a broad spectre from jazzrock to heavy.<br /><br />Everything a prog and F.K. fan can dream of. It's just that they don't really come up with anything you haven't heard before. Definitely refined once again, but not breaking any new ground.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|This album is so well done it is hard to find any one thing to point out.  The writing is fantastic. her voice has the grit of a real soul singer with a British sophistication, yet a hardship overcome.

0099579936|1.0|I chose to purchase/waste money on all 3 of the books. I, like everyone else, wanted to read what was the topic of parent groups and what was so bad that many libraries were banning it.<br />The storyline is based upon Christian Grey, an athletic hunk who travels the world, is a concert pianist, is a BILLIONAIRE, dresses and smells amazing, has amazing eyes, owns tons of businesses, has a house staff to wait on him, oh yeah- he is the pilot of his own helicopter, and glider...too! Let's not forget his yacht. Along with these material items, he happens to be obsessed with and \\"cannot survive without\\" the other character, shy, mousy, virginal Anastasia Steele.<br />The whole 3 books are written around them whispering to each other, her biting her lip, them sending snarky texts and him supposedly showing her what a real man is like in bed. Chains, whips, handcuffs, body cavity....devices.... and all!<br />The writing reminded me of when my friends and I were in high school and would make up the ultimate guy.<br />With all that being said, the writing was awful. Some people compared it to porn and I can see their view. A lot of sex and a little story. Refund please! lol

And if I'm creeped out, then I'm not reading it to my child.<br /><br />I would also like to add that my 6-year-old niece asked my mother not to read this to her anymore because it made her sad. Then she asked about death. So this seals the deal for me.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|I love this 'newer' version of Live at Fillmore East concerts.My ears are too fried to hear any difference in sound,so excuse me for not dabbling in technical recording jargon.Not that it would matter,I play music LOUD! What can an Allman Brother fan/junkie say about this record/cd that hasnt been said already? Its my favorite live album by far and with the 'new' songs added on i'm in 7th heaven.If they had added on Dreams to this my head would have exploded/imploded? Its hard to believe this was all orginally recorded live 40 years ago.It has been in my collections lp/cassette/8track/cd for all 40.Get it however you can and let the Brothers noodle your inner Boo-Boo... EAT A PEACH!
B007N85POS|2.0|I love the regular AB Rio edition but do not recommend the HD version for anyone that has less than perfect vision. Everything is so tiny, you can hardly see anything. Wish I would have read more of the reviews before I purchased,
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ummmm sure its great (I'm only doing this to get bonus points) its alright I guess I'm just bored right now so ya enjoy!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Definitely my favorite book!  I was a little hesitant before purchasing because I thought it might be geared towards a younger age group, but it was just perfect.  Such an easy, quick read.  I absolutely could not put this book down for the life of me.  Oh yeah and I read it twice.  Please comment with any post Beautiful Disaster book suggestions!
B001I0T92Q|1.0|Im sad with this adapter, because it never works, my advice is first try before to buy with this kind of devices. Really I think this item does not deserve one star.
B0086700CM|4.0|its cool. I thought the graphics would be better on the kindle. saw the game on a phone and the graphics were way better. kindle should have better pixels.
B000UU4NE4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It has everything in it that you can ask for, drama, romance, suspense, thriller, humanitarian.  I am sure I have left something out.  But this movie is awesome for children, teens and adults.  The special effects are awe inspiring and so so believable.  It makes you almost want to try and find that special spider.  Usually, sequels flop or do not measure up to the first one.  But I can see many more Spider Man movies spinning off of the original if written like this.  This is a must for your library!<br /><br />E'Lee
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game. I compete with my husband and he plays on iPad., i play on kindle.Kindle's update always behind the ipad's. If kindle is getting update same time like ipod., my game will be perfect.
B0076UXKDG|5.0|Yes, this unit is a bit overpriced, but the construction and operation are flawless.<br /><br />When this unit is attached, the combo feels as solid as an integral larger body like a D3s/D3x or D4.<br /><br />Further, at present, when the EN-EL15 is either unavailable or only available at confiscatory prices, the fact that the grip allows you to use a set of AAs (alkaline, lithium or rechargeable) to power the camera is invaluable.<br /><br />If you REALLY want long life you can also purchase the new tray and door required to use the D4's EN-EL18 battery and really add per-charge endurance to your D800.<br /><br />So it's a bit pricey for random whim purchase by amateurs and gadget freaks, but if you're a professional or advanced photographer who needs the additional functionality, the MB-D12 is rugged, feels great and is just what you would hope for in a real Nikon accessory.
