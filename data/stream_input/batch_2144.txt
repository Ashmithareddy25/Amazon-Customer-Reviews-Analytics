B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|It's after twenty years you can call it a classic right, well the remastered and live versions are as good as ever.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom is always a good author to read.  I would read any of his books, even if I did not know what they were about.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I wouldn't say I love this show but my kids do and as many times as I have seen it I have considered putting on a live performance of the show, Broadway style !
B005K01VZS|5.0|I enjoy every book from Mitch Albom.  I adore true stories and he always covers his writing honestly and meaningfully.
B00005JKNF|3.0|As a Brit film admirer and a Downton Abbey devotee, I recently found myself wondering how I had missed this one.  I had a dim memory of starting to watch it once when it was on TV but not making it very far.  After sitting through the whole thing, I am convinced that memory was accurate.<br /><br />Any film with a lot of characters is a challenge.  In this film some of the characters resemble each other, a lot of them dress similarly, and many of them have very few lines.  Also the dialogue is heavily accented and hard to understand.  I really hate to sound like the Ugly American, but I did not find this movie to be very accessible.  It was wonderful to see some of my favorite actors onscreen.  However, my brain was scrambling to translate dialogue and keep up with plot developments from start to finish.<br /><br />Now that I have made it through and am metaphorically out of breath, I feel I need to watch it again, to see some other favorites whom I didn't even recognize (Meg Wynn-Owen, Laurence Fox), but it's a daunting prospect. Maybe I'll see if there are English subtitles on the DVD, that might help.<br /><br />This film definitely has a lot to say on the subject of class in 1930s Britain.  I don't personally think it is a brilliant movie or even especially entertaining.  I would single out the performances of Maggie Smith, Kelly Macdonald, and Stephen Fry, but I am sure this was intended to be an ensemble effort with no standouts.  I have tremendous respect for all the fans of this film, suspecting they have done some work to \\"get\\" it.  I prefer films that are not such hard work.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A clever story line and an easy read.  I liked it and would read more of her work when looking for a novel.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I generally love super hero type shows. I particularly like Arrow because he is also very human and vulnerable. The acting is very good. I love the present day mystery and also all the flash-back to learn how he bacame the man he presently is.
B001QWBM62|4.0|and that's why I ordered another one after being happy with the first. Sound quality is nice and the surrounding mechanism used in the device to get sound from all possible angles and areas make it too sensitive to sounds even from far. They are using it to record lectures and it did a great job so far and they are so pleased with how easy and efficient is this device to use.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|does not work well in kindle, very difficult to access playlists,favorites or even search....would not recommend to anyone just google you tube
B0027MJU00|5.0|Had me wondering the whole time. Just when I thought I had figured it out, New evidence appeared and took it in a new direction. Awesome!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i have already had to reinstall Temple Run 2  3 times because every once in a while, this app decides to be syobborn and not open at all.  I have the kindle first generation/edition/whatever you want to call it
B005W0ARFQ|4.0|Good story. Shows the Nazi hierarchy as truly demented and creepy. Bernie is the damaged moral compass in a world gone mad.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I really like this game and the graphics are awesome but I saw the pictures for this app and there were things in the new update that actually wasn't there. On my Iphone the update is on there but its not here yet for some reason. I'm not going to play this app on here if there's no update soon. Shame on you Amazon!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I enjoyed it greatly and it is an easy read. It helps to understand the Greek Gods & Goddesses too.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I laughed so much I cannot even remember the last time I was this entertained. Ted's voice is the voices from &#34;Family Guy&#34; wrapped in a cute little fur suit. Funny and heart warming. It does not follow the pretencious regular Hollywood mold. This movie reminds me of my childhood buddies. LOVE THIS MOVIE. 5 STARS.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I really do like this game its a lot like Mario. The only thing about it that I don't like is if you keep your finger on the forward button it stops going forward.
0545265355|5.0|Very powerful story.  A futuristic Roman-style empire forces conquered nations to send children to fight as gladiators.  As a means of oppression, it seems to work -- until they draft a girl who discovers how to fight back.<br /><br />The portrayal of Katniss, the heroine and narrator, is the best thing in the books.  She has flaws -- for instance, she often misunderstands a situation when she first encounters it -- but that just makes her more realistic, and makes it easier to accept her virtues.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|When I play this game, I think of the joke, &#34;How do you get a little old lady to drop an F-bomb?&#34;  &#34;You get another little old lady to yell 'Bingo!'&#34;  I'm usually dropping F-bombs, but it is a fun game.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This triolgy set is amazing! Though I haven't read the 3rd yet (hasn't come out) would totally recommend this book to anyone who likes to read!:)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Yet another game I'm addicted to!  If a stalemate is reached, the game automatically reshuffles the tiles instead of ending the game.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual Harry was relentless in finding answers.I liked the book because it covered several avenues for him to explore in order to solve a cold case.Anyone that likes a good detective story will love this.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I had been dying to see this movie, and it did make me feel nostalgic, as I was in college during this time.  Russell Brand is especially funny, but the ending's a bit corny.
B009K86D86|5.0|Best movie to open your eyes to the reality of this world we live in. Changed everything I know. Be ready to re examine all your ideas about health and food.
1592407889|5.0|As I have always heard from very good sources Shirley McLaine is a very nasty person and cruelly ambitious -- it's well-known in Hollywood that all her \\"spiritual\\" stuff was just a ruse to make a buck. I have always disliked her as an actress and a personality, and this proves she is not a nice lady at all.
B00BBI9WD6|3.0|I gave his first a WOW, but this book his editor needed to reel back his overly descriptive passages. Since noone did that the author became even more descriptive. Boring chapters lead to bored readers.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love it,  We usually have a puzzle on the dining room table, it helps pass the winter months.  But this is my personal puzzle. one that I can take anywhere.  Love it.  Very colorful.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I'm not real fast with this game, but that's ok. It's fun spinning the cube around and sometimes it's hard to find a match!<br /><br />It would be nice if there was a score history in the app without having to link to wherever it is on the web (I chose not to use that).
B005ZUR724|4.0|I cannot talk on this game so I wish I could and its still good if anyone could tell me ill be happy
B006LRUVUA|5.0|This program works so well it's hard to believe it's free! I have it on my Kindle Fire, laptop and PC so I can access my desktop while I'm downstairs.<br /><br />It's a little hard to navigate on my Kindle, but that wasn't unexpected, and I wish the pointer were more visible but it runs very quickly and smoothly.<br /><br />It takes so little to entertain some people - I get a kick out of sitting at my computer with my Kindle and running stuff on my computer with the app on my Kindle &#60;g&#62;
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use. Keeps all my books in 1 place. Lots of free books to keep you reading in between purchases.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read.  This was a little different than his other books about Lawyers.  Would recommend it highly.  My husband liked it also.
B004SBX112|5.0|fun and addicting!! Angry Birds never fails!! My daughter plays the game all the time. Its Angry Birds enough said!!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This one is even better than the first one! Its also super long so really good for the eight bucks you spend on it!
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Wasn`t too happy about the movie, it was bit too much drama and not enough about her own life. The actor was wonderful.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book tops anything ive ever read and they are super long too which is good for your wallet. ENJOY!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I thought this was the best of Bond, But did they really had to kill &#34;M&#34;? She was wonderful in the series.
030758836X|5.0|Just as good as I heard that it was.  Being from Kansas City, it's good to see a KC author do so well.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|Love this album.  Reminds me so  much of my old Queen CDs I listened to growing up.  Fun group, great album.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I have read it many times one off my favorite go  to books I recommend it to all my friends
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun way to pass the time.<br />My son loves to play this game a lot. It's like he has a real horse lol
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Great series looking forward to season 2.  Very imaginative and funny.  I love science fiction.  i would recommend to anyone
B005IF5H2S|5.0|Lady A was at it again! A fantastic CD worth purchase by any country music fan. No complaints from me
B00AREIAI8|5.0|l think this is a very good and very fun but some times freezes. but still fun and still for 5 stars
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This a very good stress reliever. I could spend hours playing Angry Birds. I find it keeps my Brain Alert.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is for you horse lover's! It is so life like and it is such a great game I just started it today and I love it zoology much!
B0053O89IS|5.0|Bones has always been a TV series favourite of mine, and having the opportunity to review the series in dvd format is an added bonus.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game was awesome. I love being Ma. Play the game and you will see.<br />Get this game. Get this game.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Enjoy guessing. A lot of fun. More colors should be used for free. Give directions. What is needed for the points.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Such an interesting world is constructed in these pages!  You will not regret spending the money and time to get to know this book and it's characters.  A great read!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I need directions for this game. I do not understand what I am supposed to do. Gibe directions, give directions.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|A Quest of Heroes is the first of three books in a series that sets up a fantasy universe like many others, complete with a coming-of-age hero that finds out he is extraordinary in some way that was previously unknown.  The book is fine if you're 8-10 years old, but for anyone older the plot and characters are shallow and transparent.  I rolled my eyes so many times reading it, I almost didn't make it to the end.  Give it to your kid or younger sibling as an intro to fantasy and they should like it just fine.
1451695195|3.0|Dr. Alexander spent almost the entire book going  on and on about his personal life. My  interest was in knowing about his experiences while in Heaven, about which he wrote very little. A real disappointment.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Very entertaining! Awesome animation! Great story! It felt as if I was watching a live action movie! If you are into animated movies you should definitely watch this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are great and the new obstacles are too as well as being more challenging, I look forward to becoming better at this game.
B009JBZH54|5.0|THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY IS A MUST HAVE FOR BATMAN FANS. THIS SET IS AWESOME AND IN BLU-RAY, IT SHOWCASES THE MOVIES AS THEY SHOULD BE
B005HSL626|5.0|I absolutely love this game, I get a real kick out of it. A super fun way to pass the time.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Plague allows you choose from various levels of challenge (easy to hard) in order to develop a bacteria or virus that you must use to destroy all human life.  The modes of microbiological development and human transmission and symptomology are very realistic, so the game presents an ongoing challenge in terms of how to use your money (for blocking cures, developing resistance, promoting aggressive symptoms, etc?).  But the end goal is always the same:  create the plague before the humans create the cure.  You must be able to read the flashing headlines fairly quickly and keep up with the points of transmission or cure deployment, because failure to click on these flashpoints (kind of like &#34;whack-a-mole&#34; during some stages!) will cost you money!  Also, you must use your money wisely, because the funds do run out.
B007HACDLK|3.0|The premise is a stretch of the imagination, and the conclusion is not suprising or suspenseful.  Mr. Flynn has done better work.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wonder what Freud would have made of this lady. She certainly has a potty mouth. However, I quite enjoyed the trilogy and it is an easy read.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|So glad Rankin decided to bring back Rebus. Cold cases on steroids. Missed his crotchety style. Need more of him--keep him going, please.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Awesome a a a a a a a a a a a a as a a a a a as a and a an aka Ana Ana Ana
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I actually liked the Fifty Shades trilogy.  It's an unusual and offbeat story but intriguing, although a certain plot line gets a bit repetitious!  :)
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|My family and I have watched this movie many times!  Great acting and a good subject matter this day in age!  Denzel does his usual fantastic job.  It deals with a difficult topic in these stressful times, but does not chicken out when it comes to deliver the dose of reality at the end.  Thank you for another enjoyable movie night at our home!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Hard to conceive humans treat each other this way.  This is a quick but informative read I couldn't put down.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|The book was good for a quick laugh but too expensive for what you're getting. Lower the price and I'll give a better rating.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is great. You don't want to stop playing it when you start. Highly recommend this game if you like fast-paced challenging games.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Esta novela es larga, pero me mantuvo pegada a sus páginas de principio a fin. El escritor es súper inteligente, la trama excepcional. La recomiendo sin reservaciones. Definitivamente un trabajo de 5 estrellas.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|This had a nice story, and it wrapped up the themes introduced in the first show. The actual program was easier to watch.  I think there were more ouside scenes.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|LOVE LOST, MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF! lol, and was so happy to find the collectors edition at such a great price. GREAT ITEM, GREAT SELLER!
B004RUF9DC|5.0|Remember your parents making you watch this movie when you were just a little one? How you would shed so many tears during those dramatic moments? Well, this surely brought those memories back.
B00136JQMI|5.0|Some regard this as Miles Davis' greatest album. I am told it marks his departure from hard bop to modal jazz<br />While I vaguely understand the concept of modal based jazz, I have no problems digging the sound. This 1959<br />album is a great introduction to Davis if you don't know his music.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|John Palmer and the internet have turned home brewing into much more than just a fad or home hobby. Armed with the information in this book and recipes you can find on the web, you now have a viable alternative to buying expensive custom brews from the grocery store or your local brew pub. I've bottled a few batches since my purchase and cracked open my first few just recently and I have to say that using this book I was able to produce a quality product the very first try. The book starts off by giving you just enough information to jump right in and get er done, but later chapters give you details on not only what you are doing, but why it is important. This book is so valuable that I own it in paperback and electronic formats. If you are even thinking of brewing beer at home, BUY THIS BOOK FIRST! I promise you you will not be sorry, both in the decision you have made to brew your own beer, but also in investing in the time to buy and read this book.
B0011NVCSO|2.0|The music itself is wonderful, but the record pressing is among the worst in my collection. The surface noise is nearly as loud as the music, and often times distorts the vocals. I might've just gotten a bad apple, but purchase with caution.
B0049VZ222|4.0|I had to be talked into watching this show. I don't watch any sci-fi/horror types of shows. But I am pleasantly surprised. It sucked me in. Great story line. Good characters. I am already into S2. Give it a shot.
B004HW7JI8|4.0|Bought season 1 for my grandson & watched with him.  Now addicted & had to get season 2.  Plus we enjoy watching together. The 3rd disc kept skipping & stalling in one part but we were able to get through it.  Otherwise I would have given a perfect rating.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Best Bond ever!!! I highly recommend this movie to any Bond fan. It shows Bond's vulnerability which is a first.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app. easy to use, I like that you can exit out of the game and then come back where you left off
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|One of the best books I have read. Nicely written and deep words will make you think about your life.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|This was a gift for my musician husband who has always adored the Beatles and anything done by any of them. We have most of Paul's earlier recordings. This was good, not great
B0010SKSTO|1.0|It is written to sell. It could be a lot shorter and have the same amount of information. Never again.
B003274QH6|5.0|We don't watch TV, have no service but we do love watching movies and old TV shows. Everyone kept asking if we had seen this set so I bought it for my husband for Christmas. It has been hard to watch an episode at a time, we just wanted to gobble it up in one sitting. We have always loved Bryan Cranston, (used to watch Malcolm in the middle) and so we were blown away by this actor's growth- he is just wonderful. I don't like violent movies or TV shows, so this only works for me because of the humor and wit..really good series.
B002JWD6AS|2.0|The plot was just \\"OK\\", not incredibly interesting or imaginative. The very beginning of the book hooked the reader very well, but then the story quickly became like a Mary Sue type love story. The whole concept was a good one, but the delivery and story development fell short. Character development seemed uneven with most of the characters being underdeveloped and uninteresting. Sam and Grace were boring and predictable. The really interesting characters were either underdeveloped or not given enough time to become so. Perhaps the double first person point of view added to limited outside character development. The overall story seemed to drift around with no purpose other than to create teen angst and make the reader cry. That became tiring. I would have liked to see more of Shelby, Olivia and Isabel. I found the convenient constant absence of Grace 's parents unrealistic. It would have been better if the parental situation set up had been more imaginative (like a single mom, true negligence, and/or financial instability, etc.). This book just left me feeling lacking.
1577311523|5.0|I make a point to at least read part of this book each year. it has been a great help with learning to relax and just be.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was expecting more.  It was a good and interesting read though.  I would recommend it to my friends.  Read on.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|It was a movie that was filled with adventure wonder and captivated my imagination, I've always been a sucker for cartoons, but it was some thing about Tin Tin's perpescuity that sold it.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|The author had me spell bound until the very end of the book. A very interesting and most enjoyable read, a good story that had me guessing until the end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|There are many calculators to choose from but this one is great. I haven't had any issues with it and use it daily.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book is extremely well written and the story is very sad and heart wrenching. Giving the readers an insight into  a very little known knowledge as to France's involvement in the persecution of the jews . A very good read,
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this app is great I get all of my answers from this app. I like so you should like it too!
B006VJMZXY|5.0|An insight into how uneasy rests the head that wears the crown, and also how young the brides and grooms were and how marriage was made more for position rather than for love. It was not so long ago that the British believed in witches. the book is obviously based on historical fact and written in a way that still made it a very interesting read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down.  A wonderful story of heart ache and then finding true love.  I recommend it to everyone.  Nicholas Sparks puts so much feeling in his books.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A classic John Corey adventure. My only negative is the over abundance of wise cracks from Corey. Yes, his character is a wise cracking kind of guy,and maybe it's my imagination, but there seems to be alot more than i remember in all the other Corey books, especially in the beginning of the book.  But that in no way detracts from the 5 star rating I give this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Would have give the show a rating of 5 stars until they killed off Matthew. Maybe even less than 4.  Not sure I care about watching future shows. The actor and the character was a primary reason for enjoying the show.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome game! worthy successor to temple run 1. much better than temple run brave! well worth the price! you will love this game.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Love this cd.  It is the most relaxing, feel good music.  &#34;Iz&#34; was an extremely talented man and a great loss to the world of music and Hawaii.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just got a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas and wanted to try out how ease it would be to use so tried with this game.<br /><br />It is easy to play . Still learning a lot but love the Kindle
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This was a pretty fun game.  Not too hard and not too easy.  If you are stuck click on tie notebook and select the hint Icon in the lower left hand corner; I was almost thru the 2nd half of the game before I realized it was available.
B004UID2LC|1.0|When I opened this is suddenly did not look like the YouTube logo so I deleted it without opening it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|this is my type of show.  Have to admit when i saw the pilot wasn't sure if i was going to continue but when the pilot ended i had to keep watching.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Here's my short amd sweet.  It's worth renting-it's a quality movie. I would never purchase it to \\"watch again.\\"  Denzel's portrayal is deep, dark & tortured.  The movie was not what I was expecting...so I think I spent the first part of the movie trying to figure out what kind of movie it was going to be and I wasn't as engrossed as I could have been.  Oh & BTW, the morons who gave this movies a 1 star due to language & nudity.....really need to look up what \\"Rated R\\" means!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wonderful game.  Addicting and challenging.  You will not want to stop, you will go on and on.  Reminds me of the old Pipe creator game.
B0000T6JGU|4.0|I love Let it Be and I love the Beatles. I had a copy of the original that I borrowed from my sister. I already owned Naked on CD, but I wanted the vinyl. I was a bit disappointed that Naked doesn't have the little extra bits that the original album has... John's weird skatting and such. The little 7&#34; extra record is pretty neat, but I'd rather have the original. Oh well.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a really addictive game.  Quite challenging.  This would be a 5 star if there was a way to keep a record of best times.  It keeps the best time for you to beat but not a list of best scores.  Great game though.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Got here quick,and worked like Hipe said it would. It's good on batteries ,lights up a good area. Great for those who need a little help getting down a hallway in a strange house when your a guest.  Absolutely super great when the power goes out.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|No closed captioning makes it very difficult for me to follow the dialogue and ultimately the story line. Not that the story line is that complicated but I do like to use the close captioning since many movies today have a lot of mumbling in them for some reason, makes it more realistic I suppose.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Great script and direction. Also, good as a period piece. Succeeds in building edge of the chair suspense. It truly belongs with the other excellent movies vying for the Oscars.
B00973902K|5.0|Just had to have it.  Very upbeat.  I love the downloads from Amazon.  It Mmakes it easy to buy music.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I GAVE THE BOOK A 3 STAR AS I FELT IT WAS O.K. AND HAS HISTORICAL SIGNIFANCE BUT IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT READ.  THE PROSE IS LONG AND YOU CAN GET LOST IN THE DESCRIPTIVE PHRASES AND LOSE THE TRACK OF THE STORY.  IT MOVES VERY SLOW.  ALSO THE BOOK IS DEPRESSING.  THIS IS ONE SAD BOOK SO DON'T READ IT IF YOU WANT AN UPLIFTING MOOD TO BE THE RESULT.  IT IS INTERESTING IN SOME WAY BUT IT IS TRAGEDY!<br />SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A LONG READ AND ARE PREPARED FOR THE &#34;DOWN&#34; FEELING THIS BOOK RESULTS IN WELL O.K.
0689853637|5.0|This was a gift for my grandchild who loves pop up books.  He seems to love it and reads it often.
0765325950|5.0|This is definitely one of those hate it or love it books, as is clear from all of the one and five star reviews. And honestly, all things considered, what else could you expect from a series of this magnitude. I will admit that I am biased because i love Brandon Sanderson's writing, but this book is quite a masterpiece.<br /><br />Of course, some people will be upset because they have been imagining the end for 10, 15, even 20 years, and it is not anything like they imagined. People will be upset because Brandon Sanderson is not Robert Jordan, no matter how hard he tried to mimic his writing. People will be upset because some characters did not play a big role, because plot lines were tied up quickly, or because scenes dragged on way too long. It is inevitable.<br /><br />The reason i think this book is a masterpiece is because of how well it turned out, despite how difficult it must have been to write. Brandon Sanderson had to take twenty years of books, dozens upon dozens of characters, and too many plot lines and sub-plots to count and put them all neatly into one book that satisfied as many people as possible. Bravo!<br /><br />If you enjoy Brandon Sanderson's writing, this book is right up your ally. If you are able to enjoy books by letting them take you for a ride, allowing an author to guide you in a fantastical journey without worrying to much about where you are going and why your not taking the route you would have chosen, then get ready for one hell of a ride! If you have read through all the other books in the Wheel of Time series and have enjoyed them all despite any shortcomings, I do not see why this one should be any different. If you have been repeatedly let down by some of the books, or dislike how the series has changed since Brandon Sanderson has taken over, then you probably wont like this book and I am not sure why you are still reading the series anyway.<br /><br />It would have been impossible for Brandon Sanderson to make a book that made everyone happy. People are too dissimilar. With that in mind, Brandon Sanderson does an amazing job of wrapping up the series and giving the fans a wonderful piece of fantasy that can be enjoyed and cherished.

B00BETX5PS|4.0|Great  movie, locations and chase scenes. 007 on his game!  Javier Bardem plays an outstanding bad guy. We are introduced to the players who will be the future of the franchise playing Moneypenny,&#34;M&#34; and &#34;Q&#34;
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very fun and captivating.  Fun to match all the different cube designs.  Always surprised at how many layers of cubes there are.  Fun to spin and tip to get new matches.
030758836X|5.0|Amazing story, but in the end, we realize that there's a part of ourself in each character and that their relationship isn't so different than our own.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Limited in tile design...or I just haven't figured out how to change the tile design yet.  I do like the flexibility of changing the tile look.  There are many options for layouts and background colors.  The tiles that are available add some challenge as they are original type Mahjong tiles.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|That's exactly what came to mind when I started watching this great series. I came late to the Fringe scene and have just recently started watching the show; but better late than never is an understatement!<br /><br />Crazy genius scientist who drops acid in the lab and spent the last two decades in a mental institution.<br />-Check<br /><br />Out of this world yet still fathomable plot-lines.<br />-Check<br /><br />Great story-telling with tons of twists and turns, with well thought out side stories and background details.<br />-Check<br /><br />This list could go on and on because Fringe seems to have it all. If you haven't experienced this series, you should. Absolutely amazing and highly entertaining.<br /><br />Watch it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids enjoy this game.  It is fascinating to watch them try to figure how to connect the color dots without crossing over another color.  My kids are 7 and 8.  Some of the patterns are more challenging and become even more challenging as they progress. Free game and fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My six almost seven year old son loves to play this. It helps with his math skills. He has yo add his coins together in order to see what skill he can \\"buy\\" next.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I kept hearing from people that I like (friends, blogs, book clubs...) how ,inch they love Dr. Who. So I decided to give it a try. I didn't really enjoy the first episode but decided to give it another chance. Turns out all those people were right. Dr. Who is funny, imaginative and thoroughly entertaining. Love it!
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is a fun game as most know easy to play and it takes you back to the old days when Pac Man was a way of life. Give it a try......worth the price.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I LOVE this movie. It is funny and the characters are amazing. I saw it in the theater and was not expecting anything great. I fell in love with this movie and left the theater with my cheeks hurting from smiling and laughing so much. I knew I had to own it. My husband and I have watched it several times at home and laughed just as much then as the first time we watched it. The extras are great too.

B0067AC5KA|5.0|The movie was on the DVD for months before I got around to watching. I had the trilogy by the next day and completely read within a little over a week. Again disturbing and true with regards to the political games mixed in with the less stable minds. The most memorable tend to be the most dangers. Wolves not bothering to hide or the ones interacting daily hiding their true selves in society's embrace. Look twice at the outcast and try to reach them, they just may have more humanity than you do!? The best thrillers play on the mind and not the gore.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Not one of G5 best, but the game is fun to play. Finding objects is extremely difficult in the game, the zoom is almost nonexistent and the objects are hidden very well. At times taking on any color or shade to blend in. The story is interesting and keeps you engaged.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel's acting in this movie was phenomenal. The movie was riveting from start to finish! Doesn't feel like a typical Hollywood film, in a good way.
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|This score accomplishes to capture the hard-edge of the new feel injected into the Bond franchise, while throwing in elements of the &#34;classic Bond&#34; that don't let the listener forget the spirit of 007. It's definitely a soundtrack worthy for the gym!
B009CPES4I|4.0|If you watch any British series or films (Downton Abbey anyone?) you will enjoy this cast of great actors. The movie is entertaining, touching, light-hearted, and will make you want to go on vacation.

B00364K6YW|5.0|This is the best version Of P&P out there by a long shot. I have no complaints about the dvd itself; the video quality is good, sound is good, and the extra features are interesting. All in all, if you want to see P&P this is the only version worth watching, and it matches the book itself more closely than any other that I've seen. Plus Colin Firth is just dreamy, and that's reason enough I think.

0385737955|3.0|I read glowing reviews about the Maze Runner, by James Dashner, so when I picked it up and began reading, I was surprised and disappointed by the quality of writing I found therein.<br /><br />Though the plot was quick paced and well-planned; it keeps the reader turning the page. The writing is confusing. Filled with clich&eacute;s, lousy scene description, simplistic language that strives to be sophisticated and the frustrating lack of an ending only served to frustrate this reader.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of Thomas, a sixteen year old who is brought into the 'Glade'. A large outdoor structure, surrounded by an endless maze. Along with several other children from twelve to seventeen, they struggle to find out why they are there and to survive attacks by 'grievers'.<br /><br />The language is simplistic, as if the young adult audience could not read beyond the sixth grade level.<br /><br />Tears filled his eyes, but he refused to let them come.<br /><br />Few sentences within the book are more complicated than that.<br /><br />And then there are spots in which the author seems confused. As if he's unsure about scene elements.<br /><br />He stood up and walked past Chuck toward the old building; shack was a better word for the place. It looked three or four stories high...<br /><br />Either the narrator doesn't know how to count or the supposed genius child, Thomas doesn't. Either way, it's obvious someone forgot their math on this particular day and it doesn't bode well for a protagonist or his friends if he cannot count past three.<br /><br />We find out later, the character is supposed to be super intelligent, but by his behaviors, it's not quite believable. Even in a world of suspended disbelief, you cannot make an idiot child look super intelligent--unless of course, you write it that way.<br /><br />And more confusing:<br /><br />He was consumed with curiosity but still felt too ill to look closely at his surroundings. His new companions said nothing as he swiveled his head around, trying to take it all in.<br /><br />Conflicting ideas here. In the first sentence of this paragraph, he's too ill to look at surroundings, but in the next he's attempting to take it all in. I think perhaps within this short space of type the author forgot what was supposed to happen.<br /><br />Worse, to find a resolution to the questions the story poses you have to read through the whole trilogy. In the end, the books feel more like a marketing ploy than good story-telling.aid nothing as he swiveled his head around, trying to take it all in.<br /><br />Conflicting ideas here.

This movie is definitely our favorite after Iron Man I & Thor.  Robert Downey Jr. steals the show (which is hard considering all the action sequences and eye candy all over the place).  Love this package deal which insures that I will have this movie in every format and hopefully for perpetuity.

B005LAIHTA|5.0|A romance, yes, but with unusual twists and a complex story line. That is what makes the new film Safe Haven so interesting to watch. February 14 is known as a day for romance, and this year at the theater is no exception. Rated PG-13 for sexual and adult content, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria B recommends this film, even to those who are not fans of the romance genre, because it is \\"unique and not cliche.\\"<br /><br />Safe Haven<br />Reviewed by Victoria B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic<br /><br />Safe Haven is surprisingly eerie for a romantic movie. I have never seen Julianne Hough play such an intense role before, and she is honest in her acting. She plays a distrusting woman in a new town looking to have no neighbors, friends or any emotional ties, but she forgets that southerners are strangely friendly. Her goal becomes more difficult.<br /><br />I love the style in which the movie is shot, flashing between the present to the past.  This movie follows a woman named Katie who runs away from home and from her husband who is stalking her. She takes a bus, in a disguise, to any town. When the bus stops for a pit stop, she decides that the sleepy and quaint little town she has stopped in is the one for her.<br /><br />Katie (Julianne Hough) has to start over with a new name, house and people.  First she gets a job at a local seafood shack and buys a new house. She stops at the local store for groceries and meets a charming little girl named Lexi (Mimi Kirkland), followed by her dad, Alex (Josh Duhamel), who coincidentally is the same guy that sold her coffee the first day in town. Neither of them at first admit it, but it is clear that there is an instant attraction. From then on, whenever Katie goes to the store she sees Lexie and meets her brother Josh (Noah Lomax) and flirts with Alex.  Katie tells all of her encounters with Alex to her one neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders), and Jo encourages the idea of Katie dating Alex. The closer Alex and Katie get, the more dangerous their relationship becomes.<br /><br />There is a twist when Alex, who is friends with the sheriff, sees a wanted for murder post with Katie's face on it. He confronts her and tells her to leave. To find out what happens next, you'll have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />I give this movie five out of five stars because this romantic movie is unique and not clich&eacute;. I recommend it for ages 13 and up or mature audiences, due to the sexual scenes and scenes of domestic and substance abuse. I am not a fan of romantic movies, but this one was the best I have seen. It even has an exciting twist that I never saw coming. I love this movie and will see it again.<br /><br />Video review may be found online at kids first dot orgus their relationship becomes.<br /><br />There is a twist when Alex, who is friends with the sheriff, sees a wanted for murder post with Katie's face on it.

B005G5PPGS|5.0|I have not followed baseball for perhaps thirty years.  But I recently relocated to Las Vegas, Nv, and I realized I will be spending many hot afternoons every summer in my air-conditioned home with little to do but watch baseball.  (I am a retired guy.)  So, I reluctantly picked up &#34;Moneyball&#34; in hopes that the book might re-stimulate my interest in the sport.  Shazaam!  Moneyball is a home run!  Michael Lewis has achieved wonders here.  I had never heard of Sabremetrics or of Billy Beane (the protagonist of Moneyball) and the book was both eye-opening and great fun.<br /><br />Since reading Moneyball, I have bought a bunch of baseball books on the new metrics in baseball, and I am devouring these books and I am looking forward to the coming baseball season with great expectations.  Thank you Michael Lewis.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|This is a great album that nobody seems to want to give a chance.  Okay it not a &#34;Hot Fuss&#34; but there are some really great songs on here ie &#34;Runaways&#34; &#34;The Way it Was&#34;  &#34;Here With Me&#34; (great slow tune) &#34;Miss Atomic Bomb&#34; (not bad) &#34;From Here On Out&#34; ( my favorite tune - it rocks, it should have been a big radio hit  but I never hear it ??)  &#34;Battle Born&#34; (weird moody song but I liked it&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I was not expecting to like this as much as I did. Very moving, if slightly implausible. I teach very smart teenagers, and even the best of them aren't this eloquent. Still, a great story, well told, and a terrific way to pass a rainy afternoon.
0061148512|5.0|The BELL JAR is a remarkable autobiographical piece: like the fictional heroine Esther Greenwood, Plath went to New York to work on an internship, and discovered the seamy reality lurking beneath the cocktail parties and the piles of eligible men.  She finds herself retreating into despair, frustrated with her own inadequacies, as well as the constricting world around her that forces her to play certain roles - for example, as an eligible partner suitable for a procession of insincere men, or the perpetual virgin keeping herself \\"pure\\" for an ideal marriage partner.<br /><br />THE BELL JAR also struck me as a remarkable comment on contemporary cultures - specifically the recreation of New York mediatic culture so beloved of successful television series like MAD MEN.  When we look at the characters in that show, with their slicked-back hair, immaculately pressed suits and frilly dresses, we're transported back into a world which - for the program-makers at least - seems so much more attractive than the grimy reality of contemporary America.  Viewers are invited to experience pleasurable nostalgia for a vanished world.  Plath reveals the grimy reality lurking beneath that world.
B0095P31L6|3.0|The movie was cute in some scenes but I'm glad I didn't waste my money at the theater to see it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I watched this season back when it was on T.V., and loved it. Then we had twins, and T.V. watching took a bit of a backseat...<br /><br />My wife and I now watching the entire series, and it was just as enjoyable to watch this season as it was the first time.

B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Bruce Wayne spent ten years looking for a good death.<br /><br />We're at the conclusion of the Dark Knight's career, Dark Knight Returns (part 2), the adaptation of the critically acclaimed graphic novel by Frank Miller. It's the tale fan have been begging to see on screen, and in a lot of ways, the root of the modern version of Batman.<br /><br />Before Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />Before Bruce Timm.<br /><br />Before Tim Burton.<br /><br />The was only Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. It ignited imaginations like an atom bomb, and nothing would ever be the same after the firestorm had passed.<br /><br />There will be no more spoilers, except to expect more of the same vicious storytelling that characterized the first half of this adaptation, and to look forward to the stakes to get even higher.<br /><br />The movie does have the same flaw as the first half, the narration from the book is missing. The narration in the book takes the action to a different level. But, on the other hand, they chose to keep the action scenes quiet, which I think is also true to the spirit of the original story. In the book, you spend a lot of time inside Batman's head, but he doesn't speak much.<br /><br />What the filmmakers accomplished is to push the narration out of the way of the action. The book uses narration to establish that Batman is two steps ahead of everybody. But, Batman's moves are so smooth in this film, you can see and feel that Batman is two steps ahead of everybody, without him having to narrate it to you. And that's the reason I'm giving this a Five.<br /><br />When I reviewed Batman: Year One, I gave it a Four because despite being a nearly flawless adaptation, the source material had been copied so many times it no longer had the same sting. But, to it's benefit, no one has copied The Dark Knight Returns. It's just too hot for TV, and way to complicated for a normal movie. It still stings, and bites, and claws, and rips. Especially if you look atboth halves together, it's a big lumbering wall of muscle under the cape and cowl. I don't think it could get any better.<br /><br />Special Features on the Blu-Ray include:<br /><br />From Sketch to Screen: Exploring the Adaptation Process with Jay Oliva. Kinda like commentary, but over the animatic, only pieces of the film.<br /><br />Superman vs. Batman: When Heroes Collide - A 9-minute feature talking about both characters.<br /><br />The Joker: Laughing in the Face of Death - A 14-minute study of the Joker.<br /><br />Preview of Superman: Unbound, the next direct to video movie. It's under the Trailers section. It's mostly behind the scenes stuff, you can find the real trailer for Superman Unbound on youtube, and it looks great.<br /><br />Three Batman cartoons: &#34;The Last Laugh&#34; and &#34;The Man Who Killed Batman&#34; from Batman the Animated Series, and &#34;Battle of the Super Heroes&#34; from Batman: the Brave and the Bold.<br /><br />A digital comic and other trailers pad out the disk.<br /><br />While I do miss the narration, I think, overall, the two films work. It's not perfect enough to replace the original graphic novel, it's a good adaptation that I am happy to have. I give if a 5-out-of-5.

B008220C38|5.0|My review:<br /><br />When I entered the movie theatre, I knew a lot about Tolstoy's book, but nothing about this specific movie release. I knew who were starring the movie and that was it. Usually, when going to see movies, I always check out trailers and features and interviews before actually seeing them on the big screen, but this time the title of the movie was plainly enough. I have been a big fan of classical Russian literature from very young age, so I thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong in many levels.<br /><br />When the opening scenes were over, I knew that this movie was very different from any other movie version of Anna Karenina. Well, it was different from any movie based on classical literary fiction! It was mesmerizing and I was hooked from the first minutes and I did not want to leave the dark room of the theatre even when the credentials were running and most of the people were leaving the room. I wanted to stay in the world that the movie makers had created!<br /><br />Screenplay:<br /><br />Let me start with saying, that screenwriter Tom Stoppard kept the story very close to its original and I was very happy about it! It seemed that there was a clear understanding between the late Lev Tolstoy and the screenwriter Tom Stoppard. There were only very few places in the story when I realized, that it is slightly different from the original and even that was falling nicely to its place in the movie.<br /><br />The story was dramatic, heart-wrenching and beautifully executed! It's an epic forbidden love story which takes place in the Russian aristocracy. Anna Karenina is unhappily married, but she has no greater expectations to love, at least until she meets Count Vronsky. The moment they meet, there is attraction and as much as they try to deny it, it is inevitable. It's forbidden love in the society, because Anna decides to leave her husband and asks for divorce. As the isolation from friends, family and everybody else for Anna grows, the more consumed she is by darkness. Karenin does not give her divorce and it does not matter how big the love is between Vronsky and Anna, it gets dramatic consequences.<br /><br />Directing, sets, visuals, choreography, design and music:<br /><br />What made this movie exceptionally unique was the fact, that director Joe Wright staged it on a theatre. Watching the movie was like watching a theatre stage where the scenes were elegantly changed as the story folded out in front of the audience. Scene after scene the settings were changed even though the room was the same. It was original and I loved it. I also realized the the only sets which were used outside of theatre were about Levin and his life on the countryside. This change was nicely balanced where you had the hectic life of Sct. Petersburg and Moscow in one side and the picturesque and slow scenes from Russian nature.<br /><br />There was a lot of attention on choreography and physical contact in Anna Karenina. It was a movie where choreography was a main storyteller. It was often where choreography was substituting words and you can say that in Anna Karenina a picture told more than 1000 words. The ballroom dancing and even a simple touch was sometimes telling more than words. It was tense and filled with passion. Another thing which was special in Anna Karenina, were the close-ups. The facial impressions were as important as the huge scenes with many people.<br /><br />One of the interesting visuals were the usage of lightning and colors. For example there was a clear contrasts when Anna was together with Vronsky compared to when she was with Karenin. The scenes where Anna and Vronsky spend time together are brighter and softer, and the scenes at home with Karenin, the lightning is murkier and darker. It gave some nice effects to the plot and to the mood.<br /><br />I would also like to mention the design of the costumes and the music in the movie. The costumes were breathtakingly beautiful, especially the onesdesigned for Anna and Kitty and the music was coherent with the development of the story: the intensity of which grew in the rhythm with the drama surrounding it.<br /><br />Casting and ensemble:<br /><br />I liked the characters picked for the roles. Keira Knightly as Anna Karenina was a good choice. She was capable of mirroring Anna Karenina's essence showing both love, passion, courage, pain and last but not least jealousy. When Anna is consumed by isolation and jealousy and realization that the society will never forgive her, Keira Knightly gave her best to show these different reflections of woman in love and pain. I liked that a lot!<br /><br />Jude Law as Karenin was faceted. I liked that he did not show Karenin as a simple man. He loved Anna on his own way and I liked that Jude Law showed his soft side combined with the religious and hurtful side. I really enjoyed the way he played Karenin.<br /><br />I was surprised by Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky. I have seen him in Nowhere Boy and realized that fact actually after the movie. He has matured as actor and he as Vronsky was a very good choice. He showed passion, tenderness, love and passion of a man in love.<br /><br />Another surprise was Alicia Vikander as Kitty. This Swedish actress was perfect to the role. I was amazed by her grace when she played in A Royal Affair where I was stunned by her presence in acting. I loved her as Kitty, she had spark and sassyness and humbleness when she met Levin after denying him as a husband.<br /><br />I also enjoyed performances of Domhnall Gleeson as Levin and Matthew Macfadyen as Oblonski.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />The only minor thing that I was disturbed by and it was how the Russian names were pronounced. It sounded awkward to my ears, but this is probably because I grew up in the environment where Russian was used as a second language. I have the similar experiences with many other English spoken  movies and I do understand that Russian words and names are difficult to pronounce, but in a classical drama based on Russian literature I think this could have been improved.<br /><br />Generally:<br /><br />I think Anna Karenina was brilliantly made bold version of Tolstoy's novel. I loved the experience and I know that I will watch it again! I highly recommend itdesigned for Anna and Kitty and the music was coherent with the development of the story: the intensity of which grew in the rhythm with the drama surrounding it.<br /><br />Casting and ensemble:<br /><br />I liked the characters picked for the roles. Keira Knightly as Anna Karenina was a good choice. She was capable of mirroring Anna Karenina's essence showing both love, passion, courage, pain and last but not least jealousy. When Anna is consumed by isolation and jealousy and realization that the society will never forgive her, Keira Knightly gave her best to show these different reflections of woman in love and pain. I liked that a lot!<br /><br />Jude Law as Karenin was faceted. I liked that he did not show Karenin as a simple man. He loved Anna on his own way and I liked that Jude Law showed his soft side combined with the religious and hurtful side. I really enjoyed the way he played Karenin.<br /><br />I was surprised by Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky. I have seen him in Nowhere Boy and realized that fact actually after the movie. He has matured as actor and he as Vronsky was a very good choice. He showed passion, tenderness, love and passion of a man in love.<br /><br />Another surprise was Alicia Vikander as Kitty. This Swedish actress was perfect to the role. I was amazed by her grace when she played in A Royal Affair where I was stunned by her presence in acting. I loved her as Kitty, she had spark and sassyness and humbleness when she met Levin after denying him as a husband.<br /><br />I also enjoyed performances of Domhnall Gleeson as Levin and Matthew Macfadyen as Oblonski.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />The only minor thing that I was disturbed by and it was how the Russian names were pronounced.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|I own all the Bourne Legacy movies and was sad that Matt Damon was not continuing with the Series.  Now I know the torch has successfully passed to Jeremy Renner.  He is great as Jason Bourne's successor.  This movie has a lot of action, seemingly impossible stunts and is well acted.  Highly recommend!
B00846REIS|1.0|Okay, so i don't want to bore anyone with another bad review, we all are writing the same thing. The book sucks, its not realistic. There is hardly any dialogue that isn't sexual. I could probably guess and be correct to say there were about 20 sentences where there was no talk of sex. Maybe 30 if you added their conversations about their screwed up pasts. You don't fall in love with someone you don't have conversations with. This book was literally sex, sex, \\"don't leave me\\", sex, sex, \\"I'm screwed up in the head\\", sex sex, sex, sex.

B0099Y2YL6|4.0|When you're reviewing a book, you don't give away the ending. The same courtesy should obviously be given to other kinds of \\"stories.\\" I can't believe how many reviewers on here have thought it appropriate to share major plot developments of Season 3, including what happens in the very last scene of the season. Luckily I just watched the season finale and came here to see if the DVD set includes the Christmas episode. But many won't have seen any of the episodes. Please show some common sense and courtesy. Think of this when doing future reviews. If you've included spoilers here, you might consider removing your review.

B00B2G2RG6|3.0|First season for this, basic premise;  Bacon was involved in helping to capture a serial killer.  Serial Killer has some sort of bizarre hooks back to Edgar Allen Poe (eyes window to the soul, so pluck the eyes out and get creative, making death some sort of &#34;tribute to beauty&#34;.  I don't think it's giving it away that the serial killer manages to escape (at least once from the prison...  Not much of a series if he just sits at the table?)  He moves out and about, and you find that by hook or crook this serial killer has been able to chat up a bunch of people via the internet;  Gather a bunch of creative killer wannabes (the following) and is setting out to punish Kevin for sleeping with his wife.  So, at this point, looks like each week is going to be some sort of killer trying to push Bacon in a specific direction.  Direction in this case appears to be getting him out of his personal funk and back on the stick (for whatever reason).<br /><br />Not really my cup of tea, but then again Kevin Bacon over the years has supplied me with a lot of entertainment so I'm giving it a shot.<br /><br />First couple of episodes, a few years ago would have been completely over the top with the staging of the corpses, today...  Well, sad to say it's pretty much par for the course.  Some of the character interactions... Well, not homophobic by any stretch, but then again I don't go out of my way to find TV series with male homological (Is that a word?) relationships in it.<br /><br />Bacon's performance?  Considering he's a disgraced FBI agent of some type that has a pacemaker and a drinking problem.  He does a decent job, just not really the sort of character that you'd want to follow along with week by week, if they kept it that way.  The repressed anger, lack of trust / not playing well with others have given it some moments that are entertaining.<br /><br />My take?  They've just started, barely out the gate, I have hopes that we're going to go along on a journey of redemption for Bacon's character.  But this is more where I'd like it to go as opposed to where I -know- it's going to go, we will all have to wait and see just where it heads.<br /><br />So, sticking with it for season 1.mption for Bacon's character.  But this is more where I'd like it to go as opposed to where I -know- it's going to go, we will all have to wait and see just where it heads.<br /><br />So, sticking with it for season 1.

B009GEFXLC|5.0|TV series are generally based on a premise, gets completely tied to that premise and if they try and evolve it to the next step they wind up running right over a cliff or jumping the nearest shark.<br /><br />Castle, I've bought the entire series, done a mass marathon (luckily this was before twinkies ceased to exist;  Now with that lack, don't know if I'd have the stamina to pull it off).<br /><br />Concept - Castle is an amazing mystery writer, 26 or more best sellers (even though he claims to only do 1 book a year), gets pulled in in episode 1, season 1 to help Beckett (Gorgeous Homicide detective, female), solve a mystery that is using murders out of his books.  He gets hooked on her and off we go.<br /><br />The series is formulaic, there's an &#34;A&#34; story line (Generally the murder), and at least one &#34;B&#34; story line (some progression of the character's relationships).<br /><br />&#34;A&#34; story lines, generally take the form of some tribute to a genre (real wives of name your place, star trek type conventions, thematic episodes I assume played around specific holidays (Halloween in particular &#34;Undead again&#34; being a particular favorite &#34;Our killer's a zombie!&#34;), there are of course more &#34;natural&#34; killings as well, so don't think they're all some sort of trumped up bizarre thing.  In most cases these lines are decently thought out, my only fault with them is the sheer number of false leads they give you through the course of the episode.  Watching sometimes, I'd think my head would explode if they threw another twist to the murder at me.<br /><br />&#34;B&#34; storylines, tend to lighten the mood, provide a distraction from all the murdering going on.  (Wish they had a compressed stream of just the &#34;B&#34; lines sometimes.)  They do use the same sorts of mechanisms a lot to bring home their points, and as I say if not for the generally excellent performance of the actors it could get annoying, very predictable.  But in this case, I forgive them that as Most episodes are full of solid entertainment.<br /><br />Plot progression - I could name off several series where the big hook to keep the audience coming back was the old &#34;will they or won't they&#34; thing and the audience is left hanging until the last moment of the last episode to find out &#34;will they?&#34;<br /><br />Castle has taken the approach over the 5 seasons so far of maturing the relationship between Castle and Beckett<br /><br />I have to say I admire the story writers progressing the story line and managing to find things to do after the characters get together.<br /><br />Best of the series - the characters, the humor<br /><br />Worst of the series - Sometimes it could jump the orca (much larger than a shark) around motivation on plotting and agreements that the characters get into (the entire Beckett Mother getting killed storyline, several times I was what the?)<br /><br />Still at this point likely the most enjoyable show I am watchinghis case, I forgive them that as Most episodes are full of solid entertainment.<br /><br />Plot progression - I could name off several series where the big hook to keep the audience coming back was the old &#34;will they or won't they&#34; thing and the audience is left hanging until the last moment of the last episode to find out &#34;will they?&#34;<br /><br />Castle has taken the approach over the 5 seasons so far of maturing the relationship between Castle and Beckett<br /><br />I have to say I admire the story writers progressing the story line and managing to find things to do after the characters get together.<br /><br />Best of the series - the characters, the humor<br /><br />Worst of the series - Sometimes it could jump the orca (much larger than a shark) around motivation on plotting and agreements that the characters get into (the entire Beckett Mother getting killed storyline, several times I was what the?)<br /><br />Still at this point likely the most enjoyable show I am watching

B009EP3DJM|1.0|I never seen so many of her videos (like Die Young) that has nothing but Anti-Christ and Illuminati symbolism in them. I thought Lady Ga Ga and Mondana was bad. If you don't catch it then your being programmed.

B004SBX112|1.0|I'm sure the game would be fun if I could open it!  I've downloaded it several times but all I end up getting is an icon that won't open.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I was a little unsure about how this book would be turned into a movie, but I think they did a pretty great job. The animals are adorable and the characters are funny. It also stays true to the original story with showing how it is important to take care of the trees. Danny DeVito plays a good Lorax.

B005C9YZIW|5.0|This show was so well done. I would recommend the blu-ray over the dvd because the landscapes and images are breathtaking.  The extra discs are documentaries that are also very well done. Great choice for anyone interested in nature.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|its simple and packed with just the right features. I wish I had this for my ipad because i've yet to find a comparible service.
B000KKPN5C|2.0|It leaves a shadow and bright hot spot light.  I need a larger flash with indirect flash to avoid hot spot.
0800141660|3.0|I had just read the book and wanted to see the movie. Overall I liked the way it was done. I know you can't fit a whole book into a 2-hour movie without changing a few things, and I think they did a pretty good job of keeping the story straight. Most of the characters were believable EXCEPT I really took issue with Emma Thompson as Elinor - I'm sorry, she is just WAY TOO OLD! She would have been better as Mrs. Dashwood, who, if you remember from the book, was in her 40's and still attractive. The other actor that bothered me was Alan Rickman as Col. Brandon. In the book he seemed to be a softer, more genial character, but Alan Rickman's portrayal was too harsh (and his looks are a tad harsh - I don't think he smiled once in the whole movie, except maybe in the last scene).  So ... I would recommend it but whith those caveats.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|Taylor is so good. This live concert DVD is small clips masterfully edited together to seamlessly provide one entire concert into your living room.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really enjoying this series :)  Love the British accents and the ways of old fashioned upper class mannerisms and ways.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Maybe the bar was simply set to high by past pixar offerings, such as up, cars and cars 2, and of course the toy story trilogy.  Pixar also showed that they hadn't lost their magic with Wreck it Ralph, which was released after Brave.  It was still an enjoyable movie, and my kids loved it, but the story line and lack of Pixar's &#34;epic&#34; scenes was simply missing here.  My suggestion - watch it if you like pixar, avoid if you don't.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Love the Batman trilogy, and this was the icing on top. Cant wait to see what is in store next!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Like reading a good book, virtually every episode is a cliff hangar (and a good one at that). Some shows/movies try to pull off something to leave the audiences more, for example pirates of the caribbean. Except this works, and when a character dies, they stay dead. This season so far (which I'm downloading through amazon instant video because of my schedule) is more action oriented, but doesn't  abandon an actual plot and direction for simple blood and gore like many zombie flicks like dawn of the dead. You care about these people and root for them the same as you would from a character in a novel in your favorite book. To hook me, you have to have dynamic characters, conflict, plot, etc. the show killed off some very likable, useful characters and it shows the human psyche on how we as people would adapt to the loss of friends/loved ones, but also shows how we are very distrusting and in some cases  would literally kill each other in desperation, to survive.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Started watching this year and wanted to see the first two seasons.  The price of this set was very fair.
B000JML7EC|5.0|One of the great classic that I always wanted to read and finally got the opportunity. Plenty of excitement and adventure to follow with the young pirate.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|I only discovered the Swedish House Mafia a short time ago (about 2 months). After I had looked into their music, I purchased their album &#34;Until One&#34; and recently &#34;Until Now&#34;. There are only a few songs that I'm not crazy about, and even so, I like them because of the 'belonging' that they have to the other tracks. I work as a sign spinner (part time job) 3 hours a shift. This album and &#34;Until One&#34; are the perfect length (80 minutes) for me. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys house music, or even those who are new to the genre. I recommend the CD version over MP3s so that you can retain the original FLAC/320kbps files (if you are an audiophile).

Difficult to open, difficult to text as the screen cover was thick and uneven, headphone piece was difficult to remove, and the sound/music was muffled because it is waterproof. Worst case ever.

B004CFBMRY|5.0|Christopher McDougall writes about his experiences during the search for super-athletes. The super-athlete in question is not a scientifically altered/enhanced human being. But these are normal human beings who are a  part of the tribe named Tarahumara. The Tarahumaras has not contact with outside world and prefers to live in the Mexican Copper Canyons. They take a long time to induct an outsider into their inner circle. It is because of their past experiences with the external world.<br /><br />In order to find out more about this tribe and learn as much as possible about the joys of running, Christopher goes on searching for a man who has lives among the Tarahumara tribe despite being a Westerner. When you hear the backdrop of the story, there is a chance you would label it as a boring book which extols the virtues of running with a lot of related scientific discoveries. If you have one of those people, then you are right except about one thing. This is not a boring book.<br /><br />The narrative style used by Christopher is the key in making this book an enjoyable read. During his search, Christopher discovers a lot of interesting characters in the course of his journey. Instead of telling his story as a linear narrative, Christopher leaps up ahead in his story in the middle of the narrative. This makes the whole story move months and weeks ahead when the book breaks into a new chapter. But before long, he catches up on the story he left behind in the previous chapter. The uncertainty of where we are heading makes the experience enjoyable and intriguing at the same time.<br /><br />The book not only tells the importance of the story but also the will power of people who are featured in the book. Luckily for the reader, Christopher doesn't preach us. Instead, he lets the reader find the lessons on his own. When I picked up the book, I had no idea if these characters were real. After reading the book, I went looking for these characters on the internet and was amazed to find more about them.<br /><br />If you have never tried out this genre, I strongly advice you to read this book. For sports fans, this is a must read.ed to find more about them.<br /><br />If you have never tried out this genre, I strongly advice you to read this book. For sports fans, this is a must read.

The only one I had felt in years.&#34; -Composite of lines from 'Give Out.'  In the story, I always cheer for Sharon Van Etten. Ms. Van Etten has been telling me a story for years now, and it's emotionally gripping! Her three LP's thus far ARE theater. So, in a cheap ploy to garner patience from all the Ms. Van Etton fans reading this, I just want to establish that she is the character in the story that I have come to care for deeply. Boy, how I need her to find closure, peace of mind, rebirth!  Ms. Van Etten, with a new and evolving home and love, seems to be &#34;pulling ahead&#34; in her journey. Yes, the story IS moving forward. Still, everything isn't fully resolved. A salvo or two remain to be fired and, dare I say, she's is not entirely convinced that the wheels are back on her wagon to stay. Gee, that all sounds like the backgrounded and foreboding tension of the second act to me! You know, when everything finally settles down and bliss springs eternal but then... Oh, crap!  A few selfish reactions of mine to the LP. Track 2 (a happy song though laced with self-doubt qualifiers) and 3 (decidedly not a happy song -but one that hints at forgiveness and reconciliation) are both feloniously catchy and, like so many others have pointed out, contain many of the most memorable and provocative one-liners on the LP. Tracks 4 (more &#34;issues&#34;?) and 5 (super happy song) are total charmers. Track 6 is a country-laced-ethereal-road-trip-in-time-and-place and is a remarkable achievement. This song is so sonically, lyrically and affectively fascinating that I'm always, well, pissed that it ends! Track 7 displays Ms. Van Etten's penchant and talent for escalating a song to the heights of an anthem. Track 9 is a beat-mix-swing-gospel extravaganza and is as cool as it is jazz smooth. The last two songs don't share much in common with the rest of this work. Thisis partly explained by the abstract treatment of their subject matter Vs. the more every-day-down-to earth elaborations that typically preoccupy her lyrics. These songs strike me as narrowly focus yet open-ended studies and ones that strive for mood over clarity. They work for me.  What makes Ms. Van Etten the exceptional artist that so many people are concluding that she is? She has an undeniably pleasant voice, but it is more insidiously affecting than charismatic. As a guitar player, she never settles for the perfunctory, and she understands the value of patience but, then again, there is nothing &#34;signature&#34; about it. Stating the obvious, she is an accomplished lyricist -lithe, smart, evocative, fully invested- but ultimately that does not make her special either. Her greatest strength is her unwavering consistence along every imaginable dimension that matters. What makes her unique is her gifts as a composer to animate her songs into living, thirsting representations. Yes, that was a bunch of words spent going nowhere, and I am sorry. What I am trying to say is that my first and continuing reaction to 'Tramp' that it is timeless which, in turn, is just my way of saying this LP means a great deal to me.ay of saying this LP means a great deal to me.
0765325950|5.0|I loved the fact that I finally sat with the final book in the series - and enjoyed every page (except for a few, but one cannot always love it when favorite characters drop dead, or when the end isn't quite as epic as I'd hoped, with several very unexpected twists - some good, others just weird) - but overall I was satisfied. There are still some unanswered questions, and I would not have complained if there was yet another book to come, but I guess the end had to come some day. I have waited nearly ten years for it, so it was well about time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. A real fast read .Recommended for everyone! I cant wait to read the 2nd book Mockingjay.
B001I9TK1W|5.0|Come on, its Bruce Lee people!<br /><br />I have not met anyone yet who has not seen Enter the Dragon and I probably would not want to meet anyone who hasn't either!<br /><br />Anyway, as a young kid growing up; watching Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly was magical and is the reason I got in to the Martial Arts.<br /><br />Enter the Dragon is one of the best!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|The kids and I both got a good laugh. Fun story, not cheesy, and a few monsters to keep it interesting.
B001QD3JYE|5.0|Blow is one of my all time favorite Johnny Depp movies!<br /><br />What an incredible story of the man who launched to cocaine revolution here in America.<br /><br />Penelope Cruz was spectacular as well as to look at (LOL)! The supporting cast was phenomenal.<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie yet, I recommend you pop some popcorn, download and digest this entertaining true story!
B003UYV08E|5.0|Good Iron Man against bad Iron Man is the battle worth waiting to see. As long as Morton Downey, Jr. stars I will keep buying.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have used yahoo mail for a longtime and I love the fact I can get it on all my devices.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Love this flick. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Bond or Daniel Craig. You won't be disappointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|THE SECOND SEASON DOES NOT FALL BELOW THE HIGH STANDARD OF THE FIRST. hOW CAN YOU NOT FALL IN LOVE/HATE WITH THE FAMILY AND SERVANTS.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Just an awesome show. Always twisting and making you guess what will happen next. And you never know how it will turn out.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is fun and gets your blood pumping because you need to be very fast to master this game.  Good luck!
B008EKOO46|2.0|I found Collapse and Germs, Guns and Steel both entertaining and informative.<br />It seems to me that this book is relying on the success of the previous ones. There is a long pointless prologue, then about 20 pages of information. Unfortunately these 20 pages are padded out to many more with repetition and waffle.<br />I would not suggest that anybody read it.,
B007ED9FIY|5.0|This is definitely a chick flick.  So I would recommend this to all women, especially those who really like George Clooney.
1250027624|5.0|I've enjoyed all 3 seasons, and am sorry for some of the things Mr. Fellows did to the characters, but it will be interesting to see where it all goes from here.  The book helped a lot in the understanding a bit deeper the background of the characters, so it fulfilled my expectations.  I would recommend this to any fan of the series to delve a bit more into the background of this story.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great plot, great action, love the high tech. Beyond expectations! Perfect assemble of cast. We watch it multiple times. Looking forward for the sequel.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Enjoyed the book. I did not see the ending coming. Some of the content was hard to digest. Overall good though.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This won't even finish downloading! !!!!!  I can't get it to stop because it really isn't doing anything except be frozen.  This means I don't even know if the game is full or not.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Glad to see there is the option for UV or iTunes!  Fantastic movie, UV I hope you die a fiery death like the steaming bag of crap you are.  This is a safe buy!
B000JQUKKU|3.0|How many times can I read this? More times is what you'd answer yo. If it were another book about a crippled kid overcoming famine to save Christmas in the face of an elderly bigot, then I wouldn't read it. But Dickens got my heart
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Always looking for new series to watch. This another one that gives hope that there are people out there that try to correct wrongs and do what is right.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The small town setting and local characters were well captured. A little lengthy, but a worthwhile read. Not another Harry Potter, but nothing is or will be.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is more challenging than the first, making it better too.  At first it worked, but now when I try to open it it just goes back to my home page. :/
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was wonderfully written.  Sparks takes the reader along many twists & turns, & you don't know until the very end what's going to happen. Great characters & storyline. In my opinion, Nicholas Sparks best yet!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the one I use the most.  It works smoothly on my Droid and Kindle.  If I could change two things, the first would be the search feature.  It isn't the greatest and doesn't return the results in any kind of order.  Second, I would add a FORWARD and BACK button.  I can't jump back and forth between passages.  I have to type in the reference each time.
B008HSJV7A|3.0|doesn't work well on the kindle, the grayscale makes some of the dialog hard to read and you can't turn it landscape. I needed to enlarge every page and drag it around to read. I really liked the series but I'll not get another graphic novel for my kindle paperwhite
B007V4530A|5.0|A must read if your ready to be different than all the other speakers!<br /><br />Stand out from your competition! It will differentiate you from the rest!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is truly a masterful writer.  I will read Dark Places also.  This novel kept me up at night because I could not wait for the next chapter to begin.  That being said, I was a bit disappointed at the ending.....
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Nice action and graphics. No story at all though. It was inconsistent and did not allow for proper development. But it was good action.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have not yet finished this book, but so far it is truly mesmorizing.  I am a Catholic with a belief in Heaven, anyway, but to hear this neurosurgeon's description of his near death experience is amazing.  I believe reading this book will make believers out of non-believers and can help anyone coping with the loss of a loved one or their own imminent death.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|I loved Downton Abbey Season 2. I purchased the instant video but the quality was poor. I guess I am just accustomed to HD videos.  Also the connection & load time was very slow.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|I found that this movie just did not live up to the crtics' 94%. I would give it about 60.  Liked the set. I did not care for the acting (or lack of) and was not impressed by all the big named actors.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Great book, easy read...funny!<br />Sophia Kinsella one of my new faves!<br />Can't wait to read more from her!<br />Big reader
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. The suspense and twisting plot were interesting and kept me reading long into the night. A really good read for fans of this genre.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love these mystery games. This one is a lot of fun. I enjoy curling up and playing a little in bed before falling asleep every night.
B00865P3AS|3.0|The music was good, but the guest artist made 2cellos to become the guest artist and not the main.  On the first album, any song I knew immediately that it was 2cellos, this one I would not be able to tell you it was them.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Mellow compared to Born to Die; of course still risque. But still a treat and wanting more. Can't stop listening.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Nice small and compact but does a good job transferring those old slides to the computer and then on to disc.  Easy to use.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Wasn't sure at first, but as the story developed, I found myself completely drawn in.  Found myself waking up thinking about it & reading more in the middle of the night.  Can't wait for our book club discussion.
0439023513|5.0|I started reading the Hunger Games saga because I got &#34;Catching Fire&#34; as a present, and I quickly got hooked. I'm no teenager anymore, and so the argument did seem a bit childish to me at some points, but in general the story is captivating and very imaginative.<br /><br />Warning to parents who are very protective of their children: there is some serious violence in the story. I grew up watching violence in movies and cartoons (let's not mention real life) and I would not let a kid under 9 read this. It's not gory, it's just crude and real.<br /><br />I'd recommend the trilogy for teenagers, who will surely fall in love with it, and to young adults who want to enjoy a good, imaginative story that doesn't get too philosophical. It's a very easy read.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|The first half was outrageously funny. This is the first pretty-much, adult-only movie about a teddy bear that I have ever seen.  Should have expected it from Seth MacFarlane.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|The movie is very exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Great action scenes, decent plot. However, their attempt to touch on the past of James Bond is not nearly as deep and touching as in Casino Royale.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies that I watch when I need some inspiration. The filming is great and the acting is superb.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun i love being so excited about the fastest runs and you can play as long as you like this is awesome
B003VPWXRO|4.0|Gave me hope. Gave me insight. Exactly what I wanted. Exactly what I needed. Very well written and extremely helpful.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great fun reading.  As they always say, much better than the movie, and this time its true as well.  Good book for people of all ages.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not a typical Steven King noval.  Not all the horror and blood of say a Cujo, Christine, etc.<br />&#34;would it be worth changing the future by changing the past&#34;.  Best book I have read in awhile. The term &#34;rabbit hole&#34; has a whole new meaning to me now. Read it in three days.
B003O86FMW|2.0|First book good.  Second book - kinda dull and getting a little silly.  Then again, maybe I'm being harsh - this is a kids book after all!
B008FOB124|5.0|Excellent cd. I was pleasantly surprised this new work of this group. Quiet and relaxing in their sound. Recommended. Exceeded my expectations. The sound reminiscent to the most calm The Cure. For a moments, Also to Tangerine Dream and to Cocteau Twins too.<br />If you can, pay attention to this recording. I loved it.<br /><br />Excelente cd. Me sorprendio gratamente este nuevo trabajo de este grupo. Tranquilo y relajante en su sonoridad. Recomendado. supero mis expectativas. Por momentos recuerda al sonido mas calmo de The Cure. Tambien a Tangerine Dream y a Cocteau Twins.<br />Si puedes, presta atencion a este grabacion. Me encantò
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Thiis book started with alot of character angst and I was tempted to not finish it.  I'm glad I did finish it as it ended with redemption for the main characters and I like that.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I found the book to be interesting for the most part.  The sequence of events that led up to the somewhat confusing ending were pretty gruesome at times and that took away from the philosophical aspect of the book. I liked the book but I did not enjoy the entire read.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Reasonably thrilling action/espionage tale, if a bit far fetched. A good page turner for a long flight, interesting but not too demanding.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this series more then 3 times and if you and in your teens this could be the book for you . Great Book
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this and we play it together. She is learning all about caring for horses and their environment.
B009PAETCG|3.0|I played for a bit but after a while it didn't keep my eyes to the screen (A.D.D.) (lol) but the up side it was free
B005EWDA3I|3.0|I loved this story and became a little obsessed with sneaking off and spending quiet time with it, imagine my upset when the ending was so very boring. Did Murakami find something better to do and have his disinterested housekeeper finish his work?. Such a let down at the end, I've been left feeling like I didn't quite reach climax after thrilling lovemaking session...bummer.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|An entertaining book as John Grisham's usually are, one doesn't need to be in a book club to read it. Great for holidays or plane travel.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this game tests your mental agility and finger response.<br />like the levels.<br />have not tried to pay for the advance games but most likely will!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I chose this book because I love John Grisham's writing.  I did not realize it was for the 8 to 12 year old readers, but you know what,  I'm 83 and I would recommend it to any age reader.  I intend to read the other Theodore Boone books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this booking because of the twist at the end. It did get slightly boring at times but for the mos t part I always found my self wanting to read more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is so addicting to play.  Its like the real thing.  Only difference is that im not losing money. ha
B000001FP8|4.0|Bon Jovi's New Jersey CD was one of the Follow ups in Rock History that matched it's blockbuster predecessor( Slippery When Wet) Bad Medicine and Born To Be My Baby are as Good as anything the Band ever did. I have the Remaster but when given a chance i bought the Original again. Great disc great shopping Experience. I would buy from this seller agin.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Very happy to see Rebus back on the case! I have read them all and was starting to get twitchy.
B000001FKF|5.0|I remember the day I bought this and have always loved the album. It was everywhere the year I graduated(1987) I sold my original copy years ago and bought the Remaster. The Remaster sounds good but recently I've found myself wanting to get back my original CDs. This disc in particular is an Atomic Design and sounds very good and Looks real Neat. The Price was right and the CD was delivered quickly. It was also in excellent Shape. I would buy from this seller again. Great music, priceless Memories.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I like this app a lot, even though I cannot draw at all.  Fun to doodle and has many features that make even me look like I can draw.
B000002UV9|4.0|Always an Excellent sounding Recording Empire also has some of the groups best songs. The album as a whole gets better with repeat listenings. The Album made the group Superstars, Sadly Sales wise the group never got near this level again. The album should be in every Rock Fans Collection. The CD Arrived in great Condition and right on time. I would buy from the Seller Again.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|The movie was fairly engaging; not terrible.  But, what was the point?  I finished it thinking, &#34;What was that all about?&#34;
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! I thought it was very suspenseful and romantic!  You can't help but fall in love with the characters.
B000002P6R|3.0|The knock on this album is often that Kenney Jones was no Keith Moon.  Actually Jones does an outstanding job, just short of Moon's best efforts.  The musicianship overall is fine, Roger Daltrey's singing is strong and clear.  The production is both a little too polished and a little flat, compared with prior Who albums. But the main problem here is that the songs are generally weak, especially the lyrics - which are often outright embarrassing.  \\"Did you ever sleep in a bear pit\\" is the opening line for one of the songs.  No, I can't say I ever have, and I can't relate to the rest of the song either, or even understand it.  \\"Don't let go the coat\\" - why?  What coat?  Seems to me that Pete Townshend ran out of lyrics, and is reaching for something, anything.  I give him some credit for originality, he's not just recycling old lyrics, but many of these are just too weird and meaningless.  This is The Who, and fans expect greatness.  But the only songs I find to be worthy of the band's history are \\"You Better You Bet\\", \\"Daily Records\\", and \\"Another Tricky Day\\".  Three good/great songs on a Who album is a very low number, but I don't think I'm off base in this judgment. The follow-up album \\"It's Hard\\" similarly had only about 3 Who-worthy songs (\\"Athena\\", \\"Eminence Front\\", and maybe one more).  The best of those two albums might have made a decent, though very short single Who album.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful I love it it's funny because my daughter's name is Anastasia rose it was truly breathtaking I already started the second book
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Back and better than ever. Rebus is a more thoughtful and nuanced character who has also regained his sense of humor. I think the break did the author and his creations some good.
B0095ZEDTU|2.0|After thoroughly enjoying all the predecessor films in this franchise I was very disappointed in the quality of the story line in this latest installment.  The entire movie seemed to be written to successfully translate to video game format rather than to do justice to the Resident Evil family of films.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|It gives a good overview of Scott's life and the influences that shaped him.  I did like the recipes and his thoughts on health and nutrition.  I do think Scott comes across as naive or not completely honest.  Is it that hard to understand that a manic devotion and training that consumes all your time will have a negative impact on your marriage?  Otherwise I enjoyed it.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Denzel Washington was great but the whole plot was depressing.  If I am going to be depressed at the beginning I want to be smiling at the end.  Didn't happen here.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|Enjoyed this the several times I've read it.  The heroine is a star associate at her London law firm, going for partner.  Then there is a mistake identified, and her identity and future are suddenly blank.  The book is funny, but it's also touching, and you can feel her feelings, identify with her thoughts. I will read this one again.
B00459GJUM|5.0|Good story lines. Would be good to see it all tied together but I know it was cancelled a while ago.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The other books were great. This one seemed to drag on and was almost a chore to finish. I think the author ran out of story. The ending was flat. I easily buzzed through 1 through 4.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My wife had to buy her own kindle just so she could have her own relaxing melodies on her side of the bed!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Fresh new author with a unique writing style. I cant wait for her next book. This was just a fun fast read. Highly recommend it.
B0087DFIOU|3.0|Another reason not to go to Mexico.  After San Francisco, Mexico and Mexico City were my favorite places.  Not worth the risk anymore.
B00881VLCE|1.0|You have beautiful pics, but you rip people off. And that's not ok. I am very disappointed in your business practices.
6305882592|5.0|A really fun movie.  No time for popcorn.  Something mischivious going on in the background in every scene. Great acting, or just their personalities?
B005LAIIA8|4.0|I found this movie to be pretty good, but not ranked in my favorite movies. I watched this with my fiancee along with my dog, and it actually was very sad in some parts. When Victor's dog die's my Fiancee actually had some tears in her eyes (mostly due to the fact we both love our dog very much). You can tell instantly who created this movie when you see the dark graphics and creative characters. Tim Burton did a pretty good job with this move.<br /><br />I found the characters to have really good personalities to them, and Mr. Burton really expanded on everyone. The story to this movie is very good, and it is entertaining for not only kids but adults too. In my opinion this is one of Tim Burton's better recent movies.<br /><br />I believe Frankenweenie is a creative movie that plays off of Frankenstein with a twist for kids and adults to enjoy. The black and white stop motion was done beautifully, and this is to be expected since Tim Burton directed it. I feel that this movie really brought out the Tim Burton we all know from Nightmare Before Christmas to Big Fish.<br /><br />The plot is very good in the story and their is a wide variety of characters including Victor the main character and his puppy named sparky (ironically). Tim Burton really expanded on different characters including the godzilla like turtle in the end.<br /><br />All in all this was a pretty good movie and the BluRay quality is excellent. I feel that it is worth the $$ and time to watch this movie.
B00499NHLC|5.0|A fresh and intriguing look at Sherlock and Holmes played brilliantly by Cumberbatch and Freeman. Read there are 3 more episodes to come and can't wait!
B001CO42MU|5.0|I watched this movie a dozen times so far, and really enjoy it. Based in the 1970's George Jung (Depp) and Tuna head out to California to find themselves in the thick of a drug infused environment. The two east coast guys find themselves in Derek Foreal's eccentric salon discussing how they want to sell pot. Eventually George Jung becomes the name to buy from at that time and expands. He eventually is selling Coke to all the people of California in the late 70's and becomes the king pin of coke in California. Based on a true story George Jung and Pablo Ecobar go through a lot of rough patches together after meeting in prison.<br /><br />I found this movie to be quite entertaining. The cast is very good and work very well together. This is one of my favorite movies because it is a funny and entertaining movie. The movie itself is has a good plot and has its ups and downs. All in all a very good movie and worth the money on BluRay.
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughters love these dolls and everything that is from monster high, they can't stop plating and asking for more of them. this house is really nice, they loved it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is cool cooler than Temple Run way cooler<br />plez buy now<br />I said now!!!<br />what r u waiting for i said now!!!<br />now u r just trying to make me mad I said now!!!
0545323126|5.0|My daughters love these books, they cant stop reading them. they are great for kids to start appeciationg books, and most important the content is very good for kids.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great Bond Film.  The best 007 movie to date.  Full of action and suspense.  Would recommend this Bond movie to all 007 movie lovers.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Hard to describe completely, but match two squares and they disappear. Game is to get them all to disappear in the shortest period of time. Easy to play, nice graphics.
B001FVD65O|5.0|I have been a Die Hard fan since the first movie came out.  I have enjoyed each and every one of them, including the new one that just hit the theaters.  The only thing I missed in the last two was Bruce Willis's hair!
B001NLL93W|5.0|The obsession continues.  My desire to be in Jace and Clary's world continuously is unabated, which is why I am constantly reading these books.  Do yourself a favor and take up this series.
B000SZK41M|5.0|I have enjoyed every one of the Die Hard movies, including the newest one at the theater.  Love the action and the fun moments.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|These books are amazing.  Love the characters and storyline.  Can't wait for the 6th and final installment.  2014 can't arrive quick enough.
B002JODPSO|5.0|From the first, to the newest one out, I have enjoyed watching them.  Bruce Willis is a fun actor to watch, and I love all the quips and the action in each of the movies.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Can't put these books down and can't say enough good things about them.  Going on my 2nd time reading this series in anticipation of the film's release in August.  Read these books and show some YA love!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Great acting. Great writing.  You never know what is next.  A little like Indiana Jones--you keep asking yourself: &#34;How is he going to get out of this&#34;? Gruesome premise but it makes you look at society through a different lens.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game with good puzzles, if you go expert mode it's even more challenging and will give you hours (days) of intriguing gameplay. Brilliant graphics on my Kindle Fire HE.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I have to say, with the combo of the books & comics...this is the best series ever!!  If anyone is worried it's all zombie gore, it's not! It's really about the characters & their struggles with who they have to become & how they change in the face of such adversities.  It really makes you wonder what you would do if you were in this type of situation.  Would you crack?  Still be the leader you are now?  To what lengths would you go to survive??
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never taken the time to review a book before and have enjoyed or even loved others. Colleen Hoover does an amazing job of making the read care about her characters. I've not read her works before, and look forward to diving into others... Hopeless is a must read!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Loved it perfect for everyone bst of all was free for me... good for scrabble word challenges so get it
B005XN0SGU|4.0|Bounced around between a few reviews about various readers for comics on my Kindle Fire HD, and settled in on Perfect Viewer and so glad I did. Liitle tricky at first, but once you get the hang of adding your comics, it works great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really fun and cool and you'll keep wanting to play it and get high scores and try to beat your Facebook friends all positive nothing negative! Great games kids will love!!!!
B008CRC506|5.0|I've loved Katharine McPhee's voice since American Idol. It's now more mature and lovely. Everyone can sing and the songs are fantastic, really worthy of its own Broadway Musical.<br /><br />If you love musical theater this is not to be missed!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|If you can get past the first black and white episodes (which are still wonderful, if a bit melodramatic in the beginning), you will absolutely fall in love with the servants Rose, Mrs. Bridges, and Mr. Hudson. I was also happily surprised to find out that Jeane Marsh (Rose) CREATED and wrote this series. Amazing. I am now watching the last season (Season 5) - and wish it would never end.<br /><br />P.S. This is a good series to start if you are like me and need something similar to Downton Abbey in-between seasons!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I found it tricky to access once it was selected. I appreciate the specific directions on how to format the book for kindle. I need to turn my pictures into black and white, now.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie is the best we've seen in quite a while. It's a wonderful story of &#34;the graying hair set&#34;, like me, and how it is so possible to find a whole new life when we think it's all over. See this one with someone you love!!!
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Great action movie, intense, demographics was awesome. Definitely a but movie to watch again, but with prime time i can without buying it!!
B00B0NEH8C|5.0|They are back at it again with this straight-forward rocker.  I can't wait to hear this one live.  Clutch ROCKS!
B008602KQI|1.0|We watched this because of all the hype.... it was not good, it was just dumb... and I certainly understand all the hoopla.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is very fun! I play it all the time. I think you will like it too. Enjoy!!!! :)
B009YP9L7U|2.0|classic fairy tale... rewritten to include after effects of too much booze... Just as the title promises. Of course the printce is wealthy... and they live happily ever after
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|*Might have Spoilers*<br /><br />Wreck it Ralph was everything a great Disney movie, and good video game movie should be.  A wonderful story, engaging and believable characters, and wonderful visuals.  There is something for everyone in this film, especially people like me who grew up playing video games since the 80's.<br /><br />Wreck it Ralph centers around Ralph, resident bad guy for the arcade game Fix it Felix.  Day in and day out Ralph carries on his duties of wrecking one lone building, only to be defeated by Felix and the residents all the time.  Getting tired of always being labeled and treated like a &#34;bad guy,&#34; Ralph starts game jumping in hopes of becoming a hero and earning the respect and love Felix receives.<br /><br />Later on, he meets Vanellope van Schweetz in the game Sugar Rush.  Vanellope is a character with her own things to prove.  As a glitch in her respective game, her goal is to show characters in her game that she can race just as good as they can; despite her problem.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, the question lies on what makes a person; especially what makes a person a &#34;good&#34; guy, or a &#34;bad&#34; guy.  It also show what defines a hero, and that medals and labels are not what makes a true hero to somebody.<br /><br />What was also great about this film is Disney really took the time and research to appeal to gamers such as myself.  Anyone who has played console and arcade games since the 1980's will go giddy with excitement with all the references Disney managed to stuff into the film.  From Bowser, Zangief, and M. Bison at the Bad Anon meeting to the &#34;Aerith Lives&#34; FVII reference in graffiti on one of the walls at the game station; there is something for everyone.<br /><br />Wreck it Ralph is a wonderful movie for kids and adults and it's on my top ten Disney movie list.  I feel Disney really made a stupendous effort and it's one of the best movies they made in the past 20 years.
0979019710|5.0|Today was day #35 doing my Miracle Mornings and green smoothies and I think that I can officially call myself a &#34;Morning Person&#34; for the first time in life!! I feel great, excited and rejuvenated about life. I am in the midst of a very stressful 5 years (i'm in year 3) of dental school (my 2nd career) with a 2.5 year old and a husband to manage. I am really thrilled that this was the answer to my prayer of trying to figure out how to do life a bit better. I am thankful beyond belief for stumbling upon this book and getting the push to get out of bed EARLY every morning to help me stay focused and maintain some time to &#34;keep the vision&#34;. I am so excited to see everyone else's success and continue to make sure that I do not let the old habits set back in. It's a daily commitment to excellence and I really treasure that. Its absolutely worth buying and giving a try.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I had seen the commercials for this movie on tv and though it looked like a movie I might enjoy and I did.  The movie kept me intrigued and on edge to find out what really happened and what was going to happen next.  Was surprised by the ending and would recommend this to friends to watch.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|This is amazing shut gets real really quick, this was a awesome read looking forward to reading the rest of the books.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Was okay, but I did fall asleep during part of it, so it shows it was not the most entertaining movie.  Have seen others of this venue that I like better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so addictive I cant put it down I love it a lot everyone should have this app yay
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.  Purely an entertaining movie.  More recommended for teenagers or someone who doesn't want to have to think, just sit back watch and relax.
B00APUTEBG|2.0|Sick & Stupid Score: 2/7*<br /><br />This is an amateur movie, especially because of its stilted dialog, clueless acting, and uncreative plot.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is on screen for the first 20 minutes and then disappears, something we have noticed in several so-called Bruce Willis movies lately.  It seems he is just selling his name to the movie producers.  Ditto for Sigourney Weaver, although she does hang around until the end of the show, she pops in and out as needed, trying to look and act convincing as a stone-cold spy mistress.  She gives a ridiculous performance.<br /><br />Otherwise, no-talent actors, uninteresting plot, and a couple obligatory car chases, probably filmed only for the purpose of making the trailer.  Made on the cheap in Spain.<br />________________________________<br />* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Despite the fact that I am a fan of Liam Neeson, I also am a fan of Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried. Some of the scenes made me want to cry, but overall I loved how Tom Hooper made an adaptation so faithful to a well-known musical. This movie is a great time for practically everyone who is a fan of musicals, or fans of Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham Carter, or Hugh Jackman in general.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Everyone in any kind of business needs to read this book... especially if they use any kind of process or use computers.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This book first provides a way of viewing our modern world in order to understand how we, as individuals, are not free in our lives. Essentially, we live according to the agreements the world has made FOR us, rather than through the ones that would empower and set us free. The author then lists some simple agreements we must make that would allow us to live how we want, regardless of the agreements or values of those around us. It is a quick and very accessible read that provides a basic layout for self improvement. I recommend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very unexpected turns throughout the book.  Considered putting it away several times because of the foul sexual comments, but kept on going to see how they worked out  their problems.  Unfortunately, their crimes were only made available to a new generation, in the end.  I felt a curious combination of interest and disgust; vacillating between the two throughout the book.<br />They both had me fooled right up to the end.<br />Probably won't read her future books.
B0042L78MG|5.0|i orderded this cd because i heard it travelying to another city, and i really liked that one song, thanks.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved this book. Best I've read in a very long time. I especially loved the way he moves between cyberspace and the real world.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|It was enlightening.  Kind of slow  at times, but I was in the mood to sit and watch, so okay.<br />Meryl Streep is always excellent!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Iron Man is a hero for today's generation.  My cousin loves Iron Man because, he's cool and charismatic.  I love Captain America because, he's the good guy.  The success of the Marvel movies probably has a lot to do with the apparent trend that people are starving for nostalgia.  So, you can sell-up the cool guy all day long but, in the end, you want the good guy in your foxhole.  You might think that in saying so much, I'm taking this movie to be more than what it is: a movie.  But, you have movies and, you have cinemagic.  The cinemagic are the movies that sweep you up and make you cheer for the characters.  Those are the movies that stick with you because, they embody concepts and, they're cathartic in the way in which theater was intended.<br /><br />This movie was decent.  I've not seen the Iron Man movies, I've not seen Thor, or The Hulk, but, I have seen The Avengers.  This movie was good; The Avengers was much better.  But, for the way they portrayed Captain America in The Avengers, I had to see this movie.  And, for Captain America, I loved this movie.<br /><br />I am not a comic book enthusiast but, I know quite a bit about comic book characters.  Nor am I an avid movie go-er.  I do, however remember when they released the previews for Captain America and, I just remember being disappointed, thinking this would be another over-hyped, modernized destruction of a very iconic figure of American culture.  And, given the history behind the Captain America comic books, Captain America is a piece of Americana, in a sense that the current generations can't fathom.  I was tired of the marvel movies, they seemed overdone and, it was a little painful to think that Captain America was going to fall into Hollywood's grasp.<br /><br />But, to my surprise, the screen writer and director for The Avengers did a really good job of writing the dialogue, to do Captain America some justice.  I felt like they really cared enough about the embodiment of the character to keep thedialogue fairly true to what Captain America should represent.<br /><br />Now, truthfully, The Avengers would get five stars and, I would probably give Captain America four stars because, there are a few instances where I would've liked to see more of the Captain America from The Avengers in this movie but, it is almost like you get more of the really solid all-American out of the Captain America in The Avengers because he's a contrast to modernity.  Where, in the Captain America movie, he's in his element, he doesn't stand out as much because, every man is nearly as quality as he is, he just happens to be the super soldier but, he's not such a stark contrast of character in comparison to his fellow soldiers.  It's kind of the whole thing about: there's nothing special about him; he's just a kid from Brooklyn.<br /><br />And, the digital copy of this movie is CHEAPER than some of the others.  So, buy it, watch it, and cheer for Captain America, you who would be commies.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Every now and then we get a great product from Hollywood.  Wish we could say the same about Washington DC
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|I love light mysteries. This was good. The characters are vivid, and the story humorous. I just got the second book, and can't wait to read it.
B0022Q8CSC|2.0|Anyone who says that this book is better than the movie knows little about literature, and even less about film.<br />I was impressed with how close the movie was to the book, almost scene for scene. And the book isn't bad, but it is not as dramatic, cerebral, or complex as the film.<br />It is clear that in the film version Francis Ford Copolla and the stellar cast (Marlin Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall) improved upon almost every aspect of the book. They turned what is a decent paperback crime novel into high art, and I don't see how anyone can watch the film and not be disappointed by the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is on order right now.  We have seen seasons 1 and 2.  At first my husband was not interested in an English series.  I suggested he watch two episodes and decide.  We are HOOKED. It is so much fun to see the interaction between the aristocracy and their servants and their interesting lives.  Maggie Smith is so funny and so talented.  I saw her in the Quartet, a recent release, such a great actress.  We are anxiously awaiting delivery of season 3 of Downton Abbey and delighted to hear a four season is in the offing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is an interesting thing that a show not only depicts the life of the wealthy, but of the servants as well. If you enjoy a good drama, here is your show.
B002SJKWZ4|3.0|It turns on the TV and runs the volume, but that's about it. I paid a lot of money for it to not work very well, but my daughter was happy. Had I known it didn't work so great I probably wouldn't have bought it.
B00574P9EQ|1.0|I struggled with the books because the behavior of the kids in them is not how I want my kids to act.  The movie takes it up a notch and makes it more real.  We watched for 10 minutes and turned it off.  No thanks.
B002DD46P2|4.0|It is good and excellent score. The quality of the  product  is decent. it is worth listening.the pitch of score us low.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|This is the first album I've bought in a while. Glad I did, it has some great tracks on it, in addition to Madness.
0767805712|5.0|Came very quickly, indeed. They are making more write more words here but I don't have much else to say.
1416562605|3.0|The White Tiger was well written and whoever the edtitor was helped as the text was tight and clear and easy to get through. As a person who has lived in India I knew the characters and their minds. Two different worlds and two classes. The book explores some great themes and also how India is rapidly changing. I loved the feeling of the entrepreneurial spirit. Corruption is extreme in India and people there find it more offensive that you question it. The cost of a life is brought into question and I like how the author leaves it hanging in the air. Not enough writers leave the reader take the story further in imagination or in terms of morality. However I found the book lacking in practices of Hindus asking their Gods for a whole plethora of things, the India Princess complex which is blatent narcisism, how Indians living in the UK and the USA are in a different time reality and the indigenous part of India to also be fair. I found it odd something so neat won the Man Booker Prize but hey good luck to the author I hope his next book explores themes more deeply and teases them out a bit more.
B00005JL78|5.0|Came very quickly.  That's right. They are making more write more words here but I don't have much else to say.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hunger Games...enjoyed the book very much. Hard to put down. Couldn't wait to start the next book.  Loved the movie as well. Five Star rating.
B004XQO90O|5.0|Came very quickly, and that's a good thing. They are making more write more words here but I don't have much else to say.
B0017SWPXY|2.0|The plot was too predictable and because of many descriptions about racing the plot was strechted. I was very disappointed.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|The interactions between the main characters are wonderful.  Plot lines are interesting and the show keeps you guessing.  Would recommend this show to all adults, not so kid friendly though.
034580404X|5.0|I am not typically a reader but bought this series because I heard so many great things about it and was going to be out of work recovering from surgery. I could not put these books down! A love story (granted a little x-rated) but it was god- plenty of twists and turns to keep you on your toes. Enjoyed so much I am reading it again. The set with the cover to keep them together is helpful.
B003QSOFFO|5.0|It's Pocahontas, seriously do you need to know more? It's amazing; it's pre-Mel Gibson hates Jewish people; Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a fun game to play but whenever i get close to buy something that cost a lot of money it takes all of my money away when i dident even buy anything. That is the only bad thing that i would have to say about the game
B002BY77CW|5.0|This is a great light read. I read it while at work (have a lot of down time) but it would be a great beach, vacation or flight book.
0062060562|5.0|This was the my book club’s choice for December, and I absolutely LOVED it. Right away, I was drawn into the story and basically did not want to put it down. The fact that the main character loses her memory every night when she does to sleep makes for a great mystery. The storytelling in this book was phenomenal. Some parts were so intimate, so beautifully female that I was astounded to discover that the author is male! In any case – this book was a great mystery, with really interesting storytelling. All throughout the book, I kept exclaiming and tell my husband how much I loved it and how much he needs to read it. I’d basically recommend it to everyone I know.
1878424114|4.0|I enjoyed the book and the CD. The advices are conscie, precise, to the point, practical. And it is helpful to read/listen from time to time to remember the concepts.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Fun and entertaining. Just wish there were some instructions on how to handle the submarine. I think I'll keep at it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very challenging and interesting with lots of optical illusions<br />And I love it. It's like a temple run but better.
0345529057|5.0|I loved the multiple plots and the development of all the characters.  Once I started I couldn't put it down and am now find myself lost without more.  Can't wait for the next one!  Please George, get on with it!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better. I cant wait for the rest of the seasons come out and to me.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I loved this show right from the very first episode.  It is so much fun to watch them from the beginning.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is a set that will be used over and over again. We cant get enough of The Walking Dead
B001HQZJPM|5.0|I really enjoyed The Mummy and The Mummy Returns.  Not so much the third installment.  But the whole package of the three DVD's was a great deal.
B009LDXQGC|3.0|If you own all of 3 doors down cd go ahead and make your own greatest hits.  There is many songs missing from this collection.  I have them all do I will make my own instead of buying this cd.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|What's not to love?  It's fun to watch the characters grow and to watch their personalities come out.  Was that sarcasm?  No way.
B003Y5H5C4|3.0|The comedy in this film is top notch and you'll definitely be in for some laughs.  The acting is superb and that's largely to do with the excellent casting.  Swordson and ansari are an amazing set of comics in their own right.  Danny mcBride basically plays Kenny Powers here but it doesn't matter as it fits in so well with the plot.<br /><br />The only thing that left me wanting more was the scope of the script.  I felt like it could have been a little more in depth on the romance and the ending was one of those I wish it hadnt ended affairs.<br /><br />The ad libbing was pretty good but noticeable for sure.  You won't think the actors lines are scripted.  Overall worth a rent but not a buy.  the extra features are the usual behind the scenes lovefest and outtakes.  Nothing too impressive but again worth a one time watch.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I gave this five stars because my 12 year old loves it. She sings and hums the songs constantly and it can be heard blasting from her room when she is cleaning it. If it weren't for the cleaner room I'd give it one star because I am sick of hearing it. But the cleaner room effect will win me over every time. I hope you get the same effect as I did or you will sadly have sweaty shoe (what 22 sounds like blasting through a basement bedroom door) stuck in your head forever for nothing.
B009AP4MGE|5.0|This episode had some great performances by the girls and also gave us an idea of what is to come of some of the characters
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I typically try not to get wrapped up in TV shows when they first air, because I just don't have the time or schedule to. I've been wanting to watch this show since it started. Having such easy access to the show and being able to watch it on my time is great. The video quality and quick streaming give me the chance to watch at my convenience. I would highly recommend this as the best way to catch up or watch a show.
0307266303|5.0|This book not only has some great history on running in various parts of the world, but has very informative descriptions on proper form and why that form is better for long term running to avoid injury and various people groups who have used those running styles.  Very entertaining book and one that will inspire anyone to run further, faster, and keep on running!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Very Nice. Downloaded it recently and have tried it only once. So far it appears interesting and a good 'pass time'.
B00A3AY134|5.0|All of 3 Doors' CDs are awesome but having all of their hits on one CD is fantastic!  I love it!
B000641D2Y|5.0|I would love to take a holiday vacation to New York and I still bust out laughing with Tim Curry rushing into the hotel room trying to catch Kevin.  My whole family loves this movie and I can't wait to have a family of my own to share this classic with them as well.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones was outstanding.<br />There was not an excessive use of bad language.<br />I would reccomend this film to all adults.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|For years my family has read the books and watched the movies while I have shunned the series altogether.  I finally decided to purchase the box set and while yes, it doesn't seem to have a bunch of special features it does have all the movies which is what I cared about anyway as I am not a Harry Potter fanboy.  My boyfriend and I watched it over a 6 week period and we actually really enjoyed the films.  I'm thinking about having another Harry Potter weekend when the next 3 day weekend rolls around.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Wish other 2 books in trilogy had been written earlier. This ends on a cliffhanger and then you have to wait for the other 2 books.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Very touching movie about love between father and daughter and how difficult it is sometimes to show love as you should.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|i loved it!! great story line!! i loved how all the clues were very thought out and it was just a very fun game! very recommended for the kindle fire!
B0001I55SS|4.0|Me and my family are writing this review in the future-past. Yes we have been sucked into the black hole singularity. I pushed my wife in first then my sons. They don't seem to understand, I must live. But it has me, I can't break free. Quick hit the boosters. Ahhhhhhh! (J/K) But it's a DVD movie better then VHS. Might want to hold out for the BluRay or Super BluRay. When ever they come out. Disney needs your money for more Star Wars movies!...
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I am a die hard josh groban fan I love this compact disc Josh is showing a more mature sound on the compact disc
B000PC0SPU|5.0|I'm not into most psychological reading.  Having this book acquired reading for the course actually made me look differently at the material. As a student in Graphic Design I didn't quite get the reasoning for psychology in a design class. This book changed my thoughts on that and I feel I have learned a lot from the material, examples and exercises provided.
B00B935SUY|5.0|I absolutely loved the documentary.  Dave did an incredible job of covering the history of Sound City including a wide variety of musicians who gravitated to Sound City for one reason or another.  Loved the music.  Paul McCartney added a great surprise.  So happy Dave was able to save the board.  Great job!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not a book I'd normally read, but WOW, what a roller coaster of a read it is ...  almost got whiplash from the twists & turns. I could NOT put it down once I was hooked!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|this was also a gift so i am not sure what to say here.  Except, that my granddaughter loved it!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have used the free version for 6 or so months decided to up grade. I did not have any problems with the free version it has been so great could not do without it. I have installed this app on all of our devices,android phones x2,all 3 kindled as well as our Asus tablet works great and could not do without it. Installed on my husband's phone and he was unsure at 1st now he can't do without it. Thanks so much and I always look at the apps you create 1st to see if you have what I need. Recommended this version or the free one both or great.
B007EDYN36|4.0|Very informative  Peter holds nothing back about how evil Gene Simmons & Paul Stanley are, this book is a must have for all kiss fans
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved Season 2 of Downton Abbey.  Looking forward to seeing Season 3 and hoping it will be available soon.
B000002HO3|5.0|My wife and I both love this album. It has some of the greatest hits, plus some songs I didn't know but have grown to love. If you like Simply Red, buy it. If not, buy it anyway.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love it!  This is addictive! I look forward to receiving a response from the people I play with. Love the interaction! Fun.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|It's a pretty good movie. Not as good to me as some of my friends thought it was, but I like it. It's definitely worth watching, but it won't go down as one of my all time favorites.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Engaging from the beginning, with interesting character development, but somewhat predictable in the end. An enjoyable read, with insight into the physical and moral dilemmas faced by quadriplegics and their caregivers.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|How weird is it that this was a suggested item from Amazon when the search I'd done was for Macklemore....But when I saw 120 5 star reviews I was intrigued, so I took a chance and just bought it sound unheard. What a gem of a find. I second the earlier comparisons to the Beta Band and Modest Mouse and even throw in a hint of the Shins, but the comparisons are only for reference. This is a great album by great musicians and it will forever keep them on my radar.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun little game that occupies you when you need a distraction.  It is a game that you come back to between reading to see how your little dragons are coming along.
B000Q79HS8|4.0|Good example that a following series can be done well and be as thrilling as the first one. Great acting. Would recommend all 3 Bourne movies.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|I received this incorrectly in vinyl from Barnes and Noble prior to Christmas and did not get to listen until the new year.  No matter.  It was terrific to hear something traditional enough but filled with lots of unusual choices and unique renditions of classics.  Thank you to public radio for bringing Tracey Thorn into my consciousness.  You would do well to snap up a copy  or download this CD, and I might well check into other work she has produced.
B005HSL626|1.0|that game looked weird so I wanted to see how boring it was and it is boring I'm deeleting it from my kindle
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I seriously could not set this book down! I found myself looking forward to reading the book every quiet place that I could. My first Nicholas Sparks novel& I loved. What a unpredictable ending. It definitely warms your heart.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|A fun light read!  Great book for the beach!!  And who doesn't love cupcakes!?!?  Can't wait to read more by this author!
B003XDUCIG|4.0|Its a very good book. To rate it great I would look for a little more wit and witticism but very practical and interesting. I would definitely buy it again.<br /><br />the recipes are great!
B00AGKH7K0|3.0|This one is not as good as the other one - the songs are a little mellower which I wasn't looking for.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was well written and you didn't want to put the book down.  It also added a little spice to your life!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I hve to say I don't regret getting this app. We're heading to Northern Ontario, Canada. It Is great that I hve been able to track weather in a number of cities . Between here and their we have almost a 1000 miles one way and having this device , I am abe to view a 10 day period to figure out the good weather days from their to hear. GOOD CHOICE. I must say
0807014273|5.0|the meaning in life is not in circumstance or  &#34;stuff&#34;...it is in you...and impacts life around you (the opposite of leaning on circumstances to get meaning)

WONDERFUL!!!!!

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie. I don't think that there is anything that Denzel Washington plays in that isn't good. This movie was excellent. Especially if you know of someone in a similar situation.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is the best all-around puzzle app I have seen. So simple to use that my nearly 4-year-old can play, and configurable enough to keep dad entertained too. Plenty of free photos to choose from, and even more for purchase, if wanted. The original Kindle Fire's screen starts getting too small once you go above 111 pieces, but otherwise, I would highly recommend this app.

B008GJVH7M|4.0|This is a favorite of mine from the early Coen brothers movies. The complex motivations of the character s pays off in the action. You are rewarded for multiple viewings of the movie.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|It does what it needs to do, but, you really don't need this App unless you plan to do videos, because there is already a camera on your Kindle in the Photos tab. I got it b/c my Kindle cam disappeared on me one night and I couldn't Skype. I thought I needed to by the camera, turns out, I needed to do a hard restart. Holy smokes! I wasted 2 bucks!!!

B0036BK6MW|3.0|I believe this is the movie I paid and rented, but did not actually find the time to watch, so I can't give you a realistic review
B00AAQ7LP6|2.0|What can I say? I went to a concert for Rihanna's Loud tour and was disappointed by the sound; the music was too loud to hear clearly, and Rihanna's lyrics were very quiet and were mumbled - at one point, and I'm not exaggerating, I genuinely had no idea what song was being performed. I put the problems down to the venue and the possibility that Rihanna was simply ill on the night of the concert that I attended, so watched my sister's copy of this dvd to see what the concert should be like...<br /><br />... Well now I know that the sound issues weren't down to the particular venue - the dvd has iffy sound too, so the problem must lie with the tour equipment. Sure in comparison to the live experience the sound on the dvd is good, but in comparison to other concert dvds it is sort of muffled. Kind of like hearing something underwater.<br /><br />Plus Rihanna wasn't ill on the night I saw her. Sorry to Rihanna fans, but I think that this dvd shows that she's just not all that. Sure; she sounds great on her albums, but she is a bit all over the place live. The vocals are there at times [especially for the final third of the show], but she doesn't have a lot of control over them.<br /><br />***<br /><br />With  the dvd I spent more time looking beyond the sound issues and was left underwhelmed by the Loud show as a whole. The set pieces were random and blend-in-the-background dark, the costumes were dull, the dancing was the usual 'dry humping' and the set list was boring - she picked too many of her filler songs to perform.<br /><br />To sum it up; the dvd bored me and helped me make up my mind not to waste money on another Rihanna concert.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is amazing, full of characters that you quickly get to know and grow to love or hate!  The ups & downs are reel feelings felt by most viewers.  There are plenty of laughs, joys, tears and sorrows to keep it evenly rounded.
055338466X|5.0|I loved this book and will be looking for more of his books soon. It was well written for the lay person who doesn't have indepth knowledge of many of the concepts explored in the book, and the wonderful pictures throughout made for a better reading experience.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy playing this game - I win just enough to make it fun. It always works perfectly. Great to play a game with no glitches.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Good read somber would liked to have a glossary of characters beginning hard to find out who's who in story
B0095R64AO|3.0|This movie was fine, but it got way too slow in the middle and you started wondering when it was going to be over. It's not as funny as most movies with Jason Segel. I was really excited about this movie because I love Jason Segel and I'm engaged right now, but this movie didn't even impress it's target audience: someone like me. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't. Won't watch a second time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is okay I think you should be able to choose your scenery and also be able to interact with things and not just running please fix it it is getting boring look at the awesome features on temple run 2 and but some excitement to it please and thankyou.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|It's a great, modern movie with a little edge... a Must Watch! Got it for the wifey for Valentine's Day and she LOVES IT!!!
0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One is a book about video games, obsession, virtual reality, greed, pop culture, society, sociopaths, love and much more. Should you read this book, you will be led through a virtual world called the Oasis on a hunt for an insanely well hidden Easter egg.  You will share the many triumphs and setbacks of the main character and will learn a lot about the history of gaming along the way.  It is rare to find a book this good. 5/5

B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent plot. The steady dripping of details about the case of the 'Gone Girl' was riveting. Highly recommend this novel...
B008NABUU8|5.0|Always a blast brings out old ideas from when I was a kid trying to think of ways of constructing bridges... definitely love the graphics.. the 1.99 it costs is worth it.

B0078YWDHO|4.0|Great movie and thought it was worth the time to watch it.  Would recommend to others as well as friends.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game.  Kept me entertained for hours at a time.  You won't get bored playing this one.
B001N4Q4MA|4.0|Good story line and simple plot added enjoyment to the truth in this lovely adaptation of the Dr. Seuss book of the same title. My grandson loved the action and the characters and stayed envolved with the movie only loosing interest a few times. And I also enjoyed the story enough to have watched this several times now with my grandson.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it makes you think on the spot. Plus this game brings suspense with every single turn. :)
B0060CV31C|3.0|I found the story line disjointed and punctuated with irrevalent scenes and jokes. My granson showed interest in only in specific parts and lost interest in others
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game really is. But the realism sucks so bad its rediculous. I mean come on I'm flying through the ceiling. And the controls suck like a fat guy on a frosting tube
0375851569|5.0|This book has a nice set of Seuss classics to entertain parents as well as there children. As a grandmother, I remember reading all these to my own children. Nice way to pass the stories on to their children
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Really fun and beautiful. Would like to see separate screen for scores. Would like to have option of smaller cube to take less time; easier to play when you have just a few minutes.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Enjoy playing with this...it is so much fun - loaded it on my kindle and have played it quite a bit!

B009VMN3RA|5.0|Sachi Parker 's childhood was at best chaotic and at its worst full of neglect and disappointment. It was so sad to read about her loneliness and her struggles at the hands of both her parents. Well written!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband and sons and they loved it...great price and it arrived very quick and exactly as presented.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game! It's the best free ap of the day Amazon has released in a long time. It's fun, challenging but not frustratingly impossible, and good for maintaining hand-eye coordination (or even developing it in young folks). I highly recommend it.
B008Y1YK9Y|2.0|Will Smith is always great...but this sequel wasn't a good as the first two...it's okay to watch but not to purchase.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|A very moving and authentic novel -- the story of an early onset Alzheimer sufferer told from her point of view.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Making this movie must have been a hoot. There are likely alot of blooper reels. Tom Cruise was on top of his game and never fails to impress. The sound track is right from that generation.
0439023513|4.0|Took me a long time to get on board with this trilogy.  I watched Hunger Games movie first. In the movie version, I liked the subtle, accidental strength of Katness.  But now to the books.  In three books, the only time I saw Katness as showing true strength, loyalty and love is when she volunteered for Prim in the first Hunger Games.  Mostly, she is suspicious and trust is not in her bones. There are some exceptions like Rue and a few other's but that is overtaken by how the author seemed to highlight Katness's weaknesses vs. her strengths. Is this what keeps her alive?  Is this the moral to the story the author wants to portray to a young audience?  It never seems that Katness wanted anything more than to live her life under the rule of the Capitol and go with the flow.  Yet, why then, did she shoot that apple out of the pig's mouth in the first place?  Where did that come from?  Was her only motive to call attention to herself for no particular purpose?  I guess I don't ever know her motives.  Does she even have any motives other than revenge and hate?  So I gave the book(s) 4 stars.  It is layered but I think there were many lost opportunities by the author to make this better.  It is sad, dismal and it clearly comments on the fact that humanity is generally evil and self serving. That humanity, no matter how many chances we have to make it right, it is inherent that we won't. Come on couldn't Katness tell Peta she loved him at the end?  Instead, all the poor guy gets is a \\"real\\".  What the author did with Peta is an entire diatribe I won't get into.  As American's, maybe we can't believe that life can be like this.  There is a non-fiction book called The Aquariums of Pyongyang about life in North Korea.  Life in our world can be worse than in the Hunger Games.  I recommend that book to anyone who wants to read about true terror and an evil government.  As to the title of my review, I found this ironic because it is a quote from Jennifer Lawrence's character Tiffany from the movie Silver Linings Playbook.  TIFFANY: What? You're not gonna read that s*** on my time. I can tell you all about the \\"Lord of the Flies.\\" It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.  Finally, I do believe the next chapters of the movie versions will fix the gaping holes left by the author.  I don't need a happy fairy tale ending but I do need Katness to have the depth that is hinted at but never fully realized in any of the books.  I recommend the books.  They missed the mark on many levels but also hit some marks also.  It will make you think and for that, it gets high marks.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|A new Bond and a new lease on life. Looking forward to getting into this character as my new super spy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't like it at first, but by the  fourth chapter, I couldn't put the book down.  A must read before seeing the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is practically the same as temple run 1 except for the mega monkey and the rope. I really like the new stuff
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the entire series.  Now, I guess my 12 year grandson will let me see the movie.  It's probably already on DVD.  Am anxious to start another book.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It is a total copy of Mario. But it is the best app ive ever played in my life. Download it now!
0547569653|4.0|OK - so I am not an ultramarathoner, and I am not a vegetarian.  I will never run more than 10 miles, and I will never give up meat.  I tell you this because so many of the reviews of this book are written by hard core marathoners/ultra-marathoners, and by vegetarians/vegans.  And many of these reviewers want to read about these lifestyles.  That is not why I read this book.<br /><br />I read this book because I like a good story.  And sports stories, when well done, can be great.  This is not a great book.  But it does make you want to get your ass off the couch and go for a run.  So for that reason alone, it is a good read.<br /><br />The best part of the book is his description of the races themselves, which include hallucinations, dry heaves, and other ultra-marathoning gore.  But the parts on his diet strike me as preachy, and a bit long winded.<br /><br />If you are only going to read one book about running, Born To Run is a more fun read.  And (although a bit out-dated), Once A Runner will also make you want to get off the couch.  But this book is a good addition to the genre.
1592407889|4.0|If you need a license to go fishing or drive a car, why don't you need one to have kids? I know that it is an absurd question, but after reading a book like this it makes me wish that all the self-absorbed people taking up space on this planet would step back, realize parenthood is not for them, and take some steps to guarantee they never inflict themselves on a child.<br />Count me as one person who absolutely never could understand why Shirley MacLaine would drop her child off with its father on a different continent and effectively become a MIA parent. O.K., the story Shirley floated was that was her way to keep her daughter safe from possible kidnappers and under the protective care of the father. However, as this story unrolls the now adult child, author Sachi Parker paints a curious and at times unsettling picture of a remote and almost non-existent mother and a father who was strange and oddly not much better as the in residence parent than the decidedly hands off parent Shirley. Devoid of a secure childhood/home life this story details Parker's peculiar relationship with both parents. Beyond the personal story of Sachi's relationship with her parents and glimpses of their personal lifestyles,  Parker weaves a really strange tale of how estranged hubby Steve Parker scammed millions out of MacLaine.<br />While this book may be in a certain sense not unexpected due to Shirley MacLaine's and Steve Parker's unconventional relationship, it shifts a lot of attention from MacLaine's spiritual life to her personal life.<br />I liked this book. While on the face of it, it seems like Parker is following in the path of the celebrity daughters of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis I didn't find that to be the case. This book is less about verbal and physical abuse and more about a longing for a relationship that really doesn't exist. It left me wishing that MacLaine would take her mind off previous lives and the spiritual and work on the present.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I got this game as the Free App of the Day a little while back (and the dev says I'll get another free game of some sort for writing this review). With that disclaimer out of the way, I can say that this game is quite good, although not perfect.<br /><br />GOOD: For the most part, objects are hidden in logical places. You generally won't find a hammer in a cloud or anything like that. There are a few different sorts of cues for finding objects, including silhouettes, textual names of the objects, and &quot;find all the x's&quot;. There are also occasional minigames, like unscramble the note. That keeps things a little more interesting than always using one type of cue. The game is a good length, worthy of the asking price ($2.99 at the time of this writing). The dialogue in between scenes is a little cheesy, but often funny. The artwork is decent, although it is glaringly obvious that some components in a given scene were originally rendered at a significantly different resolution than others. This is a little annoying, but does not significantly affect gameplay. The sounds and music are appropriate and fairly unobtrusive. They can be disabled if you don't want them, anyway. Finally, the game has that ineffable fun factor. I kept coming back to it whenever I had a few free moments until I finished it!<br /><br />BAD: Sometimes the objects are hidden in such a way that they are very hard to see or tap. This often happens near the top of the screen and requires zooming in to make the object visible. Objects sometimes were behind the box showing cues, too. That said, all objects were at least partially visible with the right combination of zooming and panning. The dialogue was pretty clearly written by someone who is not a native English speaker. This resulted in some unintentional hilarity, but also gave a somewhat amateurish impression at times. The language issue may also be responsible for a bit of incoherence in the story. For one thing, it seemed to me that the writers assumed that I had played some other game before this one (I actually had played Mysteryville a few days prior, so that's not it). This was a little puzzling at times, but did not affect the actual gameplay. The hard-to-follow story was the worst part of the experience in my opinion.<br /><br />OVERALL: Despite a few flaws, this is a fun hidden-object game. The experience is easily worth the asking price and will keep you busy for quite a while of object-seeking fun. I will definitely consider purchasing  further games from this developer.riters assumed that I had played some other game before this one (I actually had played Mysteryville a few days prior, so that's not it).

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|AWSOME!  Absolutly AWSOME!  Far excided all of our expectations.  We accually watched the second season first on tv, so we bought the first becouse the second was so good and man it was worth it.  We are about to order the second season too by the way.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game ever.It is much cooler then any app that you have.GET THIS APP!!!!!even the lite game is so cool! GET THIS APP!!!!
B00908DDZM|5.0|This album is incredible, front to back. If you're a hip hop fan, Ben Haggerty (Macklemore) and Ryan Lewis will blow your mind. Every track, every beat, every bar is money. If you're looking for club bangers and gangsta flash braggadocio, keep moving. This is for real listeners, this for people who get it.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|Hoping Season 4 of Downton Abbey starts soon.  Yes, I know will have to wait.  The BEST Series!!<br />Everything about Downton Abbey is so great, costumes, acting and no commercials!!!!<br />PBS has done a fantastic job!!  OK, right, I'll be waiting with my cuppa tea, Toodle Pip!!
B00A1XIXM8|3.0|After a few full listens, It doesn't feel as carefully crafted as the last few albums, but it's still a good BR record, especially if you like the faster stuff. But I can't help feeling like their trying to hard to sound like a younger band. I liked the maturity that came through the better songs from Dissent of Man, Empire Strikes First, and New Dark Ages, and I wish they had continued in that vein, instead of shifting gears to remind us that they can still keep up with the kids. Still, I'm glad I got it, but I don't expect it will go down as a favorite.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is one of the best most current espionage books I've read in a very long time.  The author is up to date on computer sabotage, drones, etc.  It's a &#34;page turner&#34; and I couldn't put it down.  There are surprises at every turn.
B008B3H4VQ|3.0|I guess I'm one of the rare fans that would have preferred a real continuation of the creative direction from A Thousand Suns. Since this definitely isn't that, it was a bit of a disappointment. If you discovered LP from the Transformers sound track songs, you'll probably like this a lot. But while it calls back to more of the feel of Meteroa, it's not half as good as that excellent album. Unless you insist on having the entire LP catalog, you could probably skip this one.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is the second Lee Child mystery I've read, and it won't be the last!  It's a well crafted plot full of twists and turns.  Jack goes to help out his aunt in Florida, and the first surprise begins there, and doesn't stop until the surprise ending.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game reminds me of the the same type in Vegas.  It is fun and relaxing.  Unfortunately, I lose most of my coins off of the side.  lol
B005K17RU0|5.0|On the weekly section I wish it would show rain or snow if in evening...you could show it as coming down right side cloud as being end of day.this way you can see full day of each day in one glance without having to open each one for quick glance of what upcoming week will be like. Otherwise it is a great app...thanks
B00355L2TU|5.0|Love Jillian on the show, so thought I would try the DVD.  This is an amazing workout.  Highly recommend to anyone wanting a kick in the tail.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you have read other books by him, this will not disappoint.  I've already finished the second book in the trilogy and can't wait for #3.  Also, this is a good read to go along with watching &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; - - same time period.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I chose this rating because the connection is very erratic.  The past 2 weeks it takes me many many tries to get connected to the internet and this can be very frustrating.  Of course this happens only on my kindle fire, not my home computer.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|I love this game but it has a lot of lagging and I get stuck on screen and it freezes in one level and I can't go any further so I started another person if it does it again I will uninstall and up date my review.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Our whole family really enjoyed this movie! It was very funny and and the animation was very well done. We recommend it!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|At first when I started playing I thought it was great fun, but every time you stop playing and start again you lose everything you have played for, so you get no where fast, I just uninstalled and looking for something else to waste time with.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This was one if the better movies we have watched lately! We would and have recommend this movie to others.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Goes to the next generation, Jack Ryan Jr. Good plot and character formation. It is an easy read for all ages.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|So far I like this app and will be trying it out soon, to see how it might help me to relax
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just really want an update so badly<br />Youtube videos are beter<br />Please im begging u<br />Im ganna buy some tags<br />Only got 20$ in my pocket<br />See it has pocket in it
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much....I liked the author's writing style and the characters and everything else!  I'm glad I read this!
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|Miserable, flat, predictable, feels like it was written by a angst ridden pre-teen.  The fact that it would be picked up for a film staggers me.  Hey holleywood, get an amazon account and read the reviews!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!
B004HD61KE|3.0|Haven't read all the way through yet...which is telling. It is a book I can put down.<br /><br />Good book but a few too many parallel story lines.
B008Q09K2U|4.0|But a bit short on story! Typical later deMille, longish, funny, but a bit too much like a travelogue, and basic story a bit short. Still enjoyable though, and the funny bits are laugh out loud funny!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love how this cube works. You can turn it around, upside down to get to the different blocks. The best part for me is that I can actually see the blocks on my Kindle Fire which is very nice for older eyes!<br /><br />The graphics are beautiful.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|This is such a new great way to play mahjongg.  Keeps your mind turning.  A fun twist to an already thought provoking game.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|This is the best show I have watched in a long time.  Totally kicks other shows butts!!  This season rocks just like the other 7.  So glad we spent the money with Amazon to watch it while we wait for season 9!
1615238948|5.0|This was one of the books for our Book Club I found it fascinating & historical<br />you learned more about the slaves in the 1700's how they lived & where & what they had to do to<br />survive.<br />While the whites all lived so nice & just took advantage of the slaves during that era,and how they each had separate houses to live in also.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have been reading Clancy and Flynn novels for years and this book continued to feed my need for action!
030758836X|3.0|I was disappointed in all the reviews & write ups it had gotten.<br />Wasn't a read I really liked I thought they were both sick o's<br />I read the whole book cause I wanted to see how it ended.<br />Just wasn't what I expected it to be.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|They sound more &#34;pop&#34; yes but the lyrics are great, music is good. I enjoy this CD a lot. If you like Closer you will love it since the other songs are actually &#34;better&#34;.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I realize this is just a novel written from the author's imagination but it was a little too unrealistic for me.  I really didn't believe the characters.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This is one of the largest modular buildings in the series, both in height and in depth (the building stretches out further in the back than other models). The building process was exciting and used lots of new techniques for creating a great design. I had some issues with the roof, its a little flimsy and tends to bow a little. All around though, great model with lots of details.
B009K86D86|5.0|Very informative, really makes you think about where you're food is coming from.  Would recommend to anyone.  But with caution, because once you know the truth, there's no turning back.
B001CDLATE|5.0|The film looks absolutely amazing on the new digital TV's with its extremely high resolution. I have heard that some folks use this as a demo for showing how crystal clear their new TV's work. All around, an inspiring film - which once you watch the special feature you will enjoy even more. Learning that the ceremony of the men dancing around the poles in the middle of the forest was for an actual child's death absolutely moved me. Some of the events are staged but are all authentic in nature (traditional song and dance).
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I just touch the  the screen and have my report so I know what is going on with the weather.  I am perpared for all weather.
B0026OE2O8|4.0|Well - the audio is dubbed and there is static whenever the person is talking, its more noticeable if you don't have any background noise. The message can get preachy towards the end, but I think the cinematography is absolutely stunning. They have used footage from this film in multiple other movies, including &#34;The Tree of Life&#34;.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have not been able ger to the home page of facebook yet.  Kindle does not have any help for getting the full works of facebook.  Very unhappy.
B002YCVX5S|2.0|Really wasn't plausible, and needed a lot to make this a great recommendation.  Would not put this in any of the movies I would recommend to a friend.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Little glitches during some scenes, but doesn't really affect the gameplay. Good length, worth the cost. Would definitely recommend to play
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters and the plots are fascinating, and like a good book you hate to see it end. We look forward to the next series in session three.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Bought this for my Dell XPS 12 Ultrabook. WiFi is not always the best way to go. Plugged it in and it worked with no driver install. USB 3.0 makes it fast. Get this if you need a fast wired connection to supplement your WiFi network.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I enjoyed the frist season and am looking forward to the next season.it has a lot of good action,it also has a great story line.
0765325950|5.0|Robert Jordan started me on this long road of pleasurable reading, but Brandan Sanderson finished it with the perfect way of continuing Jordan's concept.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A good job capturing the difficulties and challenges that one might face in a situation like this.  I enjoyed the experience.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me hooked from beginning to end, which is very rare for me considering I don't read books often! This book has an interesting post apocalyptic/ somewhat futuristic setting where people have some strange traditions and means of living and surviving! I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants an adventure with some romance mixed in!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It is hard for me to not like a Batman movie. This one teased my interest trite interest in the dark movies, which I rarely watch. I guess the movie is a success then, because it suggests to us that our best chance for justice is flawed because our judgment is flawed through inability to be completely free of self-serving in a imperfect and dangerous world.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|One of the Best Movies ever! A must see for any SciFi or Noir fan! This is considered to be the best version of the film according to the director (Ridley Scott). This is one of those movies with deep underlying themes and is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and still find new details or meanings behind certain aspects or scenes. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a deep and interesting movie! The Blu-Ray version adds higher definition models and has a couple special features thrown in! Its a decent blu-ray copy!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Sequels are never as good as the original, but this did not disappoint. It is always interesting how they make science and technology available today appear to be 'way out!!!'
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book is pretty hard to follow but its a really good story of a murder mystery as well as a tale of a disturbed young girl! Its a really engaging and dramatic book that is worth reading!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The entire novel, Killing Floor, is told in first person and although that leaves us open to bias I believe it was done pretty well in the case of Killing Floor. I really enjoyed this book. Child introduces us to the badass character that is Jack Reacher and is a character likeable enough to leave us wanting more. The supporting cast, although not looking to be hanging around longer than book one, are likeable enough (especially Officer Roscoe, Reacher’s love interest, and the honest detective Finlay) to make us want more of their characters.<br /><br />As Killing Floor is primarily a no-holds barred, adrenaline-pumping, action novel, there are plenty of awesome fight scenes and Child proves that he can keep the reader turning the pages to find out the outcome (although you know that Reacher will come out on top). Indeed, there are very little non-fight scenes in the novel, and the scenes that aren’t spent fighting are spent advancing the plot. There’s little wasted space here, ensuring that the plot moves along at a breakneck pace.<br /><br />Killing Floor is a brilliant opening novel, and will no doubt have the reader wanting to rush out and get Die Trying (Reacher #2) as soon as they can. The plot is unpredictable until the last quarter of the novel when everything moves into place, but the first three quarters of Killing Floor will keep you guessing. Child also manages to develop Reacher’s character, proving that he isn’t just the 2-D character commonly found in poorly written thrillers.<br /><br />The writing style in Killing Floor is clearly action-orientated, and I guess 70% of the time Jack Reacher gets himself into trouble. But, if there’s one thing that I’ve learned by reading Child’s first novel, is that you don’t mess with Reacher. You’re going to lose. And I think, as the novels go on, that’s one thing that Child is going to struggle with, and that’s predictability. With such a long running series focusing on one character, you probably will start to get the feeling that Reacher is invincible, especially if you’re like me, a (very) latecomer to Child’s series.robably will start to get the feeling that Reacher is invincible, especially if you’re like me, a (very) latecomer to Child’s series.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final book in the Hunger Games is a good book and a welcomed end to a great trilogy. I was personally disappointed with the first half of the book though... I almost didnt finish it, just seemed out of place and not good.... but the 2nd half was able to grab my attention as well as the ending that i hoped for! overall its a good book that any hunger games fan should read to finish off the story of Katniss!
B003DZX3US|5.0|I loved this edition of my favorite Disney classic!  The special features, specifically the one on the making of the music in the show, were informative and entertaining!  Totally worth getting the new edition for big fans of the movie.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Amazon has this controller for the cheapest out of any other retailer so it really makes the value of it go ever so much more higher! Its a great controller for a great system! the rechargeable battery makes the hefty price seem far more justifiable than other console controllers! and also features rumble and six-axis motion! If you need to buy another PS3 controller buy it from Amazon.com! :)
B000AP04KQ|4.0|Just a few rough spots in the viewing of the DVD.  Pixel issues, but for so cheap I can live with that.  Thanks!
1616550414|5.0|I LOVE this book! Its a great collection of fan services all rolled into one beautiful bounded package!<br />This book comes with 4 main things inside of its 280 pages!<br /><br />1) Concept Art<br />2) Time-Line<br />3) In-Depth details of every game<br />4) Comics<br /><br />These are all displayed gorgeously and answer many things fans have been dying to know as well as point out some of the not so obvious connections between each of the games! I Highly recommend this book for any Zelda fan!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for the whole family. My kids play and now they have me hooked, too. I rate it 5 stars because of the good graphics and how addictive it is.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book that is very similar to the first book in terms of story! Its pretty much Hunger Games but on a larger scale! If you loved the first book you will love this one because the action and romance and such continues!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Really excellent book. Has a &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; like feel but really weaves history and fiction together in a very compelling way.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed it. It was sad and happy in the best of ways nub a good depiction of troubled youth.
B003RNXIBK|5.0|This is an old album from em but I rethought it do to complications to the work of it all. Anyways it is a great album even better music set up by the man himself from Cinderella man to cold as the wind blows there all pretty good music
B00B2V66VS|1.0|when I got it it was totaly awesome but it's been acting up and I haven't been able to play it for months. warning: do not buy on kindle fire!
B001JNND9W|5.0|I first saw VP on the Friday night late night movie when I was in High School.  Since then I've acquired every incarnation I could get, VHS, DVD and now Blu Ray.  One of only a few movies that I will continue to get in each and every latest greatest format.  The Blu Ray format is truly fantastic!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Good way to keep your brain sharp. It was very entertaining. Lots of colors and shapes. I would recommend it.
0896760278|5.0|I used this book when recreating/designing Civil War era wedding gown for when our house was on a historic home tour in Marietta, PA.  The pattern drafts were a valuable resource when drafting my own modern fitting patterns.  I used a modern bridal gown pattern for some of the bodice pieces, redrafting them according to the style of the historic pattern, then was able to recreate the appropriate sleeves, carriage pleated bell shaped skirt from the diagrams in the book.  One must keep in mind when using these patterns is that they are drafted from original garments, that were worn over corsets that re shaped the woman's body to a specific shape.  Unless you are making a matching corset, the pattern in Arnold's book is not going to fit a 21st century figure.  This was why for the bodice I used a modern sloper, to allow for today's woman's broader shoulder and chest.  The dress was quite successful, and I used it for several years to represent my work as a bridal gown designer and ability to recreate historic costume.  Later, this dress found a home with a re-enactor, a high compliment to the research provided to me from Ms.Arnold.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|A very nice take on the book with lovely light and costumes like ornaments on a tree. Some fine performances, especially by Jonny Lee Miller, and good use of actual lines from the book. It stands firmly between the centuries.
0345803507|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Hot! Hot! Hot! ... :-)  Its a must read! ... You won't be disappointed! Thats 4 sure!
B002APU580|4.0|Austen would not approve but the pictures themselves, thanks to Wright's eye, are worth the departure from the words and worlds themselves. Definitely a modern take with an artistic hand and a look away from the book.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|I have watched it multiple times.  Always makes me laugh an is a great one for a &#34;blue&#34; day.  The casting is perfect but the veterans steal the show:  Sissy Spacek is incredible as is Chris Walken. Pitch perfect.  Brendan Fraser is such a cute combination of naivete and sweetness.  As a product of the 50's and 60'sI related to the paranoia and craziness that the threat of nuclear war created.
B000007WNN|5.0|...then, I bought it in cassette form...and now, I'm buying the CD.  I love &#34;The Cult&#34; and this is one of their best recordings.  It was made when the band was young and fresh and before the colliding egos of Ian and Duffy started hampering their creativity.  It's also a little harder than some of their later CDs.  Great riffs!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a huge hit with my 4 year old. He loves playing it when he has to wait in a long line.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|It was enjoyed and appreciated by the receiver. It is nice to be able to shop on line especially when items wanted are not always available at the local store.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Great read, another winner for Ian Rankin.and his character John Rebus.I have read all of his Rebus books,do hope he keeps them coming.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|The cousins were over and my kids saw them playing this game. They had to have it. They have enjoyed hours of fun!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book almost as much as I loved Bared to You--I say almost because you just can't beat that awesome first meeting, first kiss, first time in bed, etc. . .After reading several negative reviews I was torn whether or not to read this, but I'm so glad I did.  Gideon is so much better in Reflected--things move a lot faster in this book and the sacrifice he makes for her!!--let's just say he's knocked Christian Grey out of the number one spot in my heart!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I wouldn't go so far as to call it 'powerful' as so many critics have, but I have to give Mr. Washington credit where credit is due. He is a superb actor, and it shows in this movie. Sadly, I know too many people who have substance abuse problems so it wasn't a new story line for me, but he gave a knock-out performance!
0064430170|4.0|For young ones to give them a sense of security, that if closing their eyes and going to sleep means giving up control and if that frightens them, having a litany of goodnights to say gives them the opposite feeling - being able to not only pass on an affectionate attitude to other beings, but subconsciously perhaps giving themselves the very same idea, so as to make closing ones eyes and going to sleep feel normal and not perhaps so frightening.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Brilliantly cast, excellent storyline, characters you love and love-to-hate...for a program that does not rely on mystery and intrigue, it is heads above the rest in storytelling.
B000001FS6|5.0|An excellent album from the Irish band U2. If you are rock lover you must have it.<br />This is a classic you must have, 5 stars out of 5.
B000002I69|4.0|It would have been difficult to surpass the greatness of TIMEOUT-which must be the greatest cd EVER. But this one is pretty good.
B009GEH5NG|5.0|To me, calling a movie made in 95' is strange to call a classic, but this one is a classic.  Any Bond fan who hasn't seen this one is missing out.
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|Controls don't work. Tilted it in every direction and the fish stayed in the same spot. I'm on a Nexus 4
B00946WMXY|3.0|I liked this movie.  It wasn't as amazing as Casino Royal or Skyfall, but it's worth a watch or two.
B00AL1ONN8|3.0|Clifford TI Harris has done it again, used a formula when creativity was needed.  I enjoyed Trouble Man until the formula revealed itself on the second listen.  TI is much too talented to waste his time, his fans money, and his fans' time with a project like this.  Short on substance, it follows a trend instead of creating one.  I just expected better.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great character development, acting and plot twists.  For those who don't care about zombies, or want nothing to do with a show or movie regarding zombies, still try to give this show a try.
B000FC146C|5.0|The story is just beautiful.  It makes you realize that even priest are not in a position to choose who to love.  I have recommended this book to all my friends.  I saw the tv production but enjoyed the book a lot more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse is a very fun game to play but........I AM STUFFING HER UP WITH FOOD AND IT SAID &quot;Beauty is not fit enough.&quot; Oh my gosh really?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|best  book ever  so funny I could explode  I laughed so hard I all most spit milk out of my nose I
B005BGBPBG|5.0|This movie diffently has an unexpected turn of events. You don't see it coming. This movie is very entertaining, and it's worth viewing. I loved it.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This film was a lot of fun. I Spent most of my time trying to figure out how many of the video games that I could name and have played myself
B000060OFT|1.0|This was a gift - I don't care for movies or old TV show reruns. I should have bought a hammer or a screwdriver for my friend instead.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great! I couldn't put it down. The characters were so interesting in the ways they interacted. It was moving and has an unexpected turn in it. My book club read the book and the majority of the people enjoyed it.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I purchased this for my son as a Christmas gift.  It's the only thing he requested this year.  He loves this game.  Reminds him of the game Pass the Pigs only with a different twist!
B004WR125O|5.0|No problems. Easy to install. Works where there is a need to download updates and no hard wire is accessible.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book.  Language is a bit rough, but all the twists and turns had me hiding from my family to finish the book!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Have enjoyed this series thoroughly. The characters are believable, the scenery is lovely and it is very entertaining. It is a mixture of drama and amusement.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|This app was not what I expected. It lets you write with a finger, but it posts the text before you can cross a T or dot an I.  I removed it from my Kindle Fire HD
B007EDYN36|3.0|OK book... nothing too surprising revealed... some of which I wish I had not learned!  Nice to see him thrash Gene and everyone else finally.  A bit surprised about the Ace stuff.  Wish there was more about the touring life in the 70's though.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I found this app to be difficult to use. It snoozes easily, but it is hard to find a button to cancel the alarm. You have to shake  the kindle to snooze the alarm and I had to shake it really hard. I will keep this app, but probably won't use it again.
B00012QM8G|5.0|People experienced similar treatment, in some places, it still happens. This movie is a great eye-opener to the motivation of genocide.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Why do I choose this rate?Because I've read every Diary of a Wimpy Kid.I think the next book should have Manny more in the book,like the old ones! Maybe they can make a STAR WARS scene!!!!!!!!The girlfriend and the dad of hers didn't really love it.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|I've seen the movie and read the book, so when my English professor announced this movie as a project, I was thrilled, but then the thought of analyzing. So much drama.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Enjoyed the movie but the supposedly HD quality was full of effects and blurs.  I should have opted for the cheaper version.
B00003CXRM|5.0|You'll laugh, cry and sing! Its like slapstick comedy combined with a musical. The acting is excellent and you'll catch yourself humming the songs for days.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|wonderful game to play and it's free.and if you like just one kind of horse you can always buy that one you don't have to buy the type that you don't like
B000HAB4KS|5.0|This movie remains a classic with its innovative filming to its imaginative storyline. A great cast of actors who were willing to try something new.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I found this to be a very absorbing, beautifully written story. Found myself deeply involved with the characters and the story. Surprise ending that I didn't expect.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Pretty Little Liars is engaging, exciting and keeps you on your toes. You truly never know what is going to happen next.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I find this game is fun. I enjoy play this game. Since my boyfriend is allergic to horses this the only way I get ti enjoy horses.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I missed this one in the theater.  Kids really like it and I did too.  Surprised to find a new movie the kids had not seen yet.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a very awesome game. There is absolutely nothing boring about<br />this it.  Here's a tip about how to get the puzzle piece in zarp's fortress. The things that explode will kill you if you step on them,but some don't. To figure out if they don't explode you have to draw a rain cloud above them,if they turn red then don't step on them but if they don't it's ok to step on them,and then you can get the puzzle piece.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I downloaded it 20 min. ago and it still loading but friend has it and it awesome not like any other hair game 1000% better<br />.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett has a gift to keep a complex story moving and helping the reader keep all the characters straight. He is a master at mixing fiction into actual historical facts and keeping it believable. While it is a long book it held my interest all the way through. Can't wait for the next book!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|The movie lacked depth and cohesion.  Dark Shadows tries hard to be something it's not, entertaining.  The one liner jokes miss, the plot is muddy, overall just another disappointing Tim Burton fizzle.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book! The author did a wonderful job at writing believable characters. A must read and have the Kleenex box handy!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season's Walking Dead is much better than the previous two, in my opinion. The entire show has surprised me - I really am not a fan of zombies, but for the most part, I've enjoyed the writing and the development of most of the main characters. (Most of the characters I didn't like got eaten, so it's all good.)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A clever weaving of history rich with characters tangled in an interesting & well written plot. I am enjoying it very much.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Sleeper! Tony Ward was perfect for role of Forestt Bounderant. \\"All u got is fear.  If u lose the fear u r already dead\\"
B001AQO3QA|1.0|If you buy this set you better have a new blu-ray player or hope your manufacturer is staying up to date on firmware updates.  I can't play these discs on either my Samsung or Magnavox blu-ray players.
1416955070|3.0|City of Bones is not a bad book. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning and several of the characters. It’s just that as the story progressed, it reminded me of so many other books that were so much more awesome. For example, every time I heard one of the Shadowhunters use the word “Mundane”, I thought of Pierce Anthony’s Man From Mundania, which came out seven years prior to City of Bones. The people from Mundania (who are non-magic folk) are called Mundane by the magic folk of Xanth.<br /><br />Even though elements of the story gave me deja vu, I did like the descriptions, particularly at the beginning of the novel. Actually, everything about the beginning I liked.<br /><br />If there was one character that stole every scene he was in, it would be Magnus Bane. How many warlocks can pull off a neon bedroom, throw fantastic parties, and be friends with everyone. He was blatantly gay and reinforced many of the gay stereotypes, but he was still a fantastic character.<br /><br />Jace was a bit of a narcissistic ass and I like that about him. He was strangely devoted to Clary, but he kept his humor and sarcastic attitude towards her up until the very end. Simon, on the other hand, feels like the obvious choice and this is obvious to everyone but Clary. Multiple characters drop hints that he likes her, but she’s too dumb to notice. And yet she picks up on Jace’s attraction to her despite his very subtle (aka insult and be a jackass) approach.<br /><br />I didn’t mind the love triangle, but the cop-out at the end of the book, which ended the love triangle felt cheap to me. Clary didn’t have to pick one of the guys. The decision was made for her. Why can’t the heroine ever be more proactive in choosing? You can’t have two boyfriends in real life and like them equally, so why is this so prevalent in fiction?<br /><br />The ending reminded me of the 3rd Lord of the Rings movie, where it ended…again and again. I couldn’t wait to be done with this book. I wish that it had ended 50 pages earlier and I’ve never said that about a book until now. The big reveals at the end were way too obvious and I guessed most of them way in advance.<br /><br />I won’t be reading the rest of the series, unless I get the books cheap. It’s not a bad book, but it definitely is not worth the hypeish that it had ended 50 pages earlier and I’ve never said that about a book until now. The big reveals at the end were way too obvious and I guessed most of them way in advance.<br /><br />I won’t be reading the rest of the series, unless I get the books cheap. It’s not a bad book, but it definitely is not worth the hype
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I don't have a cat but but do love them.  We feed stray cats, so basically we have 6 cats who live elsewhere.  They are precious.  They all have names. I intend to get a cat. An older one from a shelter.  One who needs a home.  this was a fun read.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great movie! I loved the retro Astin Martin and theme music. Lots of fun! James Bond has seldom been better. Excellent Bond villain too!
B004ATL2CM|4.0|For fans of Bryan Adams, this is a treat.  He plays most of his big hits in stripped down acoustic versions, banters with the audience, and delivers almost 90 minutes of music.  Good sound, and a good set.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Best Bond yet.  Really connects the realities of today's world into the traditions of 007.  Great way to continue the wonderful series in a new direction.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|The Abbey Road Sessions is a beautifully done CD. The differently arranged &#34;Come into my world&#34; brought me to tears when I really listened to it. If you are a Kyle fan, this CD is a must.
B0058SNI94|5.0|Cros are normally not the cutest shoe to wear, but these are adorable! They look really cute with jeans and I have only worn them a couple of times and have already received many compliments. The best part is they are so lightweight and extremely comfortable. I wear a size 8 and got them in 8..a 7.5 would have probably fit a little better, but I still love them:)
B001L7XND2|5.0|I have no objection to Truth. Do you? How could you, honestly?<br /><br />And I have no objection to Art. Hey, some of my best friends are artists.<br /><br />Most of the many favorable reviews of this film Hunger laud its artistic achievement. Perceiving Art is a totally subjective matter, but most of \\"us\\" are modestly certain that we know Art when we see it. This film is indeed artfully made. Brilliantly so! And artfully acted. One has to wonder how Michael Fassbender survived the making of Hunger; the ravages to the body of his character, Bobby Sands, are horrifying to behold. Much is horrifying in this film. The brutality and squalor depicted in the Maze Prison of Northern Ireland, where the 1981 IRA no-wash, no-uniform, and hunger strikes took place, are Holocaust-level horrifying. The film is not a narrative, not a thriller, certainly not an entertainment. It's a depiction of horror, and it's absolutely obvious that director Steve McQueen and his cast of actors are convinced of the Truth of their depiction. \\"Conviction\\" is very convincing.<br /><br />But that drags me screaming up against the question of the relationship between Truth and Art. Art demands subjective verification. Truth, however, pleads for objectivity even while the Art remains ineluctably subjective. After all, Art is made by Artists, who are fearsomely plausible even when they're wrong. Trust me, I'm not asserting that Steven McQueen was wrong, or that the depiction of the Maze Prison is inaccurate! But I don't know! If this were a book of supposed scholarship, I'd be hell-bent on determining its factuality. But it's Art! I'm touchy about Art that exists chiefly to portray a Truth. Is \\"Art that Lies\\" better than \\"No Art at All\\"? Think of the DW Griffith film \\"Birth of a Nation\\" - the filthiest Lie ever told but almost revered for its \\"artistic\\" innovations. No wonder many people shun \\"Art as Truth\\" in favor of \\"Art as Entertainment.\\"<br /><br />Your reaction to this film will depend on your attitude toward the strife in Northern Ireland. The closest thing to an \\"adversary\\" or villain in this motion picture is the voice of Margaret Thatcher, which you'll hear over a dark screen. I confess that my disapproval of Thatcher and Thatcherism is potent enough to tip my sympathies toward the IRA strikers all by itself.<br /><br />The heart of this film is a single conversation between Bobby Sands and a Catholic priest with IRA connections. It's filmed Bergman-style with an unmoving camera at chest-height. It illuminates both the violent brutality that precedes and the wrenching tragedy that follows. If the Belfast accents and slang make it hard to follow the dialogue, don't be too proud to use the subtitles.<br />!attitude toward the strife in Northern Ireland.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|Therefore, I understood very well how Will felt.  Also, Louisa and Patrick from my able bodied<br />days. I am at 80% and I sure hope it ends the way I want it too. Also the details about being a<br />Quad at Wills level C4/5  are very accurate. As a C7 I have much more ability.
B003B02PF4|5.0|I have read approximately 10 of John Grisham's books and rate each and every one a 5.  I would rate him as one of the best authors out there!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I love the Reacher novels. Often you have to suspend belief but this one was just<br />too weak. Crank them out slower but give me another like the &#34;Affair&#34;
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved the book.  It was a page turner, one of Sparks' best books!  The movie was good, but the book was better.  Good descriptions.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I was disappointed in this book - the twist in the middle was ruined by the long-winded and muddled way in which the author dragged the story out. The concept and plot was strong, but the story itself was poorly constructed.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|This movie is a mess. RZA is all over the place as a director. The opening credits are this slick stylish 70's type, then that style vanishes, then onto a more modern look, then a flashback in black and white with red blood, then on the final scene we get comic book panels appearing all of the sudden. The action scenes are horribly choreographed and edited. It's like they just had an idea on how to kill a guy, so they film that in slow motion, then quick cut a few punches here and there. Nothing flows in the fight scenes, just ideas clunked together.  Also, the tone was way too serious for this movie. It just needed to be more...fun. Like Kill Bill, Desperado, Planet of Terror.  It started out that way through the first 15 minutes with Russell Crowes arrival. Then just went a completely wrong direction. Not many moments that lighten the mood after that.  With the CGI blood and gore, dudes getting cut in half, arms lopped off, etc. you would think it wouldn't be a chore to watch. This 95 minute movie felt like 130 minutes.
B00881VLCE|3.0|wish there were more puzzles - and to change the size of pieces. otherwise my daughter loves to play this in the car!
B009O2XY12|4.0|This is a fun game. It can be hard at time. That is o.k. I think this is crazy having to put so much down.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|He just keeps recording wonderful music.  Love listening to it while driving about.  Recommend it highly!  Looking forward to his new CD in March!
B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|The movie is great on Blu-Ray, but around the 42 minute mark - when Peter is in Skull Cave imitating Hook & right before Hook tries to hook him, the video of Peter switches from crystal clear to an eraser-like rectangle matching the color of Peter's outfit (as if they tried to erase him)
B009KHBDUU|4.0|If you love Depp you'll love this. The combination of Burton and Depp always works (as in Sleepy Hallow. They brought a darkness to th movie without losing the campyness of the original.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting like oh my gosh I can't stop playing it! This game is a must have! The creators should be proud haha
B00499QUK2|5.0|Nobody does TV like the Brits! Fabulous acting, great writing. What a take on the old classic! My husband specially is a Sherlock fan and he also thought this was a great modern version that stayed true to the original spirit.
B008I43DYU|5.0|its very readable on the8.9 hd kindle and switchs fast from si to simple with twist it also<br />fills the spot for calculator app and no ads area plus,
B001E95KVA|4.0|I find Paul Polak to be very inspiring, and this book is a great wealth of information. I only wish that I could have as much experience traveling and helping the world as Polak does, and it was a pleasure to read his thoughts on it all.<br /><br />One thing about his writing - and perhaps it's a necessary to get points across with some people - he really repeats himself sometimes, and I mean several times throughout the book.
B00000ITOY|5.0|would recommend this sorting board - at first my daughter wasn't that interested but has since often picked it up and looks for our help to work out. It makes her think about colors, shapes and how things fit together I also like that (at least for right now) she needs our help.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and so does my children. it is fun and very enjoyable. And free can't beat that.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Temple run 2 is not working properly. I have uninstalled and installed it 8 stupid times! now it wont even open.

B003D5X3VM|4.0|I bought Be Good first and it was great and Water falls right in line. Gregory Porter has a sound that is hard to place. It's timeless. He sounds old school, he sounds new school, but it is all good.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It takes some time to get going on this game I'm still not sure whether I'm. playing this game right.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|It is Incognito, that sums it up. Each album is special in tis own way. Surreal is no different. Every song depicts a different mood. I love it.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Great movie. Something for everyone. Great story. My little video gamers loved it, although they would have loved to see Bowsher more than just a couple seconds.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book kept you on the edge wondering where and how it could possibly go all the way to the end.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love playing this with or without my children!!!  Easy but difficult at times very addictive!!! Great size on my kindle fire!!
B003N19DSI|5.0|Well-written and well-researched. Lots of great information and footnotes. More expensive than other versions, but worth it.  I love it.
B009ZE27US|1.0|EFFIN' USELESS!!!!  Yep..  Thats about as close as I can get.<br /><br />I figured this would have been one of those apps that was mearly fun after a couple of drinks..  Nope..  Not even that good.  Loaded it.. put my thumb on it..  hey, got it almost right..  wow.. did it again, was off my 20 years..  did it again, went 40 years the OTHER direction..  Yep..  Delete. :)<br /><br />:)
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great! Awesome acting, fun story. Definitely a great addition to the Marvel franchise. I would love to see this with my surround sound.
B007HACDLK|3.0|The Last Man was not up to Vince Flynn's usual good work.  It was predictable and not as exciting as his writing usually is
B005JE7XW0|4.0|This movied plays off stereotypes and delivers a nonstop hilarious movie. Lots of Blood, death, and comedy packed into this one memorable film.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I just love it, it was fun! it kept me interested all the way until the end and then some
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I WAS UNABLE TO PUT MY KINDLE DOWN THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST. I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE. MY ONLY WISH IS FOR THE FOURTH AND FIFTH ONE SOON.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|it is a good sequel for the in between unteil requiem is out, I just cannot wait to see how it all end..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best thing sense doodle jump!!! A must have for your kindle! The best thing about this app is its free!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Better than I anticipated. Looking forward to the movie. Would highly recommend. I hope that the author has continued the story and has started the second nook<br />.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game was the best. I never got bored of it yet. People think that 13 year-old s shouldn't be playing this. I'll cut to the chase. I love this game. Just like the computer addition.
0140157352|4.0|I have been wanting this book because I used it for a class. It is a very good thing to have it at your office and teach you about conflict resolution!
B0096HIEE2|2.0|I had high expectations and it fell flat pretty much from the beginning. Acting was poor, scenes were sloppy and not very believable.  If you're looking for whatever, it's not there.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I devoured this wonderful book.  Cheryl's words transported me to the PCT along with her.  I found a sister in her words.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Timely movie with Veteran's coming home.  Zac Efron portrays what we all think of Marines - Tough, Fair, Honest, and Caring of his fellow Marines.  His relationship with Taylor Schilling and her son was outstanding.<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a heart and soul for humanity.
B004OO4UFY|4.0|The game has two of the songs on here, both of which match and set the tone of the game simultaneously. I felt compelled to buy the album. It's a very creative work and it sounds good to my ears.
B00633W614|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st book in the series and looked forward with anticipation to book 2.  I was not disappointed.  Now the cliffhanger continues.  Can't wait for book 3!
B008LV05EG|5.0|She has a great voice and some catchy songs. I can't help but think her talents are being wasted on this album though. I would love for her to do an acoustic album. Overall it's a promising start for this new artist.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Just a simple hidden object game. It's entertaining. My nine year old daughter liked it. I also liked it. It was cool
B000ME5B30|5.0|So very informative and TRUTHFUL!  Our current weather trends and atmosphere changes are proving that Al Gore was on top of his game in coming forward with this information.  Too bad that is wasn't taken seriously.
B00BESLT6G|2.0|We loved the first 'Silent Hill' and I play the video game. This sequel wasn't worth watching and it seems like they left it open for a third. Hopefully they take more time and revisit the first one.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|A gem of a concert!!! Excellent quality. A must for passionate fans and collectors.The sound is master high technology DTS.A legendary music event.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My grand-daughter really loved it. It kept her attention and she thought it was very funny. I also thought it was Hilarious!!
080701429X|5.0|Great book!!!!! Well worth the read! Fast read! I love his writing and his perspective helped to validate my thoughts. Anyone experiencing loss, that has hit a roadblock in life or struggles with depression, must read this book. We have lost a brilliant man but his ideas and experience live on through his writing. Plan on giving this as a gift to many! A must read for everyone in my opinion!
B00BETX5PS|2.0|The opening segment was so stupid and violent my wife left the room and went to watch a show in an other room
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I'm going on a rant with spoilers included!  Yes I'm a James Bond fan from the Sean Connery get-go, who for me will always be the quintessential James Bond; suave, debonair, funny  and yes someone who can roll with the punches. My two favorites being Goldfinger and From Russia With Love. That being said there was once a franchise called James Bond that you could go to and have a pretty good time. Sure it could get campy, but you could always count on the trade mark qualities of - Exotic Locations - Exotic Women - Cool Gadgetry - Funny quips and a Kick Ass Opening.<br /><br />Fast forward to today's Daniel Craig James Bond recreation. The words that come to mind are drab, brutal and depressing. It's as if the original heart and soul that made this franchise a blast has been ripped out and replaced by a mind numbed killing zombie who's hell bent on bringing us diehard James Bond fans into a fold that is real, depressing and P.C. correct. Hey if that is the case why pay high movie entree fees when you can simply turn on the news and get all that for free. It's as if the producers in league with the writes are striving to destroy what has made the franchise a success over the past fifty years and for what?  To make it real?  Sure you can update it for the times, but don't piss on the spirit that has made the experience worth looking forward too.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert*** If you plan to see this flick you may not want to know about the plot holes that are holding Skyfall together. Let's start with the beginning when Bond is accidentally shot by his female partner and falls from a train trussle tumbling 100 feet or so to a lake below.  He's assumed dead, but of course shows up months later with no real recollection of what happened or plan of action to deal with what's happening with MI6.  He's out of shape, too old for the job and being considered for replacement.  Watching Craig drag through this movie you'd think he's already dead, replaced by a robot bit actor.<br /><br />The bad guy belongs more in The Silence Of The Lambs; a freak show with a denture issues whose world quest problem is not with taking over the world, but in taking out M.  The fem fatale could of been a contender, but instead was blown away by a bullet.  She could of been a. A love interest - B. A double agent - C. Someone who we could of cared about if given the chance.  And then there's the prepubescent Q who is  introduced into this series for the first time.  Now you think this kid would be hip, cool and most importantly imaginative.  Yup, and what does he give Bond for his first cool gadget... His PPK coded to Bond's print.  In essence a safety lock that is oh so P.C. correct and oh so boring.  What about a encoded PPK that shots backwards or even explodes. Imagination what a concept.<br /><br />For those who loved Bond's original Aston Martin DB5 you'll be happy to know its been utterly destroyed, blown up to pieces. Bond gets a little use out of it, but for this classic symbol of the Bond franchise it should of went out in style; not in a whimper, but in a fantastic scene that would of given this fantastic car its due homage. What do they say - Out with the old and in with the... I'll guess we'll just have to wait until Q comes up with something.<br /><br />Speaking of homage and then there was M.  Yeah okay I can understand updating characters. Whether it's Dame Judi Dench's decision not to carry on or the producers to take her out and replace her with Ralph Fiennes' the point is the scene where she is dispatched does not give credit and homage to a fine actress whose refined and dignified character merits<br />more than just being wounded and dying in Bond's arms with negligible dialogue and interaction in the final moments with Daniel Craig.  There should of been a kick ass scene with the two of them; fighting the villains that would of highlighted her send off and made it one to remember.<br /><br />Woulda - Coulda - Shoulda.  I gave this review 2stars because of the potential of what this could of been and with a glint of hope of what it might be. By the way does anybody miss the electrifying James Bond guitar riff that was once a dominant factor in the early movies?  When you heard that theme you knew you were in the right place.  XXX - The Bourne Idenity and even Stallone's Expendables have brandable qualities that keep bringing the audiences back. Why because they keep the faith with their audience whose expectations are met again and again.  You'd think with 50 years behind them that the 007 franchise would get it right.  If the forces that be don't adhere to the qualities that distinguished this franchise from the very beginning they will find that their 50 Golden Anniversary will be a celebration of its heyday, not its future. Remember what happened to Coke when they messed with the formula. For me there will always be one original. Bond... James Bond.
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I just finished watching the final episode of Season 3, and I am done watching this series. It began faltering in season 2. It seems that the producers/writers are beginning to use the \\"let's kill off a character to get things moving again\\" method. Give me a break. First we see Sibyl die and her child left motherless, now we see Matthew die and his child left fatherless. I guess it has been decided that no one deserves to have any happiness longer than a couple episodes. What a cheap shot. You killed off one of your best characters, folks, and one that the series has revolved around from the beginning. This series is starting to remind me of the endless X-Files series where the viewer was constantly dangled the alien carrot with no resolution, the difference being that instead of the elusive aliens, we are being asked to jump from one transitory character to another and thank them for it. Sayonara.
B001AITH50|5.0|This has been my favorite movie for many years and now I am lucky enough to have it on DVD :) This is a great movie. I definately reccommend it!!!

B001YB29HG|5.0|if you've never seen Dr Horrible's, you're really doing yourself a disservice.  or you're in the Evil League of Evil.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is what it is...still the same fun running game with new twists and turns. Still a  good time killer waitjng for appointments ans such.
1616550414|5.0|Yes, not merely a fan, a Zelda Purist is someone who has an unwavering dedication to the essence of Shigeru Miyamoto's vision. This is the definitive collector's item for a Zelda Purist's bookshelf. I've been mesmerized at the detail contained in this book. There are designer notes all over the different iterations of the dozens of illustrations. The size of the book was larger than I expected and has a ton of information. I'm very impressed with this book and is the first piece of Zelda paraphernalia that I've ever purchased outside of the games themselves.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|wonderful story, characters wellcast, beautiful setting and location.  gives a great picture of life in early 20th century England. can't wait to see each episode!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great fun for everyone. An interesting revisit on the story we all heard as kids. I enjoyed the music, as did my 2 year old.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Wonderful beginning! Grabs you from the very first chapter. Enjoyed the location and storyline. Great first effort and I was anxious to read his second novel. A great selection that is  totally engrossing! my bookclub agreed was this was spellbinding. Great surprise ending.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|If you like Mr. King novels, time traveling, and you're a Sci-Fi fiend, then you'll like this book.... I'm now 50% of the book in a week. 5 Stars
B00447L4JG|5.0|My 12 year old niece requested this for Christmas and has enjoyed watching it over and over. It is a classic!
B00AHXDECG|4.0|How can you go wrong with Bruno Mars?  His high energy presentation, lyrics, and word combinations are fascinating.  What a talent.
B000JIHP88|5.0|i bought this item<br />I like this. This is Very good price & Very Good Quality<br />My wife also like this.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|The Terminator was a great movie. Drama. Action. Good old Arnie.<br />How could a sequel improve this? Well, Terminator 1 was great. Terminator 2 is awesome.<br /><br />You can't beat Arnie as a hero. You also have both classic catchphrases with a new one. The enemy is more threatening/powerful. We already have the cold hero Arnie. We have the soldier Sarah Conner. We have the silver nemesis T-1000. Add to the mix young &#34;this is my town&#34; John Conner, and we have a perfect blended cast of characters. The action isn't bad either.<br /><br />In terms of the blu-ray disc, the quality is great and same for the special features.<br /><br />Totally reccomended!<br />Goodbye, everyone! Or rather, hasta la vista baby!
1423113497|5.0|i bought this item<br />I like this. This is Very good price & Very Good Quality<br />My wife also like this.
B000H30B2C|2.0|This movie has some really good acting in it.<br /><br />I would watch it just to see Naomi Watts. She is a baby doll.<br /><br />That said: Peter Jackson could screw up a wet dream. Everything that he touches is WAY too long. This movie could have been shortened by a LOT. Many of the scenes are dragged out way too far, and some of the stuff going on in the jungle is just ridiculous.<br /><br />The Lord of The Rings trilogy is a great example. i loved those three movies, but I fast forwarded through at least a third of them. Who in hell wants to watch three little guys walking around all the time and the sentimental music playing in the background as they smile stupidly.<br /><br />The man has a problem. He may be tying to compensate for something that isn't quite long enough. :p
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a well written book that can capture your attention.  It is worth a read.  Would love to read more from this author.
B000HZGNDG|5.0|One of the best in the franchise, ties Wrath of khan in my book. !!! a must for any star trek fan of any generation !!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Everyone enjoyed the movie tremendously...from aged 18 to 60, we all got a kick of out it.  Would recommend anytime to anyone who wants a good laugh.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The hero of this book fits the classic role of the lone man righting wrongs for truth's sake.  Action packed drama that sometimes is predictable, is not stale.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Will make you laugh over and over. I caught myself reciting lines from the movie for a few days, so haliourous!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game grows on you. Give it time, and you will not want to put it down! Highly enjoyable alternative to words and draw something. One of the better games available. :0)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so fun! I have always wanted a horse and this is the closest thing to one! love it!
B000F8O35U|3.0|It is good, but for some reason, my dvd player has a hard time reading it and it wont play in my car and it wont play any of the extras. But no scratches and my daughter's have watched it a million times, so we are happy with our purchase.
B001I45UFC|5.0|A very good book that is not quite allegory but merely supposition. I recommend everyone to read this great book.
B0012SCHZK|3.0|This movie is full of blood and guts and it is incredibly entertaining, but DO NOT watch this instead of reading the poem. The plot lines about the parentage of monsters is way off compared to the text. Beware high school students!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Holy hell.<br /><br />You know how most books are so predictable that you are just waiting for the words to read like you pretty much figure they will?<br /><br />Yeah?<br /><br />Well this book is in no way predictable.<br /><br />Completely surprising.<br />Absolutely stunning.<br />Terrifically heartbreaking.
B00008OE4W|2.0|A sad bundle of cliches laced with juvenile Hollywood politics. If you like real espionage, watch (or better, read) The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I gave this book a high rating because it was superbly written.  Unlike some readers, didn't have a problem with the Irish dialog and found it easy to follow.  The ending was not sad!
B00AIGQTEC|4.0|When the hard copy versions (CD/Vinyl) of this single came out I was kind of excited... until I saw the prices that they wanted for them... OUCH!  That being said, if you're a fan and your money is tight, than this digital download is perfect especially at price listed! As for the actual tracks, in my opinion only Track #1 - Rock and Roll Love Affair (Original Extended Mix) and Track #3 - Rock and Roll Love Affair (Jamie Lewis Stripped Down Mix) are worthwhile. The other versions are meh, especially when compared to &#34;RNR Affair Remix #7&#34; that Prince himself has officially released elsewhere. NOTE: If possible because of the other three versions, I'd only have given this 3 and a half stars but for whatever reason only 'whole stars' are an option. (PS&#62; Been a fan of his music for over 3 decades now just so you know where I'm coming from regarding this review!) Peace & Enjoy!
1609611543|5.0|There is so much information available in this book to learn about wheat free eating. Dr Davis's cookbook is also a great companion to this book.
B004WR125O|5.0|This little addition to my new Onkyo TX-NR616 receiver is a blessing. I now have internet media at my disposal.
B005M5PENG|5.0|Best show love everything about it. Just recently visited Hawaii and it makes watching even better. Nice to catch up with missed episodes.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|Gandhi is a great classic. I have watched it several times and realized I needed it for my collections. Great quality and fair price.
B004132HZS|5.0|I can't wait for the filming of season 3 to start, this is such a great show. It is a great modern day version of Sherlock Holmes.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|I have always loved John Williams and this album has not disappointed. Soundtrack of the Lincoln movie so it brings to mind as you listen, the tremendous turmoil of the times.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|A must if your a bond fan. Movie was a bit long, but defiantly makes up for it with the ending.
B002L3ARRU|4.0|An overall fun movie to watch, nothing really deep just fun to watch and enjoy. Good movie for young and old.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This guy just keeps shurning them out. I think he really enjlyed writing this one as it was pure fiction and not tied to anything.
B009HELT3C|4.0|This was a good show for family night at the house.  On the up side, the humor was decent, and the actor who played the young Kay did an outstanding job.  On the down side, what can you do with MIB that hasn't been done already?  (twice)  Overall rent it and watch with your kids.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Being a weather buff I insist on quality. I want up to date weather in a timely manner. Your weather program meets these criteria. I endorse it wholeheartedly. I will check it early each day  and several times throughout the day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Haven't finished it yet but am reading it and it is a wonderful book.  Can't hardly put it down.  Can't wait to get back to it.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This book is a look at life in Malawi and how little it's changed over thousands of years.  Everyone lives on the edge of starvation.  William Kamkwamba as a young man with little education becomes fascinated with windmills that he's seen in books.  To better the life of his family and eventually his village, he becomes determined to build one.  His struggle to build a windmill from scrap pieces he finds in garbage pits is truly inspirational.  His windmill success opens many doors for him.  I loved learning about Malawi and the people.  The book is well written and engaging.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This really is a fun new spin on children's stories. I'm always eager to watch an episode. I have seen all the episodes and I would definitely watch each one again. The characters are fun and endearing. I think it's well worth the money.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I love the walking dead and I will continue to finish out this season but I'm hoping it is not as boring as the 1st episode of season 3:(
B003JTHXOK|5.0|VERY good book...great story, great suspense, satisfying ending...couldn't put it down.  Don't start it unless you can lose yourself in it till it's finished!
0439796644|5.0|This is a book orininally targeted to young people. It is a great read. The movie was based on this book.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|After UNDER THE DOME I was pretty certain that I wasn't going to read another Stephen King book. When I saw the summary of 11/22/63 it intrigued me enough to give it a try. The biggest disappointment in Mr King's books lately seems to be a rush to the ending. For a change, I didn't feel like 50 pages from the end that he suddenly realized he was running out of space and had to hurry things up. While I don't mind the 800+ page books, I sometimes wish he'd go back to his beginnings and write smaller stories.<br /><br />Anyway, the book tells a great story with a unique twist on the whole time travel trope. This book obviously took a crap load of time and effort just due to all the research that was probably required to get all the details right (for the most part). I'd recommend this to folks who are looking for a new spin on a time travel story.
0060935464|5.0|Of course this is a well-known novel that has made the best seller list a long time ago. It is well-written and very interesting. A classic!
0425263908|5.0|Loved this book. If you have read Fifty Shades of Grey and want to know what to read next, this is the one for you
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Once you try it, it can be addictive.  And you definitely cannot beat the price.  I have to put it away, or I don't get my daily chores completed.
B002ZG999U|4.0|i got this for my husband i watch it with him.as for the 4 stars we couldn;t find out what the story line was all about<br />but it has got alot of action in it. so it was a good buy. we thought that  wills and scharzenegger would be in this one<br />but they wasn;t. itwas worth the money and got it cheaper at amazon
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|i absolutely love the angry birds games and this is no exception. i would recommend it to anyone that likes the rovio games or star wars. very fun!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|what can i say about this movie. so funny love it. my whole family like it.so glad that i brought it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app it is super addictive. you just want to play more and more it's a good brain game. I love it.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|my husband love this movie. had alot of action in it. wish that willis and schwarenegger had more of a part..but still a good movie.if you like alot of action these 2 monies are what you want.. a great buy
B006LSZECO|3.0|I'd say that through the first third or so of the novel, I was pretty intrigued, then gradually as the story unfolded I found myself feeling disappointed. Then came the ending and I wanted to pull my hair out. My colleague said it best, &#34;this is a book that you read and then fling against the wall.&#34; The writing itself is pretty solid but the way things were &#34;resolved&#34; didn't seem to fit. I'd say read it if you are achingly curious to see what the hype is about. You will likely be disappointed, though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|There are some glitches, but this is a really beautiful game otherwise. I ran into a glitch where you can't buy another horse until your Friend list loads... over and over... so no unicorn for me, sadly.<br /><br />I spend a lot of time just watching the horse move around... it's relaxing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am 31 years old but still love picking up a good YA novel. This is one I will recommend to all of my fellow YA lovers. It touched my heart, kept me interested, and really made me think about how I am often wrapped up in appearances and will judge a book by its cover. Read it! You might learn something about yourself  : )
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Found it to be boring and couldn't stay awake. Other half said it was okay..but didn't like the way it ended.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|a quick read of little substance. very light. and very predictable. When you want a no brainer Just for gals
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Couldnt wait to turn it off. For the life of me I don't see how anyone could have even gotten paid to make it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|fabulous intrigue We have had to add TV on demand to watch the 2nd season in order to satiisfy  our curiosty about the story.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|This group rocks and Brittany is the reincarnation of Amy Winehouse and Janis Joplin...so much genuine emotion, soul, and grit!  Every cut on this album makes me smile knowing that there are young people out there very capable of writing great lyrics and performing with deep purpose and conviction.<br /><br />&#34;5&#34; for the lyrics and performance!  &#34;3&#34; for the poor mastering on this album!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I am searching I guess for what Heaven or the afterlife is like! My reason is I want to know that my son is ok and that he wasnt afraid ! Books like this help me with the grieving process in some ways.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|You already know the movie is one of the best Bond's ever, and that Daniel Craig stands next to Sean Connery, so I will just review the image quality, which is one of the best blu ray transfers you can buy. Avatar looks stunning, but the story is nothing special, and the acting only OK, but this gives you all the marbles. Some say the best in the series (or darn close) and to make it even sweeter, one of the best looking blu rays out there. If you are looking for some films to revel in both visually, and substance wise, this should be near the top of your list. A few others that are worth looking for are 2001: A Space Odyssey, LOTR trilogy, Alien & Aliens, Casablanca, any Pixar title, Chinatown, and of course The Godfather collection, which retains all the beauty of the original transfers with added clarity. Don't miss this one.
B007SGM084|5.0|As most women out there I really liked this set of books. Not that I would do some of the things mentioned. But to read it got me hot an bothered sometimes
B005APT8A8|5.0|For the money this has to be one of the best deals out there. Every album by one of the best and most influential groups of the 60's. OK, it does not have the booklets that came with all the single discs, but how many people who buy this don't already know their story. I have a couple books on them, so ai can live without the booklets, since all of these discs are remasters with all bonus tracks included. I paid less than $30 for this, and if you have any interest in the source of a who's who of American rock, you should just pick it up. Their albums started getting spotty after Untitled, but even the weakest ones have some stellar tracks. The first seven albums are simply sublime-classics all.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I've always been a fan of Mahjong and this is a great app. The only thing I would improve is that there are too many ad's.
B0036WHM1E|5.0|so unique  an alternative type music- relaxing with little story twists in the songs- loved it all from day one and plan to collect a few more by them
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I would definitely reccomend this book for those struggling in some way.  When I was hospitalized someone told me about this book.  I downloaded it to my kindle and do not regret it.  I am a dog lover and the dog tells the story.  It is heartwarming.  The author adds very important and encouraging life lessons.  I may be physically impaired right now (which also messes with the emotions when people are in so much pain all the time with no escape), but this book really did help me and it was a great read.<br /><br />Most people may not have my particular issue, but all people struggle in life.  This is not only a good read, but can really encourage you as life goes on.  It is a must read in my opinion.<br /><br />You will not be wasting your money to purchase this book.  Enjoy!  And prepare to highlight sections of the book you want to go back to!  I have!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like everything about the book except how it ends... but it was a really good book!!! Love it!! It was really sweet and I balled! If I cry that much it goes t o show how good it actually is!
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Love both actors and love the movie! Funny and true about a friends with benefits relationship. Great chemistry between JT and Mila.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I thought the first two in the series were more engaging that the final book in this series- thank you
0374532125|5.0|I feel like everyone should be required to read books like this in order for us to successfully combat the global poverty crisis.
B0058Z4NR8|3.0|The theory is appealing, the book is well written and full of nice history insights ... until you realize that some facts are being &#34;interpreted&#34; to support the theory.
1586487981|5.0|Although this book is taking me sometime to get through because of its similarity to a textbook, filled with facts and stats and theory...it's really educational and very informative. I'm really enjoying the facts it is opening my eyes too about poor economics.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Definitely increases memory and competitive energies. Takes a while to learn if you've never done it but it's well worth the effort. I'm hooked.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Great movie, what more can I say? Played great, arrived quickly. Really enjoy this childhood movie - a great addition to any Christmas movie collection!
B00APAENUI|5.0|I love the Honor Harrington series. All of the books can stand alone, but together they are a great adventure
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book,loved it, made me think about how I treated others and how others treat me. I also thought about how much friends stand up for each other.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm still stunned by the season finale last night. WHY,OH WHY?<br />What a season and I have it all right here ready to watch again. It's the best pre-order I have ever made. You won't want to be without it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is incredible! I cannot stop playing, very addicting.<br />Best game I have ever played. I think it should be number in the world<br />for best market app and game. I totally recommended it! Great!
B007712XAU|5.0|My gosh, after last night . . .I have to go through the WHOLE set AGAIN . . .<br />It will be an all-nighter. Excellent staff and always interesting.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|i used to be an intel fan back in the days of 2003-2008. but than in 2009 i made my first custom build for myself and i decided to give the AMD Phenom II x4 processor a try and loved it, and since than became an AMD fan.<br /><br />now dont get me wrong im not saying this because im an AMD fan, if you're on a budget and want to make a computer by spending as little money as possible you should get this because its saves you some money that you wont have to waste on buying a graphics card. and also not to mention that this CPU does 3.8 without overclocking it, and overclocking it will make it go from 3.8 to 4.2<br /><br />intel is WAY overpriced with their CPU's nowadays. go look for the Intel Core i7-3770K and it'll cost you more than $300, on newegg.com it'll cost you $320 and the speed of it is 3.5Ghz and if you overclock it it'll go to 3.9, and like the A10, it does come with Integrated graphics but the A10 is faster<br /><br />i'd say that the AMD A8-5600K Trinity would be the predecessor of the Intel Core i7-3770K and it sells for $110 since both of their overclocked speeds are 3.9Ghz, and they're both quad-cores, both of them have integrated graphics, except that the price of both CPU's have a BIG difference
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Best scifi thriller in a long while. The special effects did not take away from the plot as it does in most movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this game. it's so much fun.I now have all my children and grandson playing this game. it's on everyone's phone. we love it !
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the most easily addictive games I have ever played. I play it almost ever day. 10 stars. Great game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I.use it on all my devices, from desktop.to phone.to.tablet, tablet and it keeps.my saved content available on.all of them. Word
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great book.  Well written, great mystery.  I won't say much more because I hate spoilers.  But I would definitely recommend it.
B000MYFILK|5.0|A lovely romantic story.  Simple story ( maybe unreal) but  nicely  done.  The performance of Peck and Hepburn are first rate.
B001BANK32|4.0|Haven't read a book since that was \\"better\\" though I haven't read many since.<br /><br />Sometimes I didn't understand how Jack was so possible to break down.<br /><br />I also kind of don't like how there is a steady, yet choppy and then jumpy movement into sheer \\"magic\\" the bolt that slides open.<br /><br />Jack becoming immune to death&pain...I just did not get it?<br /><br />Make's me not want to read IT as I imagine the same kind of mechanisms are likely in play.<br /><br />Still, I loved it
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|I like science fiction in general, but much of the genre suffers from a plot predictability.  Often I find myself not finishing these books because I see what is coming at the end.<br /><br />This was refreshingly not the case with Ubik (and Philip K Dick in general).  Each time I thought I had Ubik figured out, there was another interesting curve that both added to the story and kept it interesting until the end.  If you like a good story that will surprise you all the way to the end, and will also make you question your own reality a bit, try Ubik.  Safe when used as directed.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn is awesome! Sharp Objects still my favorite though, this is 2nd.  Cannot wait until she writes another one!
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|I started reading this book and discontinued reading it after the first two chapters. It is no great mystery, but it rather reads like a romance novel, and not a good one at that. Disappointing!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent reading...very interesting look at the Navy Seals and what they are called upon to do day in and day out!
1616550414|5.0|Required for all true fans of the Zelda series. Includes several pages of full color artwork, background information, and full timeline explanations.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I bought this video as a gift for a young teenager. She is very hard to please but she was happy with this!
B00AMH0NPI|2.0|Midnight in Peking is the story of the murder of Pamela Werner in Beijing in 1937. Officially the mystery was never solved, but her father, a former British consul with a knack for annoying the establishment, eventually identified the culprits who, when Werner's mutilations are considered, were obvious suspects.<br /><br />While this is an interesting story, it was the style which let it down. A diligent editor would've given the author a thesaurus to avoid the noticeably repetitive vocabulary (too many &#34;tiffins&#34;, for example), and might've asked how he knew half of what he claimed about the various characters in the tale.<br /><br />It is a very noir tale, and while it may have been the basis for some case for Philip Marlowe, as history I felt it needed a little more scholarly gravitas.
B000YDAZ2Q|5.0|I like these boots because they fit great and are very comfortable. I have trouble finding my size and my exact size was available.
159514188X|4.0|This was a book that a family member was very interested in.  Was happy with it and exactly the one he asked for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it, it's really fun and after awhile u get addicted to it. I really recommend this game to everyone.
B007ZSE1M8|5.0|A wonderful documentary about this &#34;quiet Beatle&#34;!  Any music fan will appreciate this in-depth look at George and his artistry.
B0006N2EZ0|1.0|This dvd will only play for half of the movie,that it comes up this disk can not be played, it is a piece of trash,they should ban this seller from selling their junk
B000WQWPKA|5.0|this movie has always been a great favorite of mine and my family's. Getting it in Blue-Ray adds to the enjoyment of watching it again.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|Disappointing.  Should definitely be offered as a free game given the lack of options and challenge.  I've downloaded free games that offer more....
193413712X|3.0|I thought the writing style was fresh and unusual, and the imagery was amazing.  I could visualize the dreams and hallucinations going on in Crosby's mind and feel the fragile border between the real and not real.  That said, I felt sometimes the words got in the way and pushed me back from knowing what actually was going on in the end of life for this man.  While I did like the book (sort of), it left me unfulfilled as a reader, and I had wished more gaps had been filled in this story.
B00683JK9K|4.0|Flexible puzzles, from easy a few pieces to very hard, numerous pieces.  I also found the program responive and the movement is easy, have not had the chance to turn images around, but, i will figure it out when needed.  Worth the price
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very fast paced, if you like action this is the game for you. Can get a little frustrating always starting back at the beginning.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it so much on TV that I buy it to save on my KIndle.  i HAVE BOUGHT OTHER TV SHOWS ALSO.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this is so much better than the first one. I love it so much. It has really good graphics, and has different changes for the better. If you liked the 1st one you'll love this one.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|If you like puzzle games I am sure you will like this one. Great game for kids of all ages.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This one keeps my 6 year old occupied while in the car. She may have some trouble on levels, but she wants to figure them out.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I loved the book!  I am not an Apple fan as when you have one thing Apple, you end up having everything Apple.  This book not only explains the reason behind it, but also what a manic and detailed person Steve Jobs was.  I could not put it down.  It is well written and interesting.  The people in the book are both positive and negative about him, that makes the book amazing!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I like the fact that with all of these you have to work on how to get to the pigs instead of just chucking stuff at a brick wall.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I'm a huge Fan of those Four they have a rare gift of bringing everyday kind of songs into the upper athmosphere...<br />They harmonize wonderfully. I have all their CDs now and some of their DVDs as well. Great Music!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Classic card games are a great way to pass the time and what better way than not taking up half the kitchen table?
B0049IWQJW|5.0|I have 5 and 3 year old boys.  We've seen this movie 50 times and it never gets old! No guns and no foul language either.
0545265355|5.0|This series is very popular right now. As of mother of 4 teens, I purchased the series to have on hand for them all to read at will, and also because I like to stay current with what they are reading by reading the same books as them. Library fees for overdue books add up over time, and purchasing the set was definitely cheaper. As for this series, I have to say that it is brilliantly written, and it is an astute commentary on the state of war our country is currently engaged in. The series discusses, in terms that children can relate to, that their feelings are normal and appropriate. It also shows how war impacts both those training and fighting away from home, as well as those waiting and worrying at home. It even talks about social commentary and the impact on society with the war constantly in the news. While there is some violence, due to the nature of the storyline, it is not graphic, gory, or unessential. All of the violence mentioned in the books is necessary and considerate of the audience. Buy it, read it, love it!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|It was fun but got a little monotonous.  It is a bit too long and just felt like the same thing every time I played.
B002ZBPPJ8|5.0|I love Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock movies and this is my favorite. A not so impossible relationship carried out in what should be an impossible time-frame. The mailbox at the lake house serves as the gateway between the time-separated couple as they grow from unlikely pen-pals into an ever deepening relationship. As they learn about each other, they also affect a shared past by creating brief but meaningful encounters. It's a believable happy ending that I enjoy watching every so often.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I wanted to check it out because I like to do crafts and sew.  I thought that I might get some new ideas  I also like to try new recipes.  Great ideas.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Glad I chose this app. Have used it a few times.  The only thing is that I have to remember to turn up the volume<br />so I can hear it!! It's easy to set. Only has 3 different alarm sounds but it was free. Might try full version later.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love period works.  The character building is complete but doesn't drag out.  It moves along quickly.  I just hope they can keep the interest going.  Quite disappointed they killed off Matthew.  One of the best characters on the show.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love this app.  I have trouble falling asleep but. since using this app, have no problem. Would recommend trying it<br />to anyone. Ocean with slow waves is fabulous!!
B003Z49LYO|4.0|This is a perfect movie to watch on a rainy day where you can cuddle up on the couch and have a movie day.
B00008GKEG|4.0|Music can be a skill that strikes some people at an early age and reveals things about the Tax Man that many Americans no longer feel what it is like to finally get a big paycheck and give the government a large share. MBE! This Anthology is quite ambiguous about government. If the queen thought Ringo started the Beatles, at least she was aware that they had to be coming from some kind of organizational strategy. After being four Beatles, Billy Preston was a great addition and Yoko Ono helped to add interest to a song: Christ, you know it ain't easy. They called it The Ballad of John and Yoko.<br /><br />Help! I liked the music. The basic idea is that sometimes you want people to hear: I Am the Walrus.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn do an outstanding portrayal of how their lives change and evolve over the years.  Hopefully we can see ourselves evolving as well.<br /><br />Filmed by the sea on the Mendicino Coast is in itself a perfectly pure delight.  There is the sameness, yet the changing.<br /><br />This is a movie I can watch at least once a year and enyoy it every time.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|This movie scared me to the edge of my seat, these movies are my favorite as well, the second one comes out next month to DVD. can't wait.
0807014273|5.0|This book has been a college required reading in some schools.<br /><br />It tells of a man living in a concentration camp in implorable conditions.  He observes how human nature drives some of the prisioners and the ways their lives are lived simply through the mind and the thoughts one gives it.<br /><br />You can also actually feel what he lived through and the process after the American's set the people free and the way life had changed for them.  Also you can see the victory achieved by 'right thoughts'.  Very powerful book.  I'm glad to have it on my bookshelf next to &#34;Night&#34; by Elie Wiesel which was a winner of The Nobel Peace Prize.<br /><br />The horrors allow you to look at mans inhumanity to man and know you want to empower yourself to move toward love and forgiveness.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This movie is awesome i cry everytime i see bruce willis's character die in the last part of the film.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book! Nicholas Sparks always wants me to keep interested and throws some interesting twists into the novel. Looking forward to watching the movie:) I highly recommend this book
B000001FTH|4.0|I remember quite a few of these song over the years and was glad I bought this cd.  Worth a listen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You have to buy it. It is so awesome!!you can do almost everything on it, that you can with a real horse.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book. Love the English author. Definitely will read all her books. Just ordered another book by this author.
1616550414|5.0|The book arrived a little slow for the fastest shipping, but it arrived undamaged and that's all I can ask, other than that, it's Legend of Zelda, of course it's good!!!
B00AERRKHA|5.0|Lois McMaster Bujold is, hands down, my favourite SF author, so I'm always eager to see more from her. Captain Vorpatril's Alliance is a great story in its own right, with Bujold's typically richly-developed characters, but what I appreciated most was getting a deeper look into Ivan's character - and through him, Miles's. We've heard before that Miles &#34;swallows people up&#34;, but this is really the first time we've had the opportunity to see him from someone else's perspective (other than Mark's, but you really can't expect Mark to have a POV on Miles that is even vaguely balanced). Having read it, I now understand why Ivan is so devoted to his mediocrity, and it left me with the desire to re-read the whole series so I can see how my new insights change the stories I thought I already knew.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like it a lot! It's not hard to understand, I like that you can change the colors of the different pages. It's a ver nice Notepad
B009IJJB8G|4.0|As I LOVE the British TV series 'Sherlock', I was all ready NOT to like this. However I do like this. Very much.<br /><br />The actor who plays Sherlock is British and plays him British but with an American sensibility. This Sherlock reminds me of Vincent D'Onofrio's version in Law & Order: Criminal Intent. (If you don't think that show is a version of Sherlock Holmes, you just haven't thought about it enough.) However this one, like the UK one, plays him more of a sociopath which I like.<br /><br />The actor who plays Watson is an Asian woman. Because of the character's smarts, Watson is more of a help to Sherlock than previous versions. Something I like about both of these modern day versions is that both Watsons seem to be more complex characters than previous Watsons.<br /><br />I was very happy to find this version of the modern day Sherlock Holmes story so enjoyable.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book had me hooked for the whole three days I read it. Very charismatic and adventurous! Everyone should read this book!
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|It is a cute story for younger teens, but then again maybe too advanced for them. I jsut thought it was over dramatic and unrealistic.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It the best trilogy of books I've ever read and you never know what's going to happen its a great book
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is one of those things my grandkids got me interested in and in order to keep up with them I need to practice. HaHa!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|It is an excellent article, I really liked the presentation and method of delivery of high level, although it took a bit was well worth
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|This is definately a quirky movie. It's a decent story - the kids are really excellent. Don't really get all of the accolades though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book watched the movies and as normal book is better then them movie, always read book then watch movie
B008M36EEI|5.0|Beautifully told story, quirky yet lovable characters, and lovely scenery... This is a movie that I will definately watch again!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I was sitting next to my best friend on the bus she showed me this game and I knew I had to get it when I won my kindle fire at school. This game is totally awesome and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone!!
159448385X|5.0|loved this book. i was transplanted to another world. got lost int the book. loved it. highly recommend. get it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is the best game i ever played im a tiger sharck level 10 and he is bigger then i thot i csnt wait to i git the great white
0060977264|5.0|one of my favorite coelho books. not like you can go wrong with coelho. highly recommend. love him and his books.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of those great series that I can't wait to see the next episode of. Not everybody likes zombie apocalyptic tales, but in my opinion this series is great entertainment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|it was still good. Kept me turning pages. What seems REALLY obvious at first turns out not to be.  The twists and turns  keeps you interested.
B009B4ZEKM|3.0|I've loved Christina Aguilera's music for some time because of her strong vocals. But somehow, this latest album just doesn't do it for me. The songs are sort of experimental, and sound a little weird to me.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Great season! I finished this season in a few days. The brother's always surprise me how their able to keep it together from demons to leviathans.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Love Alison's voice, and this CD makes me love her even more! I had initially bought this CD just for 1 song - &#34;When You Say Nothing at All&#34;, but soon found that there are many gems in this 2 CD set.<br /><br />Also, the fact that it's Made in the USA and the good Sound Quality of this recording is a double bonus.<br />(yes, I'm an audiophile). A must buy, and kudos for having it Made in USA, not like the many sell-outs I see these days that are Made in Mexico which sound dull and lifeless.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I bought this app and it had tons of hoops to jump through in order for me to use it. Waste of money!
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|It is evident that the author put a great deal of tedious research into this story, which is riveting to those of us who lived in that era and will never forget where we were the exact moment Kennedy was shot. This is a fascinating read.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|There are over 30 different versions of the bible in this app and the best part is it's free. There are some paid upgrades available but you don't necessarily need them. Over all it's a good bargain.
B008A1B5Z0|4.0|I have bought this app and can find and open on my Kindle Fire 1 but can not find to download on my new Kindle Fire 8.9.  What am I missing.
B0030BOCF0|5.0|Needed this LP of my collection.  Perfect condition and rounds out my 5 other LPs that I have.  MUSE ROCKS
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This updated story of Sherlock in New York, with Dr. Watson is well played by all actors involved.<br /><br />I like the fact that the writers/producers have made these characters three-dimensional, rather than cookie-cutter made pieces in this one hour crime-drama. While the crime solving is a bit formulaic, the personalities involved makes this a fun show to watch. I look forward to the interesting conflicts these two personalities have between each other, let alone the rest of the regulars characters.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Really can't give a good review.  I'm only at Chapter 3.  Got the kindle version.  So far, gives a good account of how elite seal teams are &#34;weeded out&#34;.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Just a glorified romance novel and not even as good as some.  Despite some mention of Christian Grey's demons, it just really didn't seem realistic.  Maybe an escape which after all is what romance novels are all about.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My kids love this movie. Not too scary for my 4yo. We have watched it everyday since purchasing it. They know half the songs and the lines.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|This is a great time management game and I enjoyed it. However, after playing a few levels,you are required to pay $3 99 to unlock the next levels. I did so,assuming I had full access to the game. I was disappointed when once again, after playing a few levels, I was asked to pay another $3 99  to access further levels.  This would be a 5 star game if the developers would charge the full price up front. It is very misleading.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|The book was very well written. I was hooked from the first chapter. I found it hard to put down.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel continues to impress as an actor and definitely one of the best films of year. Supposedly based upon the true story of an Alaska Air Flight in 2001.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Fast paced, captivating read --- the doc writes well.  Most of all, it's a huge encouragement of hope that our &#34;end&#34; is a launch into something as beautiful as he describes.  Can't wait (but I will).
B00BESLHEA|2.0|If it weren't for Lucy Liu's performance, I would have given this one star. She was definitely the best part of the movie, but overall it was really bad. Essentially take the fight scene from Kill Bill Vol. 2, ruin it and watch it for an hour and a half. That is what this film did for me. I was highly disappointed. Kudos to whoever made the trailer and made the movie look MUCH more interesting than it was.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It is cute and keeps a person focused.  It isn't always responsive and freezes sometimes.  The puzzles are varied and cute.
B000002J0B|5.0|Everybody, or perhaps almost everybody has their favorite Zeppelin album.  This one is mine.  And, this isn't some sort of new thing for me.  This has been my favorite Zeppelin album since even before I got the 10 disc box set of all their albums back in high school.  I remember reading a Zeppelin biography by an insider in the Led Zeppelin outfit and this is the album I played all the while I was so fascinated when I read it.  In my opinion, this album is the last good one before Robert Plant needed help to make his voice sound thicker by electronics.  Since I learned Plant was a smoker, it became very easy for me to identify that his career's glory would be shortened because physically one can't expect to be a good singer if he or she is a smoker.  It just can't be done.<br />My favorite song on this one is, \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\"  I appreciate it for its complexity, especially when I was a kid and was not familiar with more music.  If you have been a reader of mine, despite how unpopular cerebral music tends to be these days, I can tell you this is a good one.  Certainly, not the most of all time or something like that, but it sounds like a lot of work was put into it.  The Song Remains The Same is a work I would hope that anybody would be able to enjoy.<br />John Bonham is most certainly one of the best drummers ever in my opinion.  Too many drummers today trigger their material, such that every time a drum is hit, it sounds exactly the same way.  If you ask me, that's cheating.  He might very well be my favorite drummer of all time because sometimes Dennis Chambers plays too many notes, and sometime Virgil Donati lacks taste in favor of playing something that can be done.<br />However, if you just listened to The Song Remains the Same, it would be a shame.  This record is awesome from start to finish.  Even its weakest song The Crunge is worth listening to.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|It's fun to play and I don't like the pigs making fun of me when I lose  :)  The only thing I don't like are all the pop up adds.
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|i ordered  the movie its self,  not the directors cut , this dvd case and ad said it INCLUDED  the directors  cut, which means that the original  movie should be in the set , not true ! i feel it was a false ad and im now  still looking for what i want
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Lots of fun! Great time passer!  Great app. Love the storyline and all of the characters. I can spend hours playing this! Thanks for the free app.
B00004RF8J|5.0|this is a genius movie it is my favorite of all time. musical and acting combined in perfection with an all star cast. I just love it.
B009ICQ6KO|3.0|I was expecting a lot more out of this album after reading the reviews, but it just does not quite do it for me. I am looking forward to seeing them play live at the Doheny's Blues Festival coming up in May.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Although the story line is not written well and the dialogue is very weird and the characters are creapy, the puzzles are fun and challenging.
B00AGKH6D8|3.0|This album is just not my kind of groove. I love Joe Bonamassa's blues music he does, but this is just not anywhere close do what he usually does. It sounds like he had fun doing it, and that is what matters most.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|One of the best documentary films I have ever seen and I've seen many! An excellent film that I highly recommend to others. Grohl really hit this one out of the park!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Love this game. I wake up eager to start a new day of gaming excellence. Thank you gameloft. Now back to the game.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I would recommend this game to everyone who likes games. Great... I love it. Can't wait for the next in the series.
B0093ST02E|3.0|This had a good story line, but the nudity and vulgarity was not necessary.  Why do the producers always feel the need to ruin a good movie with such things.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series, but Uthred is now 45.  How long before he retakes Bebbanburg?  Great string of characters.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Great application. I love the word of the day, efc. I love that I can look up words off line
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Getting  a little soap opera like, but I loved it!  The ending leaves you salivating for book three.  The twists and turns of this story keeps the pages turning, simply can't put it down.
B00156VGX8|5.0|Very Powerful.<br />a bit graphic but real. It's not for everyone. If you're sensitive to sexually issues, you should watch.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this last year while in Mexico on vacation.  My Mr. Grey my look more like Javiar the poolside bartender....<br />The book wasn't as taboo as most people jacked it up to be, but I did find it a little far fetched that the doe eyed virgin was so easily coaxed into this contract...but I still couldn't put the book down!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does it again.  Good suspense with twists and turns that just make an enjoyable reading experience.  I would absolutely recommend this book.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Reminds me a lot of high school musical, only better. Watched it with my girlfriend and enjoyed it, great music.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|regular Temple Run is pretty fun to play...but...you have to play Temple Run 2. now THIS is a blast.. enjoy !
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The movie is about a drunk who needs to come to terms with his addiction. While the performances are strong, the movie is much longer than it needs to be. Also the whole plot around managing an almost impossible landing of a broken plane is really implausible and distracting. Save your money and watch something else.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Some reviews made it sound like Death Race had CGI that looked unrealistic like a cartoon, and thus I almost did not purchase it because it sounded like it had too fake looking CGI. Now that I saw it I disagree, plus I thought it had some intense action scenes that were realistic enough for me to stay interested throughout. I'm glad I watched it to see that Death Race is an intense movie with what appeared to me to be quite realistic prison hardcore car races. Unlike most action movies there is from the beginning a connection with the circumstances with the Jason Statham character and his fight to the finish of the Death Race.
B001NE80P4|5.0|This is a great movie and a great image quality, just as I expected! Very good! I saw it right away!
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|Well written, very well acted by (Hunt, Hawkes, and Macy). Tough topic to do a good movie, but this one is SUPERBLY DONE, by ALL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|This a very good purchase. I'm enjoying this a lot. The image is very nice and its a very good deal
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Having never heard this group or knowing anything about them till I heard them prior to the Grammys. I decided to try their album and was it a grand surprise. This is a rollicking good time, with songs that really make you feel good and want to move. The best music money I've spent in a long time.
B00A3VLJCE|4.0|Tutorials make it seem like it's a breeze to use. Trying to get similar results with different photographs can be hard. It's not very intuitive for someone who hasn't been exposed to a lot of Photoshopping. Fun app with great bang for the buck though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a awesome game and when you get far and you fall it fells like u are falling get the game people
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This will kill time, is fun and quick.  My children enjoy it while waiting in the Dr. office and such.  Keeping it on my device for them.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Works well and is fast.  I can get thru my email very quickly.  And I also like the Android app
B008458O3S|5.0|My 9 year old loves the challenge and how you have to make the trains collide to merge and make a new color train to complete some of the higher levels.  Will be keeping this for some time.
B008EKOO46|3.0|As a psych major, very little surprising.  It seemed far too heavily weighted on the south pacific islanders.  Took too long getting to the point.  I didn't finish the book.  Disappointing after author's interview on Colbert Report.
B005HSL626|3.0|It's alright, does the ninja slice thing but gets old after a while, kids are bored with it already after a month.  I'll be removing it but it served it's purpose for a short while
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Sort of a geometric Sudoku, easy to learn but progressively harder, and lots of variations.  Fun for kids but good for grownups, too.  A brain game with nice colors.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Thought I had this one figured out until the twist at the end.<br />Loved the character development.  Excellent writing.  Flynn is brilliant. Have now read all three of her novels and anxious for # four.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Wonderful instrumentation, voices, lyrics.  Makes you want to get up and dance, or sing along (privately, because who can compete with these voices?)  Makes me want more of their recordings.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ordered on Kindle and it was a good read. I love the kindle for many things, one of which is the convenience of ordering a book and having it downloaded immediately. Do read this is you’re interested in US history. Lincoln in particular is a fascinating figure to learn about.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|I was totally surprised at how great this album is...I knew it was going to be good, but WOW.  It's a little bit Hendrix, a bit of the Black Keys and Lenny Kravitz all rolled into this fantasic ball!!  This guy is unbelievably talanted.  It's a fantastic album.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved this book. In fact, I loved the whole series. This story has it all-kingdoms, kings, queens, families that you will love, families you will hate, wolves, dragons, and other surprises. I read all the books in this series and was so upset when I came to the end--there is still so much more of the stories to tie up. But I understand the writer will be giving us at least one more installment on the series in the next year or two. I can hardly wait! This series is a grand adventure and sure to please.
B007V4530A|4.0|This is a quick easy read with good pointers for many types of presentations. You can use the pointers for business or any presentations
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked!  I love this series and can't get enough.  Even my husband (who rarely watches tv) enjoys it.  Keep it coming!!
B004NOH9LC|4.0|MORNING GLORY fits nicely into a Romantic Comedy package without really being a complete member of the genre.  There are relationships, but it's far more focused on the work relationship between Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) and Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) and that made the movie work for me and my wife.  Ford is perfectly grumpy and McAdams is adorably cute.  Throw in a fun performance from the always great Diane Keaton and a number of other excellent supporting actors and the movie works.  Is it great? No.  How many great Romantic Comedies are there?  It's like comfort food.  We watch these moves to feel good.  There's not great exposition or invention that makes the film standout, but I gave it 4 stars because it succeeded in what it was intended to be, cute and fun.
B007FXLZ9K|2.0|The relationship that the brother (Michael Fassbender) and the sister (Carey Mulligan, who also does a great job, like usual) have is very similar to the one that I have with my own brother, which was interesting to me to finally see it from an outsider point of view. Other than that - WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MOVIE?! Other than the obvious and obligatory - sex scenes, work scenes, bar scenes, apartment/bathroom scenes - what did this movie aim to achieve? It seems typical of movies that are coming out over the past few years and currently - fantastic actors, lazy script. I'm just glad I didn't pay for it outright. I think it exposes addiction well; what made me annoyed was the choppy aspect of it, and how obligatory those choppy scenes seemed.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I truly enjoy Sherlock Holmes.  So much so, that I read every book and story by Doyle, plus a couple others by other authors.  I've enjoyed almost every SH creation I've ever seen including the way WITHOUT A CLUE turned the story on its ear.  That being said, I just couldn't get excited about the recent Robert Downey Jr. version.  I haven't seen them and Downey Jr is my favorite actor, but I never saw SH as an action hero.  He was brains first and foremost and Cumberbatch captures it perfectly and with the right amount of oddness.  Add in a testament to the &#34;military&#34; in &#34;military doctor&#34; (finally) and we get a great Watson too with Martin Freeman.  They combine for a wonderful pair.  Not every mystery is 5 star, but it's the pair and Holmes' brain that keeps me coming back.<br /><br />That being said, I watch alone.  My wife just didn't get into it, but I had to give her some history on where HOUSE & THE MENTALIST, and their ilk came from.  You can appreciate those excellent series without knowing Doyle's creation, but I think you miss some of the genius of it then.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Unfortunately the book introduces so many new characters and sub-plots that it is hard to follow and seems rambling. I found myself having a hard time staying interested in this volume compaired to the previous books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read this one while on vacation. It was the perfect book. I really enjoyed this story,particularly the ending. Won't give it away! Read it you won't be sorry.
B0000214F0|5.0|Nice film DVD came in great condition as well, recommended for anyone interested in the topic, thanks a lot! Jnx
B008PE9GSA|4.0|For me it's really a 3.5, but I love and respect ZZ Top so much I'll round it up just for the fact they have a new album.  If you like the Top in general, you'll like this.  I've not yet listened enough to get the songs burned in my memory, but &#34;I Gotsta Get Paid&#34; and &#34;Flyin' High&#34; grabbed me right off the bat.  The boyz seem to have taken a step back into the rough voiced bluesy rock sound.  If you're just a fan of the hits, then this release might not be for you.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Interviews, live recordings, footage of the three surviving (at the time) Beatles playing together.  I've watched this entire collection 4x (twice on VHS, twice on DVD), and I'm looking forward to another viewing soon.
B0019KC4TK|5.0|Genesis - Trespass<br /><br />  I remember at one point in my life having to go back and get all the early Genesis albums after hearing &#34;Selling England By The Pound&#34; in all its greatness!  Trespass was an immediate love for me and the song &#34; Stagnation&#34; was and still is amongst my favourite Genesis moments.<br /><br />  Trespass was really the start of their progressive rock leanings and the opening of Gabriel emoting &#34;looking for someone&#34; clearly sets the stage that this album and genre are marking the beginning of a change.<br /><br />  With the liberal use of the mellotron, flute, organ, guitar, bass and theatrical lyrics and vocals...this album would begin to help define an entire new genre of music......the progressive rock era!  Song that would tell a story......song that were connected......songs that dared to take the listener to places never visited before.<br /><br />  Trespass has some simply amazing musical moments and is a very underrated Genesis album far too often over looked and mis-diagnosed.  Of course the band matured and would go on to record more creative and popular albums, but that should not hide the truth that this album stands up well on its own still to this day.<br /><br />  The SACD master was done by Nick Davis and it is a defite upgrade to my previous recordings.  I have heard things and felt things now that I never experienced before.  The mix is nice and clean with excellent sound seperation and contrast.  For example on the song &#34;Stagnation<br />&#34; I never really ever heard the clear seperation of the two acoustic guitars that play in synch!<br /><br />  Fans of Genesis will need to hunt this version down.
1616550414|5.0|At $20, this book is a bargain.  Full color pages, interesting things to read, and a great manga in the back.
B0070DR5Y4|4.0|There's only one flaw in this movie and that is the leading actor.  Kevin Costner is a mediocre actor who can't even pull off an English accent, so why, why, WHY would you cast him as Robin Hood?  It boggles the mind!<br /><br />So why did I buy this movie? I bought it because I love the story, and I bought it because the rest of the cast was superb.  From Little John to Maid Marian to Friar Tuck - they were all perfect.  I'm a huge fan of both Alan Rickman and Morgan Freeman, and they were both brilliant, so much so that I am able to tolerate Kevin Costner as he muddles through an otherwise perfect movie.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I really like this baby wipe case.  The slide over button makes accessing the wipes easy and you don't have to open it each time and risk getting too many wipes or having trouble getting it closed.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I spent a little while trying to figure out what was going on. And I came to the conclusion I didn't really care that much.  This was actually a purchase for my wife and she seems to like it a lot and that's important.  Also the plot line centered a giant space ship called Abby.  I'm not into syfi.  But if I was I would love this.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoy this game, to occupy me when I'm bored. Good challenge. I would recommend it. My grandkids can play it too,
B0055OK2T0|3.0|The movie has an interesting beginning, but he story line gets increasingly nonsensical as it progress toward the end. By the end of the movie it gets boring.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love Maggie Smith and will watch anything with her in it.  She did not disappoint.  As far as the actual show goes, I really enjoyed the story and most of the characters.  I like to glimpse what the world was like back in the day.
0792838068|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, even though it had made me really thirsty at times.  I thought Nicolas Cage's acting was exceptional. It's a pity he hasn't done anything this good in decades.<br /><br />A coupla things bothered me. I didn't feel Elizabeth Shue was quite right for the role of the hooker.<br />She's a decent actress, but are hookers really that hot? I've never been with one, but from all the hundreds of police show mug shots I've seen over the years I don't believe I've ever seen one that hot. Maybe the police just arrest the ugly ones.<br /><br />And why was Shue’s street dress that high up? The top part was almost up to her tits. Didn't seem quite right. Overall the movie was great because I cared about the characters and wanted to watch the thing till the end, which is a rarity for movies these days. Highly recommended for alcoholics and non-alcoholics alike.
B003G93ZCM|5.0|Gene was the man. I was very interested in his journey as a pilot, adventurer , and an astronaut. He's very Frank about his feelings for the Apollo program, fellow colleagues, and NASA. If u are a space program nut, this book is perfect for you.
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|I'm giving this game one star as I can't even play it.  I've purchased G5 games before and loved them - no problems downloading.  However, this game shows up in the &#34;cloud&#34;, but I can't get it to download to my Kindle.  The description showed it was compatable with the Kindle Fire so I'm not sure what the problem is.  Every time I try to get it over to my device, it shows that  it's downloading, takes forever, then has a red &#34;!&#34; on it but won't actually download.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's Star Wars........how can it not be awesome? Worth the money, great clear picture, love the case it comes in. Just over all AWESOME.
B008476HBM|5.0|I HAVE READ THIS BOOK MANY TIMES. WATCHED COLIN FIRTH IN THE MOVIE...GREAT..RECOMMEND FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVES THE CLASSICS AND ROMANCE
0800141660|3.0|The scenery, where ever it was filmed it just like a painting a landscape.  Emma Thompson and the ensemble cast are great.<br />The one exception if Hugh Grant, He is always Hugh Grant.  That bumbling, stammering, manner just doesnt work in this movie.<br />After all he is playing the love of Emma Thompson's life with complications which is not resolved until the last scene.<br />For some reason I found the movie lacking something.
030758836X|5.0|This is Billy Joel's \\"The Stranger\\" in a book. At the surface, it is a simple murder mystery novel that jerks the reader around. But it is more than just an good plot.<br /><br />Society has so many expectations in how everyone should act that people have little room to mix in their own humanity. Whether it is becoming Amazing Amy, or acting like a distressed husband, or living up to the wife's high expectations, there is little room to simply be yourself in your interactions with the world and your spouse.<br /><br />Despite this cage guiding our behaviors, Gillian Flynn points out there is some truth in these expectations. The wife should learn from the Cool Girl and give her husband slack and not expect him to be perfect. The husband should learn from the distressed husband and try to empathize and build a relationship with the wife. Not because society expects it, but because these idealized expectations do indeed lead to a better relationship.<br /><br />The characters may be extreme and the stream of events may be unlikely and some of the plot devices may be primitive. But look beyond these flaws, and you'll see a brave attempt to figure out how relationships really work.<br /><br />So, put on the faces of the stranger, because these faces are the social norms that create good societies and good relationships.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made.  I think the name &#34;Shawshank Redemption&#34; probably kept a lot of people from<br />seeing it in the theatres.  It was more or less praised by word of mouth after it came out on VHS back in the day.<br />Highly recomment to one and all.  Movies like this are just not made anymore, and I can't figure out why?
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I thought it was a good retelling of Jane Austen book. Movie did not have detail or emotion of book, but Austen fans should still enjoy.

0525948023|5.0|I like it!<br /> I don't have 13 words to say & I don't see why its mandatory to have a lot to say about MY purchases ~ either I like it or don't like it ~ why do I have to write a book?  why don't you simply put a brief description in  the headliner or summary ~ you should be trying to make it easier for clients to want to leave feedback ~ this is to much work!

B004X2M9VY|5.0|I just got into the Doctor Who series and really enjoyed this season. Complicated plot twists woven throughout the season
B00BESM14U|5.0|Didn't know what to expect since most book to the big screen movies don't work out so good. But it was great
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Its highly addictive. I would recommend this game for anyone to play. Its really fun and pretty easy to catch on how to play!
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|A decently funny movie at times, but for those who are not really into drug/alcohol and crude sexual humor, you'll find it lacking.  The &#34;disney&#34; ending could have been written better, and Wahlberg's nemesis (Joel McHale) could have easily been written out of the script as he had no depth and didn't cause all that much grief for the main characters. For some, they'll find an animated teddybear doing drugs with Mark Wahlberg hilarious.  For the rest, save your money.
1400067820|3.0|My title summarizes this book.  This same theme is repeated over and over one chapter after another.  The theme could have been said in ten pages.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is almost the best game ever well so far if I had like a thousand kindle fires I would download Temple Run 2 on all of them.
B005KELW26|5.0|I love the color; it comes in a variety of colors if you don't like purple.  It definitely keeps the Kindle in place.  I really enjoy the magnetic closing feature.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and strongly suggest that you get something to carry your Kindle around in.
